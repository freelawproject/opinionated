But \u00a7 924(c) could not apply to that person, because tax fraud is not a \"crime of violence\"-that is, it does not have force as an element, and it does not \"by its nature\" involve a substantial risk that force will be used.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    A person who uses a firearm to extort advice on how to commit tax fraud is at least threatening to use violence, and might even use violence, during and in relation to the crime of tax fraud. It would be reasonable to authorize punishment for using a firearm in that manner. Congress once did so.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1970, Pub. L.

Since 1984, Congress has limited the instances in which a person can be punished for using or carrying a firearm in criminal activity. Section 924(c) could not apply to a person who uses a firearm to extort tax fraud advice, because tax fraud does not meet Congress's definition of a crime of violence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    <strong>\n     B. Categorical Approach\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    The key characteristic of Congress's definition of a \"crime of violence\" is that it applies to categories of crimes, not to the circumstances in which an individual defendant uses or carries or possesses a firearm. Necessarily so, using a firearm as a weapon to commit a crime would make\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    crime a violent one. But if that was\n    what Congress intended, the phrase \"crime of violence\" would be superfluous.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    Congress uses the identical phrase, \"crime of violence,\" elsewhere in Title 18,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 16. It uses a similar phrase, \"violent felony,\" elsewhere in \u00a7 924, at subsection 924 (e)(2)(B). As to both \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) and \u00a7 16, courts use a \"categorical approach\" to decide whether a given crime fits Congress' definition. This approach looks \"only to the statutory definitions\" of the crime, \"not to the particular facts underlying\" an individual defendant's commission of the crime.\n    <em>\n     Taylor v.

Narrow Scope of the \"Right\"\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    First, the United States suggests\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    announces only \"a defendant's right not to have his sentence increased under the residual clause of the ACCA,\" as the Tenth Circuit recently put it.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

The United States' argument would seem to require the Supreme Court to decide whether the \"right\" in\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    applies to each statute\n    <em>\n     before\n    </em>\n    a federal defendant could file a \u00a7 2255 motion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Congress intended the statute of limitations \"to eliminate delays in the federal habeas review process,\"\n    <em>\n     Holland v.

Requiring people who \"assert\" that\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    gives them a right to relief to file within a year of\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    's issuance serves Congress's purpose much better. Anyone who asserts that a later case applying\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    confers a right to relief-say,\n    <em>\n     Dimaya\n    </em>\n    , or a case specifically addressing \u00a7 924(c) -is unlikely to receive the benefit of \u00a7 2255(f)(3), because the Court \"initially recognized\" the \"right asserted\" in\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n    , not in\n    <em>\n     Dimaya\n    </em>\n    or a later case.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    <strong>\n     3.

This leaves the limitations period with no work to do. Statutes of limitation are not generally redundant with the merits of a claim in this way.\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    The other provisions of the limitations period, \u00a7 2255(f)(1), (2), and (4), are independent of the merits of the claim presented. By simply reading \u00a7 2255(f)(3) to require a defendant asserting a new right to relief to file within a year of the Supreme Court's initial decision recognizing the right, \u00a7 2255(f)(3) is as easy to apply and as independent of the merits as the other subsections of the limitations period.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    <strong>\n     4.

It is possible, at least theoretically, that Canfield and the United States differed over whether he committed robbery or extortion (the difference being a \"razor's edge\") but agreed that he violated the Hobbs Act. If that were the case, it would be easier to see that he is factually innocent of violating \u00a7 924(c), as opposed to the \"legal insufficiency\" of the elements in the plea agreement. As the prejudice question is easily decided, the Court will assume it is fair to say Canfield did not commit a \"crime of violence\" as defined in \u00a7 924(c).\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
