GELPI, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case arises out of a one-vehicle accident in which the driver sustained significant head trauma and other injuries. Following the accident, Luis John Hernadez Denizac, Ly Ann Hernandez Lopez, Luis Hernandez, and Nilsa Denizac (collectively \"Plaintiffs\") sued Kia Motors Corporation (\"Kia\" or \"Defendant\") in federal court asserting diversity jurisdiction and theories of product defect and failure to warn. (Docket No. 1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kia moved for summary\n   judgment and Plaintiffs responded in opposition. (Docket Nos. 94; 98).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   After disposing of preliminary matters involving Local Rule 56, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Kia's motion for summary judgment at Docket No. 94.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Local Rule 56\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the summary judgment stage, parties must follow Local Rule 56. Section (c) states that \"[a] party opposing a motion for summary judgment shall submit with its opposition a separate, short, and concise statement of material facts.\" L. Cv. R. 56(c). This statement \"shall admit, deny or qualify the facts supporting the motion for summary judgment by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party's statement of material facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In addition to allowing an opposing party to admit, deny, or qualify the moving party's facts, the opposing party may submit additional facts in a different section, provided that they are \"supported by a record citation ....\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Section (e) provides that the Court \"may disregard any statement of fact not supported by a specific citation to record material\" and notes that the Court has \"no independent duty to search or consider any part of the record not specifically referenced in the parties' separate statement of facts.\" L. Cv. R. 56(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   If a party improperly controverts the facts, Local Rule 56 allows the Court to treat the opposing party's facts as admitted; the First Circuit has consistently held that litigants ignore Local Rule 56 \"at their peril.\"\n   <em>\n    Caban Hernandez v.

(Docket Nos. 95 at 1-18 \u00b6\u00b6 1-78; 99 at 1-3 \u00b6\u00b6 1-13). Although the paragraphs in Plaintiffs' statement of uncontested material facts (\"PSUMF\") are numbered 1-13, each paragraph references a different numbered paragraph in Defendant's statement of uncontested material facts (\"DSUMF\").\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 99 at 1 \u00b6 1. While it would have been better form to number each paragraph in relation to the paragraphs in DSUMF (in other words, paragraph one of PSUMF should reference paragraph one of DSUMF, rather than paragraph one of PSUMF referencing paragraph eight of DSUMF), Plaintiffs have at least managed to include a reference to the relevant paragraphs of DSUMF, and thus the Court will consider those thirteen paragraphs in PSUMF. What Plaintiffs have not done, however, is properly admit, deny, or qualify the remaining paragraphs in DSUMF (specifically paragraphs 1-7, 9-15, 17-20, 22-24, 28-31, 33-37, 41-46, 48-49, 51-74, 76, and 78).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 99 at 1-3 \u00b6\u00b6 1-13.

Rather than citing to the record, Plaintiffs improperly cite to websites not included in the record material.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   L. Cv. R. 56(c) (\"The opposing statement may contain in a\n   separate section additional facts, set forth in separate numbered paragraphs\n   <em>\n    and supported by a record citation ....\n   </em>\n   \" (emphasis added) ). As such, the Court disregards these paragraphs. Plaintiffs argue that Defendant has similarly referred to a website link in its submissions (Docket No. 107 at 5); the difference is that Defendant's references to the website are not presented as record citation in their statement of uncontested facts. Had Defendant attempted to support its DSUMF with citations the website, the Court would be compelled to disregard them as well. As it stands, however, all facts asserted in DSUMF are supported by citations to the record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Defendant's Reply to Plaintiffs' Opposing Statement of Material Facts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In Defendant's reply to PSUMF, they replied, not only to Plaintiffs' separate section of additional facts, but also to Plaintiffs' responses to Defendant's original statement of uncontested material facts. (Docket No. 104).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Local Rule 56 section (d) governs this matter. \"A party replying to the opposition to a motion for summary judgment shall submit with its reply a separate, short, and concise statement of material facts\n   <em>\n    which shall be limited to any additional facts submitted by the opposing party\n   </em>\n   \" L.

Relevant Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   PSUMF and DSUMF, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovants, reveal the following relevant undisputed material facts:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 11, 2014, Plaintiff Luis John Hernandez Denizac was driving his 2012 Kia Forte northbound on Road No. 1, from Caguas to San Juan. DSUMF \u00b6\u00b6 2-3. At approximately 2:20 a.m. he lost control of the vehicle, which swerved off the road and over a grass median.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. The vehicle then crossed a two lane marginal service road, hit a cement pedestal, and side-swiped a fence on the driver's side.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It came to a stop after the front left portion of the vehicle came into contact with a garbage dumpster.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Luis John does not have any recollection of the time immediately before, during, or after the accident, and there were no witnesses to the crash.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Police arrived on the scene within approximately five minutes, by which point Luis John had already been removed from the vehicle and was receiving treatment in an ambulance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-20. Plaintiffs allege that Luis John sustained a severe brain contusion as a result of the non-deployment of the vehicle's side curtain airbag.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. They further contend that if the airbag had deployed, Luis John would not have suffered the \"extensive, debilitating, and permanent life-changing injuries that he did.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29. The airbag's non-deployment is a result, Plaintiffs aver,\n   of Kia's defective manufacturing process and improper installation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Upon commencement of this lawsuit, Plaintiffs retained Engineer Otto R. Gonz\u00e1lez Blanco (\"Eng. Gonz\u00e1lez\") as their only liability expert.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. A structural and hydraulics engineer, Eng. Gonz\u00e1lez spent 95% of his time over the last eight years reconstructing accidents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. Eng. Gonz\u00e1lez has previously testified about accident reconstruction and has been recognized by the court as an expert in the same. PSMUF at 6 \u00b6 27; Docket No. 104 at 29 \u00b6 27. He does not, however, have any formal education in automotive design, engineering, or electronics, or in electrical or mechanical engineering. DSMUF \u00b6 41. He is not an expert with respect to anything related to automotive manufacturing or design or airbag systems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42, 66. Eng. Gonz\u00e1lez does not have any medical education, nor has he taken courses in trauma or injury causation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. He did not know the parameters for the circumstances when an airbag in a 2012 Kia Forte must deploy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45. He was unaware of the specifications for any portion of Kia's airbag system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. He did not inspect the vehicle's airbag, nor did he perform any tests on it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65. He never deployed an airbag in a 2012 Kia Forte.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74. Eng. Gonz\u00e1lez indicated that he would not provide expert testimony about the non-deployment of the airbag or whether the airbag was defective.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Eng. Gonz\u00e1lez testified that it was his opinion that if the airbag system didn't work, it was because it had a defect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67. He could not identify a specific component of the system that might have been defective, nor could he say which part of the airbag system did not work because he was not an expert in the construction or design of airbag systems.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Eng. Gonz\u00e1lez opined that the airbags should have deployed in the car, and because they did not, something was wrong.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68. He did not know whether there was a defect, but he \"believe[d] there must have been a defect\" because the airbags \"should have deployed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It was his opinion, based on his review of the medical records, that Plaintiff Luis John's cerebral contusion was caused by a lateral impact with the side of the car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Two of Defendant's experts, Dr. Gennarelli and Eng. Rucoba, opined that given Luis John's height, the area where he hit his head was above the area that would have been covered by the airbag, had it deployed. PSUMF at 7 \u00b6\u00b6 36-37; Docket No. 104 at 31-32 \u00b6 36-37. Specifically, Dr. Gennarelli stated that the area where Luis John's head struck the vehicle was \"above that covered by a side curtain airbag if one were to have deployed in his crash.\" Eng. Rucoba stated that \"[b]ased on his seated height, it's my opinion that [Luis John]'s head would strike the hard structural components above the area of deployment for the side curtain airbag. Therefore, even if the side curtain airbag had deployed his injuries would not have been mitigated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Specifically, Dr. Gennarelli stated that the area where Luis John's head struck the car was \"above that covered by a side curtain airbag if one were to have deployed in his crash,\" and Eng. Rucoba stated \"[b]ased on his seated height, it's my opinion that [Luis John]'s head would strike the hard structural components above the area of deployment for the side curtain airbag.

Likewise, such failure to function is also per se insufficient to prove a product's inherent dangerousness so as to require additional warnings. Without an expert that is able to testify about airbag deployment, system design, warnings, instructions, or manufacturing, Plaintiffs are unable to present the necessary evidence to produce a genuine issue of material fact as to inherent dangerousness vis-\u00e0-vis Luis John's height.
