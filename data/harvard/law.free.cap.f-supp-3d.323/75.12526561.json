Accordingly, the Court issues this amended opinion to correct certain non-substantive, clerical errors that inadvertently appeared in the original order.\n  </p>\n </footnote>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <author id=\"p-9\">\n   JOHN A. WOODCOCK, JR., UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A high school student and the public school district in which he is enrolled seek emergency injunctive relief in the form of a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction against the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), its Chairman, and an independent literary organization to permit the student to participate in a national competition operated by the Defendants scheduled to begin on April 23, 2018-a mere three days from now. The Plaintiffs allege that the NEA and its Chairman's enforcement of an eligibility rule violates the student's Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to equal protection by discriminating against him on the basis of his immigration status and national origin. The Plaintiffs also argue that the literary organization's enforcement of the eligibility rule violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In their motion, they seek only to preserve the student's opportunity to compete in the national competition. The Defendants oppose the motion, arguing that the eligibility rule survives even strict scrutiny and that, thus, the Plaintiffs cannot show a likelihood of success on the merits, dooming their motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court grants the student's motion for temporary restraining order because it concludes that the Plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the merits, that the student would suffer irreparable harm but for an injunction, and that the balance of the relevant impositions and the public interest tip toward the student's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Courts adjudicating challenges to federal laws closely related to immigration, naturalization, and foreign policy interests tend to employ rational basis review.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lopez-Flores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7416628\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/63/1468/#p1475\">\n    63 F.3d at 1473-74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 1995) (applying rational basis review because foreign policy concerns, including the \"threat of in-country terrorist attacks and the desire to meet the United States' obligations under international treaties[,] provided the impetus for passage of [the challenged statute,] the Hostage Taking Act\"). The further the challenged law, regulation,\n   or policy from the core federal interests in immigration and foreign affairs, the more searching the judicial review.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    De Malherbe v.

Here, based on\n   <em>\n    Hampton\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, the Court concludes that a more searching judicial analysis than mere rational basis and a less searching judicial analysis than strict scrutiny is appropriate for the NEA policy in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   This leads to an additional observation. As noted above, the\n   <em>\n    Bruns\n   </em>\n   Court was careful to note that \"the calculus is markedly different for\n   <em>\n    congressional\n   </em>\n   acts distinguishing on the basis of alienage.\"\n   <em>\n    Bruns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067634\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/750/61/#p66\">\n    750 F.3d at 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, although the NEA references federal statutes as suggestive of congressional intent, there is no congressional enactment that requires it to impose these citizenship or permanent resident requirements to the POL competition. If the Court were dealing with a duly enacted federal statute, the calculus, as the First Circuit wrote, would be different.

The Court begins with identification of such an interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   One of the NEA's identified interests is maintenance of discretion to allocate its limited resources as it sees fit-including preventing anyone who is not a United States citizen of legal permanent resident from receiving benefits derived from those resources. The NEA stated that it contributed $195,000 to the POL competition. TPF contributes about $500,000. The extent to which the NEA's financial commitment justifies the eligibility requirement bears further investigation, but it does not drive the result on this motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The NEA claims that injunctive relief for the Plaintiffs would jeopardize its appropriations from Congress and funding it receives from private partners. The NEA's assertions do not persuade the Court. Counsel for TPF, one such private partner, stated at oral argument that the TPF would welcome Mr. Monga's participation in the national finals and that his participation would present no problems from TPF's perspective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The NEA points to instances wherein Congress has limited eligibility for certain grants, prizes, and scholarships, including the National Medal for the Arts, to citizens and legal permanent residents. Although perhaps suggestive of generalized congressional intent, it is also true that Congress did not draw such a line for the POL competition. It is always tempting to draw conclusions about congressional intent from what Congress has said or has not said in other contexts. But these arguments at least merit further development. At this stage, the Court does not find either convincing. NEA notes that it is almost entirely dependent upon Congress for its funding and asserts that therefore, \"it is not unreasonable for the NEA to model eligibility criteria based on those that have obviously been important to Congress over the past several decades.\"\n   <em>\n    NEA Opp'n\n   </em>\n   at 11. The NEA, which draws much of its funding from Congress, has a right to be concerned about following congressional directives, but the Court is not convinced on this record that Congress has directed either explicitly or implicitly the eligibility requirements for the POL competition that the NEA has adopted.

Oct. 2, 2002) (\"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\" to compete in the Miss America pageant national finals with the \"chance to be Miss America, a national icon\"). Given this quintessential harm that cannot be measured nor redressed by damages, this factor clearly weighs in favor of Mr. Monga.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The NEA does not contest the harm itself; rather, it argues that the harm is not cognizable because it is \"self-inflicted.\" NEA points to communications it had with the MAC in advance of the Maine state finals indicating that Mr. Monga was ineligible to participate and suggests that the Plaintiffs' alleged foreknowledge of the harm either precludes them from having it redressed via injunctive relief and/or leads to a conclusion that they were tardy in filing suit. As the Court noted earlier, these arguments may be valid against PPS, which the Court views as in a very different position from that of Mr. Monga. But there is no evidence in this record that would allow the Court to ascribe PPS's knowledge of the NEA eligibility rules to Mr. Monga or find that Mr. Monga caused himself a self-inflicted harm merely by participating in this competition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Balance of the Relevant Impositions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The NEA argues that an injunction in favor of Mr. Monga would harm any individuals who wanted to participate in POL but declined to do so because they were excluded by the eligibility rule. Although NEA is free to develop this argument, it is without any record support and amounts to speculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   The NEA claims that a grant of the relief the Plaintiffs seek would undercut the integrity of the national finals. It is difficult to understand how. Mr. Monga is the POL Maine state champion. Allowing him to compete with champions from other states and to be fairly judged on the merit of his performance would not appear to undermine the integrity of the competition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The NEA also asserts that an injunction would be an affront to its discretion in administration of its programs. The NEA has not persuaded the Court that to the extent an injunction would impinge on the NEA's discretion that such an imposition outweighs the harm Mr. Monga stands to suffer if he were disallowed from competing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The NEA speaks of its priorities, including \"artistic and cultural significance, giving emphasis to American creativity and cultural diversity.\"\n   <em>\n    Defs.' Opp'n\n   </em>\n   at 3 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20954\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) ). It also describes the state art agencies to which it makes grants, such as the MAC, as being \"charged with reducing barriers to cultural participation....\"\n   <em>\n    Defs.' Mot.\n   </em>\n   at 3. It would seem that the participation of Mr. Monga, a talented young man raised in Zambia, in the national finals as an outcome that actually advances these priorities. The Court finds that the balance of the relevant impositions tips toward Mr. Monga.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Effect of the Ruling on the Public Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The Court acknowledges the arguments of both sides with respect to the impact an injunction would have on the public interest. However, in the unique\n   circumstances presented in this case, allowing Mr. Monga to compete in the POL national finals strikes the Court as outweighing the more generalized goals the NEA points to. As such, the Court finds that this factor tips in favor of the Mr. Monga.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Having determined that each of the four factors relevant to the issuance of emergency injunctive relief weighs in favor of allowing Mr. Monga to participate in the POL national finals, the Court concludes that such relief is warranted in this unique case. The Court leaves for a future date, when time constraints are not so pressing, a more measured and sober determination, informed by further argument from the parties, of the important issues at stake in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Portland Public Schools\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   As the Court intimated, it sees PPS' involvement in this case as markedly distinct from Mr. Monga's. The Court has doubts about whether PPS would have standing to obtain a TRO on behalf of Mr. Monga. It views PPS as having greater knowledge of the eligibility requirements of the NEA program than can fairly be imputed to Mr. Monga. PPS's stated interest in assuring that future students, including those who are neither citizens nor permanent residents, will be allowed to participate in future POL competitions is a markedly different proposition than Mr. Monga's immediate desire to participate in next week's competition. In short, the Court's ruling in favor of Mr. Monga is not a harbinger of rulings to come, one way or the other. Finally, as the Court has granted relief to Mr. Monga, it is not necessary to grant the same relief to PPS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The Court DENIES the Plaintiffs' Motion for Temporary Restraining Order against The Poetry Foundation (ECF No. 3). The Court GRANTS Allan Monga's Motion for Temporary Restraining Order (ECF No. 3) insofar as it seeks to require the NEA and Chairman Chu to allow Mr. Monga to participate in the Poetry Out Loud national finals competition in Washington, D.C., beginning on April 23, 2018.
