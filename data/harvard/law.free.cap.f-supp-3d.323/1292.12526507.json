Specifically, the Court appended the phrase \"on or about February 4, 2005,\" to the first four VICAR elements,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \"the existence of an 'enterprise' as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201959\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2), on or about February 4, 2005.\" Third Proposed Jury Instructions at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The United States objected to the Court's Third Proposed Jury Instructions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objection at 1. The United States contends that, in\n   <em>\n    United States v. DeLeon\n   </em>\n   , CR No. 15-4268, the United States made a similar objection to the VICAR instructions in the Court's Eighth Proposed Jury Instructions, filed March 1, 2018 (Doc. 1864), which the Court sustained.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   United States' Objections to Court's Eighth Proposed Jury Instructions, filed March 2, 2018 (Doc. 1849)(\"\n   <em>\n    DeLeon\n   </em>\n   Objection\"). In the\n   <em>\n    DeLeon\n   </em>\n   Objection, the United States argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The government objects to the requirement in the first paragraph that the enterprise \"was engaged in racketeering activity on or around the time of the violent crime charged in that count of the indictment.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Booth\n   </em>\n   is misguided.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Anthony Cordova's Response to the Government's Objection to the Court's Third Proposed Preliminary Jury Instruction, filed July 9, 2018 (Doc. 795)(\"Response\"). According to Cordova,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Booth\n   </em>\n   stands for the proposition that \"the Constitution does not\n   require the [VICAR] statute to specify how broad a time period constitutes being 'engaged in' racketeering activity.\" Response at 1 (citing\n   <em>\n    United States v. Booth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%201192317\">\n    1999 WL 1192317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ). Cordova contends that\n   <em>\n    United States v. Booth\n   </em>\n   recognizes that, in a VICAR case, the United States must prove that the relevant enterprise had been \"presently engaged in racketeering activity at the time of the VICAR crime.\" Motion at 2-3 (citing\n   <em>\n    States v. Booth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%201192317\">\n    1999 WL 1192317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court overrules the Objection. VICAR does not contain an express temporal requirement for an enterprise's existence or engagement in racketeering activity, but the statute contains a de facto temporal requirement. To establish VICAR's purpose element, the United States must prove that a defendant committed a violent crime \"as consideration for the receipt of, or as consideration for a promise or agreement to pay, anything of pecuniary value from an enterprise engaged in racketeering activity, or for the purpose of gaining entrance to or maintaining or increasing position in an enterprise engaged in racketeering activity\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201959\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). If no enterprise exists or if no enterprise is engaged in racketeering activity, then it is impossible to receive \"anything of pecuniary value\" or \"a promise or agreement to pay, anything of pecuniary value\" from an \"enterprise engaged in racketeering activity.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201959\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Joining an enterprise engaged in racketeering activity and \"maintaining or increasing position in\" such an enterprise is likewise impossible.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201959\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Thus, outside exceptional circumstances that are not implicated by the evidence in this case,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   establishing VICAR's purpose element requires the United States to prove that an enterprise both existed and engaged in racketeering activity when a defendant committed a crime of violence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   To be clear, VICAR does not require the United States to prove that the\n   SNM committed specific racketeering acts on or about February 4, 2005. The United States needs only to show that the SNM was, at that time, engaging in racketeering activity in a systematic way. Just as the Dallas Cowboys is an enterprise engaged in professional football year-round even though the football season begins in the fall and ends in the winter, an enterprise can be engaged in racketeering activity over an extended period of time without continuously committing racketeering acts. In other words, the United States must show that the SNM was in the racketeering business on or about February 4th, 2005, but it does not need to show that the SNM engaged in a racketeering act on or about that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In both\n   <em>\n    United States v. DeLeon\n   </em>\n   trials, the Court did not include an explicit temporal reference in its final jury instructions. The Court included, however, implicit temporal references insofar as the Court instructed the jury that, to return a guilty verdict, it would have to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that an enterprise existed as alleged in the Indictment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Court's Final Jury Instructions at 34 (Instruction No. 25), filed May 23, 2018 (Doc. 2303)(\"Second Trial Instructions\"); Court's Final Jury Instructions at 32 (Instruction No. 25), filed March 5, 2018 (Doc. 1877)(\"First Trial Instructions\"). The portions of the Indictment that those instructions reproduced tracked VICAR's language closely; for example, the Second Trial Instructions states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    On or about March 26, 2001\n   </strong>\n   , in Do\u00f1a Ana County, in the District of New Mexico, as consideration for the receipt of, and as consideration for a promise and agreement to pay, anything of pecuniary value from the Syndicato de Nuevo Mexico Gang (SNM), or for the purpose of gaining entrance to or maintaining or increasing position in the Syndicato de Nuevo Mexico Gang (SNM),\n   <strong>\n    an enterprise engaged in racketeering activity\n   </strong>\n   , the defendants ... did unlawfully, knowingly, and intentionally murder Frank Castillo, in violation of NMSA 1978, Sections 30-2-1 and 30-1-13.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Second Trial Instructions at 28 (Instruction No. 23)(emphases added).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Trial Instructions at 26 (Instruction No. 22)(giving a similar instruction regarding Javier Molina's murder). Thus, because the final jury instructions in\n   <em>\n    United States v. DeLeon\n   </em>\n   tracked the statutory language, as shown above, those instructions also contain an explicit temporal element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Even if the jury instructions in the\n   <em>\n    United States v. DeLeon\n   </em>\n   had omitted a temporal element, that error would have been both harmless, and invited by the Defendants. The United States, the Trial 1 Defendants, and the Trial 2 Defendants never introduced any evidence indicating that the SNM ceased to exist as an enterprise or ceased to engage in racketeering activity; either the SNM was an enterprise engaged in racketeering activity or it was not. Thus, omitting a temporal element would not have undermined either jury's verdict, so such an omission would have been harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Omitting a temporal element would also have been invited error, because both the Trial 1 Defendants and the Trial 2 Defendants asked the Court to model its instructions\n   on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit's pattern VICAR instructions, which contain no temporal requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction (Criminal Cases)\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2.78, at 382-87 (2015).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trial 1 Defendants based their proposed instruction setting out the elements of a VICAR offense on the Fifth Circuit pattern instructions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants Proposed Jury Instructions at 83-86, filed January 12, 2018\n   (Doc. 1641)(Instruction No. 49)(citing\n   <em>\n    Fifth Circuit Pattern Jury Instruction (Criminal Cases)\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2.78).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   They also objected to the United States' proposed instruction setting out VICAR's elements, because that instruction did not track the Fifth Circuit's pattern instructions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendants' Joint Objections to the United States' Proposed Jury Instructions (Doc. 1635), filed January 19, 2018 (Doc. 1663)(faulting the United States for proposing a VICAR instruction that \"is not a pattern instruction adopted by any Circuit,\" and adding that \"the Defendants have proposed to use the Fifth Circuit pattern instruction and associated definitions to instruct the jury about VICAR crimes, and the Court should use that instruction as well as the definitions associated with it.\"). Late in the first\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The Defendants in the second\n   <em>\n    United States v.
