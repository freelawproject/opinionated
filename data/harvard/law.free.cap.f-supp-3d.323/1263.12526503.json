BROWNING, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on the Motion to Exclude Witness Julian Romero Testimony, filed April 17, 2018 (Doc. 2121)(\"Motion\"). In the Motion, Defendant Edward Troup asks the Court to exclude the substance of a statement that Julian Romero, a witness for Plaintiff United States of America, made during a March 28, 2018 interview:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   ROMERO met Edward TROUP at Hobbs and knew he was SNM. ROMERO was housed with TROUP sometime before SANCHEZ was killed at the county jail. TROUP brought drugs into the segregation three unit. TROUP smuggled the drugs in himself when he was arrested for a parole violation. TROUP was aligned with ARCHULETA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Motion \u00b6 1, at 1 (quoting FBI 302 (held March 28, 2018)(DeLeon 68419) ). Troup argues that Romero's statement describes an alleged bad act and that \"the time for the government to provide the defendant with notice of any bad acts it intended to introduce has long since passed.\" Motion \u00b6 2, at 2. Troup asserts that, \"[i]n the United States Response regarding Rule 404(b), it stated that it would 'provide such prior acts evidence in accordance with the scheduling order in this case.' \" Motion \u00b6 6, at 3 (quoting United States' Response in Opposition to Defendants' Motion for Notice of FRE 404(b), 405, 406, 608 and Res Gestae Evidence [1047] at 3, filed April 20, 2017 (Doc. 1102) ). Troup contends, however, that the United States did not provide the FBI 302 containing Romero's statement until \"the Saturday before trial commenced (April 7, 2018).\" Motion \u00b6 7, at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Troup also argues that Romero's statement is not relevant to the charges against him, and may \"lead the jury to convict Mr. Troup based on a bad character trait, and not on evidence proving the offenses alleged.\" Motion \u00b6 3, at 2. According to Troup, Romero's statement is not \" 'probative of a material issue other than character,' \" so it is not admissible under rule 404(b). Motion \u00b6 5, at 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Romero's statements are probative of a material issue other than character.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   To establish a violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201959\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"VICAR\"), the United States must show that the SNM is an \"enterprise engaged in racketeering activity.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201959\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Drug trafficking is racketeering activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(A). The Court has heard evidence that Troup is an SNM member, so evidence indicating that Troup smuggled drugs into a prison facility tends to make it more probable that the SNM is an enterprise engaged in racketeering activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 401. Accordingly, Romero's statement is not irrelevant to the VICAR charges against Troup, so rule 402 does not render those statements inadmissible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 402 (\"Irrelevant evidence is not admissible.\"). Likewise, offering Romero's statement to show that the SNM is an enterprise engaged in racketeering activity is not using the statement \"to prove a person's character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character,\" so that statement is admissible notwithstanding rule 404. Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court does not believe that enterprise evidence is subject to rule 404(b)(2)'s notice requirement in a criminal case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 404(b)(2) (\"[T]he prosecutor must: (A) provide reasonable notice of the general nature of any such evidence that the prosecutor intends to offer at trial; and (B) do so before trial-or during trial if the court, for good cause, excuses lack of pretrial notice.\").\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   The test often, though confusingly, used by the courts is whether the acts that are the subject of the proof are \"inextricably intertwined\" with the basic elements\n   of the crime charged. If so, Rule 404(b) is considered inapplicable and there is no need to articulate a \"not-for-character\" purpose for the evidence. Nor is there any need to give prior notice of the intent to use the evidence, as is required if the evidence is covered by Rule 404(b).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Stephen A. Saltzburg et al.,\n   <em>\n    Federal Rules of Evidence Manual\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 404.02[12] (11th ed. 2017). Romero made the statement that Troup finds objectionable on March 28, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion \u00b6 1, at 1. Even if rule 404(b)(2)'s notice requirement applies, however, the United States provided the Defendants pretrial notice of Romero's statement-albeit on the Saturday before trial-and, thus, satisfied that requirement. The Court does not fault the United States for failing to disclose the Romero statement earlier, because the United States did not have the statement earlier. In words attributed to Immanuel Kant: \"ought implies can.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Robert Stern,\n   <em>\n    Does 'Ought' Imply 'Can'?

Evidence is admissible under Rule 404(b) only if it is relevant.... In the Rule 404(b) context, similar act evidence is relevant only if the jury can reasonably conclude that the act occurred and that the defendant was the actor....
