Plaintiff Cleveland asserts two additional claims-a claim for retaliation under Title VII and \u00a7 1981 and a state law claim for retaliatory discharge. This matter is presently before the court on defendant's motion for summary judgment on all claims of both plaintiffs (doc. 137). As will be explained, the motion is denied as to plaintiff Thomas's claim that defendant denied her a pay increase based on race; is denied as to plaintiff Cleveland's discriminatory discharge and retaliation claims; and is otherwise granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are uncontroverted or related in the light most favorable to plaintiffs as the nonmoving parties. Defendant Piat, Inc. is a local ServPro franchisee. Its primary business is to remediate and restore homes and businesses that have been damaged by water or fire. Defendant employs administrative office employees who answer the phones, audit job files to ensure they are properly\n   billed, bill the customers, and handle payments and accounts receivable. Plaintiff LaShone Middleton-Thomas began working in defendant's administrative office on February 4, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   She earned an hourly wage of $13.00 during the course of her employment. When plaintiff Thomas first started working for defendant, she generally was an administrative assistant and, in that capacity, answered the phones, processed paperwork, and performed other administrative tasks as directed by the office manager. Plaintiff Thomas also acted as the \"back up\" scheduler when the scheduler was absent. The scheduler dispatches and schedules field technicians to work at various properties throughout the day and is responsible for getting field technicians to work sites at the appropriate time. At some point during her employment, plaintiff Thomas also began placing supply orders for defendant. Mike Hogan, defendant's operations manager since 2011, instructed plaintiff Thomas what to purchase and plaintiff Thomas would place the order. At all times, plaintiff's direct supervisor was the office manager who, until November 2016, was Dru Farthing. When Ms. Farthing was terminated in November 2016, Terri Kesler became the officer manager. The office manager reported to Cory Bates, one of defendant's owners. The other two owners of defendant were Jack Whitaker and Clo Whitaker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In August 2015, Mssrs. Bates and Hogan hired plaintiff Guinans Carol Cleveland as a project manager. Plaintiff Cleveland's annual salary throughout her employment with defendant was $50,000. Shortly after plaintiff Cleveland was hired, defendant created a new position for plaintiff Cleveland and she began handling some of the work that Mr. Hogan had been performing as operations manager. Specifically, in September 2015, plaintiff Cleveland became defendant's Human Resource and Safety Manager. In this role, plaintiff was responsible for typical human resource functions, such as bringing employees' concerns to management; advising managers on employee discipline; and coordinating hiring. She was also responsible for maintaining the company's fleet of vehicles and for complying with certain safety regulations. During her employment, plaintiff Cleveland reported directly to Mr. Hogan. Plaintiff Cleveland does not dispute that, by March 2016, Mr. Hogan believed that plaintiff Cleveland had significant performance issues in her role as Human Resource and Safety Manager. Among other issues, Mr. Hogan believed that plaintiff was insubordinate by distributing forms and policies to production staff without discussing those forms and policies with Mr. Hogan and by failing to conduct safety trainings despite being asked to do so. Mr. Hogan also believed that plaintiff Cleveland had a misunderstanding of government regulations resulting in unnecessary costs to the company. The record reflects that plaintiff Cleveland and Mr. Hogan had frequent discussions about defendant's compliance with DOT regulations and, to a lesser extent, OSHA regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In June 2016, plaintiff Thomas became aware that Mr. Bates had concerns about plaintiff's performance when she received an email from Ms. Farthing conveying Mr. Bates' concerns. According to Ms. Farthing's email, Mr. Bates was concerned about plaintiff Thomas's attitude and the fact that she always seemed unhappy. He was also concerned with the amount of time that plaintiff Thomas spent in plaintiff\n   Cleveland's office and he did not understand why those meetings or visits were occurring so frequently. In early August 2016, Mr. Bates himself expressed concerns to plaintiff Thomas about having low energy and appearing \"kind of down\" and he wondered whether plaintiff Thomas did not like him or did not like ServPro. Around this same time, plaintiff Thomas made a complaint via email to Mr. Bates and Ms. Farthing in which she stated that she believed she was being treated differently than others at ServPro based on her race. Plaintiff Thomas highlighted that she had been at work for 17 months without a pay raise and that defendant was scrutinizing her work, work habits and personality traits more closely than it scrutinized other employees. She alleged that defendant had stereotyped her as an \"Angry Black Woman.\" Mr. Bates, Ms. Farthing and plaintiff Cleveland met with plaintiff Thomas the following day to discuss her concerns and then met again a few days later to discuss any additional concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. Hogan reviewed plaintiff Cleveland's performance in August 2016 and he communicated the issues he had with plaintiff Cleveland's performance both before her review, during her review and after her review. Based on his opinion regarding plaintiff Cleveland's performance, Mr. Hogan did not recommend a salary increase and plaintiff did not receive one. In late October or early November 2016, defendant's payroll vendor, Bukaty Companies, offered to handle the human resource functions that plaintiff had been performing and it offered to do so at a significantly lower cost than plaintiff Cleveland's annual salary. Mr. Bates discussed the offer with Mr. Hogan and they agreed that having Bukaty perform the human resource functions for defendant would be a good decision due to the cost savings and because plaintiff Cleveland's performance had not met defendant's expectations. Mssrs. Bates and Hogan decided to terminate plaintiff Cleveland's employment, effective November 21, 2016, and to outsource her position. Defendant did not replace plaintiff Cleveland; Bukaty has performed the human resource aspects of plaintiff's position and other employees of defendant have performed the safety-related aspects of plaintiff's position. Plaintiff avers that just 12 days prior to her termination, on November 9, 2016, she reported to Clo Whitaker that she felt like she was being treated differently than other management staff and that defendant \"was violating multiple OSHA and DOT regulations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff Thomas resigned her employment on September 8, 2017. Defendant did not replace plaintiff Thomas and other administrative office employees have absorbed her duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Additional facts will be provided as they relate to the specific arguments raised by the parties in their submissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

This argument is rejected because the Tenth Circuit does not require that level of specificity in a charge of discrimination. Plaintiff expressly alleged in her charge that she was subjected to a hostile work environment based on her race and the approximate time period is clear on the face of the charge. While plaintiff does not identify an alleged harasser, her allegations concerning performance and attendance scrutiny are sufficient to put defendant on notice that plaintiff's supervisor or supervisors were likely the subject of those allegations. No more is required. Plaintiff Thomas has sufficiently exhausted her claim of racial harassment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

She also marked the \"continuing action\" box with respect to the dates that the discrimination occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Plaintiff Cleveland now seeks to add a claim based on allegations that defendant, based on plaintiff Cleveland's race, denied her \"compensatory time\" for overtime hours that she worked.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   She concedes that this claim does not appear in her charge of discrimination but contends that the court may consider it nonetheless because it is reasonably related to her wage claim. For the same reasons that the court rejected plaintiff Thomas's argument, plaintiff Cleveland's argument is rejected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eisenhour v. Weber County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4119223\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/744/1220/#p1227\">\n    744 F.3d 1220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1227 (10th Cir. 2014) (explaining abrogation of exhaustion exception for reasonably related claims by discrete-incident rule) ). The court, then, dismisses plaintiff's claim that defendant denied her compensatory time based on her race and defendant's motion is granted to this extent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant contends that plaintiff Cleveland has failed to exhaust any race discrimination claim stemming from defendant's denial of a pay increase and the termination of plaintiff Cleveland's employment because the charge contains no \"facts\" supporting those claims. The court easily concludes that plaintiff Cleveland's charge satisfies the purpose of administrative exhaustion-to give notice of the alleged violation to the employer and to give the EEOC an opportunity to conciliate the claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v. Needham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277048\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/1284/#p1290\">\n    856 F.3d 1284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1290 (10th Cir. 2017). Plaintiff Cleveland marked the \"race discrimination\" box and expressly identified her termination and the denial of a pay increase as specific instances of race-based discrimination. These allegations are sufficient to alert defendant to plaintiff's race discrimination claims and to trigger an investigation into the circumstances underlying plaintiff's termination and her denial of a wage increase. And unlike a complaint filed in federal court, there is no requirement that a charge of discrimination contain sufficient facts to render the claim plausible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277048\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/1284/#p1290\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277048\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/1284/#p1290\">\n    at 1291-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In summary fashion, defendant also contends that plaintiff Cleveland failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with respect to her hostile work environment claim because plaintiff has not included any \"facts identifying any alleged harasser, the type of discrimination complained of, or the time period of any alleged harassment.\" The court rejects this argument for the same reason it rejected the argument in connection with plaintiff Thomas's charge-namely, the Circuit does not require the level of specificity espoused by defendant and plaintiff Cleveland's charge sufficiently indicates that she witnessed racism in the workplace over the course of her employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Lastly, defendant contends that plaintiff Cleveland has not adequately exhausted a claim for Title VII retaliation because the facts alleged in her charge do not reflect that she complained of any practice prohibited by Title VII. This argument goes to the merits of plaintiff's claim rather than the exhaustion requirement and the court rejects it. Plaintiff marked the \"retaliation\" box on her charge and alleged that she was discharged in retaliation for complaining of unfair acts and practices. This is sufficient to satisfy the purpose of exhaustion and to trigger an investigation into plaintiff's complaints and her termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277048\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/1284/#p1290\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277048\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/1284/#p1290\">\n    at 1291-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Mr. Bates testified that Dru Farthing, as the office manager, was in the best position to evaluate plaintiff's behavior, work activities and work product. Ms. Farthing, on at least two occasions, requested a wage increase for plaintiff Thomas and documented numerous reasons supporting the increase. This, of course, suggests that plaintiff was eligible for a raise regardless of her position on the pay scale. And other evidence in the record demonstrates that while plaintiff's wage may have been \"near\" the top of the scale, it was not at the very top of that scale and that some room existed for an adjustment. Moreover, because Mr. Bates admits that Ms. Farthing was in the best position to analyze plaintiff's performance, Ms. Farthing's recommendation of a raise suggests that plaintiff's performance was not necessarily a factor in the decision to deny her a raise. The record also suggests that when Ms. Farthing presented her raise requests to Mr. Bates, he rejected those requests and, in doing so, highlighted only plaintiff's attitude (a highly subjective criteria) without any reference to pay scales or any specific criticism of her performance. Finally, the evidence does not demonstrate that plaintiff's alleged refusal to accept a promotion to the scheduler position affected her pay rate in the position she held. In combination, plaintiff's evidence is sufficient to survive summary judgment on this claim and the jury must resolve factual disputes underlying that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    B. Plaintiff Cleveland's Denial-of-Pay-Increase Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Plaintiff Cleveland challenges defendant's decision not to give her a merit increase in connection with her August 2016 performance review. Because defendant's motion is silent on the issue, the court assumes that defendant is not challenging plaintiff Cleveland's ability to establish a prima facie case. According to defendant, it denied plaintiff a raise in August 2016 because plaintiff's direct supervisor, Mr. Hogan, did not believe that plaintiff's performance merited a pay raise. In fact, it is undisputed that Mr. Hogan raised specific, objective concerns with plaintiff about her performance before, during and after her August 2016 performance review. Those concerns included, among other things, Mr. Hogan's belief that plaintiff was insubordinate by distributing forms and policies to production staff without discussing those forms and policies with Mr. Hogan and by failing to conduct safety trainings despite being asked to do so; and Mr. Hogan's belief that plaintiff Cleveland had a misunderstanding of government regulations resulting in unnecessary costs to the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In an effort to show that defendant's legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for failing to give plaintiff a pay raise are pretextual, plaintiff Cleveland highlights that she was never disciplined for violating any specific policy; that she never missed work; that she worked long hours; and that she \"outperformed\" Caucasian employees. But none of these facts casts doubt on the specific reasons offered by defendant or in any way calls into question the specific performance issues set forth in Mr. Hogan's affidavit. Although Mr. Hogan mentioned a handful of minor issues on plaintiff's performance evaluation that plaintiff now challenges as pretextual (such as her wearing blue jeans on occasion), there is no evidence that these minor issues had any bearing on whether to give plaintiff a pay raise or otherwise factored into Mr. Hogan's decision not to give plaintiff a pay increase. Plaintiff's arguments on those issues, then, are simply not relevant and do not show a factual dispute on any genuine issue. Because plaintiff has failed\n   to establish pretext with respect to her claim that defendant failed to give her a pay raise based on her race, summary judgment in favor of defendant is granted on that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    C. Plaintiff Cleveland's Discriminatory Discharge Claim\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendant concedes for purposes of summary judgment that plaintiff Cleveland has established a prima facie case with respect to her claim that defendant terminated her employment on the basis of her race. According to defendant, it terminated plaintiff's employment because it decided to outsource defendant's human resources functions to a third-party vendor at a significant savings, particularly in light of plaintiff's performance issues. In an effort to show pretext, plaintiff contends that defendant's reason is unworthy of belief because it outsourced only the human resources part of plaintiff's job and that plaintiff's duties involving safety regulation and code compliance were not outsourced. But plaintiff does not dispute that those functions were absorbed by existing employees and that defendant, thus, still realized a significant savings by outsourcing the human resources aspect of the job and letting existing employees perform the rest of plaintiff's duties. In any event, plaintiff's argument does not address the performance-related reasons proffered by defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On that issue, plaintiff contends that her performance was not really a factor in the decision to outsource her position because a Caucasian warehouse manager received a worse evaluation than she did and his position was not outsourced. Evidence that a similarly situated employee received better treatment can suggest that the employer's alleged nondiscriminatory reason is pretextual.\n   <em>\n    Roberts v.

As the Circuit has explained, however, \"to provide a basis for reliable comparison, the other employee must, in fact, be similarly situated-that is, reporting to the same supervisor, held to the same standards, and afoul of those standards to at least the same degree. And it falls on the employee alleging discrimination to rule out alternative explanations for the differential treatment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715202\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/1306/#p1310\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Timmerman v.

In any event, the evidence demonstrates that defendant treated this employee the same way in which it treated plaintiff-defendant failed to give\n   the employee a pay raise at the employee's October 2016 performance review and ultimately terminated the employment of the warehouse manager for performance deficiencies. Plaintiff Cleveland also asserts that she had a reputation for being a competent and dedicated employee. But as the Circuit has repeatedly held, an employee's self-assessment of her performance is not enough to show pretext; only the manager's perception of the employee's performance is relevant.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Metzler v. Fed. Home Loan Bank of Topeka\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3728915\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/464/1164/#p1179\">\n    464 F.3d 1164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1179 (10th Cir. 2006) (finding that employee's subjective beliefs regarding her attitude, knowledge, and performance did not raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding employer's stated bases for her termination).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Nonetheless, plaintiff has come forward with evidence that, if credited by a jury, could suggest that defendant factored plaintiff's race into its discharge decision. There is evidence in the record that Cory Bates told plaintiff that she was \"fishing for racism\" in her discussions with African-American employees and that Mr. Bates, Mr. Hogan and Ms. Whitaker asked other employees, including plaintiff Thomas, if plaintiff Cleveland was \"pushing\" racism in the workplace. There is evidence that Mr. Hogan, whenever plaintiff met with African-American employees in her office, referred to those meetings as \"black meetings\" or a \"black thing\" and pressed plaintiff for information about the content of those meetings. While the record does not reveal the full context of these statements, the record does not foreclose the possibility that plaintiff's race, in conjunction with her position as HR manager and the way in which she was carrying out her position as an African-American human resources manager, played a part in defendant's decision to terminate plaintiff's employment. A jury must resolve this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Racial Harassment Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In the pretrial order, plaintiffs contend that defendant subjected them to racial harassment sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of their employment. To survive summary judgment on a claim of racial harassment, plaintiffs must present evidence that creates a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the workplace is \"permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Lounds v. Lincare, Inc\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086628\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1208/#p1222\">\n    812 F.3d 1208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1222 (10th Cir. 2015). A plaintiff \"does not make a showing of a pervasively hostile work environment by demonstrating a few isolated incidents of racial enmity or sporadic racial slurs. Instead, there must be a steady barrage of opprobrious racial comments.\"\n   <em>\n    Herrera v. Lufkin Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5711913\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/474/675/#p680\">\n    474 F.3d 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 680 (10th Cir. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Even taking the evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff Thomas, she cannot raise a genuine factual issue that her workplace amounted to a racially hostile environment. In support of her claim, plaintiff Thomas first asserts that she experienced an incident so severe that it, standing alone, was sufficient to alter the terms and conditions of employment. That incident concerns a former employee named Andrew Nail. According to plaintiff, Mr. Nail's employment was terminated after he made a vulgar, racist comment in the workplace. Mr. Nail, after hearing that a co-worker's African-American wife suffered a miscarriage, allegedly said \"That's one less cotton-picking nigger in the world.\" There is no suggestion that plaintiff Thomas heard this remark or had knowledge of the remark until after the termination of Mr. Nail's employment. In any event, the evidence reflects that defendant terminated Mr. Nail's employment\n   immediately and, shortly thereafter, Mr. Bates and Mr. Hogan began hearing \"rumors\" that Mr. Nail was threatening to come back to the workplace and \"shoot up the place\" during a breakfast meeting scheduled on April 13, 2016. Mr. Bates contacted the Olathe Police Department and the police investigated the threat of violence and determined that no threat existed. Indeed, the breakfast meeting occurred without incident and there is no evidence that Mr. Nail ever returned to the workplace.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiff Thomas's claim is that defendant should have informed her that Mr. Nail had been terminated for making a racist remark and had threatened to come to the breakfast meeting and \"shoot up the place.\" According to plaintiff Thomas, she is responsible for letting people through the security doors at the workplace and she attended the breakfast meeting. Plaintiff Thomas asserts that she was thus placed in a position \"where her life was threatened.\" She contends that defendant's \"racially discriminatory decision to not inform\" plaintiff Thomas of the \"Andrew Nail situation,\" while informing Caucasian employees, is severe enough to constitute racial harassment. But there is no evidence that defendant distributed information about Andrew Nail based on race. The record reflects that defendant, at the advice of the Olathe Police Department, did not alert all employees because it \"would have been sounding an unnecessary alarm.\" Mr. Hogan testified that he did not inform anyone at all about the potential threat and that Mr. Bates told only two senior-level management employees who were given specific instructions by the police on protecting employees in the unlikely event Mr. Nail came to the building. Mr. Bates similarly testified that he told only Mr. Hogan and the two management-level employees identified by Mr. Hogan in his deposition. There is simply no basis in the record, then, for plaintiff's suggestion that defendant notified Caucasian employees about a potential threat from Andrew Nail but elected not to tell African-American employees about a potential threat. Plaintiff has substantially mischaracterized the record. In short, no reasonable jury could conclude that the Andrew Nail incident was based on plaintiff's race or that the incident in any way amounted to harassment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In the alternative, plaintiff attempts to show that she experienced \"pervasive\" harassment based on race. She directs the court, however, to only one overtly racial remark made by a co-worker. According to plaintiff, Veneta Smith on one occasion referred to plaintiff as a \"colored girl.\" But the record is not clear whether plaintiff heard the remark or even had knowledge of the remark prior to this litigation. Rather, the deposition testimony cited by plaintiff suggests that Ms. Smith referred to plaintiff Thomas as a \"colored girl\" in a conversation with another employee, who later reported the remark to management. This single remark, then, hardly makes plaintiff's workplace permeated with discriminatory intimidation, ridicule and insult and falls far short of the \"steady barrage\" required for a racially hostile environment claim.\n   <em>\n    Chavez v. New Mexico\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9037487\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/397/826/#p832\">\n    397 F.3d 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 832 (10th Cir. 2005) (holding that two racially offensive remarks \"[fell] far short of the 'steady barrage' required for a [racially] hostile environment claim\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiff contends that additional incidents support her hostile work environment claim, including that Caucasian employees refused to return her phone calls; that Mr. Bates changed her positive performance evaluation to a negative one; that defendant refused to investigate her claims of race discrimination; that defendant burdened her with other employees' responsibilities; that Mr. Hogan criticized her performance\n   and micromanaged her work; and that Jack Whitaker left a copy of the book \"The Seven Laws of Spiritual Success\" on her desk.

Like plaintiff Thomas, plaintiff Cleveland's claim is based in large part on the Andrew Nail incident. For the reasons described above, plaintiff Cleveland has not demonstrated that anything about this incident was based on race or sufficiently severe to constitute harassment. She also attempts to establish that she experienced \"pervasive\" racial harassment in the workplace, beginning with evidence of two comments that she contends were \"racially charged.\" In November 2015, Project Manager Matthew Minshall told plaintiff Cleveland in front of other managers during a meeting that she could \"stand behind me and be my shadow.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff testified that she could not recall any specific context for this remark. In March 2016, employee Joel Bates asked plaintiff during plaintiff's safety check of employees' Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) bags, \"What do you want me to do, tap dance for you?\" Finally, plaintiff avers that \"[w]henever I had a meeting in my office, Mike Hogan would always approach me afterword [sic] to talk to me about the meeting and would often refer to the meetings as 'black meetings' or 'black thing.' \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Even assuming the race-based nature of these comments, plaintiff Cleveland has failed to set forth a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the comments were sufficiently pervasive so as to alter the terms and conditions of her employment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the court recognizes that the \"pervasiveness evaluation is particularly unsuited for summary judgment because it is inherently fact-found by nature,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086628\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1208/#p1222\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086628\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1208/#p1222\">\n    at 1222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a plaintiff is nonetheless still required to show \"more than a few isolated incidents of racial enmity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086628\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1208/#p1222\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4086628\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/1208/#p1222\">\n    at 1223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

According to defendant, the \"manager rule\" established by the Tenth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    McKenzie v. Renberg's, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11347217\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/94/1478/\">\n    94 F.3d 1478\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 1996), dictates that plaintiff did not engage in protected opposition to discrimination. Under the \"manager rule,\" employees who are required as part of their job duties to report or investigate complaints of discrimination cannot claim that the reporting or investigating itself is a protected activity under the \"opposition clause\" because conveying others' discrimination complaints is not the same as opposing unlawful practices. Defendant contends that summary judgment is appropriate because plaintiff Cleveland never stepped outside her role as defendant's Human Resources manager in conveying other employees' complaints of discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In her response, plaintiff asserts that she engaged in protected activity on November 9, 2016 when she reported to Clo Whitaker that she felt like she was being treated differently than other management staff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   This allegation is clearly distinct from conveying complaints of other employees such that defendant's reliance on the \"manager rule is misplaced. Moreover, despite the fact that plaintiff's allegation about her own complaint on November 9, 2016 appears in the pretrial order, defendant's motion for summary judgment does not address this specific aspect of plaintiff's retaliation claim. Rather, defendant challenges that allegation only in its reply brief after plaintiff emphasized the allegation in her response to the motion for summary judgment. The court, then, declines to address defendant's belated argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lynch v. Barrett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869818\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/703/1153/\">\n    703 F.3d 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1160 n.2 (10th Cir. 2013) (court does not consider arguments raised for the first time in reply brief).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In any event, the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff demonstrates that plaintiff was the only African-American member of management; that she complained to Clo Whitaker on November 9, 2016 that she was being treated differently than other members of management (all of whom were Caucasian); that defendant terminated her employment just 12 days later; that Ms. Whitaker had some involvement in the termination decision; and that Ms. Whitaker, along with Mr. Bates and Mr. Hogan, questioned plaintiff Thomas about whether plaintiff Cleveland was \"pushing\" racism in the workplace. Taken together, a reasonable jury could conclude that plaintiff engaged in protected activity on November 9, 2016 and that Ms. Whitaker knew that plaintiff, on November 9, 2016, was opposing a practice made unlawful by Title VII. Thus, even if defendant had challenged this aspect of plaintiff's retaliation claim in its opening brief, the court would nonetheless have denied summary judgment on that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The court turns, then, to the rest of the\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas\n   </em>\n   framework. In support of her retaliation claim, plaintiff Cleveland has additional evidence beyond the evidence she relied on in connection with her race discrimination claim. In addition to the close temporal proximity between her discussion with Clo Whitaker and her termination, there is evidence in the record that Cory Bates told plaintiff that she was \"fishing for racism\" in her discussions with African-American employees and that Mr. Bates, Mr. Hogan and Ms. Whitaker asked other employees, including plaintiff Thomas, if plaintiff Cleveland was \"pushing\" racism in the workplace. Defendant does not address these allegations in the context of plaintiff's retaliation claim. Viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiff, that evidence could be construed by a reasonable jury as evidence that defendant believed that plaintiff Cleveland was stirring up complaints of race discrimination against defendant or encouraging employees to question whether they were experiencing racism in the workplace. And a reasonable jury could conclude that defendant terminated plaintiff Cleveland's employment based on its belief that plaintiff was stirring up trouble in the workforce, even if plaintiff's performance was also a reason for the decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Univ. of Tex.

Sprague, however, addressed a claim based on \"equal pay\" allegations or, stated another way, allegations that the plaintiff was paid less than her male counterparts.

In fact, the record reflects that Ms. Smith was supervised and evaluated by Matt Haney and she did not hold a management position.

Mr. Bates clearly testified, however, that he did not believe that the term was racially charged in the context in which he believed it was used.

Defendant contends that plaintiff's statement in her affidavit in insufficient to establish the requisite \"report\" because her report to Ms. Whitaker was devoid of any facts or explanation supporting any alleged violation of OSHA or DOT regulations. Defendant is incorrect. Plaintiff's affidavit does not speak to the facts or explanation that plaintiff may have provided to Ms. Whitaker. Thus, while the affidavit contains no facts or explanation as to what plaintiff specifically reported to Ms. Whitaker, the court cannot conclude that plaintiff's report (as opposed to plaintiff's affidavit) contained no facts or explanation as to the alleged violations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
