FRANK, United States District Judge\n   <strong>\n    INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This matter is before the Court on a Partial Motion to Dismiss and Strike Plaintiffs' Consolidated Amended Complaint (the \"Amended Complaint\") brought by Defendant 3M Company (\"3M\" or \"Defendant\") (Doc. No. 87). For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants in part and denies in part the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This case involves a 3M product, the Lava Ultimate CAD/CAM Dental Restorative (\"Lava Ultimate\"). Lava Ultimate is a product designed for dentists to use in making customized dental restorations, such as veneers, inlays, onlays, and crowns. A dental crown is a tooth-shaped cap that completely covers a tooth or a dental implant. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 55.) A crown can be made from Lava Ultimate with a computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing machine (\"CAD/CAM\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.) A dentist uses the CAD/CAM machine to take a digital image of the patient's tooth and mouth and then mill the Lava Ultimate dental block into a customized crown. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This process allows the procedure to take place in a single office visit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In January 2011, the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") approved Lava Ultimate as a Class II medical device for indicated uses of \"inlays, onlays, veneers, and full crown restorations, including crowns on implants.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 69, 71-72.) 3M then released Lava Ultimate into the market. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73.) Plaintiffs allege that 3M marketed Lava Ultimate as, for example, especially suitable for crowns, fracture-resistant, durable, aesthetically pleasing, convenient, and more economical. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 73-85.) In addition, 3M represented that Lava Ultimate could be used for permanent, adhesive, single-tooth restorations, including crowns. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In this action, Plaintiffs, who are all dentists or dental practices, allege that crowns made using Lava Ultimate material suffer from an inherent defect, namely that they have a propensity to \"debond\" from teeth at higher rates than other crown material. Plaintiffs contend that Lava Ultimate loses its adhesive properties after being exposed to conditions normally present in patients' mouths. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.) Plaintiffs also argue that they have shouldered the costs associated with the defective crowns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   3M ultimately removed Lava Ultimate from the market for use in crowns (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96), but it denies any inherent defect in the product. Instead, 3M contends that the product worked well for all but a small percentage of dentists. On June 12, 2015, 3M sent a letter to dentists stating: \"[3M] is removing the crown indication for Lava Ultimate CAD/CAM Restorative Product because crowns are debonding at a higher-than anticipated rate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) 3M sent the following warning: \"\n   <strong>\n    IMPORTANT:\n    <em>\n     Do not use Lava Ultimate restorative for any type of crown because there exists a potential for debonding\n    </em>\n    .\"\n   </strong>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original).) The FDA classified 3M's letter as a Class II recall, which is defined as:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"a situation in which use of, or exposure to, a violative product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences or where the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their Amended Complaint, seeking a putative nationwide class action or, in the alternative, thirteen putative statewide subclasses of dentists and dental practices who purchased Lava Ultimate and used it to apply dental crowns between January 1, 2011 and June 12, 2015. In the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs bring roughly 70 separate claims for statutory fraud, breach of express and implied warranties, unjust enrichment, and common-law fraud under 13 states' statutory schemes, as well as a claim under the federal Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In general, Plaintiffs allege that they: purchased Lava Ultimate blocks and seated them for dental crowns (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-49); purchased Lava Ultimate after having received and reviewed various marketing materials touting Lava Ultimate's use in crowns (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   &amp; \u00b6 86); relied on 3M's representations about Lava Ultimate's suitability for crowns (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-49); reported crowns that debonded to either 3M or a 3M sales representative (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); and suffered injury by repairing or replacing the crowns (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 99-102). Plaintiffs seek compensatory damages for the repair or replacement costs of Lava Ultimate-based crowns and for the alleged loss to business reputation and practice, disgorgement of profits, statutory penalties, an injunction from \"continuing to sell, market, or distribute Lava products for use in crowns,\" punitive damages, and attorney fees and costs. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. and Prayer for Relief.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs allege, among other things, that 3M breached an express warranty. 3M acknowledges that Lava Ultimate products came with an express warranty. Specifically, 3M points to a ten-year express warranty that covers Lava Ultimate-based restorations, including crowns, and that disclaims other express or implied warranties. 3M insists that any dispute between dentists and 3M over the performance of Lava Ultimate is governed by the express warranty and that Plaintiffs' other remaining legal theories are red herrings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support, 3M points to the following \"10 Year Limited Warranty\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Limited Warranty and Limited Remedy\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   3M ESPE warrants for 10 years from date of placement that restorations made from Lava(tm) Ultimate CAD/CAM Restorative will not fracture if fabricated using a 3M ESPE recommended milling machine in strict compliance with approved indications and instructions for use. 3M ESPE makes no other warranties including, but not limited to, any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   (Doc.

Compl. \u00b6 78 (referencing a \"10-year warranty\").) 3M's webpages, which are cited in the Amended Complaint, also reference a warranty. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6 76 n.3; \u00b6 80 n.8; and \u00b6 85 n.12; Doc. No. 114 (\"2d Wildung Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 4, 5, 6 &amp; Exs. C, D, E.)

In addition, Plaintiffs ask the Court to rule without the benefit of a factual record. 3M correctly points out that whether out-of-state plaintiffs can assert a claim under Minnesota law is a fact-intensive question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Nat'l Hockey League Players' Concussion Injury Litig.\n   </em>\n   , Civ.

Fraud Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   3M moves to dismiss numerous fraud and consumer protection claims for a failure to plead with particularity under Rule 9(b). These claims include: Minnesota Consumer Fraud Act, Minnesota Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Minnesota Unlawful Trade Practices Act, Fraud (under the laws of California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington), California Unfair Competition Law, California False Advertising Law, Florida Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Georgia Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Kansas Consumer Protection Act, New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, New Mexico Unfair Trade Practices Act, and Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act-Consumer Protection Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   3M argues that Plaintiffs have failed to allege even some representative examples of the fraudulent conduct with requisite particularity. Plaintiffs disagree and argue that their allegations are sufficient to allow 3M to prepare a defense. In addition, Plaintiffs argue that the Court must consider the factual context of the case, emphasizing that this case involves allegedly misleading advertising campaigns. In such cases, Plaintiffs submit, \"the pleadings are not required to provide the date and time of every communication.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lehman Bros.

[Plaintiff's] reliance on 3M's misrepresentations about Lava Ultimate's suitability for dental crowns was an immediate cause of the injury-causing conduct because, but for 3M's misrepresentations, he would not have bought Lava Ultimate.

The Amended Complaint contains additional general allegations about representations made by 3M in its promotion of Lava Ultimate, including representations made on product boxes, product instructions, 3M's website, mailers, brochures, industry magazines, at trade shows and conferences, press releases, and in sponsored \"news\" stories. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 73-86.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Having carefully reviewed the Amended Complaint, and considered the parties' arguments, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' allegations of fraud lack the particularity required under Rule 9(b). It is true that where, as here, it is alleged that the misstatements have occurred over a period of time, Plaintiffs are not required to provide the exact date and time of each and every allegedly fraudulent communication. Even so, Plaintiffs are required to allege \"some representative examples of the fraudulent conduct with particularity.\"\n   <em>\n    Select Comfort Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4196029\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/796/981/#p983\">\n    796 F.Supp.2d at 985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs have not done that.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   First, Plaintiffs do not provide sufficient details about the allegedly fraudulent materials they claim to have received or viewed. Plaintiffs vaguely refer to \"various marketing materials\" but do not allege\n   facts that demonstrate (or even suggest) what specific marketing materials each Plaintiff viewed and relied upon. Instead, Plaintiffs offer nearly identical allegations that are repeated for each Plaintiff and that supposedly apply equally to all Plaintiffs. The recitation of the same general allegations for each Plaintiff is insufficient.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs claim that 3M misrepresented and concealed material facts about Lava Ultimate crowns. In support, Plaintiffs list numerous statements made by 3M with respect to Lava Ultimate, such as: \" 'indicated' for crowns,\" \"ideally suited for implant supported restorations,\" \"perform similarly to or better than glass ceramic and composite materials,\" \"high flexural strength,\" \"especially advantageous for crowns over implants,\" and \"tough material with excellent resiliency.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6 122.) However, Plaintiffs do not allege how the purported defect in Lava Ultimate-the propensity to debond-rendered the listed representations false or misleading.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Szul v. Flagstar Bank\n   </em>\n   , Civ. No. 14-14089,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%2013036942\">\n    2015 WL 13036942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (E.D. Mich. June 8, 2015) (noting that plaintiffs failed to explain how an alleged misrepresentation was false or how plaintiffs' reliance on it resulted in an injury). Again, Plaintiffs' allegations in this regard are conclusory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Third, Plaintiffs' allegations with respect to knowledge and intent are insufficiently specific. Plaintiffs allege that 3M knew that its representations were false or misleading based on the allegations that Plaintiffs reported the debonding issue to 3M. However, on this point, Plaintiffs' allegations are vague and, again, nearly identical for each Plaintiff. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Am. Compl. \u00b6 27 (\"After seeing the high failure rate of Lava Ultimate, [Plaintiff] complained to 3M and 3M's sales representative. 3M continually represented that Lava Ultimate was not the problem and was not defective, instead blaming [Plaintiff's] application techniques and saying that no other dentist was experiencing debonding problems.\").) Plaintiffs also point to paragraphs 89-94 to support the elements of knowledge and intent. However, these allegations are also conclusory, generally referring to an aggressive marketing campaign touting Lava Ultimate as a superior product for use in crowns and asserting that 3M failed to warn about Lava Ultimate's defect. Importantly, Plaintiffs do not provide sufficient details that would shed light on which Plaintiff or Plaintiffs specifically talked to 3M about debonding, the position of those at 3M they spoke to, what exactly Plaintiffs reported to 3M, when they reported the issue to 3M, or what specifically was discussed during the conversations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, Plaintiffs again offer nearly identical allegations for each Plaintiff. Moreover, Plaintiffs do not specify how 3M had \"intent to induce.\" While intent can be alleged generally, the allegations cannot be conclusory or based on speculation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dunnigan v. Fed. Home Loan Mortg. Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=184%20F.%20Supp.%203d%20726\">\n    184 F.Supp.3d 726\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 740-41 (D. Minn. 2016) (explaining that plaintiffs must allege facts that give rise to a strong inference of fraudulent intent). Here, Plaintiffs' allegations\n   regarding intent are conclusory as they fail to give rise to a strong inference that 3M intended to mislead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs' allegations with respect to reliance are insufficiently specific. Plaintiffs make the conclusory allegation that they relied on 3M's misrepresentations. However, Plaintiffs fail to provide requisite specifics, such as which marketing materials specifically encouraged the purchases of Lava Ultimate blocks for use on crowns and whether Plaintiffs relied on those specific materials. Instead of pleading reliance with particularity, Plaintiffs rely on the same vague and nearly identical allegations for each Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   For the above reasons, all of Plaintiffs' fraud and statutory claims that involve elements of fraud are properly dismissed. The latter include: Minnesota Consumer Fraud Act, Minnesota Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Minnesota Unlawful Trade Practices Act, California Unfair Competition Law, California False Advertising Law, Florida Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Georgia Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act, Kansas Consumer Protection Act, New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, New Mexico Unfair Trade Practices Act, and Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act-Consumer Protection Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Motion to Amend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In their opposition, Plaintiffs request leave to amend their Amended Complaint. Plaintiffs make this request without filing a formal motion or attaching a proposed amended complaint. Without the benefit of any showing by Plaintiffs of how they propose to amend the Amended Complaint to satisfy their pleading burdens, the Court cannot determine whether allowing such an amendment is warranted. Therefore, Plaintiffs' informal request to amend is denied. However, because it is plausible that Plaintiffs could amend their fraud claims to address the noted deficiencies, Plaintiffs' fraud claims and related statutory claims are dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Claims Seeking Injunctive Relief\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   3M also moves to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims under four statutes that only permit injunctive relief: California Unfair Competition Law (\"California UCL\"); Georgia Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act (\"GDTPA\"); Minnesota Deceptive Trade Practices Act (\"MDTPA\"); and Minnesota Unlawful Trade Practices Act (\"MUTPA\"). While these claims are properly dismissed for the reasons discussed above, the Court addresses this issue below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Under the MDTPA, the \"sole statutory remedy for deceptive trade practices is injunctive relief.\"\n   <em>\n    Gardner v.

In addition, in order to state a claim for injunctive relief under the MUTPA, a plaintiff must allege a threat of future harm to himself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buetow v. A.L.S. Enters., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874565\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/1178/#p1185\">\n    650 F.3d 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1185 (8th Cir. 2011) (finding that a plaintiff must \"prove the threat of future injury\" in order to receive injunctive relief under the MUTPA). Similarly, under the GDTPA, the only available remedy is injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ga.

And under the California UCL, the only remedies available are injunctive relief, restitution, and civil penalties, but not monetary damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Forty Niner Truck Plaza, Inc. v.

Sept. 20, 2011) (\"A claim under [the UCL] is equitable in nature; damages cannot be recovered.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   3M argues that Plaintiffs have not sufficiently pleaded these claims. Plaintiffs argue that 3M's position is premature and that whether a likelihood of future harm exists is properly addressed at summary judgment. In addition, Plaintiffs maintain that ongoing future harm from Lava Ultimate and 3M's alleged misrepresentations is likely. Plaintiffs suggest that possible injunctive relief includes an order: (1) requiring 3M to acknowledge that Lava Ultimate was inherently defective; (2) preventing 3M from reintroducing Lava Ultimate for crown sales; and (3) ordering 3M to correct prior misrepresentations. In addition, Plaintiffs claim that 3M could reintroduce Lava Ultimate back into the market for crown use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The allegations in the Amended Complaint demonstrate that 3M sent a letter to dentists stating that it was removing the crown indication for Lava Ultimate before this lawsuit was filed and that the FDA classified this letter as a \"Class II recall.\" (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 96-97.) As a Class II medical device, Plaintiffs recognize that Lava Ultimate is subject to FDA regulations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 72, 97.) Thus, 3M maintains that even if it wanted to renew Lava Ultimate's crown indication, it would need to comply with FDA regulations. And significantly, now that Plaintiffs are aware of the alleged defects in Lava Ultimate and 3M's alleged misrepresentations, they cannot show that they are likely to be deceived by such representations in the future.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Indep. Glass Ass'n, Inc. v. Safelite Grp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , Civ.

Nov. 16, 2005) (explaining that where plaintiff was aware of deceptive trade practices, he was likely to be vigilant in the future, making injunctive relief inappropriate). The Court concludes that based on the allegations in the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs cannot make a plausible showing of a likelihood of future harm.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Four D., Inc. v.

Breach of Implied Warranty Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiffs allege a claim for breach of implied warranty under the laws of Minnesota, California, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, New Mexico, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and Washington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Warranty Disclaimer\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   3M argues that this claim fails as a matter of law because 3M disclaimed any implied warranties for Lava Ultimate products. The law and analysis regarding the disclaimer of implied warranties is similar\n   under the relevant states' laws. The parties refer to Minnesota law in their discussions of whether 3M validly disclaimed all implied warranties. Under Minnesota law, a seller may disclaim implied warranties.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20336.2-316\">\n    Minn. Stat. \u00a7 336.2-316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . To make such a disclaimer, the seller must do so conspicuously and in writing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Minn.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20336.2-316\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   3M argues that its 10-Year Limited Warranty conspicuously presents a disclaimer in the section titled\n   <strong>\n    \"Limited Warranty and Limited Remedy\"\n   </strong>\n   which states \"3M ... makes no other warranties including, but not limited to, any implied warranty of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose.\" (Wildung Decl. \u00b6 2, Ex. A (emphasis in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   As an initial matter, Plaintiffs submit that the 10-Year Limited Warranty (and any warranty disclaimer contained therein) is not explicitly referenced in, attached to, or necessarily embraced by the Amended Complaint. Plaintiffs argue that the Court should refuse to consider any such warranty at this stage because it constitutes extrinsic evidence that has been raised by 3M solely to discredit or contradict the allegations in the Amended Complaint. Plaintiffs further submit that the Court cannot consider the 10-Year Limited Warranty without converting the present motion to one for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court disagrees. Instead, the Court concludes that it may properly consider the warranty because it is necessarily embraced by and referenced in the Amended Complaint. The Amended Complaint cites to numerous documents that expressly reference a 10-Year Limited Warranty. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 76 n.3, 78, 80 n.8, 85 n.12.) In addition, the Amended Complaint alleges that 3M \"made its representations ... in the instructions for use\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74), and 3M submits that every version of Lava Ultimate product instructions contained both the 10-Year Limited Warranty and the warranty disclaimer. (Wildung Decl. \u00b6 3, Ex. B.) Moreover, the Amended Complaint expressly alleges that 3M \"provided an\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   express warranty against fracturing,\" implying that there was an operative express warranty. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 160 n.16 (emphasis added).) It is entirely proper for the Court to consider the 10-Year Limited Warranty (and warranty disclaimer) without converting the motion to one for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dittmer Props., L.P. v.

The Court agrees and declines to dismiss Plaintiffs' breach of implied warranty claims at this early stage of litigation. The Court requires a more complete record of the foundational facts surrounding the content and distribution of any warranty disclaimer, such as background facts on the creation of the language in the disclaimer (when the language was created), any changes made to the language over time, the documents on which the disclaimer was printed, whether there were different versions of the disclaimer being used, as well as the circumstances surrounding the disclaimer's communication to Plaintiffs. Should the evidence bear out that the 10-Year Limited Warranty 3M submitted contained a disclaimer that was communicated\n   conspicuously and in writing to each Plaintiff in the form detailed above, it is possible, if not likely, that Plaintiffs' implied warranty claims will not survive summary judgment.

First, the law on the issue of a third-party beneficiary exception to the privity rule is not entirely clear, and Plaintiffs have identified cases that appear to support such an exception.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re MyFord Touch Consumer Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6889913\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/46/936/#p984\">\n    46 F.Supp.3d 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 984 (N.D.

Finally, considering that this case is still in the early stages of litigation and the factual record is not developed, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have alleged sufficient facts to support these claims. Thus, the Court declines to dismiss Plaintiffs' breach-of-implied warranty claims under California, Florida, Georgia, Minnesota, New York, and Tennessee law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Unjust Enrichment Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that 3M benefitted unjustly from selling inherently defective Lava Ultimate products, whose value was inflated by 3M's concealment of the debonding defect when used in crowns, and that 3M's enrichment was at the expense of Plaintiffs. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 189-94.) 3M argues that this claim should be dismissed because Plaintiffs have alleged the existence of an express contract (the express warranty). Thus, 3M argues that the contract and any adequate remedies available thereunder preclude recovery under an unjust enrichment theory. In addition, 3M argues that Plaintiffs have not stated how 3M was unjustly enriched.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court denies 3M's motion on this claim. Plaintiffs' unjust enrichment claim is pled in the alternative. This is permitted, even if the claims are inconsistent.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Segelbaum, Inc. v.

Minn. 2009) (explaining that, at the motion to dismiss stage, plaintiff is permitted to pursue alternative theories that would provide remedies at law and equity). In addition, the allegations in the Amended Complaint are sufficient to state a claim for unjust enrichment. The Court will revisit this issue as the case matures and the viability of Plaintiffs' other claims becomes clearer. This reasoning also applies to Plaintiffs' claims for unjust enrichment under each state's laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.

Plaintiffs assert that the GFBPA allows a business, as a consumer, to bring suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   First, the definition of a consumer under the GFBPA is limited to natural persons.

Plaintiffs argue that the scope of \"consumer-oriented\" conduct under the New York Business Law covers a broad array of practices that impact consumers at large. In\n   <em>\n    Mount Sinai\n   </em>\n   , the court held that alleged misrepresentations made by defendant to a medical school and not a \"consumer\" (or patient) could still constitute \"consumer-oriented\" conduct under the General Business Law where the medical school alleged that it transmitted the alleged misrepresentations to its patients.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268362\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/580/#p586\">\n    234 F.Supp.3d at 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   While the cases cited by Plaintiffs demonstrate a broad application of the General Business Law, they also reveal that \"consumer-oriented\" conduct can be demonstrated when an alleged misrepresentation made to a business is repeated to consumers. Here, however, Plaintiffs have not alleged that they repeated any of 3M's alleged misrepresentations to any of their patients. For this reason, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to sufficiently allege \"consumer-oriented\" conduct necessary to state a claim under the New York General Business Law. Therefore, New York Counts I &amp; II are properly dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Washington Consumer Protection Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   To prevail on a Washington Consumer Protection Act claim under Washington law, a plaintiff must demonstrate: (1) unfair or deceptive act or practices; (2) occurring in trade or commerce; (3) public interest impact; (4) injury to plaintiff in her or her business or property; and (5) causation.\n   <em>\n    Hangman Ridge Training Stables, Inc. v.

Specifically, 3M contends that it no longer sells Lava Ultimate for use in crowns and that Plaintiffs' claim is based on past conduct. Plaintiffs argue, on the other hand, that there is a public interest impact here because 3M has failed to acknowledge that Lava Ultimate causes high failure rates and nothing prevents 3M from reintroducing Lava Ultimate into the market for use in crowns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Court finds that the Amended Complaint sufficiently alleges facts to establish that the conduct at issue had an effect on the public interest. \"[A] private dispute can affect the public interest if it is likely that additional plaintiffs have been or will be injured in exactly the same fashion.\"\n   <em>\n    Birkholm v.

Wash. 2006). Here, Plaintiffs allege a widespread marketing campaign that affected numerous transactions. While there are no allegations that the conduct is likely to be repeated in the future, it is plausible that additional plaintiffs have been injured. Thus, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled this claim. The Court therefore denies 3M's motion to dismiss the Washington Consumer Protection Act claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    VIII.

Instead, the Amended Complaint makes clear that Lava Ultimate blocks were purchased by dental professionals who used a CAD/CAM machine to shape the block and then surgically place the blocks in patients' mouths during certain restorative dental procedures. Plaintiffs do not allege facts that would demonstrate that Lava Ultimate is a consumer product.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Minnesota Breast Implant Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11594082\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/36/863/#p876\">\n    36 F.Supp.2d 863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 876 (D.
