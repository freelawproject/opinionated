In the years since <em>O'Connor</em> was decided, however, a different four-factor test appears to have been more frequently applied by district courts across the country. <em>See</em> 2 <em>McLaughlin on Class Actions</em> \u00a7 11:11 (14th ed.). That test, which is based in part on factors identified by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Dowling v. Am. Haw.

Application</strong></p><p id=\"p-18\">Regardless of the precise formulation of the test to be applied, the internal review at issue here is the type of evaluation that the self-critical analysis privilege seeks to protect.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Partrederiet's internal investigation was completed after the accident occurred, and the purpose was to pinpoint the root causes of the accident and to identify corresponding corrective actions and preventative measures that Partrederiet can take to avoid future incidents. Further, Partrederiet asserts that its investigation was required by an international treaty, the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea 1974. In addition, Partrederiet represents that it has disclosed all the objective information and facts generated by its investigation, such as data from the BW GDF SUEZ BOSTON's Voyage Data Recorder, and has withheld only the self-analysis portions of its investigative report.</p><p id=\"p-19\">Several cases have recognized that the rationale for applying the self-critical analysis privilege is especially compelling where a post-accident safety review is concerned. For example, the court in <em>Granger</em> considered whether the privilege should apply to an internal post-accident review prepared by an investigation committee after an Amtrak electrician was injured at a maintenance facility. <em>Granger</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7857664\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/116/507/#p509\">116 F.R.D. at 508</extracted-citation>. The court determined that the sections of the report titled \"Accident Analysis\" and \"Committee Recommendations\" were protected by the self-critical analysis privilege, because \"one of the primary purposes of the doctrine is to prevent a chilling effect on self-analysis and self-evaluation prepared for the purpose of protecting the public by instituting practices <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"163\" href=\"#p163\" id=\"p163\">*163</a>assuring safer operations.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"7857664\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/116/507/#p509\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"7857664\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/116/507/#p509\"> at 510</extracted-citation>. The court explained that \"[t]here is no question that the public has an interest in the institution of practices assuring safer operations of railroads,\" and reasoned that the \"production of these portions of the report would tend to hamper honest, candid self-evaluation geared toward the prevention of future accidents.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"7857664\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/116/507/#p509\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> Later, in <em>Dowling</em>, the Ninth Circuit quoted from <em>Granger</em> and noted that \"[w]e do not disagree with this analysis.\" <em>Dowling</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515281\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/971/423/#p426\">971 F.2d at 427</extracted-citation>. The court drew a distinction, however, between <em>Dowling</em>, which involved a voluntary, routine safety review conducted by a cruise ship operator, and a post-incident investigation, explaining that \"the difference between pre-accident safety reviews and post-accident investigations is an important one,\" since the \"candid analysis of the causes of [a particular] accident[ ] is more likely to be stifled by a disclosure requirement than would the routine review of safety concerns.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515281\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/971/423/#p426\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515281\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/971/423/#p426\"> at 425-27</extracted-citation>. The court also noted that the Federal Rules of Evidence \"bar only evidence of <em>subsequent</em> remedial measures to prove negligence,\" based on the social policy rationale \"of encouraging people to take, or at least not discouraging them from taking, steps in furtherance of added safety.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515281\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/971/423/#p426\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> at 427 (citing Fed. R. Evid. 407 and quoting advisory committee note). Along the same lines, a federal court in Pennsylvania determined that a post-accident report generated by the Navy was also protected from disclosure by the privilege. <em>See</em> <em>In re Petition of McAllister Towing &amp; Transp. Co.</em>, No. 02-cv-858, <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%201240667\">2004 WL 1240667</extracted-citation>, at *1 (E.D. Pa. May 7, 2004) (explaining that \"the entire goal of the [internal] investigative process is to promote safety and to eliminate the possibility of a similar accident occurring in the future,\" which is \"the basis for the [self-critical analysis] privilege, in the first place,\" and noting that the \"privilege is based upon the concern that disclosure of documents reflecting candid self-examination will deter or suppress socially useful investigations and evaluations or compliance with the law or with professional standards\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) ). Accordingly, the self-critical analysis privilege should apply to the evaluation at issue here.</p><p id=\"p-20\">Block Island Fishing argues that Partrederiet has not demonstrated that it will suffer actual harm from disclosing the investigative report. As discussed <em>supra</em>, however, the problem that the self-critical analysis privilege is meant to address is the disincentive against conducting future safety reviews if such material were required to be disclosed, rather than any immediate harm that the company would suffer from disclosing the report in this specific instance. Block Island Fishing also contends that, because Partrederiet is legally required to conduct post-accident evaluations, disclosure of the report will not prevent Partrederiet from performing similar evaluations in the future. The fact that Partrederiet must continue to conduct these reviews, however, does not necessarily mean that it will have the incentive to be particularly thorough or candid in those evaluations. As the court in <em>Webb</em> recognized, the self-critical analysis privilege enhances compliance even where a report is legally required, because a company \"must be encouraged to be candid and forthright in assessing\" the practices at issue. <em>Webb</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5720778\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/81/431/#p434\">81 F.R.D. at </extracted-citation>433 ; <em>see also</em> <em>O'Connor</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5723996\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/86/211/#p218\">86 F.R.D. at 217</extracted-citation> (relying on <em>Webb</em> factors, including that report was prepared to satisfy government requirement).</p><p id=\"p-21\">Block Island Fishing also argues that the report should be disclosed because Partrederiet has not demonstrated that it was prepared with the expectation that it would be kept confidential, nor has it indicated that it has actually been kept confidential. <em>See</em> <em>Dowling</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10515281\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/971/423/#p426\">971 F.2d at 426</extracted-citation> <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"164\" href=\"#p164\" id=\"p164\">*164</a>(recognizing \"general proviso\" that \"no document will be accorded a privilege unless it was prepared with the expectation that it would be kept confidential, and has in fact been kept confidential\"). The Court agrees that Partrederiet must demonstrate it has satisfied this requirement, so it shall file a status report within ten days of this order explaining whether the report was prepared with the expectation of confidentiality and whether it has been kept confidential. Given that the law concerning the self-critical analysis privilege is not well-established, the Court will not require Partrederiet to divulge the report merely because its initial brief does not make clear whether the report meets this requirement.</p><p id=\"p-22\">Lastly, Block Island Fishing asserts that Partrederiet's invocation of the privilege is overbroad because Partrederiet has not disclosed documentation concerning the specific facts and materials that were considered in the post-accident review. The Court agrees that Partrederiet must turn over these components of its report and allow its Rule 30(b)(6) deponent to testify about all facts and observations considered in the investigation. <em>See</em> <em>Granger</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7857664\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/116/507/#p509\">116 F.R.D. at 510</extracted-citation> (holding that portions of report titled \"Cause\" and \"Contributing Factors\" were discoverable). In addition, Block Island Fishing asserts that the privilege should only apply to the deposition testimony of Helge Drange, Partrederiet's designated Rule 30(b)(6) deponent, and should not preclude Block Island Fishing from seeking the testimony of other deponents concerning topics such as the cause of the accident. The Court agrees that this limitation is appropriate. <em>See</em> <em>Hoffman v. United Telecomm., Inc.</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7856290\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/117/440/#p442\">117 F.R.D. 440</extracted-citation>, 442-43 (D. Kan. 1987) (holding that self-critical analysis privilege did not prevent plaintiff from seeking testimony concerning witness's personal opinion). Thus, Block Island Fishing may ask questions concerning the deponents' personal opinions or observations about the accident, but may not request information about the evaluative portions of the report at issue.</p><p id=\"p-23\"><strong>C. Conclusion</strong></p><p id=\"p-24\">Accordingly, Partrederiet's Motion for a Protective Order [ECF No. 56] is <em>GRANTED</em>, subject to the limitations set forth in this order. Partrederiet shall file a status report within ten days.</p><p id=\"p-25\"><strong>SO ORDERED.</strong></p><p id=\"p-28\">Some courts have interpreted a 1990 Supreme Court decision as casting doubt on the viability of the self-critical analysis privilege. <em>See</em> <em>Univ. of Pennsylvania v. EEOC</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330834\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/493/182/#p188\">493 U.S. 182</extracted-citation>, 188-89, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330834\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/493/182/#p188\">110 S.Ct. 577</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330834\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/493/182/#p188\">107 L.Ed.2d 571</extracted-citation> (1990). In that case, the court refused to recognize a peer-review privilege that would have protected materials concerning a university's tenure decisions where the EEOC was investigating charges of gender and racial discrimination. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330834\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/493/182/#p188\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330834\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/493/182/#p188\"> at 185, 189</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11330834\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/493/182/#p188\">110 S.Ct. 577</extracted-citation>. Some courts have described <em>Pennsylvania</em> as \"implicitly reject[ing] the rationale for a self-evaluation privilege\" because both privileges are based on the \"assertion that candid appraisals of organizational management and personnel practices will be hindered to the detriment of the public interest if such information is subject to disclosure in litigation.\" <em>Roberts v. Hunt</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"823246\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/187/71/#p75\">187 F.R.D. 71</extracted-citation>, 75 (W.D.N.Y. 1999). The self-critical analysis privilege, however, is ordinarily only recognized where protecting an organization's self-analysis could further a specific, important public policy goal, such as implementing affirmative action programs or improving safety procedures. Thus, it is not apparent that <em>Pennsylvania</em> completely forecloses the existence of the privilege. <em>See</em> <em>Abbott v. Harris Publ'ns</em>, No. 97-cv-7648 (JSM), <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%20549002\">1999 WL 549002</extracted-citation>, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. July 28, 1999) (explaining that, post-<em>Pennsylvania</em>, the party seeking to invoke the self-critical analysis privilege \"bears a heavy burden of establishing that public policy strongly favors the type of [internal] review at issue and that disclosure in the course of discovery will have a substantial chilling effect on the willingness of parties to engage in such [internal] reviews\").</p><p id=\"p-29\">The U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia employs yet another test: \"(1) the document must be a critique submitted as part of a mandatory government report; and (2) the document must have been prepared retrospectively as a component of a post-accident evaluation.\" <em>Felder</em>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4289342\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/153/221/#p224\">153 F.Supp.3d at 225</extracted-citation>.
