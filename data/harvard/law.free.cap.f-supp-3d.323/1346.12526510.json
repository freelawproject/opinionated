DuBOSE, CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The age-old question of how many people does it take to change a light bulb has reached federal court. The matter is currently before the undersigned on Defendant's motion for summary judgment. (Doc. 52-54). Defendant contends it only takes one Second Engineer to change a light bulb. Plaintiff asserts, for the first time in his response, that assigning less than two people is proof that the Chief Engineer of the vessel was negligent under the Jones Act. Moreover, Plaintiff alleges that the ship was unseaworthy because he was not provided with the \"safe, proper working and operational illumination\" he needed to change the light bulb and because Defendant failed to warn him of the threshold in the doorway to the Tech Library. Upon consideration, and for the reasons set forth herein, the motion for summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Factual and procedural background\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff Kwasi Boafo Manu has been a seafarer since 1972. On October 20, 2014, he signed aboard the USNS Gordon as the vessel's Second Assistant Engineer. A Second Engineer is responsible for maintenance of the vessel. Typically, \"Plaintiff received his assignments from the First Engineer or the Chief Engineer every morning.\" (Doc. 58, Plaintiff's response, p. 1) On the morning of January 4, 2015, the vessel was in port at reduced operational status. The Chief Engineer assigned Plaintiff to relamp the vessel,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , check light fixtures for proper operation and replace burned out light bulbs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Relamping is one of Plaintiff's regular duties.\" (Doc. 58, p. 2). \"When relamping is done during the regular work week there are 2 people assigned\n   to the task together.\" (Id.) \"Because it was Sunday and three of the engineering crew members were off duty, [the Chief Engineer] assigned Plaintiff to carry out the task alone.\" (Id.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"After receiving his assignment from the Chief Engineer, Plaintiff gathered a ladder, fluorescent light bulbs, and his tool bag and began going from room to room on the vessel checking to see if the lights needed replacing.\" (Doc. 58, p. 2) \"Plaintiff ultimately ended up in the tech library which is on a different level from where he attained the ladder, bulbs, and tool box.\" (Id.) \"Plaintiff knew that there was a bulb out in the tech library so he didn't have to check to see if that worked.\" (Id.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"When he reached the tech library, he immediately attempted to walk through the door with a ladder over his shoulder, his tool bag in his hand and the bulbs in his other hand.\" (Doc. 58, p. 2). \"As Plaintiff entered the tech library he tripped over the raised threshold at the door[.]\" (Id.) \"While [Plaintiff] was aware of the raised threshold, he tripped because his attention was directed at entering the narrow door with a ladder, tool box and bulbs and therefore he wasn't looking at the threshold.\" (Id.) Plaintiff knew the raised threshold was there as well as other thresholds throughout the ship. (Doc. 53, p. 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiff testified that he tripped and fell on his shoulder because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The illumination was only from the alley, and my back was facing the alley. So, the Tech Library was a little bit darker. That was one factor. Then I was carrying a ladder and a bag and a bulb at the same time, so I had to concentrate - - - my attention was divided. You know, when you have a ladder in the alley, you don't want to knock - - I was concentrating on that one also. That was when I tripped and fell on my shoulder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (Doc. 53, p. 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff testified that there was no reason he did not take the ladder, bag, and tools into the Tech Library one at a time (Doc. 53, p. 6). He was not in a hurry and did not have a timeline (Id., p. 8). With respect to darkness, Plaintiff testified that he had a headlamp, but did not use it (Id., p. 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Chief Engineer testified that lamping rounds do not customarily require two seamen. (Doc. 53, p. 8). He also testified that changing the light bulbs in the accommodation area, where the Tech Library is located, does not require a crewman to ascend more than one or two rungs on a ladder. Therefore, he did not consider this to be a two-crewman task. (Doc. 59, p. 5)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On March 31, 2015, after several medical examinations, Plaintiff was ultimately diagnosed with a torn rotator cuff and a broken bone. He had surgery to repair the injury. On February 5, 2016, one year later, Plaintiff's treating physician released\n   him to return to work without restrictions. Plaintiff was found fit for duty without restrictions following his March 15, 2016 and March 6, 2017 physical examinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 16, 2016, Plaintiff filed a three-count Complaint against the United States alleging (1) Jones Act negligence; (2) unseaworthiness; and (3) unpaid maintenance and cure benefits, all arising from the trip and fall accident (doc. 1).

Plaintiff also alleges that Defendant failed to warn him about the raised threshold in the doorway to the Tech Library, which was concealed and hidden because of the dark and improperly illuminated environment.

Well-Come Holdings, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3550753\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/1221/#p1227\">\n    710 F.3d 1221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1227-28 (11th Cir. 2013) (\"This court's precedent foreclosed Well-Come's attempt to amend its complaint at the summary judgment stage without seeking leave of court pursuant to Rule 15(a)(2).\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Second, Plaintiff was not injured while changing a lightbulb. Plaintiff was injured because he tripped over a threshold. Arguably, if two crew members had been assigned to the task, the load may have been shared. However, that does not alter the fact that Plaintiff did not see the necessity of taking items into the room one at a time. In\n   <em>\n    Harrison v. Seariver Maritime, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20Fed.%20Appx.%20119\">\n    61 Fed.Appx. 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2003) (unpublished opinion), the circuit court found that carrying hoses \"was routine and certainly not hazardous; moving shipboard equipment is a common and expected physical task.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=61%20Fed.%20Appx.%20119\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2003%20WL%20342266\">\n    2003 WL 342266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5.

Plaintiff has not established a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendant was negligent, thus Defendant is entitled to summary judgment as to Plaintiff's claim for Jones Act negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Count II - Unseaworthiness\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   With respect to unseaworthiness, Plaintiff alleges in his complaint that under the General Maritime Law, Defendant owes a duty to provide a safe and seaworthy vessel. Plaintiff alleges that Defendant violated this duty by failing to provide safe, operational and properly working illumination in the Tech Library and by failing to warn him about the raised threshold in the doorway to the Tech Library, which was concealed and hidden because of improperly illuminated conditions. (Doc. 1). Plaintiff argues that this unseaworthy condition caused him to trip and fall while carrying the ladder, light bulb, and tool bag over the threshold.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"Under general maritime law, a shipowner has an absolute duty to furnish a seaworthy ship.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

In\n   <em>\n    Haughton v. Blackships, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the circuit court explained \"that 'a seaman is not absolutely entitled to a deck that is not slippery.

Ala. 2010) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant argues that it is entitled to summary judgment because Plaintiff cannot show that his injury was caused by the alleged lack of operational illumination in the Tech Library or the alleged failure to warn Plaintiff about the threshold in the entryway. Defendant argues that Plaintiff's own unseamanlike method of work - \"his decision to enter a dim room without using a flashlight and while leaving himself no hand with which to break or prevent his fall\" - caused his injury. (Doc. 53, p. 26). Defendant points out that relamping was part of Plaintiff's duties as an engineer and that he knew of the non-operational illumination in the Tech Library. Defendant also points out that Plaintiff was aware of the threshold in the Tech Library as well as other thresholds throughout the ship, and that he had a headlamp but did not use it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendant also argues that the \"Primary Duty Doctrine\" bars Plaintiff's recovery for Jones Act negligence. Defendant argues that the doctrine, as applied in this circuit, denies recovery where a ship's officer, with actual knowledge of an unsafe condition that the officer is assigned to correct as part of his customary job duties, is injured by that unsafe condition. Defendant argues that Plaintiff, the Second Engineer charged with the duty to relamp the vessel, knew the light was burned out in the Tech Library and thus knew of the alleged unsafe condition - dim lighting - that he was assigned to correct, and thus cannot recover for his injury from tripping over the dimly lighted threshold. Defendant also argues that Plaintiff's decision to carry the ladder, tool bag and light bulbs, all at one time, without leaving one hand free to himself for safety, precludes recovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Plaintiff responds that the doctrine has no application in a Jones Act case because of \u00a7 54 of the Federal Employees Liability Act (FELA). Alternatively, Plaintiff argues that even if the doctrine applies, it applies only when a plaintiff's injuries result solely from the plaintiff's own negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Plaintiff cites to\n   <em>\n    Louisiana &amp; Arkansas Ry. Co. v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"537196\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/214/290/#p292\">\n    214 F.2d 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 292 (5th Cir. 1954) for his argument that the Primary Duty Doctrine has no application. In that FELA action, the Fifth Circuit rejected the doctrine as obsolete. However, the Eleventh Circuit has not rejected the doctrine. Instead, it has limited the application to circumstances where there was misconduct or actual knowledge of an unsafe condition on the part of a ship's officer, and that unsafe condition caused the injury. In\n   <em>\n    Villers Seafood Co., Inc. v. Vest\n   </em>\n   , the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, held that the doctrine applies only to ship officers who are charged with the duty to maintain the vessel. The circuit court found as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   Vest did testify that it was his duty to keep the vessel in repair, and some courts have denied recovery under the \"Walker doctrine\" which states that a ship's officer whose breach of duty to maintain a safe ship has caused his injury by an unseaworthy ship or appliance may not recover damages for his injuries. However, in each of the cases in which the court has denied recovery the\n   injured officer actually knew of the existence of the unseaworthy condition before the accident. We are unwilling to extend the doctrine to a case in which no misconduct or actual knowledge of the existence of an unseaworthy condition has been proven.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1689753\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/813/339/#p342\">\n    813 F.2d 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 342-343 (11th Cir. 1987).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Assuming for purposes of this opinion only, that the non-operational light bulb could be an \"unseaworthy condition\", there is no dispute of fact that Plaintiff, as a Second Engineer, is an officer charged with the duty to maintain,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , relamp, the vessel. There is no dispute that he \"actually knew of the existence\" of the non-operational light bulb,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1689753\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/813/339/#p342\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   and that he knew that the lighting was dim in the Tech Library before he stepped over the threshold. (Doc. 58, p. 2, Doc. 53, p. 5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff also admitted that there was no reason he did not carry the ladder, light bulb and bag over the threshold one at a time. (Doc. 54-2, p. 22, Manu deposition). These undisputed facts establish that the Primary Duty Doctrine applies, and therefore, Defendant is entitled to summary judgment in its favor as to Plaintiff's claim of unseaworthiness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff also argues, for the first time in his response, that the duty to provide a seaworthy vessel \"includes the owner's obligation to provide a sufficient number of crew members to safely perform a task\" and that a fact finder could conclude that the Chief Engineer's failure to assign two crew members to carry the necessary items for the relamping task, rendered the vessel unseaworthy. (Doc. 58, p. 4, p. 6) He also argues that if Defendant had performed a Job Safety Analysis, it would have known that two crewmembers were required to change the light bulb, and it is likely that the Chief Engineer would not have assigned Plaintiff to perform the task alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiff's new bases for his unseaworthiness claim fail as untimely. However, Plaintiff has also not shown a genuine issue of material fact as to the unseaworthiness of the vessel. He must show that an unseaworthy condition, which may include assigning an insufficient number of workers to perform a task,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Michel v. Jade Marine, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%205382255\">\n    2008 WL 5382255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *3-4 (E.D. La. Dec. 22, 2008), played a substantial part in causing the injury or the injury was a direct result or reasonably probable consequence of this unseaworthiness. Plaintiff relies upon his conclusory speculation that a Job Safety Analysis would have shown that two crew members were necessary to perform this task. However, Defendant points out that Chief Engineer's testimony that relamping in the Tech Library, where the ceiling is seven feet high, does not require a crew member to ascend more than one or two rungs on a ladder and is not considered a two-crew member task. (Doc. 59, p. 4, p. 38). This evidence was unrefuted. Since Plaintiff has failed to show a genuine issue of fact as to the unseaworthiness of the vessel, summary judgment is due to be granted in Defendant's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Count III - Maintenance and Cure\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiff did not address Defendant's argument that summary judgment should be granted in its favor as to Plaintiff's claim for maintenance and cure (doc. 58, response).
