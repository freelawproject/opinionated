Hale, Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Deeann Sanders initiated a late-night encounter with police officers at the scene of her husband's DUI arrest, which was very near her home in Hodgenville, Kentucky. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 1-2) A police car dashcam recorded the incident, and police later released the video to the media. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) Sanders sued the City of Hodgenville and former Hodgenville Chief of Police Steven Johnson, alleging violations of state law and seeking relief under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for violations of her constitutional rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendants have moved for summary judgment, arguing that there are no genuine issues of material fact remaining. (D.N. 35) The Court agrees. Because Sanders has not established that Defendants violated her constitutional rights, her \u00a7 1983 claim fails as a matter of law. The Court will therefore grant in part Defendants' motion for summary judgment and decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Sanders's remaining state-law claims pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 29, 2014, Sanders's husband Sam Sanders was driving to his residence after watching a basketball game at his father-in-law's house. (D.N. 46, PageID # 487) At the time, Sam Sanders served as the superintendent of the school system of LaRue County, Kentucky, in which Hodgenville is located. Within yards of his residence, Hodgenville Police Officer James Richardson pulled over Sam Sanders on suspicion of driving under the influence. (D.N. 1-2, PageID # 7) The stop occurred on a public roadway. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.N. 35-3) A second officer arrived at the scene, and after conducting field-sobriety tests, the officers placed Sam Sanders under arrest. (D.N. 35-6) At some point, the dashboard camera in Richardson's squad car began recording.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Shortly thereafter, Deeann Sanders arrived at the scene. Sanders wore a white housecoat that rested slightly above knee level, a nightgown underneath, and tennis shoes. (D.N. 46, PageID # 495) The arresting officers later described Sanders as \"upset ... and condescending\" during the encounter. (D.N. 35-6, PageID # 162;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   D.N. 35-5) The dashboard camera in Richardson's car captured the entire interaction with Deeann Sanders. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.N. 35-7)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Thereafter, Richardson drove Sam Sanders to the police station for booking procedures. (D.N. 35-6, PageID # 162)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Meanwhile, Deeann Sanders went to the home of Terry Cruse, Hodgenville's mayor at the time. (D.N. 35-9, PageID # 175) Cruse, who was asleep, awoke to the sound of \"someone beating on [his] back door.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 175) When he opened the door, he found Deeann Sanders, who asked him \"to personally go down to tell the police officers to let her husband go.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Cruse declined. Sanders then arrived at the police station, asked to speak with her husband, and eventually called the LaRue County District Court Judge to inform him of the evening's events. (D.N. 46, PageID # 511, 514) Richardson activated his body camera during the incident. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.N. 35-11) The video shows Deeann Sanders repeatedly knocking on the station's door and interrupting the officers during booking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The next day, Madonna Hornback, who then served as Hodgenville's City Clerk, allegedly received several media requests for the dashcam recording that captured Sam Sanders's arrest. (D.N. 35-14, PageID # 214) She referred the media to Hodgenville Chief of Police Steven Johnson and wrongly informed Johnson that the city must comply with the requests in light of Kentucky's Open-Records Act, Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 61.870\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thereafter, Johnson raised the matter with Mayor Cruse, who told Johnson \"to comply with the open records laws just as he would with anyone else and to handle it.\" (D.N. 35-9, PageID # 176) Johnson then invited the media to view the recording and allowed one cameraman to film the video as it played on a television monitor. Media outlets eventually aired the dashcam video on broadcast television.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.N. 1-2, PageID # 8)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In fact, Johnson may have violated state law by releasing the video. An exception to the Open-Records Act, \u00a7 189A.100(2)(e), provides that video recordings of DUI arrests \"shall be used for official purposes only.\" Any public official or employee who fails to comply with \u00a7 189A.100 \"shall be guilty of official misconduct in the first degree.\" Ky. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 189A.100(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In light of \u00a7 189A.100, Sam and Deeann Sanders reported Johnson's actions to the Kentucky State Police. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.N. 35-16) The Commonwealth eventually charged Johnson with official misconduct in the first and second degree for his release to the media of the dashcam recording. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.N. 35-17) A LaRue County jury acquitted Johnson of all charges. (D.N. 35-14, PageID # 225)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Thereafter, Deeann Sanders brought this action against the City of Hodgenville and Johnson. (D.N. 1-2) Sanders contends that Defendants violated various state laws as well as her constitutional rights by releasing the recording to the media. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Specifically, she claims that the release of the recording caused her \"great humiliation, embarrassment, mental anguish, mental and emotional pain and suffering, and damages to her reputation and character.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , PageID # 8) Defendants have moved for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (D.N. 35)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

However, as a threshold matter, to properly assert a \u00a7 1983 claim \"[a] plaintiff must allege the violation of a right secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and must show that the alleged deprivation was committed by a person acting under color of state law.\"\n   <em>\n    West v.

Here, a significant aspect of Sanders's position is that the recording at issue was the subject of media inquiries. Thus, Sanders must show that Defendants have refused similar media inquiries in the past. Although the record does indicate that Defendants had previously never released recordings of a DUI arrest (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D.N. 35-14), Sanders does not contend that Defendants have withheld such recordings in the face of media inquiries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Wells v.

The court reasoned that because the video contained not only the plaintiff's private sexual conduct but also his alleged criminal act in trading sexual favors for a reduction in legal fees, and because the videotape would eventually be made public through its use at the plaintiff's criminal trial, the plaintiff had failed to show that the defendants violated his right to privacy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9214237\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/327/863/#p879\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The recording here contained not only Sanders's interaction with the arresting officers but also evidence of Sam Sanders's criminal act.

Sanders's \u00a7 1983 claim is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   (2) Sanders's remaining state-law claims are\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED\n   </strong>\n   to LaRue County Circuit Court in accordance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   (3) This matter is\n   <strong>\n    DISMISSED\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    STRICKEN\n   </strong>\n   from the Court's docket.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Throughout her pleadings, Sanders insinuates that there are material issues of fact regarding whether the media cited the open-records law during their inquiries to the city and whether it was in fact Cruse, Hornback, or Johnson who contacted the media in the first place. (\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , D.N. 44, PageID # 300-03) Neither question is dispositive to the Court's eventual conclusion, however. First, regardless of whether the media actually cited Kentucky's open records law in their requests, the evidence indicates that the city officials believed, albeit wrongfully, that the law was at issue. Sanders does not challenge Hornback's contention that she told Johnson that the media's requests were covered by the Open-Records Act. Nor does Sanders challenge Mayor Cruse's claim that he told Johnson to comply with the media requests pursuant to the Open-Records Act. Finally, Sanders provides no affirmative proof to show that any of the public officials contacted the media first.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    The Court has omitted certain background information that Sanders provided concerning corruption among LaRue County public officials, which is unnecessary to the Court's analysis. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    D.N. 44, PageID # 304-05)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    If anything, the cited testimony from Johnson's peer officers indicates that he did not release the recording in bad faith. Although the officers contend that the release was a \"bad idea\" and generally against best practices (D.N. 35-14, PageID #190-191, 203), none of the officers insinuate that Johnson released the recording maliciously.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    In support of her \u00a7 1983 failure-to-train claim, Sanders states in her complaint that \"Defendant Johnson has admitted under oath that he was unaware of the law prohibiting the wrongful release of police video recordings.\" (D.N. 1-2, PageID # 10). Ultimately, Sanders cannot have it both ways. She may not in one instance cite this evidence to support her overarching failure-to-train claim while elsewhere insinuating that the release was done in bad faith.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    In a footnote in her response brief, Sanders moves to strike Johnson's answer and proffered defenses in this case for his refusal to sit for a deposition. (D.N. 44, PageID # 302) The Court declines to consider a \"motion\" made in a footnote, particularly one seeking such a remedy.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
