BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   George Littlefield was an early and prominent benefactor to the University of Texas (\"the University\"). He served in Terry's Texas Rangers during the Civil War and believed that Confederate history should be preserved and celebrated so that \"future generations would remember those grand patriots who gave up their lives for the cause of liberty and self-government.\" To that end, he commissioned a sculptor to create statues of Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee, Albert Sidney Johnston, John Reagan, James Hogg, and President Woodrow Wilson \"during a period of resurgent white Southern nostalgia for the social order of the old South embodied by the Confederacy.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Littlefield's will provided a bequest to the University to establish the Littlefield Fund for Southern History and another fund to erect the commissioned statues \"in places of prominence\" on campus. The statues were installed along the main mall of the University's Austin, Texas campus in the 1930s.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2015, University President Gregory L. Fenves (\"Fenves\") formed a taskforce with students, faculty, and alumni \"to study the artistic, social, political intent, and historical context\" of the statues, to \"review the past and present controversies over the statues,\" and to \"develop[ ] alternatives for the for the relocation of the statues.\" The taskforce suggested several solutions, including relocating the statues to the Briscoe Center for American History to be displayed in full historical context with one of the largest collections of resources on American slavery in the country as well as in full artistic context alongside the papers of Littlefield and the sculptor of the statues. After a white supremacist shot and killed nine individuals at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, Fenves accepted the recommendation of the task force and announced his decision to move the Jefferson Davis and Woodrow Wilson statues. David Bray and Texas Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans filed suit in state court the next day seeking a permanent injunction to prevent Fenves from removing the statues. The suit was based on state-law claims similar to those brought by the current plaintiffs. The state court denied the motion for an injunction on the basis that the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring the claims. The Texas Sixth Court of Appeals affirmed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bray v. Fenves\n   </em>\n   , No. 06-15-75-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203083539\">\n    2016 WL 3083539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex. App.-Texarkana 2016, pet. denied). The Wilson and Davis statues were subsequently removed, but the other Confederate statues remained on the mall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2017, Fenves caused the removal of the Robert E. Lee, Albert Sidney Johnston, John Reagan, and James Hogg statues from the main mall, after a neo-Nazi killed a young woman who was counter-protesting a white-supremacist demonstration in Charlottesville, Virginia. Fenves determined that \"Confederate monuments have become symbols of modem white supremacy and neo-Nazism.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs David McMahon, Steven Littlefield, and Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed this suit\n   against Fenves on August 23, 2017. McMahon filed his First Amended Complaint, Application for Injunctive Relief, &amp; Motion for Declaratory Judgment on September 20, 2017 (Dkt. No. 7).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties agreed that the University would maintain the\n   <em>\n    status quo\n   </em>\n   until the court ruled on the motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   McMahon and Littlefield are both descendants of Confederate veterans, and Littlefield is a descendant of George Littlefield. McMahon claims that the University's removal of the statues and impending obscuration of the plinths of the statues violates his right to free speech under the First Amendment. In \"abridging the political speech of the monument,\" McMahon claims that the University abridged his own right to hold a dissenting political viewpoint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans (the \"Sons\") seek to \"protect the memory of our beloved Confederate Veterans,\" including \"memorials, images, symbols, monuments and gravesites.\" The Sons also claim a First Amendment injury on behalf of its members because its members \"dissenting political viewpoint [ ] was communicated by the Littlefield statues.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Invoking the supplemental jurisdiction of this court, McMahon brings several additional state-law claims, including breach of the bequest agreement between Littlefield and the University, violation of Texas Government Code Section 2166.501 and .5011, and violation of the Board of Regents' authority over the University campus. Fenves moved to dismiss for lack of standing and for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Put simply, McMahon argues that the University engaged in viewpoint discrimination against his dissenting viewpoint-that which celebrates the Confederate legacy-when the University removed the Confederate statues from its grounds. Because McMahon shares this dissenting viewpoint, he believes that the University's removal of the statues amounts to viewpoint discrimination against him personally. When standing is contested, the appropriate inquiry is whether the interest is cognizable in the abstract, and then, whether such interest is concrete and particularly felt by those bringing suit; if the interest alleged is both cognizable and particularly felt it is an injury in fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    504 U.S. at 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p560\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he injury in fact test requires more than an injury to a cognizable interest.

McMahon and Littlefield seek to do just that. McMahon and Littlefield may be more deeply attached to the values embodied by the Confederate monuments than the average student rushing to class on the mall, but their identities as descendants of Confederate veterans do not transform an abstract ideological interest in preserving the Confederate legacy into a particularized injury. The alleged free-speech injury of McMahon and Littlefield, while perhaps cognizable in the abstract, is not an\n   <em>\n    injury in fact.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   McMahon also relies on several cases for the proposition that alleging a First Amendment violation is all that is needed to confer standing. McMahon's reliance on these cases is misplaced. The Court did not express an opinion on the parties' standing to sue-only on the merits of their First Amendment claims. In fact, none of the cases cited by McMahon discussed standing. Nonetheless, these cases illustrate the same principles as\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   : an injury to a cognizable First Amendment interest must be concrete and particularly felt by the plaintiff bringing suit. In each of the cases relied on by McMahon, the interest was the right to free speech; however, that interest was still particular to each of the plaintiffs bringing suit because the government acted directly against the plaintiffs,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , in denying a license, denying a grant or funding, and denying the opportunity to erect a new statue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

The court takes no position on whether the Sons' alleged injury finds support in First Amendment case law or would ultimately be successful on the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steel Co. v.
