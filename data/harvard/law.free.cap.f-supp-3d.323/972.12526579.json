Some commenters argue that as long as the notice is on the first page and is apparent to a reasonable consumer, the Commission should not further define what will be considered \"clear and conspicuous.\" Others urge the Commission to provide specific guidance to ensure consumers are aware of their opt-out rights and sending parties have standards by which they can comply with the law. We are persuaded that rules specifying the font type, size and wording of the notice might interfere with fax senders' ability to design notices that serve their customers. However, we make some additional determinations about the opt-out notice so that facsimile recipients have the information necessary to avoid future unwanted faxes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   26. Consistent with the definition in our truth-in-billing rules, \"clear and conspicuous\" for purposes of the opt-out notice means a notice that would be apparent to a reasonable consumer. We also conclude that the notice must be separate from the advertising copy or other disclosures and placed at either the top or bottom of the fax. Many facsimile advertisements today contain text covering the entire sheet of paper, making it difficult to see an opt-out notice that is placed amongst the advertising material. Thus, the notice must be distinguishable from the advertising material through, for example, use of bolding, italics, different font, or the like. We clarify that, in accordance with the Junk Fax Prevention Act, if there are several pages to the fax, the first page of the advertisement must contain the opt-out notice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    In the Matter of Rules &amp; Regulations\n   </em>\n   , 21 F.C.C.R. at 3801 (footnotes omitted).

On the faxes at issue here, copies of which have been provided to the Court, the Opt-Out\n   Notice appearing on the first page, the only page on which Amedisys was mandated to place the notice, utilized a smaller, and therefore different, font than was used for the advertisement text, which is what the FCC requires. In arguing that the type was\n   <em>\n    too\n   </em>\n   small to support a judgment for Amedisys, Plaintiff cites to a TILA case from the Seventh Circuit,\n   <em>\n    Lifanda v. Elmhurst Dodge, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11164327\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/237/803/\">\n    237 F.3d 803\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2001), in which the court found that the defendant was not entitled to judgment because a disclosure was \"set forth in the smallest type on the form, which is so minuscule as to be barely legible.\"\n   <em>\n    Lifanda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11164327\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/237/803/\">\n    237 F.3d at 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court articulated that \"[a]lthough the district court notes that TILA does not mandate any minimum type size, it simply does not follow that type size is irrelevant to a determination of whether a disclosure is 'conspicuous.' If the term 'conspicuous' is to retain any meaning at all, it cannot be met as a matter of law by type disproportionately small to that in the rest of the document, and which is itself barely legible.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11164327\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/237/803/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, there has been no showing in this case, nor does it appear to the Court, that the font used in the Opt-Out Notice was \"minuscule\" or \"barely legible.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11164327\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/237/803/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds, as a matter of law, that the Notice was clear and conspicuous for purposes of the TCPA. The Defendant's motion for summary judgment on that issue is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Did the Notice Set Forth the Requirements of an Opt-Out Request Pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 227(b)(2)(D)(iii) and 227(b)(2)(E) ?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Advanced Rehab argues Amedisys has not shown as a matter of law that it fully complied with all the requirements of \u00a7 227(b)(2)(E), as it must under \u00a7 227(b)(2)(D)(iii). Plaintiff concedes that the Notice adequately set forth the first requirement, found in subparagraph (E)(i), that a request for opt-out identify the telephone and/or fax machine numbers to which the request applies. With respect to subparagraph (E)(ii), however, Plaintiff submits that it was not enough to advise the recipient that requests were to be made to a particular telephone or fax number. Rather, it had to state that calling these numbers was the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   way to request an opt-out,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that the request is compliant\n   <em>\n    only if\n   </em>\n   the stated methods are used.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(E)(ii).

The court rejected as \"an unpersuasive game of semantics\" plaintiff's assertion that the notice failed to inform recipients that an opt-out request must be in a specific form, as the notice made clear that a request would not be honored unless it was sent to the defendant through one of the enumerated options.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As previously noted herein, the FCC has made it\n   clear that no specific wording is required.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In the Matter of Rules &amp; Regulations\n   </em>\n   , 21 F.C.C.R. at 3801. The Court is unpersuaded by the Plaintiff's position. Accordingly, summary judgment with respect to subparagraph (E)(ii) is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Subparagraph (E)(iii) is another matter. Amedisys has proffered no argument as to whether the Notice satisfied this subparagraph.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ,\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Court is unable to determine if relief is appropriate. The motion for summary judgment based on this subparagraph is, therefore, DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Did the Notice Comply with \u00a7 227(d)(1)(B) ?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff claims that the Opt-Out Notice failed to comport with \u00a7 227(d)(1)(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Advanced Rehab submits that, as \u00a7 227(b)(2)(D) provides that the\n   <em>\n    notice\n   </em>\n   , as opposed to the transmission in general, complies with the Act only if the requirements of subparagraph (d) are satisfied, the information required by the subparagraph must be contained in the notice itself. Because the \u00a7 227(d)(1)(B) information here appeared at the top of the page and the Notice was placed at the bottom, the argument goes, Amedisys has failed to establish the\n   <em>\n    notice\n   </em>\n   was sufficient as a matter of law. Once again, the nonmovant cites to no case authority to support its assertion. However, the Defendant offers little in the way of substantive argument in support of summary judgment. Accordingly, based on the dearth of briefing on this subject by either party, the Court is uninclined to grant summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   For the reasons articulated herein, the Defendant's motion for summary judgment is DENIED as to the issues involving\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(E)(iii) and (d)(1)(B) and is GRANTED as to the remainder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED this 15th day of August 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Contemporaneously with its initial complaint filed August 4, 2017, the Plaintiff filed a \"placeholder\" motion for class certification.
