The town wants it down. The sponsor wants it up. Both sides invoke the First Amendment and both have moved for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    STATEMENT\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Since 1971, a twenty-foot electrically-illuminated steel and plexiglass Latin cross has stood atop Albany Hill, the prominent knoll near the intersection of Interstates 80 and 580. At the time of its erection, the 1.1 acres hosting the cross belonged to Hubert and Ruth Call (who lived in Albany but not on the 1.1 acres). They allowed The Lions Club of Albany, California, a non-profit corporation, to erect the cross and to illuminate it (and the Lions Club proceeded to illuminate it every Christmas and Easter season up to the present) (Dkt. Nos. 43 at 10, 44, Exh. TTT). Hubert Call was then a member of both the Lions Club and Albany City Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   All would have remained well for the cross but for a multi-party real estate deal by which defendant The City of Albany acquired title to the 1.1 acres along with adjacent parcels in exchange for approving a high-rise project nearby. The details remain important, so this order will lay them out.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Developer Interstate General Corporation (IGC) sought to develop high-rise condominiums on its real property located along the western slope and base of Albany Hill. In April 1972, IGC asked the City for permission for the development. The City saw opportunity and replied that it wanted an \"overlook\" park on Albany Hill. In May 1972, the Albany City Council passed an ordinance requiring a Council-issued use permit before any building or structure could proceed on Albany Hill. IGC's land and the Call's land (including the cross) fell within this restriction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In July 1972, IGC applied to the Council for a use permit. In October 1972, the City proposed conditions for issuing the requested\n   use permit, including requiring IGC to deed the City two hilltop acres for parkland use. After a series of negotiations, IGC eventually proposed a so-called \"$600,000 plan\"-a complex multi-party agreement involving, among others, IGC (and its affiliates), the City, and the Calls. Under this plan, IGC offered to allocate $600,000 of its own money to purchase additional private property for the City's desired Overlook Park (now Albany Hill Park)-including the Calls' 1.1 acres at the summit of Albany Hill-and to convey it to the City. In November 1972, the Council issued IGC's use permit and accepted IGC's proposed $600,000 plan (Dkt. No. 44, Exh. TTT).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Pursuant thereto, IGC offered to pay the Calls $258,000 for title to their 1.1-acre parcel \"free of liens, encumbrances, easements ... and conditions of record ... other than exceptions of record.\" 38 Cal. 3d at 641,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=214%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20139\">\n    214 Cal.Rptr. 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=699%20P.2d%20316\">\n    699 P.2d 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   IGC and the Calls eventually reached an agreement whereby the Calls deposited two grant deeds into escrow-a grant deed conveying the Call parcel to an IGC affiliate and another grant deed conveying to the Lions Club an \"easement for ingress and egress to maintain the existing cross standing\" on the Call parcel. Before closing escrow, Call insisted upon burdening the parcel with the easement and would sell only on the condition that the cross would remain with an easement for access. The developer went along and deposited in escrow a grant deed conveying the Call parcel to the City. That deed did not indicate that title to the Call parcel was subject to the easement (but it did not have to for the easement to be effective).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   38 Cal. 3d at 642 n.10,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=214%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20139\">\n    214 Cal.Rptr. 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=699%20P.2d%20316\">\n    699 P.2d 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The City followed by depositing the building permit in escrow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the instant case, the City suggests that it was not actually aware of the easement but concedes that it was on at least constructive notice (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 72). When escrow closed, the easement deed to the Lions Club was recorded before the grant deed to the City. 198 Cal.Rptr. at 330. The City thus acquired the Call parcel subject to the Lions Club's easement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Taxpayers subsequently filed a suit challenging the City's land acquisition, alleging that Hubert Call's role as city council member at the time of the transaction created a conflict of interest. The taxpayer suit itself raised no easement or Establishment Clause problem. The City, the Calls, various council members, and IGC (and its affiliates) became named defendants. The suit became known as the\n   <em>\n    Thomson\n   </em>\n   litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 1978, the Alameda County Superior Court found that although the transaction was non-fraudulent and although Call had abstained in the approval process, Call nevertheless had a proscribed financial interest under California's Government Code Section 1090 in the agreement between IGC and the City. The Superior Court ordered the Calls to pay the City the full\n   $258,000 amount (plus interest) received by the Calls for the parcel and denied relief as to the other defendants (Dkt. No. 44, Exh. TTT).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Establishment Clause became part of that litigation, ironically, at the behest of the Calls.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   198 Cal.Rptr. at 336. They argued that the City's acceptance of the deed to the land burdened by the easement protecting the cross violated the Establishment Clause. The trial court, however, held that the City's acceptance of the Call parcel was consistent with the Establishment Clause because of the acquisition's secular purpose (namely, \"to provide additional park land to the City\"), it neither advanced nor inhibited religion, and it did not constitute excessive governmental entanglement with religion (Dkt. No. 44, Exh. TTT).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On appeal, the Calls challenged their liability and the taxpayers appealed the denied relief as to the corporate defendants. The California Court of Appeal affirmed the lower court's holding that the agreement between IGC and the City was void due to Call's proscribed financial interest in the contract under Section 1090. (This had nothing to do with the easement.)\n   <em>\n    Thomson v.

The California Court of Appeal noted the potential constitutional infirmities presented by the cross, stating that \"the cross and the easement present problems requiring consideration,\" including \"some of the constitutional proscriptions cited by the Calls.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=198%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20320\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It, however, refused to let the Calls escape the consequences of Section 1090\"by reason of problems of their own making.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=198%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20320\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The cross and easement did not affect the invalidation of the contract between IGC and the City.

Moreover, the California Court of Appeal held that IGC breached its contract with the City by allowing the land to be burdened with the easement and reversed,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , the trial court's \"narrow view\" of the pleadings, which it believed led the trial court to let IGC \"escape liability to the City.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=198%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20320\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=198%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20320\">\n    at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The California Court of Appeal left undisturbed the trial court's finding that the City's acquisition of the Call parcel was valid because it had the secular purpose of public park use.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=198%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20320\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=198%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20320\">\n    at 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

These separate comments took for granted the validity of the easement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   So, the litigation ended, and Albany Hill Park took shape as municipal undeveloped space with tall eucalyptus trees bisected by a walking trail with a large cross near the summit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Decades passed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Every Christmas and Easter season, the Lions Club turned on the switch to illuminate the cross, visible all the way to the East Bay Hills. Those enjoying the park could hardly miss the cross, it being next to the trail and being the park's largest structure (actually the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   structure other than gates, benches, signs, and a rope swing).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In 2015, East Bay Atheists began criticizing the cross. In 2016, municipal officials had PG &amp; E shut down power to the cross for 106 days. The City claims the shutdown came as a result of legitimate safety issues and fire hazards. The Lions Club claims it came as part of a harassment campaign to force the cross off the hill (Dkt. Nos. 44 at 11-14, 46 at 9-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In September 2017, the Lions Club commenced this civil action against the City and five city officials in their individual and official capacities, alleging a conspiracy between defendants and the East Bay Atheists. The Lions Club alleges the conspiracy began in November 2015 when the City began raising allegedly bogus safety concerns about the electrical wire connected to the disputed cross (Dkt. Nos. 1, 43 at 11, 47 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In November 2017, the City and five city officials counterclaimed against The Lions Club of Albany (and its affiliates).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The gravamen of the City's claims focuses on\n   the invalidity and unenforceability of the Lions Club's easement under the United States and California Constitutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Lions Club now moves for summary judgment both on their claims and against the counterclaims.

Here, the easement's terms were solely between the Calls and the Lions Club.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   This order assumes for the sake of argument that the purpose of the easement was to require subsequent owners to honor the cross, including public owners. Nevertheless, the City, which was on at least constructive notice of the easement, could have simply refused to close the deal. As was observed in the\n   <em>\n    Thomson\n   </em>\n   litigation, \"[h]ad the City refused to accept the Call Parcel in performance of the $600,000 Plan, IGC would have retained said real property under its ownership\" (Dkt. No. 44, Exh. TTT).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   While the City portrays itself as a victim of the easement, the fact is that the City must bear responsibility. To repeat, the City could have rejected the deal, burdened as it was by the easement. The First Amendment ran against the City, not the private parties. Once the City accepted title and began converting the land into a public park, it then could have solved its Establishment Clause problem by condemning the easement (and paying its value) under its power of eminent domain, selling off, if feasible, a subdivided parcel containing the cross to a private party (and keeping the rest for a park), or by possibly imposing zoning restrictions against all religious displays on public land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Ultimately, the City cites no First Amendment authority for the idea that an otherwise\n   <em>\n    valid\n   </em>\n   easement simply goes limp the moment the land goes into the City's ownership. That theory would turn the\n   <em>\n    Thomson\n   </em>\n   litigation on its head-the easement issues addressed by the trial court all the way to the California Supreme Court could have been easily waved away had the easement problem been as simply avoided\n   as by a theory of unenforceability upon public ownership.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    2. THE PUBLIC PARK WITH THE CROSS VIOLATES THE ESTABLISHMENT CLAUSE.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   To repeat, the Establishment Clause runs against public entities, not private parties. After the City acquired the land burdened with the cross and turned it into a public park, the City also acquired an Establishment Clause problem and should have solved it by condemning the easement via its power of eminent domain, selling off a parcel with the cross to a private party, or enacting a valid zoning ordinance.

This overtly religious symbol, which stands alone, is prominent in the park itself and remains visible, through clearings in the trees, far beyond the parkland's immediate vicinity (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 43, Exh. A). The cross stands close by the only public trail through the park and close by park benches, all of which remains reachable on foot within a couple of minutes from the parking lot. The cross is illuminated during Easter and Christmas seasons. And, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Buono\n   </em>\n   , the cross has never been a war memorial. It is solely a religious symbol (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 43 at 11, 60, Exh. Z).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Lions Club argues decisions such as\n   <em>\n    Buono\n   </em>\n   do not govern because they do not apply to private actors. The Lions Club, not the City, built and maintains the cross, it says. And, the easement, the Lions Club argues, is no weaker a property right than a fee simple-had the cross been on a small parcel titled to the Lions Club, there would, it says, have been no constitutional issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Buono\n   </em>\n   acknowledged that the conduct there at issue originally derived from private citizens.\n   <em>\n    Buono\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9228915\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/371/543/\">\n    371 F.3d at 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The mere fact that private conduct is involved does not preclude Establishment Clause concerns once the land arrives in public hands. And, to the extent that the Establishment Clause and\n   <em>\n    Buono\n   </em>\n   (in which the cross was eventually deeded to the City) require government action to apply, such government action is plainly present in the instant case. Here, the City owns and uses as a public park land burdened by an easement perpetuating the religious symbol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The relevant inquiry for evaluating the primary effect of the City's parkland burdened with the easement and the cross is whether a \"reasonable observer\" would\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    perceive\n   </em>\n   governmental endorsement of religion.\n   <footnotemark xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em case-ids=\"9228915\" https:=\"\" index=\"64\" xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.L&lt;extracted-citation url=\">\n    ibr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\"&gt;See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9228915\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/371/543/\">\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9228915\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/371/543/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9228915\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/371/543/\">\n    at 549-50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, a reasonable observer would perceive-knowing \"the history and context of the community and forum in which\" the cross appears-an impermissible endorsement. The reasonable observer would be aware that the cross stands on city parkland, it celebrates Christian holy days, and the City has supported this religious activity for decades (\n   <em xmlns=\"http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HLS.Libr.US_Case_Law.Schema.Case_Body:v1\">\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt.

But it is not on a separate parcel. The\n   cross stands on public land. The easement is not a separate parcel, much less a separate coherent parcel.

As such,\n   <em>\n    Thomson\n   </em>\n   analyzed the cross and easement mainly in terms of how they affected land value and prejudiced the suitability of the land for use as a public park. The constitutional issue arose as a gimmick by the Calls to escape the consequences of the conflict of interest-a ploy the courts disfavored.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The California Supreme Court, moreover, did not review the trial court's constitutional findings in affirming the trial court decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 644. For that matter, the trial court's constitutional findings merely blessed the City's \"\n   <em>\n    accepting the deed\n   </em>\n   to the Call Parcel\" (Dkt. No. 44, Exh. TTT) (emphasis added). Here, by contrast, the issue is, once the City accepted the land, and once the City turned it into a public park with the cross, did the City thereby violate the Establishment Clause?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The California Court of Appeal recognized this distinction, stating that \"the constitutional problems presented by the cross and the easement pertain only to ... its use as a public park in the future. They do not reach the trial court's determinations ... which were to the effect that the\n   <em>\n    acquisition\n   </em>\n   of the land by the City was valid\" and that \"[t]he existence of the cross and the easement does not affect the determination that the contract between ICG and the City was void.\"\n   <em>\n    Thomson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=198%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20320\">\n    198 Cal.Rptr. at 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It went further, stating that \"the easement actually protects the location and existence of the cross, and that the land is consequently\n   <em>\n    unsuitable for use as a municipal park\n   </em>\n   because of the constitutional proscriptions which preclude the display of a religious symbol on public property.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=198%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20320\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=198%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20320\">\n    at 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Justice Mosk in his separate opinion echoed this distinction, stating that the \"perpetual religious symbol rendered the property legally\n   <em>\n    unsuitable for park\n   </em>\n   or other public purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    Thomson\n   </em>\n   , 38 Cal. 3d at 654,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=214%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20139\">\n    214 Cal.Rptr. 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=699%20P.2d%20316\">\n    699 P.2d 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985) (emphasis added). In other words, it was common ground among all concerned in\n   <em>\n    Thomson\n   </em>\n   that the easement was alive and well and its main effect on the deal was to render the land unsuitable for use as a public park and/or to diminish the value of the land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Nevertheless, in the face of these warnings, the City, having accepted the raw land, proceeded to do exactly what was said to be unsuitable-namely, converting the land for use as a public park.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In sum, while the\n   <em>\n    Thomson\n   </em>\n   litigation conflicts with the City's unenforceability theory and while the trial court found that the City could accept the deed without violating the Establishment Clause, that litigation also recognized that downstream (\"in the future\") the land would be \"unsuitable\" for use as a public park by reason of the cross. The instant order, with the benefit of the downstream record, agrees that the land cannot continue as a public park with the cross on it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    3. THE CITY MUST REMEDY ITS FIRST AMENDMENT VIOLATION.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   To remedy the Establishment Clause violation, the City has at least two options-either sell a parcel containing the cross to a private party or condemn the easement through its power of eminent domain. Possibly, a third option would be to adopt a zoning ordinance banning all religious symbols from its public places.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   If the City chooses to sell to a private party, it must do so at fair market value and it must do so in a manner that avoids other forms of Establishment Clause violations. The subdivision must be a coherent, separate parcel in such a manner that the public may recognize that the cross no longer stands on public land. If the City condemns the easement, it would have to pay the Lions Club just compensation, as determined by fair market value by a jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In the procedural context of this case, however, there is actually no party adverse to the municipal defendant seeking to pursue any of these avenues against the City. This order has reached this juncture only to explain why the City is wrong in its argument that the easement somehow became lifeless upon title flowing into public hands. Before the Court would entertain any motion to compel the City to deal with its Establishment Clause problem, a plaintiff with standing would need to move to intervene (and would need to do so promptly). At that point, the specifics of any remedial plan could be vetted to avoid yet further constitutional problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    4. QUESTIONS OF FACTS REMAIN REGARDING THE EXTENT\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    , IF AT ALL , THE CITY VIOLATED THE LIONS CLUB'S RIGHTS.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Meanwhile, the fact is that the cross has stood on Albany Hill for almost half a century and, even though the City should not have built its park around it, the cross has been a fact of life. The City should not have interfered (if it did) with the Lions Club's easement and/or religious observances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Whether or not the City violated the Lions Club's free speech, free exercise, equal protection, and/or due process rights and/or interfered with the Lions Club's easement implicate heavily disputed facts. The City argues that it cut off electric power to the cross because it presented a safety hazard. The Lions Club argues that the City's safety concerns reek of pretext and that the scheme received ratification by the City's policymakers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Genuine disputes of material facts exist. The Lions Club's motion for summary judgment on its free speech, free exercise, equal protection, due process, and interference with easement claims are thus\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . A jury will have to decide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    5. MISCELLANEOUS CLAIMS.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    A. California Takings Clause.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The Lions Club claims that the City violated the California Takings Clause by disconnecting the electricity to the cross. Article I, Section 19 of the California Constitution provides that \"[p]rivate property may be taken or damaged for public use only when just compensation ... has first been paid to ... the owner.\" This provision \"never was intended, and never has been interpreted, to impose a constitutional obligation upon the government to pay 'just compensation' whenever a governmental employee commits an act that causes loss of private property.\"\n   <em>\n    Customer Co. v. City of Sacramento\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1992337\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/10/368/#p378\">\n    10 Cal. 4th 368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 378,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20658\">\n    41 Cal.Rptr.2d 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=895%20P.2d%20900\">\n    895 P.2d 900\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995). Without property taken or damaged for \"public use,\" the Lions Club is not entitled to just compensation under the California Constitution. The Lions Club's motion for summary judgment on the California Takings Clause claim is thus\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Quiet Title.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The City seeks to quiet title on the ground that the Lions Club's easement was \"granted for the improper, illegal and unconstitutional purpose of displaying a religious symbol on public property\" and is thus invalid (Dkt. No. 46 at 15). This order holds that the Lions Club's easement is valid (but that the City is obligated to condemn the easement or otherwise solve its Establishment Clause problem). The Lions Club's motion for summary judgment in its favor on the quiet title claim is thus\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Trespass.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The City argues that the presence of the cross in its park constitutes trespass. \"The essence of the cause of action for trespass is an 'unauthorized entry' onto the land of another.

The Lions Club's motion for summary judgment in its favor on the trespass claim is thus\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Nuisance.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The City bases its private nuisance claim on \"the unconstitutional condition perpetuated by\" the cross's ongoing presence and the City's \"seeming endorsement\" of \"Christianity above other religions and above no religion\" (Dkt. No. 47 at 9-10). It bases its public nuisance claim on the cross's unconstitutional condition, which is allegedly \"offensive to many members of the community,\" conveys the appearance of government religious preference, alienates certain community members, and \"interferes with the use and enjoyment\" of the park (Dkt. No. 46 at 17). The Lions Club counters that its cross is a \"beloved symbol of Albany Hill\" and causes no interference with the use and enjoyment of the public park (Dkt. No. 44 at 19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   We must remember that the Constitution runs against governmental entities, not private parties, and that the City, not the Lions Club, is the one who is violating the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The City cites decisions involving, for example, theaters and bookstores exhibiting obscene materials (\n   <em>\n    People ex rel.
