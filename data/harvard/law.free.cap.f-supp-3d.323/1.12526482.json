The record contains conflicting evidence on that score. As noted, Dr. Nelson recommended a new evaluation. On the other hand, Latisha Chisholm, an expert in special education programming and placement and an expert in social work who taught S.H., testified that upon classification of S.H. as a student with emotional disturbance on February 6, 2015, no additional psychological testing was warranted to confirm that diagnosis. AR 555-57, 559, 574. It is not the province of the court to re-weigh this competing evidence. That is best done by the hearing officer, who heard all the testimony. Thus, this court cannot make the affirmative finding that Plaintiff seeks and, at most, would remand this matter for the hearing officer to take account of Dr. Nelson's opinion.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       <em>\n        Reid ex rel.

But that testimony is simply too generic to be of much probative value in determining whether a new evaluation would have translated into actual educational opportunities for S.H. Plaintiff's counsel appeared to concede as much at the hearing.

Based on the evaluation she conducted in August 2017, which Defendant had authorized the prior month, AR 259-60, Dr. Nelson diagnosed S.H. as suffering from ADHD and \"emotional disturbance,\" which she described to be an \"impulsivity disorder,\" AR 418;\n       <em>\n        see also\n       </em>\n       AR 268 (specifying DSM-V diagnosis as \"Unspecified Disruptive, Impulse Control Disorder\" and \"Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder\"). She testified that S.H. is \"a young person who is not in class to make progress because of his emotional disability and because of his ADHD.\" AR 422. But S.H.'s prior psychological assessment in 2011 had recognized S.H. as having ADHD, and S.H.'s triennial evaluators understood that condition, AR 48, 82, 85.\n       <footnotemark>\n        3\n       </footnotemark>\n       And, in connection\n      with S.H.'s triennial assessment in February 2015, S.H.'s evaluators classified him as having \"ED\"-emotional disturbance-without conducting a psychological examination.

Thus, new psychological testing would not have alerted S.H.'s triennial evaluators to a different diagnosis. Additionally, Defendant did conduct some new assessments in connection with the triennial evaluation to provide an updated picture of S.H.'s educational needs. In December 2014, Defendant prepared a new Functional Behavior Assessment. AR 50-53. That Assessment, which included an interview of S.H., described him as \"oppositional-defiant, disruptive, and easily distracted resulting in multiple suspensions,\" AR 50, and recommended the development of a \"[B]ehavior [I]ntervention [P]lan,\" AR 53. That Behavior Intervention Plan was completed on February 6, 2015, and offered a host of strategies to address S.H.'s \"targeted behaviors,\" including \"mood instability,\" \"emotional disengagement,\" \"irritability,\" \"distractibility,\" and \"defiance.\" AR 80. These are the same types of behaviors that Dr. Nelson identified in her psychological assessment. AR 261-70; 418-19. In short, there is good reason why Plaintiff has not cited any different information that a comprehensive psychological examination would have supplied about S.H. in February 2015: there appears to be none.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-17\">\n       In sum, even if Defendant did commit a procedural violation by not ordering a new comprehensive psychological examination, Plaintiff has offered no reason to believe that such an error abridged S.H.'s substantive rights under the IDEA. A remand therefore is unwarranted, and the court will grant judgment on Count I in favor of Defendant.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-19\">\n       Plaintiff's second claim is a variant on her first. As noted, Defendant authorized a private psychological assessment of S.H. in July 2017, which Dr. Nelson completed in early August 2017. Plaintiff contends that Defendant's \"failure to reevaluate for over two years is a substantive denial of FAPE because that delay denies parents their substantive right to monitor a child's progress on an IEP through continual evaluations.\" Compl. \u00b6 54. In other words, Plaintiff argues that the continued failure to psychologically reassess S.H. in the years\n       <em>\n        after\n       </em>\n       the triennial assessment constitutes a separate, actionable denial of a FAPE.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       Mem. of P. &amp; A. in Supp. of Pl.'s Opp'n to Def.'s Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. &amp; Reply to Def.'s Opp'n, ECF No. 13, at 9 (\"To be clear ..., this claim originates from DCPS's action and inaction in conducting a triennial evaluation for S.H. in February 2015.... Ms. Hart's claim, however, does not end at that time. Each day that DCPS failed to perform a necessary component of S.H.'s triennial evaluation, DCPS continued its ongoing violation of the IDEA.\").\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-20\">\n       Plaintiff's claim is an odd one. If the court had found, as to Count I, that the failure to test S.H. anew in February 2015 constituted a substantive violation of the IDEA, then that finding would hold true not just for the February 2015 IEP, but in all likelihood for the following years, too, because S.H.'s future IEPs also would not have been informed by a current psychological evaluation. But, in that event, a separate claim for a \"continuing violation\" under Count II would be duplicative of Count I.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-21\">\n       But given the court's ruling on Count I that Defendant did not violate the IDEA in February 2015 by not administering a new psychological assessment, that ruling also\n      resolves Count II-there can be no \"continuing violation\" if no violation occurred in the first place. In short, not having violated the IDEA in 2015, Defendant did not violate it thereafter. To be sure, as discussed, a failure to perform a statutorily-mandated or needed assessment can rise to a substantive violation of the IDEA.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       <em>\n        Z.B.\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516708\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/515/#p523\">\n        888 F.3d at\n       </extracted-citation>\n       525 ;\n       <em>\n        James\n       </em>\n       , 194 F.Supp.3d at 143-44. For example, in\n       <em>\n        James\n       </em>\n       , a case decided by this court and upon which Plaintiff heavily relies, the student's school had completely failed to implement two years' worth of IEPs, and when the student's mother made multiple requests for a comprehensive psychological evaluation, DCPS admitted that it was required to conduct one, but failed to carry it out.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       194 F.Supp.3d at 141-43. In such circumstances, \"[t]he failure to conduct a new comprehensive psychological evaluation\" of the student meant that her \"IEP might not be sufficiently tailored to her special and evolving needs.\"\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       at 144. But here there is no reason to believe that additional testing would have substantively affected the educational opportunities afforded to S.H. Plaintiff identifies no deficiency in her son's IEPs; nor does she identify any changed circumstances from the last comprehensive psychological evaluation, except excessive absences. Evaluators were well-aware of S.H.'s attendance problem, however, and addressed it in the February 2015 IEP and Behavior Intervention Plan. AR 82, 85, 89, 91 (addressing S.H.'s chronic absence from class). The record contains no evidence to suggest that the evaluators would have \"learned anything more or different\" from a comprehensive psychological evaluation, resulting in a \"substantively different\" IEP in 2016 or 2017.\n       <em>\n        Z.B.\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516708\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/515/#p523\">\n        888 F.3d at 525\n       </extracted-citation>\n       .\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-22\">\n       Therefore, the court will enter judgment in favor of Defendant on Count II.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-24\">\n       For the foregoing reasons, the court grants Defendant's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment and denies Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment. A separate final, appealable Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n      </p>\n     </p>\n    </div>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
