Although the juvenile record and the arrest history of the petitioner were readily obtainable, petitioner's trial counsel admitted that he failed to investigate or inquire into these facts. Deficient of this knowledge, trial counsel advised petitioner that \"his worst case sentencing scenario would likely be around 17 \u00bd years.\" Resp't Ex. 119 at 3. On another occasion counsel told petitioner that \"a sentence of ... over 20 years is really unrealistic. Don't even put that in your mind.\" Resp't Ex. 127 at 75. Based on this advice, petitioner refused to accept an initial plea offer of 200 months and later refused to negotiate a settlement that would have resulted in a prison range of 17 \u00bd to 20 years. Following trial, a presentence report was ordered that reflected a much more serious history of criminal conduct than the minimal criminal background known to trial counsel. Petitioner was sentenced to 396 months in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Petitioner brings this habeas corpus proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , challenging his convictions and sentence for robbery, assault, and attempted murder. Because of his failure to adequately investigate petitioner's criminal history, trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by advising his client that a trial outcome could be no worse than a negotiated settlement. This caused prejudice to the petitioner. Because the PCR court failed recognize the constitutional significance of trial counsel's failure to reasonably investigate petitioner's criminal history prior to advising petitioner about potential outcomes, the decision of the PCR court was an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law.

Based on counsel's deficient advice, petitioner understandably believed that any sentence he received, even if he went to trial and lost, would not be significantly different than the State's offer and \"never\" over 20 years. As a result, petitioner did not possess the information necessary to make an informed decision when he rejected the State's offer and refused further plea negotiations. \"Counsel cannot be not required to accurately predict what the jury or court might find, but he can be required to give the defendant the tools he needs to make an intelligent decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Turner v.

If the report had no impact, respondents maintain that counsel could not have been deficient in failing to obtain this information, particularly when counsel believed petitioner's 33-year sentence to be an aberration, regardless of his criminal history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   It is perplexing that a critical piece of evidence-the presentence investigation report-is not included in the PCR record. At the same time, I do not find it necessary to render a decision. The record reflects that the information contained in the presentence report was detrimental enough for counsel to ask that it be stricken, or alternatively, for an extension of time to obtain mitigation evidence. Tr. at 796 (\"we're going to ask the Court for 30 days so that we can prepare our mitigation package to present to the Court, given the nature of this PSI\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Resp't Ex. 127 at 73-74. The prosecutor also referenced the \"very detailed PSI\" during the sentencing hearing to highlight petitioner's \"checkered\" past and his \"mindset and criminality.\" Tr. at 825-26. The record also reflects that all parties involved, including the settlement judges, believed an appropriate sentence was between 15 and 20 years. Resp't Ex. 128 at 2-3. The fact that a sentence longer than 20 years was not raised until disclosure of the presentence investigation report lends credence to the assertion that the information impacted the sentence petitioner received.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Moreover, the issue is not whether the presentence investigation report convinced the trial judge to impose a 33-year sentence; counsel's deficiency is not dependent on the court's sentencing decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the issue is whether counsel was deficient when he failed to obtain critical sentencing information before advising petitioner that accepting the State's plea offer would not result in a significantly better outcome than exercising his constitutional right to trial. Counsel's uncontroverted testimony establishes that he would have given petitioner different advice had he obtained the information contained in the presentence investigation report. Even if counsel would have never thought a 33-year sentence was realistic, petitioner's concern was not necessarily the \"number\" of years but rather the \"spread\" of years between a negotiated sentence and a sentence after conviction at trial. Resp't Ex. 127 at 65, 77. Counsel testified that had he obtained the presentence information, he would have advised petitioner that the \"spread\" would be much greater.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 76-77. In other words, counsel would have given different and more accurate advice had he thought to obtain petitioner's criminal history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Accordingly, I find that the PCR court unreasonably found no deficiency when counsel failed to obtain critical sentencing information before advising petitioner about the sentencing consequences of rejecting the State's plea offer. Based on counsel's own undisputed testimony, he did not adequately inquire into petitioner's criminal history-even though he \"should have\" and could have done so-and he would rendered different advice if he had thought to obtain this critical information. This Court fails to understand what more is needed to establish deficient performance in these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   With respect to prejudice, the PCR court found that petitioner could not establish prejudice when there was \"no\n   plea offer\" for petitioner to accept and he would not have accepted a plea offer under any circumstances:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   There was never a plea offer made here by the DA. The evidence is that the DA in Mult. Co does not make an offer in Measure 11 cases, but invites the pet to make an offer that he wants the DA to agree to. The DA's Measure 11 committee then has to approve the deal. The trial deputy suggested that an offer of around 20 years would probably be accepted, but the pet was never willing to make an offer in that range. There were several judicial settlement conferences, one part way through trial, but the pet never made an offer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [T]his court does not believe that he was willing to plead at all since he still maintained at trial that he was not the shooter in the first episode and wasn't even there for the second and that the trial judge was trying to railroad an innocent man....The last settlement conference was after the state had presented most of their evidence and the pet knew that all of the victims had testified and id'd him and detailed the robberies and shooting. If pet truly wanted to plead, that would have been a great chance to make a deal before it was too late, and he still didn't and went on to deny all of the charges.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Resp't Ex. 130 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   As petitioner points out, the PCR court mistakenly found that there was no plea offer; the State made a firm offer of 200 months on September 21, 2005, as evidenced by the prosecutor's contemporaneous notes. Resp't Ex. 128 at 2, 4. Respondents concede this point but argue that the PCR court reasonably found that petitioner was determined to go to trial and would not have accepted any plea offer. Respondents emphasize that petitioner unequivocally rejected the 200-month plea offer made on September 21, declined to make an offer in response to the prosecutor's invitation during trial, and told the trial court that he \"don't take no deals.\" Tr. at 886.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Whatever statements petitioner made publicly while in open court, the record reflects he participated in more than one settlement conference and expressed an interest in settlement to his attorney, particularly after his mother encouraged him to settle his case. Resp't Ex. 129 at 28;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Resp't Ex. 127 at 67-68. More importantly, as the PCR court did, respondents fail to recognize that petitioner refused plea negotiations\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   because he relied on counsel's deficient advice that he would receive a functionally similar sentence if convicted at trial. Indeed, the PCR court's finding that petitioner would never have accepted a plea is premised on the misapprehension that petitioner was fully and accurately informed about the consequences of rejecting plea negotiations and nonetheless chose trial. This finding is unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Counsel testified that as trial approached, \"the situation did change\" and petitioner wanted to \"at least see what was out there\" and \"talk to the judge\" about settlement possibilities. Resp't Ex. 127 at 24-25. Counsel further testified that during trial, petitioner was \"looking to [counsel's] thoughts on what a sentence would be after trial and comparing the plea offer to the consequences after trial\" and \"weighing the plea negotiations against the outcome at trial, if there was a conviction even.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13, 64. Counsel stated, \"I told Mr. Crawford that his worst case sentencing scenario would likely be around 17 \u00bd years. I provided this advice to Mr. Crawford at a time when he appeared to me to be seriously entertaining the prosecutor's plea offer.\" Resp't Ex. 119 at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   At that time, counsel's estimated difference-or the \"spread\"-of one to two\n   years between a negotiated sentence and a sentence after conviction by trial was not significant enough for petitioner to waive his right to jury trial; but counsel believed a spread of eight, nine or ten years would have been.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65, 77. According to counsel, petitioner told him, \"But it's not enough incentive... It's not going to be that much worse after trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 64. As counsel explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   another year or two may make all the difference in the world to some people. But it wasn't-the spread wasn't that large. The spread wasn't that large that-he didn't see the advantage in it. A much older person, who only has 15 years left on this earth, 13's a big difference than 15. But Mr. Crawford was relatively young, and there was no large spread between my advice and what the plea offer was.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 65. However, had counsel obtained the presentence investigation information, he would have advised petitioner differently:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   At a minimum, I would have said, you know, \"Hey, look, the judge is going to go consecutive on the Assault II and give you three 90s and then may go higher than that.\"... And ...the spread also would have changed from, \"Look, it's going to be somewhere between 15 and 20 [years],\" to, \"Hey, look, it's going to be three 90s'...It's going to be 21 to 25 [years], instead of 17.\"...I would have said, \"Look, your sentence is going to be higher than I thought previously, potentially higher, and the spread isn't as great as I thought it would be.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   75-77.

Petitioner testified that he relied on counsel's advice, explaining, \"I didn't know nothing about trials and the law at that time, so, I mean, he was telling me I wouldn't get no more than 17 and a half, so I-I went with his advice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29.

(\"No, I would [have] ignored his advice and took the 16-year plea deal.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In other words, petitioner was not inclined to relinquish his constitutional right to trial and accept a plea offer if the outcome would not be significantly more favorable than a conviction at trial.

No evidence of record contradicts petitioner's and counsel's testimony that petitioner would have accepted the State's original plea offer-or at least pursued negotiations during trial-had he known that consecutive sentences were the likely outcome.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   At oral argument, respondents argued that petitioner's in-court statements belied any intent to consider plea negotiations; respondents emphasized petitioner's repeated proclamations of his innocence and his assertion that he takes \"no deals.\" Respondents seek to portray petitioner as an angry, defiant young man whose behavior and personality were such at the time that he would never have entertained a plea bargain. At the same time, petitioner is as easily portrayed as a relatively unsophisticated and immature young man who does not trust the government or the system. But the record is clear on one point-he trusted his attorney. The court is not in a position to analyze outcomes based on isolated statements in the record. I am not a psychologist, but it would not amaze me if the government's portrayal of the petitioner's defiance at sentencing is the same defense mechanism I have seen displayed by young men over the last three decades in the courtroom.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Surprisingly, the evidence that seems most likely to speak to the personality of the petitioner, the presentence investigation prepared by the probation department and a psychological evaluation, were not made part of the PCR record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Ultimately, the presentence investigation report is extraneous to my decision. As explained above, the record makes clear that the information in the report was significant and detrimental to petitioner. Counsel testified that he could have obtained this information prior to trial, and, if he had, he would have advised petitioner that he would likely face consecutive sentences if convicted at trial. Counsel and petitioner testified that, based on counsel's advice, petitioner rejected plea negotiations, proceeded to trial, and received a 33-year sentence-a sentence twice as long as counsel predicted. I find that the uncontested evidence of record demonstrates that petitioner would have accepted the State's plea offer but for counsel's advice, and the PCR court was unreasonable in ruling otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   I recognize that, on federal habeas review, a state court decision \"must be granted a deference and latitude that are not in operation when the case involves review under the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   standard itself.\"\n   <em>\n    Harrington v.

However, in this case, the PCR court failed to apprehend the relevant facts and rejected the sworn and uncontroverted testimony of petitioner and his counsel; under these circumstances, the PCR court's ruling was an unreasonable application of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lafler\n   </em>\n   and deference is not due.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The remaining question is \"what constitutes an appropriate remedy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    Lafler\n   </em>\n   , 566 U.S. at 170,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12188541\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/566/156/#p162\">\n    132 S.Ct. 1376\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Petitioner requests that I \"order the State to reoffer the plea agreement,\" and, if petitioner accepts, \"the State trial court should proceed with the normal process under Oregon law for memorializing a plea agreement on the record and sentencing pursuant to that agreement.\" Pet'r Brief at 25. However, in this case I fail to discern a need for anything more than resentencing. Based on the record, it appears that the \"sole advantage\" petitioner would have received is a lesser sentence of 200 months; nothing suggests that the State offered dismissal of certain counts or a plea involving less serious counts, and the mandatory sentences for the counts of conviction would not \"constrain\" the resentencing of petitioner to concurrent sentences to achieve the 200-month agreement. Accordingly, I find the proper remedy is to remand the case for resentencing in accordance with the State's 200-month plea offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   For the reasons explained above, the Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus (ECF No. 2) is GRANTED.

Resp't Ex. 129 at 57-58. Regardless, counsel's duty to render accurate advice necessarily includes the duty to obtain information pertinent to such advice; in this case, counsel had the duty to obtain factual information relevant to sentencing exposure before advising petitioner whether to accept or reject a plea offer.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Similarly, whether petitioner was prejudiced is not dependent on the trial court's decisions made\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    petitioner rejected all plea offers based on counsel's deficient advice.
