While courts engaged in this inquiry primarily consider \"what the school knew or reasonably should have known of a student's needs at the time\" of an IEP's drafting, \"evidence that post-dates the creation of an IEP is relevant to the inquiry to whatever extent it sheds light on whether the IEP was objectively reasonable at the time it was promulgated.\"\n   <em>\n    Z.B. v.

Specifically, with respect to the May 2016 IEP, the hearing officer found it to be adequate based largely on testimony from D.M.'s first-grade teacher, who recounted that D.M.'s \"academics and behavior improved during the remainder [of school year] 2015-2016.\" AR 13. Such testimony alone, however, is not enough to declare that the May 2016 IEP did not deny D.M. a FAPE. The teacher's observations captured only a two-month snapshot of D.M.'s development: from start of the IEP on May 4, 2016, until the end of the 2015-2016 school year. That is simply too short a time frame in which to evaluate the adequacy of the May 2016 IEP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The hearing officer also should have considered evidence of what happened during the fall of the next school year while the May 2016 IEP remained in effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 106-09 (indicating goals to be achieved by May 3, 2017);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Z.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516708\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/515/#p524\">\n    888 F.3d at 524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . D.M.'s multidisciplinary team acknowledged at that a \"major issue for [D.M. under this IEP] was regression and recoup at the beginning of the next school year,\" AR 101, and D.M. clearly regressed almost immediately upon entering the second grade. For instance, during the first quarter of the second grade, D.M. was deemed to be performing \"significantly below grade level\" in \"reading\" and \"writing &amp; language\" and, after the second quarter, he remained below grade level in both categories. AR 144. Significant behavioral problems also manifested immediately at the start of the 2016-2017 school year. One of his teachers reported that D.M. \"has kicked, punched, and name called his class mates,\" that he \"throws papers, pencils, desks,\" and that he \"engages in these aggressive behaviors on most days.\" AR 165. An independent evaluator confirmed these behaviors during observations of D.M. conducted in early and mid-September.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516708\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/515/#p524\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (describing aggressive behaviors during observations conducted on September 6, 9, and 16, 2016). In the end, the May 2016 IEP cannot be evaluated based solely on D.M.'s progress during an, at most, eight-week period at the end of the first grade. The hearing officer should consider D.M.'s regressive academic performance and behavioral troubles in the fall of 2016 when evaluating whether the May 2016 IEP denied D.M. a FAPE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The hearing officer also did not sufficiently address key evidence with respect to the December 2016 IEP. Defendant agreed in October 2016 to conduct a psychological evaluation for suspected Emotional Disturbance, a different disability classification. AR 177, 205. Yet that evaluation had not been completed by the time evaluators developed the December 2016 IEP. AR 362. When a comprehensive psychological evaluation was finally completed in March 2017, the evaluation found that D.M. \"meets the criteria to be classified under IDEA as Emotionally Disturbed,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   and recommended that he \"most likely should be placed in a therapeutic school that can better meet his needs.\" AR 362, 384-85. But the hearing officer rejected this important evidence without explanation, stating only that he \"was not convinced by the testimony of the witness who recently conducted the evaluation of the student.\" AR 15. Such a terse rejection of expert testimony is at odds with the Circuit's recent guidance that \"[s]ometimes a belatedly obtained professional opinion, for example, may suggest a longstanding problem that a school should have but failed to identify and account for earlier.\"\n   <em>\n    Z.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516708\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/515/#p524\">\n    888 F.3d at 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By not adequately addressing the recent psychological evidence, the hearing officer did not determine \"whether DCPS would have learned anything more or different\" about D.M. with the benefit of such testing and therefore \"failed to establish a reliable baseline of [D.M.'s] current needs against which to evaluate the [December 2016 IEP's] adequacy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516708\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/515/#p524\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516708\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/515/#p524\">\n    at 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
