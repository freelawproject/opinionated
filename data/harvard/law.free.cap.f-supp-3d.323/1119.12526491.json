Having read and considered the papers filed in connection with this matter and being fully informed, the Court hereby GRANTS IN PART and DENIES IN PART the United States' motion, for the reasons stated below. The Court, in its discretion, finds this matter suitable for resolution without oral argument.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 78(b) ; N.D. Cal. Civ.

THE PRIOR ACTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Taxpayer sold shares of stock resulting in a capital gain of $132,521,496 in the 2000 tax year.

To avoid the income tax attendant to such a gain, Taxpayer participated in a tax shelter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. In April 2001, he filed a tax return for the 2000 tax year, wherein he reported capital losses from the tax shelter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Taxpayer died in December 2001.

Thereafter, Defendant signed a series of consent forms (i.e., the Consents) that purported to extend, through December 31, 2006, the deadline for the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") to assess taxes against Taxpayer for the 2000 tax year. Gonzales Decl. \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On December 6, 2006, the IRS issued a notice of deficiency to Defendant, in his capacity as the representative of the Estate, for underpayment of income taxes in the amount of $26,231,835 and an accuracy-related penalty in the amount of $5,246,367. SNOD at US000064. On April 12, 2007, the IRS assessed the aforementioned sums, as well as $13,361,360.50 in interest. Compl. \u00b6 16; Form 4340 at US000003. On or about April 13, 2007, the IRS gave notice of the assessment and made demand for payment.

Defendant, as the personal representative of the Estate, then filed an administrative claim for refund.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The IRS abated the penalty in full because the Estate had complied with the IRS's disclosure initiative regarding abusive tax shelters, but otherwise disallowed the claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. The IRS did not refund the penalty, however, but retained the funds as a setoff against a portion of the interest owed on the additional tax liability for 2000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 2, 2008, Defendant, as personal representative of the Estate, filed suit in this Court for a refund. Dkt. 1, R.A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Among other issues raised by the parties and decided by the Court was whether the IRS had properly credited the refund of the accuracy-related penalty against Taxpayer's unpaid statutory interest. Dkt. 174 at 19-20, R.A. The action was resolved in the United States' favor on summary judgment (\"SJ Order\"),\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , and the Court entered judgment for the United States, Dkt. 175, R.A. The Ninth Circuit affirmed the judgment (\"USCA Memo\"), Dkt. 186, R.A., and the Supreme Court denied a petition for writ of certiorari (\"USSC Order\"), Dkt. 190, R.A.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. THE INSTANT ACTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Although Defendant satisfied the underpayment of income tax and penalty prior to filing the Refund Action, he failed to pay the interest assessed against Taxpayer for tax year 2000. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 14, 18.

The United States asserts that the Refund Action conclusively determined Defendant's tax liability for the 2000 tax year, and thus, the accrual of interest on that tax is automatic. The United States further argues that the Form 4340 establishes that the assessment of interest was proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As discussed above, Defendant argues that the United States is not entitled to summary judgment for the following reasons: (1) it fails to establish the liability of either the Trust or the Estate; (2) its claim is barred by the statute of limitations; (3) it did not give the requisite notice of the assessment of interest; (4) its claim is barred by estoppel; and (5) it cannot rely on the Form 4340 to carry its burden of proving the amount owed.

The supplemental brief fares no better.

His argument is twofold: (1) the Consents may be invalid against the Estate, and thus, failed to extend the statute of limitations; and (2) even if the Consents are valid, the time to assess any tax or interest was extended only through December 31, 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

It is evident that Defendant could have raised the issue of the statute of limitations in that action. In fact, in the refund claim submitted to the IRS prior to the filing of the Refund Action, Defendant argued that \"the statute of limitations for additional assessment had expired as of the date [the SNOD] was issued on December 6, 2006.\" Dkt. 28-1 at 32, R.A. For any of a number of reasons (e.g., because he deemed the argument meritless or because he explicitly relied on the validity of the consents in arguing that his refund claim for 2001 was timely,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 91 at 21-22, R.A.), Defendant later omitted the statute of limitations argument from his complaint.

Noting that interest was not\n   assessed until April 12, 2007, Defendant argues that the assessment was time-barred. Defendant makes two material errors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   First, by operation of sections 6503(a)(1) and 6213(a), the statute of limitations was suspended for 150 days after the SNOD was issued on December 6, 2006.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Shannahan v.

Consequently, the limitation period to assess a tax deficiency did not expire on December 31, 2006, but rather, on May 30, 2007.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11672217\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/47/1128/#p1135\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (explaining that any days remaining in the limitation period continue to run after the suspension period).

The assessment on April 12, 2007 therefore was timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Second, although a tax deficiency must be assessed within three years after a return is filed,\n   <em>\n    interest\n   </em>\n   \"may be assessed and collected at any time during the period within which the tax to which such interest relates may be collected.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%206601\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Field v.

Defendant asserts that the IRS failed to provide the alleged notice. As evidence of this purported failure, Defendant notes that he requested in discovery all notices and assessments sent to Taxpayer. Subject to and without waiving its general objections, the IRS responded that it had already produced responsive documents, identified as: (a) the SNOD; (b) the Form 4340; (c) the SJ Order; (d) the USCA Memo; and (e) the USSC Order. Defendant asserts that, \"[o]bviously, none of these documents include any notice allegedly sent ... on or about April 13, 2007, for the interest assessment.\" Opp'n at 12. He argues that the allegation regarding notice is therefore \"unsubstantiated,\" and it is \"safe to conclude that no such notices exist.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9196551\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/381/109/#p113\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Government's response is somewhat unsatisfactory. It responds: \"Defendant seems to believe that he was entitled to receive a notice, separate from the [SNOD], about the assessment of interest. This is simply not the case. Because the application of interest is automatic under [ section 6601 ] in the case of an underpayment, his notice was the [SNOD].

Given that a notice of deficiency need not include interest, however, the Government's assertion that notice separate and apart from the SNOD is not required is tantamount to an argument that no notice is required at all. The Government provides no authority to support this assertion, which is contradicted by statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%206601\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1) (\"Interest prescribed under this section on any tax shall be paid\n   <em>\n    upon notice and demand\n   </em>\n   ....\") (emphasis added).

The Court finds that Defendant was thus entitled to notice of the assessment of interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Government's perfunctory and unsupported argument aside, the Court nevertheless finds that notice was proper. As stated above, \"Form 4340 is probative evidence in and of itself and, 'in the absence of contrary evidence, [is] sufficient to establish that notices and assessments were properly made.' \"\n   <em>\n    Hansen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10507643\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/7/137/#p138\">\n    7 F.3d at 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   , 953 F.3d at 540).

Defendant offers no evidence to rebut the information contained in the Form 4340. Indeed, he does not even declare that no notice was received; rather, he asserts that the IRS failed to produce a copy of the notice during discovery. At most, this evidences a potential discovery violation, not a defect in the assessment and collection process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hughes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10518810\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/953/531/#p540\">\n    953 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   539 n.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Moreover, the Court notes that Defendant did, in fact, receive notice of the assessment of interest. In the Refund Action, the Estate itself alleged that, \"on or about July 28, 2008, Defendant's [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] Internal Revenue Service credited the $5,246,367 [accuracy-related penalty] against asserted interest allegedly due of $13,361,360.50.\" Dkt. 28 \u00b6 12 n.*, R.A.

ESTOPPEL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendant further argues that the Government should be estopped from asserting its claim of interest because the IRS twice represented that \"no interest was due.\" Opp'n at 16. Specifically, on December 6, 2006 and again on June 11, 2008-attached to the SNOD and Disallowance, respectively,-the IRS provided a Form 4549-A, \"Income Tax Discrepancy Adjustments,\" that reflected \"Interest ( IRC \u00a7 6601 )\" in the amount of $0.00. SNOD at US000069; Disallowance at US000198. Although acknowledging that estoppel is applied sparingly against the government, Defendant argues that the\n   IRS's misstatements are the \"sort of 'official misconduct' that can be considered sufficient to estop the government.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10518810\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/953/531/#p540\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Brandt v.

This is based largely on Defendant's claim that the IRS failed to assess or provide notice of the assessment of interest prior to bringing this suit, thereby allowing interest to accrue for 10 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   \"The traditional elements of an equitable estoppel claim include (1) the party to be estopped must know the facts; (2) he must intend that his conduct shall be acted on or must so act that the party asserting the estoppel has a right to believe it is so intended; (3) the latter must be ignorant of the true facts; and (4) he must rely on the former's conduct to his injury. Additionally, a party asserting equitable estoppel against the government must also establish that (1) the government engaged in affirmative misconduct going beyond mere negligence; (2) the government's wrongful acts will cause a serious injustice; and (3) the public's interest will not suffer undue damage by imposition of estoppel.\"\n   <em>\n    Baccei v.

The fact that no outstanding interest was shown on two forms is not necessarily an affirmative representation that no interest would be due. Rather, it may simply have been the case that the notices to which those forms were attached, i.e., the SNOD and Disallowance, did not address the matter of statutory interest. Moreover, even if the forms are construed as such a representation, Defendant has not shown that the IRS engaged in affirmative misconduct. Although the IRS may have been negligent in failing to accurately report the amount of interest owed, \"negligence alone will not support a claim of equitable estoppel against the government.\"\n   <em>\n    Baccei\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089065\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/632/1140/#p1147\">\n    632 F.3d at 1147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, no injury or injustice resulted. As discussed above, the evidence before the Court demonstrates that the IRS timely assessed the interest and issued a notice and demand for payment thereof. Defendant was made aware of the assessment by no later than July 28, 2008, and the issue of crediting the abated penalty as a setoff against the interest was litigated in the Refund Action. Thus, Defendant cannot plausibly claim that he failed to pay the interest for lack of notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    E.

The Court of Appeals explained that the assessment itself must be timely, but that the supporting record need not be prepared within the statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526704\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/12/489/#p493\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Stallard\n   </em>\n   is therefore clearly misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Second, Defendant argues that the presumption of validity is rebutted here because \"evidence shows the information in the forms to be erroneous.\" Opp'n at 14. Specifically, he asserts that, \"in 2007, the Form 4340\n   <em>\n    would have said\n   </em>\n   ... that the [$5.2 million penalty] was owed,\" even though the IRS subsequently abated the penalty on the ground that it was \"wrongfully charged.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10526704\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/12/489/#p493\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The logic behind this argument is flawed. The form filed in this action reflects that the accuracy-related penalty was abated. Form 4340 at US000004. Thus, no error appears. Moreover, insofar as an \"error\" existed in 2007, it was not in the form, but in the penalty assessment itself. \"Where an assessment is based on more than one item,\" however, \"the presumption of correctness attaches to each item.\"\n   <em>\n    Stonehill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1847969,1847910\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/702/1288/\">\n    702 F.2d at 1294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Proof that an item is in error destroys the presumption for that single item; the remaining items retain their presumption of correctness.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1847969,1847910\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/702/1288/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, even if the IRS erred in imposing the accuracy-related penalty, that error does not infect other items, such as assessed interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In view of the forgoing, the Court finds that the Government may rely on the Form 4340 to establish the amount of interest owed.
