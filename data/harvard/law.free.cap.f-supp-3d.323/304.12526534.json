Castro's argument is unavailing. In an interview after her arrest, Castro claimed that she had no knowledge that the cellular phones were in her binder. (Docket No. 47 at p. 2.) Her prior bad acts regarding delivery of contraband to federal inmates undermines her post-arrest assertions, and provides context for the July 30, 2016 incident. The two-count indictment alleges that on July 30, 2016, Castro attempted to smuggle contraband into MDC. (Docket No. 3.)
