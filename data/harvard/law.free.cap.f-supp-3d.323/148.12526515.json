Crooker also seeks an injunction to remedy such violations, including: (1) the removal of Crooker's name from any watch list or database that prevents him from flying, (2) a disclosure of the reasons and bases for his inclusion on the federal government's \"No Fly List,\" and (3) the opportunity to contest such inclusion before a live, neutral decision-maker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) and (6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, asserting that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction on the action and that Crooker fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. In the alternative, the Defendants request that the Court stay proceedings in this case pending Crooker's exhaustion of his administrative remedies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

In sum, this Court has subject matter jurisdiction to exercise review under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") without first requiring Crooker to purchase a plane ticket, try to board, and wait to see what happens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Ordering the Defendants to process a TRIP application for Crooker may be all that Crooker can accomplish in this case. Despite the Defendants' arguments and declarations, Decl. Deborah O. Moore (\"Moore Decl.\") ECF No. 58-1 and Decl. Timothy P. Groh (\"Groh Decl.\") ECF No. 58-2, this Court believes that granting Crooker such an order is the only just and fair thing for Crooker. After all,\n   <em>\n    fiat\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    justitia\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ruat\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    c\u00e6lum\n   </em>\n   (let justice be done though the heavens fall).

Deficiencies of the Current Redress Procedure.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In his interaction with DHS TRIP, Crooker received an answer stating only that \"[a]fter reviewing your inquiry, we have determined that it falls outside the scope of the DHS TRIP program,\" and TSA jurisdiction. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17, 24. This is not surprising, since Crooker never tried to board a domestic or international flight. The Defendants point out that any information on the No Fly List is deemed \"to be sensitive security information that may not be publicly released.\" Defs.' Mem. Dismiss 6 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Napolitano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3636660\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/700/733/\">\n    700 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   737 n.5 ). Thus they emphasize that they cannot simply respond to every casual inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Defendants thus create a Kafkaesque situation -- indeed a potential violation of the Constitution's due process clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The only available option is to follow the DHS TRIP process, which forces the interested person to be an airline passenger, and only after that person is delayed or denied boarding may he start the whole process of redress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Other courts have noticed this issue: \"There are thousands of people on the government's terrorist watchlists, and there are thousands more people each year whom the government misidentifies as being on the lists.\"\n   <em>\n    Shearson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070942\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/588/#p594\">\n    725 F.3d at 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even Deborah O. Moore, the Branch Manager of the Transportation Security Redress Branch in Civil Rights &amp; Civil Liberties, Ombudsman and Traveler Engagement at the TSA, acknowledges the No Fly List's drawbacks: \"[a]pproximately 98% of travelers who make redress inquires with DHS TRIP are not in fact in the TSDB.\" Moore Decl. at \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Even so, the Defendants argue that allowing Crooker to have his TRIP application processed will open the floodgates to other inquiries and will have a detrimental effect on national security. The floodgates argument is frequently raised with but vague meaning and few facts to support its sometimes-shaky foundations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Marin K. Levy,\n   <em>\n    Judging the Flood of Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20U.%20Chi.%20L.%20Rev.%201007\">\n    80 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1007\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1007-77 (2013). So it is here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   This case has a discrete set of alleged facts: the TSA makes a disclosure, Crooker loses his job. It is nobody's fault. He's trying to clear his name following government-established procedures. There may be other analogous cases. They will come before competent judges who can distinguish those cases from this one. At the hearing on Crooker's motion to dismiss, this Court inquired about other cases like this one. There has been no response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   There is nothing to the floodgates argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint, ECF No. 43, and Motion to Stay the Case Pending Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies, ECF No. 45. The Court rules that it has a limited area of subject matter jurisdiction here, Crooker has standing, and he need not exhaust any administrative remedy other than submitting a TRIP application. While the Court has limned a possible remedy should the alleged facts prove true, it is in no position to fashion a remedy absent proof of the alleged facts.
