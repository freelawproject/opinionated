Defendant Portland General Electric Company (\"PGE\") is part-owner and part-operator of the Pelton Project. DRA sues PGE, alleging that its operation of the Pelton Project violates the Federal Water Pollution Control Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201251\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (commonly known as the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\") ).

The Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon (the \"Tribe\"), which consists of three Indian tribal groups-the Warm Springs, the Wasco, and the Paiute-serves as amicus curiae in this case. Both PGE and the Tribe move to dismiss DRA's Complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(7) for failure to join a necessary party (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Tribe) under Rule 19. For the reasons discussed, the Tribe and PGE's motions are denied. Because the Court concludes, however, that the Tribe is a necessary party to this litigation, and that the Clean Water Act abrogates the Tire's sovereign immunity on those issues, the Court orders the Tribe formally joined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Pelton Project consists of three dams on the Deschutes River: the Round Butte Dam, the Pelton Dam, and the Reregulating Dam.

ECF 73 at \u00b6 23. The Tribe and PGE simultaneously filed applications for water quality certifications for the Pelton Project, pursuant to CWA Section 401, with both the Tribe's Water Control Board (\"WCB\") and with Oregon's Department of Environmental Quality (\"DEQ\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2000%20WL%201504844\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In June 2002, WCB and DEQ issued their respective water quality certifications.

ECF 73 at \u00b6 24. At the time of the relicensing negotiations, the Project withdrew and discharged water from the bottom of the reservoir only, which resulted in the project exceeding water quality standards for temperature, pH, and dissolved oxygen. ECF 75-2 at 4-5. The Project, from the beginning, also had issues with fish passage. The dams created a total barrier to migration by resident and anadromous fish in the Deschutes River, preventing anadromous and resident salmonids from reaching historical spawning and rearing areas. ECF 75-2 at 4. By 1973, fish passage was abandoned in favor of a fish hatchery, a result that has had a profound effect on the Tribe. ECF 73 at \u00b6 26. Under the 2005 License, the Tribe and PGE were required to (1) reintroduce anadromous fish runs upstream of the Pelton Project that were extirpated as a result of construction and operation of the project; and (2) reduce the Pelton Project's\n   contribution to water quality problems on the Lower Deschutes River. ECF 75-3. A key feature of the Relicensing Settlement Agreement, made a part of the 2005 License, is a Fish Passage Plan. ECF 73 at \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Under the 2005 License, the main way in which the Project would move toward improving both fish passage and water quality was by construction of a selective water withdrawal facility (\"SWW\") at the Round Butte Dam intake tower.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C450\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C450\">\n    at \u00b6 34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The SWW is designed to allow water withdrawal from both the warmer surface water and the cooler bottom water, which both helps to meet temperature and water quality goals and standards and to allow fish passage. ECF 75-3. As a result of the SWW, anadromous fish are now passing both upstream and downstream through the Pelton Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The 2005 License also establishes Implementation Committees-a component of the Relicensing Settlement Agreement-including a Fish Committee.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C450\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20FERC%20%C2%B6%2061%2C450\">\n    at \u00b6 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fish Committee consists of PGE and the Tribe as well as several other stakeholders. The Fish Committee oversees implementation of the Fish Passage Plan. ECF 75-2 at 16. FERC intended the Fish Committee \"to have a pivotal role in the administration of a large variety of post-licensing activities, including changes in protection and enhancement measures on behalf of fish and wildlife, water quality, and recreation.\" ECF 75-1 at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   DRA brings this action under the citizen suit provision of the Clean Water Act, alleging ongoing violations of the Pelton Project's CWA \u00a7 401 Certification from DEQ, which is a condition of the 2005 License. Specifically, DRA alleges that PGE has violated the following conditions of the DEQ Water Quality Certification: (1) Condition E.1, requiring that the facility be operated in accordance with the pH Management Plan contained in the WQMMP; (2) Condition C.1, requiring that the SWW facility be operated in accordance with the Temperature Management Plan; and (3) Condition S, which requires that no wastes be discharged and no activities conducted that would violate state water quality standards. The Tribe and PGE both move to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(7) for failure to join the Tribe, a party that the Tribe and PGE argue is necessary under Rule 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Whether the Tribe Properly Can Move to Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   DRA argues first that neither the Tribe nor PGE is authorized under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to bring a 12(b)(7) motion at this time. DRA argues that the Tribe, which is not a party to this case, may not bring such a motion under Rule 12(b)(7), which provides that \"a\n   <em>\n    party\n   </em>\n   may assert\" a 12(b)(7) defense. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(7). The Tribe suggests in response that it is a\n   <em>\n    type\n   </em>\n   of party, although it does not have \"full party status.\" The Tribe argues that, because Rule 12(b)(7) does not limit the\n   <em>\n    types\n   </em>\n   of parties that may assert a 12(b)(7) defense, it does not clearly proscribe the Tribe from bringing such a motion. The Tribe also argues that Rule 12 should, for practical purposes, be construed to permit an amicus curiae party to file a Rule 12(b)(7) motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Under Rule 12, only a\n   <em>\n    party\n   </em>\n   may make a Rule 12(b)(7) motion to dismiss. \"An amicus curiae is not a party to litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller-Wohl Co. v. Comm'r of Labor &amp; Indus. State of Mont.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1487316\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/694/203/#p204\">\n    694 F.2d 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 204 (9th Cir. 1982) (responding to amici curiae's contention \"that their extensive participation [in a case had] made them parties\n   to th[e] litigation\"). The basis of the Tribe's motion is that the Tribe\n   <em>\n    was not joined as a party\n   </em>\n   to this case. The Tribe's motion to dismiss is therefore denied. Nonetheless, PGE, the defendant in this case, has made its own motion to dismiss pursuant to Rules 12(b)(7) and 19, and has joined in the Tribe's motion to dismiss. The Court therefore considers PGE's motion to dismiss, with the benefit of the Tribe's arguments as amicus curiae.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Whether PGE's Motion is Timely\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   DRA also argues that PGE's motion under Rule 12(b)(7) is untimely. \"Except as provided in Rule 12(h)(2) or (3), a party that makes a motion under [ Rule 12 ] must not make another motion under [ Rule 12 ] raising a defense or objection that was available to the party but omitted from its earlier motion.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(g)(2). PGE previously filed a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(1), asserting a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Rule 12(h)(2) provides that the failure to join a required party may nonetheless be raised: \"in any pleading allowed or ordered under Rule 7(a)\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a complaint); \"by a motion under Rule 12(c)\" (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a motion for judgment on the pleadings); or\" \"at trial.\" Rule 12(h)(3) relates to subject-matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Because Rule 12(h)(2) provides that the defense of failure \"to join a person required by Rule 19(b)... may be raised as a motion for judgment on the pleadings, and may be made as late as at trial, it is in the interest of judicial economy to hear PGE's motion to dismiss at this stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Moretti v. The Hertz Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201238712\">\n    2016 WL 1238712\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (D.

The Tribe alleges that its proprietary interests include is status as: co-owner of the Pelton Project, joint licensee of the 2005 License, party to the GSA, and party to the Relicensing Settlement Agreement. The Tribe's sovereign interests, it explains, are related to its authority to regulate activities and resources within the boundaries of its Reservation, and to its treaty-reserved rights, including the right to take fish at its usual and accustomed stations throughout the Deschutes River Basin. DRA acknowledges that the Tribe holds essential interests related to the Pelton Project, the Deschutes River Basin's fish and wildlife and water quality, and to its own sovereignty. DRA argues, however, that those broad interests are not implicated in this case, which deals only with the issue of whether PGE is operating the Pelton Project in violation of DEQ's Water Quality Certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   DRA's attempt to narrow the scope of this case is unpersuasive. This lawsuit arises out of DRA's assertion that the Pelton Project is being operated in violation of the CWA. The Tribe and PGE are co-licensees of the Pelton Project. Additionally, although under the O &amp; O Agreement between the Tribe and PGE, PGE is the operator of the Round Butte and Pelton Dams, and of certain aspects of the Reregulating Dam, the Tribe holds an ownership interest in the entirety of the Pelton Project, and serves as operator of the generation facilities at the Reregulating Dam. Furthermore, the operation of the Pelton Project has a direct effect on the Tribe's treaty-reserved rights, including not only its right to dictate how its land is used and how facilities within its\n   boundaries are operated, but also the Tribe's right to the resources, including fish, within the Deschutes River Basin. The Tribe thus has an interest in the subject matter of this action, and that interest is legally protected by both the Tribe's ownership of and license for the Pelton Project and by the 1855 Treaty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Resolving the question of whether the Pelton Project is being operated in violation of the DEQ Water Quality Certification could impair the Tribe's interest as co-operator and co-licensee of the Pelton Project. Additionally, any relief ordered would inevitably impact, or at least carry a risk of impacting, the Tribe's interests in the resources of the Deschutes River Basin. Regardless of the precise relief requested or ultimately ordered, any relief that involves changing the pH, oxygen, or temperature levels of the water in and around the Pelton Project-the very measures DRA seeks to affect through this lawsuit-will impair the Tribe's sovereign interest in exercising governmental power over the natural resources within the Reservation and risk impairing the Tribe's right to fish in and around the Deschutes River Basin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   DRA argues that PGE can adequately represent the Tribe's interests in the suit.

DRA argues that although the interests of the Tribe and PGE may derive from different sources, the Tribe and PGE share the same interest in defending the specific claims alleged in DRA's complaint-namely, that the operation of the Pelton Project violates the CWA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Although DRA may be correct that, in resolving the\n   <em>\n    merits\n   </em>\n   of this case, PGE would likely make all of the same arguments that the Tribe would make if it were formally named a defendant, the same is not true with respect to the fashioning of a\n   <em>\n    remedy.\n   </em>\n   The Tribe has unique interests in not only the operation of the Pelton Project, but also in its effect on the surrounding natural resources. Those interests are reserved by treaty and would not adequately be represented by PGE. A remedy ordered by the Court against PGE could also result in requiring the Tribe-a sovereign entity-to take or refrain from taking certain actions. To find liability in the absence of the Tribe, and thereafter to fashion a remedy in the Tribe's absence, has the potential significantly to impair the Tribe's interest in a manner substantially different from any effect on PGE's interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   For similar reasons, PGE is not\n   <em>\n    capable\n   </em>\n   of making all of the arguments that the Tribe would make. The Tribe has also expressed that it vests no authority in\n   PGE to make the Tribe's arguments, indicating that PGE may be not only unable, but unwilling, to make the arguments available to the Tribe. Finally, the Tribe will offer necessary elements for the Court's consideration, such as how to interpret the DEQ certification in light of the parallel WCB certification, and how to go about fashioning a remedy in a way that does not unnecessarily impinge on the Tribe's treaty-protected interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Although this raises an interesting theoretical point,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   it is not the situation\n   before the Court. DRA has represented that, if the Court concludes the Tribe is a necessary party, DRA would amend its complaint to assert claims against the Tribe, in addition to PGE, for violation of the CWA. Because the Tribe is a licensee and part-owner and part-operator of the Project, it is reasonable to believe that DRA could assert the same or substantially similar claims against the Tribe as DRA has asserted against PGE.

The Tribe and PGE also argue that Section 1365\n   <em>\n    impliedly\n   </em>\n   uses a different definition of \"person,\" because it defines \"person\" to include the United States, and thus cannot be the same \"person\" as used in Section 1362. The problem with this argument, however, is that even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that Section 1365\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   create an entirely new definition of person, the Tribe and PGE provide no workable alternative definition of \"person\" for purposes of the citizen suit provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Elsewhere, the Tribe and PGE suggest that in the absence of a specific definition displacing that in Section 1362, but where it would make little sense to apply Section 1362's definition,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"person\" should be interpreted according to its plain meaning, or otherwise given the most logical definition based on its context. It is perfectly logical, however, to apply Section 1362's definition of \"person\" in Section 1365 and to then add the United States and expressly limit the provision's applicability to states, which are included in the broad definition of person, by limiting suits against governmental entities to those allowed under the Eleventh Amendment. Contrary to PGE and the Tribe's argument, there is no \"absurd result\" that must be avoided in this case. Further, in some other CWA provisions, the Tribe and PGE argue, \"person\" must be given its plain meaning, denoting simply a natural, or human, individual. Applying this definition to Section 1365, however, would itself have an absurd result: only individuals, the United States, and other governmental instrumentalities or agencies, excluding claims against states for civil penalties and declaratory relief, could be subject to citizen suits for violations of the CWA. That would mean that PGE, a non-government and non-human entity, could not be subject to this suit, which is an illogical and untenable result.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Decker v.

Nonetheless, the use of the term \"including\" in Section 1365 is not so different from the use of the term \"in addition to\" in Section 1319(6) that the Court finds any meaningful difference to attribute to Congress' intent. To \"include\" means \"to place, list or rate as a part or component of a whole or of a larger group, class, or aggregate,\" or \"to take in, enfold, or comprise as a discrete or subordinate part or item of a larger aggregate, group, or principle.\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary (2002). This is nearly indistinguishable from the plain meaning of \"in addition to.\" Although Section 1319(6) may have added to Section 1362's definition of \"person\" more explicitly than did Section 1365, the Court finds no reasonable diverging meaning to glean from these two variations in word use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   PGE also argues that if Congress had simply intended to add to the definition of \"persons\" already provided, then it would have been superfluous to also reference state entities, which are already included in the definition of \"persons\" in Section 1362. Section 1365, however, does more than reference states-it references all other governmental instrumentalities or agencies-and it is far from clear that these bodies are all included in the general definition of \"person.\" Furthermore, as DRA argues, and as PGE now agrees, the qualifying text \"to the extent permitted by the Constitution\" actually operates to\n   <em>\n    remove\n   </em>\n   states from definition of \"persons\" against whom citizen suits may be initiated, based on Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Finally, PGE argues that Section 1365 is a grant of jurisdiction only, and not an abrogation of sovereign immunity. PGE first suggests that the title of Section 1365(a) indicates that it is a grant of jurisdiction. Regardless of whether a statute's title is a proper consideration at this stage,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania Dept of Corr. v.

Section 1365 provides that \"any citizen may commence a civil action ...\" and only later adds that \"[t]he district courts shall have jurisdiction\" to hear such actions. The first part of the provision, therefore, does something more than grant jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, if the citizen suit provision were merely a grant of jurisdiction, then it would follow that sovereign immunity of the\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   has not been abrogated for citizen suits-another untenable result.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    ONRC Action v.

PGE now argues, as discussed, that the provision is simply not an abrogation of sovereign immunity at all, and that the parenthetical reference to the Eleventh Amendment \"clarif[ies]\" that sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment was preserved. But as PGE argues elsewhere, an interpretation of a statute that would render text superfluous is to be avoided.\n   <em>\n    Corley v.

If the citizen suit provision would not otherwise operate to abrogate sovereign immunity, such a clarification would be superfluous. DRA argues that the parenthetical reference to the Eleventh Amendment\n   <em>\n    restores\n   </em>\n   State sovereign immunity. PGE retorts that DRA has made no showing of an initial\n   <em>\n    abrogation\n   </em>\n   of sovereign immunity for which a\n   <em>\n    restoration\n   </em>\n   would needed. PGE again urges that abrogation may not be found in the use of the term \"person\" and in its definition. For the reasons discussed above, the Court disagrees. Lastly, PGE argues that the inclusion of tribes in the definition of \"municipalities\" was intended only to allow tribes to receive federal aid under the CWA. The Court is unpersuaded by PGE's sparse support for this proposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Interpreting Section 1365 to abrogate the sovereign immunity of Indian tribes and the United States, but not of individual states does raise the question of why Congress would have expressly provided that the citizen suit provision did not abrogate state sovereignty under the Eleventh Amendment, but not done the same for tribal sovereign immunity. At first glance, this presents some incongruity. Any meaning that could be gleaned from this apparent mismatch, however, is lessened by the fact that Congress\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   clearly intend to differentiate between states and the federal government-providing for citizen suits against the latter but not the former-negating the potential concern that this mismatch suggests it was not Congress' intent to treat Indian tribes differently from states.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Court concludes that Section 1365 of the CWA abrogates the sovereign immunity of Indian tribes. The Court agrees with other courts that have found that where a statute defines \"person\" to include \"tribes,\" and allows citizen suits against \"persons,\" Congress has made a clear and unequivocal waiver of tribal sovereign immunity. The Court is unpersuaded by the Tribe and PGE's argument that the CWA's citizen suit provision, by explicitly mentioning the United States and other governmental bodies, meant to remove Indian tribes from the CWA's general definition of \"person.\" \"Person,\" as generally defined in the CWA, does not include the United States. Giving the term \"including\" its plain meaning, Section 1365\n   <em>\n    adds\n   </em>\n   the United States to the definition of \"person,\" and expressly preserves state sovereign immunity under the Eleventh Amendment, but not tribal sovereign immunity. Because the citizen suit provision of the CWA abrogates tribal immunity, it is feasible to join the Tribe-a necessary part-to this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The Tribe is a necessary party in this action, and it is feasible to join the Tribe because Congress has abrogated the Tribe's sovereign immunity against suit under the CWA. Accordingly, the Tribe's motion to dismiss (ECF 72) and PGE's motion to dismiss (ECF 74) are DENIED, the Tribe shall be joined as a Defendant, and DRA may file an amended complaint within 14 days from the date of this Opinion and Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    For example, if the Tribe's interest in this action derived only from its proximity to the Pelton Project, or the Project's effect on tribal resources, but the Tribe held no responsibility for the ownership or operation of the Project, and the Project itself was not operated on tribal land, the Tribe may still be a necessary party due to its interests, but DRA likely could not allege that the Tribe had violated the CWA. In that case, the Tribe likely would retain its sovereign immunity because the only purported basis for an abrogation-the CWA-would be inapplicable to the Tribe.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    The Tribe and PGE point to several examples within the CWA where it would make little sense to apply Section 1362's definition of \"person,\" which includes entities like corporations. For instance, in provisions requiring research on \"the harmful effects on the health or welfare of persons causes by pollutants,\" or authorizing scholarships for \"undergraduate study by persons,\" the Tribe and PGE argue, Congress used \"persons\" merely to mean natural, human individuals, without expressly stating so. The Court addresses the Tribe and PGE's argument on this matter without weighing in directly on the meaning of \"persons\" within these other CWA provisions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    The Tribe and PGE asserted the opposite position in their initial briefing, but in supplemental briefs argue that this text indicates that states\n    <em>\n     do\n    </em>\n    have sovereign immunity from suits for damages.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Notably, in their original briefing on this motion, PGE and the Tribe argued that Section 1365 expressly abrogated the sovereign immunity of the United States and of individual states, and insisted that because Congress had done so explicitly without mentioning Indian tribes, Congress had not intended to abrogate the sovereign immunity of tribes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
