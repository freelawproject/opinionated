LEITMAN, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On January 24, 2018, Defendant Jacourtney Harris pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). In connection with Harris' sentencing, a dispute arose over whether a guilty plea that Harris entered in 2014 in state court to a charge of unarmed robbery constitutes a \"conviction\" for a \"crime of violence\" as those terms are used in \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (the \"Guidelines\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Harris entered the earlier plea under Michigan's Holmes Youthful Trainee Act (the \"HYTA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20762.11\">\n    Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 762.11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That statute allows a juvenile to avoid a formal conviction by pleading guilty to an offense and successfully completing his sentence. Harris completed his sentence for unarmed robbery, and the state court dismissed the case against Harris without entering a judgment of conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   With respect to sentencing in this case, if Harris' prior plea under the HYTA qualifies as a \"conviction\" for a \"crime of violence,\" then Harris' base offense level under the Guidelines is 20. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4). If the plea does not amount to a \"conviction\" for a \"crime of violence,\" then Harris' base offense level is 14. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the sentencing hearing, the Court determined that unarmed robbery under Michigan law is not a \"crime of violence\" under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4) of the Guidelines, and Harris' base offense level is therefore 14. The Court orally explained the basis for that ruling, and the Court now issues this written Opinion and Order to clarify, supplement,\n   and more fully explain its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Guidelines provision at issue, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4), provides that a defendant's base offense level for a felon in possession conviction is 20 if \"the defendant committed any part of the instant offense subsequent to sustaining one felony conviction of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\" Harris argues that his unarmed robbery plea should not result in a base offense level of 20 under this provision for two reasons. First, Harris contends that his plea under the HYTA did not result in a \"conviction.\" Second, he argues that unarmed robbery is not a \"crime of violence.\" The Court addresses each argument separately below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Harris first argues that his prior guilty plea to unarmed robbery is not a \"conviction\" under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4) because he successfully completed his sentence and, at that point, had his civil rights \"restored\" under the HYTA. (Harris Sentencing Mem., ECF # 19 at Pg. ID 77.) In support of this argument, Harris relies upon\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(20). That statutory provision excludes certain offenses from the term \"crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year\" as used in a chapter of the United States Code concerning criminal firearms offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statute provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   The term \"crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\" does not include-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (A) any Federal or State offenses pertaining to antitrust violations, unfair trade practices, restraints of trade, or other similar offenses relating to the regulation of business practices, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (B) any State offense classified by the laws of the State as a misdemeanor and punishable by a term of imprisonment of two years or less.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    What constitutes a conviction of such a crime shall be determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held.

He contends that \"conviction\" in \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4) should be read in light of, and consistently with, this language. Such a reading, Harris argues, yields the conclusion that a defendant who has successfully completed a HYTA sentence and had his civil rights \"restored\" has not been \"convicted\" of a crime for purposes of \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4). At the sentencing hearing, counsel for Harris candidly acknowledged that she could not cite any case in which any court has reached that conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court is not yet prepared to accept Harris' argument that, by operation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(20), a defendant has not been \"convicted\" as that term is used in \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4) where he has pleaded guilty to an offense under the HYTA, successfully completed his sentence, and had his civil rights restored. Before the Court could reach that conclusion, it would need to be\n   persuaded, among other things, that \"conviction\" in \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4) should be read in light of the statute cited by Harris rather than in light of the definition of \"convicted of an offense\" in another provision of the Guidelines themselves: \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(4). That Guidelines provision states that \" '[c]onvicted of an offense,' for purposes of this provision, means that the guilt of the defendant has been established, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of nolo contendere.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(4). If \"conviction\" in \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4) is read in light of the definition in \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(4), then a guilty plea entered under the HYTA would appear to count as a \"conviction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Another potential obstacle in Harris' way is the Sixth Circuit's suggestion in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Pritchett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065593\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/749/417/#p423\">\n    749 F.3d 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 423-24 (6th Cir. 2014), that a guilty plea fits within the ordinary meaning of the term \"conviction,\" and its holding in that case that a guilty plea followed by a diversionary sentence (without entry of a judgment of guilt) constituted a conviction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(A). Before the Court could accept Harris' argument here, Harris would have to explain why\n   <em>\n    Pritchett\n   </em>\n   does not compel the conclusion that his plea under the HYTA qualifies as a \"conviction\" under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   There may well be a basis for distinguishing\n   <em>\n    Pritchett\n   </em>\n   and for reading \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4) in light of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20921\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(20), as Harris proposes,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

So, while the Court may one day conclude that a plea under the HYTA does not amount to a \"conviction\" under \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4), the Court does not so hold today.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Harris next argues that his base offense level should not be 20 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4) because unarmed robbery under Michigan law-the offense to which Harris pleaded guilty under the HYTA-is not a \"crime of violence\" under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a). The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Section 2K2.1(a) incorporates the definition of \"crime of violence\" from \u00a7 4B1.2(a) of the Guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, cmt. n.1. That provision, in turn, defines \"crime of violence\" as any felony that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (1) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (2) is murder, voluntary manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, a forcible sex offense, robbery, arson, extortion, or the use or unlawful possession of a firearm described in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%205845\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) or explosive material as defined in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). The first clause of the definition, \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1), is commonly known as the elements clause, and the second clause, \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), is commonly known as the enumerated offenses clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In order to determine whether unarmed robbery qualifies as a \"crime of violence\" under either of these clauses, the Court must \"apply a 'categorical' approach, meaning that [the Court] must look at the statutory definition of the crime of conviction, not the facts underlying that conviction, to determine the nature of the crime.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

This language suggests that an unarmed robbery does not require \"violent force.\" Indeed, the Michigan Legislature's decision to separate \"force\" and \"violence\" with the disjunctive word \"\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   \" indicates that a defendant's use of force is sufficient to sustain a conviction even if the force does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   involve violence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    People v.

ID 91-94.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For several reasons, the Court concludes that\n   <em>\n    Randolph\n   </em>\n   does not control here. First, the court in\n   <em>\n    Randolph\n   </em>\n   construed the pre-2004 version of the unarmed robbery statute that, in contrast to the current statute, applied to a theft accomplished through \"force\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   violence.\" For all of the reasons explained above, the Michigan Legislature's change to \"force\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   violence\" in the 2004 amendments to the statute is strong evidence that the Legislature intended to criminalize robberies accomplished through the use of\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Second, other aspects of the 2004 amendments undermine the connection that\n   <em>\n    Randolph\n   </em>\n   drew between the statute and the common law of robbery that the Government relies upon here. These other amendments (1) abrogated the specific holding in\n   <em>\n    Randolph\n   </em>\n   that the force used in a robbery must occur at the same time as the taking and (2) expanded the scope of robberies to include certain attempt offenses which were not considered robbery at common law. As amended, the statute now provides (with the newly-added language underlined):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (1)\n   <em>\n    A\n   </em>\n   person who,\n   <em>\n    in the course of committing a larceny of any money or other property that may be the subject of larceny, uses\n   </em>\n   force\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   violence\n   <em>\n    against any person who is present\n   </em>\n   , or\n   <em>\n    who assaults\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    puts the person\n   </em>\n   in fear,\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment\n   <em>\n    for\n   </em>\n   not more than 15 years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    (2) As used in this section, \"in the course of committing a larceny\" includes acts that occur in an attempt to commit the larceny, or during commission of the larceny, or in flight or attempted flight after the commission of the larceny, or in an attempt to retain possession of the property.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mich.%20Comp.%20Laws%20%C2%A7%20750.530\">\n    Mich.

The Legislature's departure from the common law rules of robbery indicates that the common law principles underlying the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Randolph\n   </em>\n   (upon which the Government relies) may well have considerably less relevance when it comes to interpreting the current version of the unarmed robbery statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Third (and in any event), the Michigan Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Randolph\n   </em>\n   did not directly address the level of force necessary to sustain a conviction under the unarmed robbery statute.

Furthermore, the court did not squarely address the level of actual force required to sustain a conviction under the prior statute. Instead, the court addressed the specific argument made by the defendant: namely, \"that because one may commit unarmed robbery in Michigan by 'putting [another person] in fear,' the statute does not require 'the use, attempted used, or threatened use of force against another' and is therefore overly broad.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=689%20Fed.%20Appx.%20840\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=689%20Fed.%20Appx.%20840\">\n    at 844\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Matthews\n   </em>\n   simply does not address the precise question confronted by this Court: whether the level of actual force required under the current version of Michigan's unarmed robbery statute is \"violent force.\" Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Matthews\n   </em>\n   relied heavily on\n   <em>\n    Randolph\n   </em>\n   , but, as described above,\n   <em>\n    Randolph\n   </em>\n   lacks the force that it once had due to the 2004 amendments to the unarmed robbery statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Government also relies upon\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In both of those cases, the courts held that unarmed robbery under Michigan law is a \"crime of violence.\" But the courts in those cases were construing the earlier, pre-amendment version of Michigan's unarmed robbery statute. Moreover, the Seventh Circuit decided\n   <em>\n    Tirrell\n   </em>\n   before the Michigan Court of Appeals issued the unbroken line of decisions-cited above at Section III(B)(1)-establishing that an unarmed robbery conviction may rest upon force short of \"violent force.\" And while\n   <em>\n    Lamb\n   </em>\n   was decided after the Court of Appeals decisions, it neither acknowledged those decisions nor attempted to distinguish them. In addition,\n   <em>\n    Tirrell\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lamb\n   </em>\n   each relied heavily on\n   <em>\n    Randolph\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   For these reasons, the Court declines to follow\n   <em>\n    Tirrell\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lamb\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, the Government relies upon the following passage from the Michigan Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    People v. Kruper\n   </em>\n   : \"Whenever the elements of force or putting in fear enter into the taking, and that is the cause which induces the party to part with his property, such taking is robbery. This is true regardless of how slight the act of force or the cause creating fear may be,\n   <em>\n    provided, in the light of the circumstances, the party robbed has a reasonable belief that he may suffer injury unless he complies with the demand.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1925810\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mich/340/114/\">\n    340 Mich. 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=64%20N.W.2d%20629\">\n    64 N.W.2d 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 632 (1954) (emphasis added). The Government reads the italicized language as confirming that the force necessary to sustain an unarmed robbery conviction must amount to \"violent force.\" The Court respectfully disagrees. The Michigan Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Kruper\n   </em>\n   did not directly confront the question of how much force is necessary to support an unarmed robbery conviction.
