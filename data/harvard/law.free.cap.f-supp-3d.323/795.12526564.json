Ellis, III, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   At issue in this multi-count bank and tax fraud prosecution is defendant's motion to suppress evidence recovered from a search of his residence in Alexandria, Virginia. Specifically, defendant contends that the warrant authorizing the search failed to satisfy the Fourth Amendment's requirements (i) because the warrant did not clearly describe the evidence to be seized and (ii) because the scope of the warrant\n   was not limited by the probable cause on which the warrant was based. Defendant also argues that the execution of the search violated his Fourth Amendment rights because the executing agents exceeded the scope of the warrant and unlawfully retained defendant's personal items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The government opposes defendant's motion, contending that the warrant was sufficiently particularized and limited by the probable cause established in the affidavit.

The Fourth Amendment guarantees \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures\" and provides that \"no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\" U.S. Const. Amend. IV. As the Supreme Court has recognized, \"[b]y limiting the authorization to search to the specific areas and things for which there is probable cause to search,\" the Fourth Amendment \"ensures that the search will be carefully tailored to its justifications, and will not take on the character of the wide-ranging exploratory searches the Framers intended to prohibit.\"\n   <em>\n    Maryland v.

Here, by contrast, the terms of the warrant limited the permissible search and seizure to electronic devices used as means to commit, or containing evidence of, the Subject Offenses. Warrant Attach. B \u00b6\u00b6 1-3. The\n   <em>\n    Griffith\n   </em>\n   court also faulted the warrant there in issue for failing to limit \"the scope of permissible seizures to [electronic] devices owned by [the defendant]\" given that the affidavit in that case provided no factual basis on which to seize electronic devices of the defendant's family members.\n   <em>\n    Griffith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275602\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1265/\">\n    867 F.3d at 1276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But that limitation is not appropriate here because the affidavit in this case clearly established the relevance of records associated with not just defendant but also with defendant's family. For example, the affidavit reflected that several of defendant's allegedly criminal transactions included transfers from offshore accounts into accounts defendant jointly held with his wife. Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 21. The affidavit also described a bank-fraud scheme that involved a multi-million dollar loan to a limited liability company owned by defendant's wife.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27, 34. As such, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Griffith\n   </em>\n   , the agents here had reason to believe that electronic devices belonging not just to defendant, but also to defendant's wife, would contain evidence of the Subject Offenses. Accordingly, the warrant's description of the electronic devices to be seized was adequately particularized given the facts and circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In sum, the warrant here (i) identified the items to be seized in relation to specific Subject Offenses, (ii) included an illustrative list of records to limit the discretion of executing agents, and (iii) provided a sufficient description of the categories of items to be seized given the nature and circumstances of the crimes at issue.

Specifically, the affidavit reflected that Trusko, defendant's employee, told Special Agent Pfeiffer that defendant \"used his home to do business and maintained records of his businesses at his home.\" Aff. \u00b6 65, 66. Indeed, Trusko informed Special Agent Pfeiffer that Trusko had personally observed business records in defendant's home office as recently as May 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66, 67. The affidavit also established probable cause to believe that evidence of the Subject Offenses would be found on electronic devices in defendant's home. Specifically, the affidavit explained that Trusko told Special Agent Pfeiffer that defendant had a Mac Desktop computer in the designated office space of his residence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76. The affidavit also disclosed that Trusko had told Special Agent Pfeiffer that defendant made widespread use of electronic media in his business activity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And Trusko knew this fact because Trusko noted that he had, on several occasions, wiped defendant's old computers and cellular phones before giving the devices to charity and had observed a drawer of old electronic devices in defendant's former\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   residence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Finally, Special\n   Agent Pfeiffer, in his affidavit, noted generally that electronic devices often contain not only substantive evidence of a criminal offense-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , emails or bank records-but also records revealing how the devices have been used-\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , usernames, and computer account session times and durations-evidence which might aid in establishing the \"who, what, why, when, where, and how\" of the criminal conduct under investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   These facts, taken together, lend ample support to the common-sense conclusion reached by the magistrate judge here, namely that probable cause existed to believe (i) that defendant's electronic devices would contain evidence relevant to the Subject Offenses and (ii) that the devices in question would be located at defendant's residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In an attempt to avoid this conclusion, defendant again relies chiefly on\n   <em>\n    United States v. Griffith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275602\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1265/\">\n    867 F.3d 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Cir. 2017). But here again,\n   <em>\n    Griffith\n   </em>\n   is of no aid to defendant; it is inapposite in this context, as well. In\n   <em>\n    Griffith\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. Circuit determined that the warrant and the attached affidavit there did not establish probable cause to believe the defendant had a cell phone because the affidavit did not contain any information specific to the defendant; instead, the affidavit relied only on the general assumption that individuals in modern society often use cell phones. Here, by contrast, in addition to stating the general, common-sense proposition that individuals often use electronic media for storage purposes, Special Agent Pfeiffer's affidavit also provided information specific to defendant. For example, the affidavit explained specifically that Special Agent Pfeiffer's interview of Trusko revealed that defendant \"has made widespread use of electronic media in the course of his business activity.\" Aff. \u00b6 76. And Special Agent's interview with Trusko further confirmed that defendant had an office in his home which contained a desktop computer. Thus, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Griffith\n   </em>\n   , there was ample individualized and specific support in Special Agent Pfeiffer's affidavit for the magistrate judge's conclusion, namely that defendant used electronic media in his business and that defendant at times conducted that business in his residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In sum, the warrant here also satisfied the breadth requirement of the Fourth Amendment by adequately limiting the scope of the warrant by the probable cause on which the warrant was based. Accordingly, suppression on this ground is unwarranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that the search warrant for defendant's residence was fatally overbroad and lacking in the requisite particularity, suppression would not be warranted given that the searching agents acted in good-faith reliance on the warrant.

Special Agent Pfeiffer prepared a 41-page affidavit which set forth factual allegations establishing (i) probable cause to believe defendant committed the Subject Offenses, and (ii) probable cause to believe evidence of these Subject Offenses would be located in defendant's residence. Special Agent Pfeiffer then submitted the warrant application for review and approval by prosecutors. Once the warrant application was approved internally, Special Agent Pfeiffer submitted the application to a neutral and detached magistrate judge, who found the requisite probable cause and issued the warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Defendant argues the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule should not apply here because the affidavit at issue here (i) was \"facially deficient\" in its failure to particularize the place to be searched and the things to be seized and (ii) was \"so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render official belief in its existence entirely unreasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    Leon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    468 U.S. at 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11340969\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/468/897/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 3405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

In this regard, the Fourth Circuit has made clear that \"the seizure of items not described in the warrant violates the Fourth Amendment-and the items should be suppressed-unless an exception to the warrant requirement applies.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Legg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10504613\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/18/240/#p242\">\n    18 F.3d 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 242 (4th Cir. 1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Defendant contends that the agents executing the search warrant on defendant's residence violated these principles when the agents seized and imaged nearly every electronic and media device in defendant's home, including an Apple iPod, Apple iPod Touch devices, and several personal devices, such as a camera and camcorder. Specifically, defendant contends that no reasonable agent could have believed that these personal electronic devices were used to commit the tax and bank fraud crimes alleged in the affidavit and the warrant application. But this argument fails because it misunderstands the scope of the warrant. The warrant not only authorized the search and seizure of electronic devices used to commit the Subject Offenses, but the warrant also authorized the search of \"computers, electronic devices, and storage media\" that could be used to store the categories of records described in paragraph 1 of the warrant. Warrant Attach. B \u00b6 3. Although a reasonable officer might not believe that a defendant used an iPod, an iPod Touch, or a camcorder to commit bank fraud, courts have routinely recognized that these same devices can be used to store evidence of fraud-related crimes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ballard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229271\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/551/33/#p36\">\n    551 F.

Accordingly, because officers seized only items within the scope of the warrant and acted reasonably in doing so, the warrant was executed in a constitutionally permissible manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Even assuming that the executing agents exceeded the scope of the search warrant by imaging and seizing defendant's personal electronic devices, suppression of all the evidence recovered from the search of the residence would nonetheless be unwarranted. This is so as the Fourth Circuit has held that \"[a]s a general rule, if officers executing a search warrant exceed the scope of the warrant, only the improperly-seized evidence will be suppressed; the properly-seized evidence remains admissible.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Squillacote\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11244586\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/221/542/#p556\">\n    221 F.3d 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 556 (4th Cir. 2000). Blanket suppression is only justified in extraordinary circumstances where \"the officers executing the warrant exhibit a flagrant disregard for its terms\" by, for example, seizing \"large quantities of evidence clearly not within the scope of the warrant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11244586\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/221/542/#p556\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   No such extraordinary circumstances exist here, and as such, blanket suppression is not warranted even assuming the executing agents exceeded the scope of the warrant. Far from large quantities of evidence,\n   defendant identifies approximately 15 of the more than 70 items seized as allegedly exceeding the scope of the warrant, including Apple iPods, Apple iPod Touch devices, and memory cards from Nikon cameras, a Casio camera, Sony cameras, and a Go Pro Hero camera. These devices are clearly covered by the terms of the warrant, which, as described above, authorized the executing agents to search and seize both electronic devices potentially used in the commission of the Subject Offenses and electronic devices or storage media containing the categories of records described in the warrant. Warrant Attach. B \u00b6 3. Because the record reflects that the executing agents did not flagrantly disregard the terms of the warrant by seizing large quantities of evidence not described therein, blanket suppression of the evidence recovered from the search of the residence is plainly not appropriate here.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Foster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11941134\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/100/846/#p850\">\n    100 F.3d 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 850 (10th Cir. 1996) (finding law enforcement officers flagrantly disregarded terms of warrant where the warrant listed four firearms and marijuana as the items to be seized but officers seized \"anything of value,\" including a \"BB gun, drill, TVs, lawnmower, coveralls, socket set, clock radio, coins, knives, jewelry, etc.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Given that blanket suppression is not justified, the general rule in the Fourth Circuit would require suppression only of those approximately 15 items defendant identified as exceeding the scope of the warrant. Because the government has indicated that it does not intend to use these items at trial,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Gov't Opp. at 19, even this more circumscribed suppression is not necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Defendant further argues that the agents' execution of the search was constitutionally flawed because the government retained the items seized from the search of defendant's residence for more than a year without making an effort to segregate irrelevant or privileged items. Contrary to defendant's assertions, the record makes clear that the government has conducted a timely and reasonable review of the documents seized from the search of the residence. During the search itself, the government imaged many of the electronic devices, allowing defendant to retain the original electronic device and seizing only the imaged copy of the devices. Furthermore, the executing agents, aware of potential privilege issues, flagged and separated potentially privileged materials while executing the search. Since the search, the government has conducted ongoing privilege and relevance reviews, making efforts to separate and to remove irrelevant and privileged materials and offering defendant and his counsel the opportunity to gain insight into the review process and to examine any identified irrelevant material.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Letter from Robert S. Mueller, III, Special Counsel, to Kevin M. Downing, Law Offices of Kevin Downing 3, 11 (Nov. 17, 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Nor does defendant succeed in equating the government's seizure and retention of items here to the government's seizure and retention of items that warranted suppression in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Metter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5747598\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/860/205/\">\n    860 F.Supp.2d 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D.N.Y. 2012),\n   <em>\n    United States v.

These cases are inapposite. In\n   <em>\n    Metter\n   </em>\n   , the court granted a motion to suppress where the government had retained \"\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   imaged electronic documents ... without any review\" to determine either relevance or the applicability of privileges for fifteen months.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5747598\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/860/205/\">\n    860 F.Supp.2d at 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Debbi\n   </em>\n   , the government failed to conduct any privilege or relevance review in the eight months following its seizure of defendant's documents and returned only \"a limited portion of improperly seized materials\" despite repeated\n   requests from defense counsel.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9365229\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/244/235/\">\n    244 F.Supp.2d at 237-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, in\n   <em>\n    Comprehensive Drug Testing\n   </em>\n   , the government retained documents not described in the warrant for at least six months even after locating the relevant subset of documents within those seized.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3783527\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/621/1162/#p1171\">\n    621 F.3d at 1171\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, by contrast, privilege review began during the search, and the government has conducted ongoing privilege and relevance review since then, regularly updating defendant on its progress. Moreover, the government has offered defendant the opportunity to review irrelevant materials segregated through the government's review process, but defendant to date has declined to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Thus, the record reveals that the government seized items within the scope of the terms of the warrant and that the government has made reasonable efforts since the search to separate out irrelevant and privileged materials, to make arrangements to discuss the segregation process with defendant, and to return evidence when possible. Accordingly, the execution of the search was reasonable and there is no basis for suppression on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In sum, the record reflects that the warrant authorizing the search of defendant's residence was not constitutionally infirm. Specifically, the warrant was adequately particularized given the nature and circumstances of the crimes allegedly at issue, and the warrant was limited in scope by the probable cause established in the affidavit. Even assuming the warrant was overbroad and insufficiently particularized, the searching officers' good-faith reliance on the warrant was reasonable as the warrant was neither so facially deficient nor so lacking in indicia of probable cause as to render an officer's reliance on the warrant unreasonable. Finally, when conducting the search, the executing agents searched and seized only items within the scope of the warrant and made reasonable efforts to segregate and to return any privileged or non-responsive items recovered from the search. For these reasons, there are no grounds for suppression of the evidence recovered from the search of defendant's home, and defendant's motion must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    The facts recited here are derived from the testimony of Special Agent Jeffrey Pfeiffer (\"Special Agent Pfeiffer\") at the June 29, 2018 hearing on defendant's motion to suppress as well as the warrant, the attached affidavit, and the inventory of items seized from the search of defendant's residence.
