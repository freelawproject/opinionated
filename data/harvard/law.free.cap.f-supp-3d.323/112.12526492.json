Def.'s Resp. at 12-15.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Even after Shire received the new and accurate dissolution data from Abhai, neither Dr. Luk nor Juniper conducted any tests or analysis that involved this particular data.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Reply Supp. Expert Report of Dr. Luk (\"Dr. Luk Reply Report\"), ECF No. 227-1.

Def.'s Resp. at 13. It is unclear to the Court how Abhai's misconduct would require Shire to perform third party testing on Adderall XR. Therefore, Shire's award is reduced by $26,356.50.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    Appendix C.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Shire is entitled to all fees and costs associated with Dr. Dressman following the revelation of the misconduct.
