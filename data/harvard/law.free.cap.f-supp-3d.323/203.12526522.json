He holds an MBA in finance and accounting and multiple professional certifications and licenses. He applied for jobs with State Street 14 times prior to January, 2015, and twice more in 2015. Higgins sought positions as a Senior Audit Manager and Senior Auditor but did not receive an invitation to interview for either job. He alleges that State Street knew he was older than 40 years of age based on the information contained in his resume.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In November, 2015, plaintiff filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (\"MCAD\"). That complaint was dismissed in October, 2017 and Higgins then filed this suit in November, 2017. Pending before the Court is defendant's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant has filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

Age discrimination analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Accepting the plaintiff's allegations as true, he has asserted that he was a member of a protected class (because he is over the age of 40), was qualified for the job (by virtue of his credentials and experience) and suffered an adverse employment action (because he was not hired). He alleges no facts, however, demonstrating a causal connection between his age and State Street's decision not to interview him. Accordingly, he fails to allege a plausible claim for relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Higgins does not claim that State Street hired a younger person with equal or lesser qualifications to fill the positions for which he applied. He does not allege that any State Street employee or agent said or did anything to indicate that defendant discriminated against him based on age. In short, although plaintiff provides his speculative conclusion that State Street based its decisions on his age, he alleges no plausible facts from which a fact-finder\n   could infer that age discrimination occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"It is not enough\" to allege that the plaintiff is a member of a protected class and was subject to an adverse employment action.\n   <em>\n    Alicea\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    N.

Mass. 2017). Plaintiff protests that defendant has failed to serve the discovery that he believes would demonstrate State Street's discriminatory decision-making. Without a complaint that states a claim that is plausible on its face, however, he is not entitled to such discovery. The mere fact that an older employee was not hired does not trigger a right to \"conduct discovery in hopes that evidence of a discriminatory motive may turn up.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268386\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/232/213/#p215\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268386\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/232/213/#p215\">\n    at 216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Because plaintiff has not alleged a \"causal connection\" between his failure to obtain an interview and his age, he has failed to state a plausible claim upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant's motion to dismiss will be allowed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     Pro se status and leave to amend\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The First Circuit Court of Appeals has explained that the fact a plaintiff files a complaint\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    se\n   </em>\n   \"militates in favor of a liberal reading.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boivin\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Black\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11230906\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/225/36/#p43\">\n    225 F.3d 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 43 (1st Cir. 2000).
