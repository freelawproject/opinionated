Browning, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on Motion to Exclude Witness Joseph Otero Testimony, filed March 22, 2018 (Doc. 2141)(\"Motion\"). In the Motion, Defendant Christopher Chavez asserts that, \"[o]n March 21, 2018, FBI Special Agent Leysha Lopez Recci interviewed Joseph Otero,\" which \"produced an FBI 302\" that \"was entered on March 22, 2018,\" but was not provided to Chavez until April 12, 2018. Motion at 2. Chavez contends that \"[t]he contents of the 302 were statements heretofore not previously attributable to any 302, state investigative report or transcript from any hearing.\" Motion at 2. Chavez reproduces, in his Motion, the portion of the Otero 302 that he finds objectionable:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   GARZA was killed pretty early in the morning, around the time that the cell[s] were unlocked. Christopher CHAVEZ aka \"Critter,\" Eugene MARTINEZ, and Allen PATTERSON, aka \"Trigger,\" killed GARZA. When OTERO looked into GARZA'S cell, CHAVEZ was Holding [sic] GARZA and strangling him, and MARTINEZ and PATTERSON were attacking him too. GARZA was killed because he was a member of Los Carnales gang. OTERO did not agree with this. OTERO was never a member of the SNM, however he was sometimes seen as one of them because he was housed with SNM members. To this day, OTERO remembers the look on GARZA's face as if begging for help.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Motion at 2 (quoting DeLeon 61816-61817). Chavez argues that Plaintiff United States of America's April 12, 2018 disclosure violated\n   the Court's March 26, 2018, deadline for disclosure under the Jencks Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203500\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   so he \"proposes the Court prohibit and preclude Joseph Otero to testify consistent with the contents of the aforementioned FBI 302.\" Motion at 3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Prohibiting Otero to testify about the matters that the Otero 302 contains, however, is not an appropriate remedy for the Otero 302's delayed disclosure. The United States complied with the Jencks Act even if it did not comply with the Jencks deadline to which it agreed -- March 26, 2018 -- because it produced the Otero 302 before Otero completed testifying on direct examination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203500\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Consequently, the Jencks Act's draconian remedial provision -- which states that, in the event of a Jencks Act violation, \"the court shall strike from the record the testimony of the witness, and the trial shall proceed unless the court in its discretion shall determine that the interests of justice require that a mistrial be declared\" -- does not apply.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203500\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Further, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has declared that, notwithstanding the Jencks Act's mandatory phrasing, \"[t]he Jencks Act does not require a striking of testimony or the declaring of a mistrial for every failure to comply.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Heath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"866121\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/580/1011/#p1019\">\n    580 F.2d 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1019 (10th Cir. 1978). Instead, \"[t]he remedy or sanction in each instance is for the trial court to impose.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Heath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"866121\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/580/1011/#p1019\">\n    580 F.2d at 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Courts have found that late disclosure caused no prejudice in instances where an opportunity for full cross-examination had been provided and where the trial court found no bad faith on the prosecutor's part.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Heath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"866121\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/580/1011/#p1019\">\n    580 F.2d at 1019\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court, thus, has discretion to determine an appropriate remedy for the United States' violation of its self-imposed Jencks Act deadline, and excluding Otero's testimony regarding the content of the Otero 302 would be inappropriate. The United States can call witnesses without providing a preview of their testimony to the Defendants. For example, the United States could call Otero to testify even if it never documented its interviews\n   with him\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   or even if it never interviewed him at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Jencks Act exists to provide\n   potential impeachment material to defendants and not to provide a sneak peek at the United States' case in chief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Smaldone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"238494\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/484/311/\">\n    484 F.2d 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10th Cir. 1973) (stating that the Jencks Act's object was \"to allow defendant to review material which could be regarded as a statement for the purpose of impeachment\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203500\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (stating that the United States only needs to disclose its witnesses' prior statements after they have \"testified on direct examination\"). While the United States should have lived up to its promise\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and provided the Otero 302 to the Defendants on March 26, 2018, that the Defendants received the Otero 302 on April 12, 2018 -- a week before Otero took the stand -- allowed them to prepare to impeach Otero. The Defendants have had more opportunity to prepare for cross examination than the Jencks Act affords, and there has been no violation of the Jencks Act. Accordingly, the Court concludes that restricting the subject matter of Otero's testimony is not necessary to avoid prejudicing the Defendants and excluding eye witness testimony about the Rolando Garza murder would significantly hinder this trial's truth-seeking function.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 687,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984) (equating \"a fair trial\" with \"a trial whose result is reliable\").

The United States agreed, however, to produce its Jencks Act statements two weeks before this trial began,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , by March 26, 2018.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    The United States orally asserted that it -- meaning the prosecutors in this case -- gave the Otero 302 to the Defendants on April 12, 2018, because they did not have the Otero 302 until that date. That assertion indicates that the United States acted in good faith, but it does not excuse the Otero 302's delayed disclosure. The FBI had access to the Otero 302 as soon as it drafted that document,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , on March 22, 2018. The Jencks Act requires \"the United States\" -- and not any particular attorneys representing the United States -- to produce \"any statement ... of the witness in the possession of the United States.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203500\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b).\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n    [W]hether the nondisclosure was a result of negligence or design, it is the responsibility of the prosecutor.

It is clear that Congress was concerned that only those statements which could properly be called the witness' own words should be made available to the defense for purposes of impeachment.... [T]he legislation was designed to eliminate the danger of distortion and misrepresentation inherent in a report which merely selects portions, albeit accurately, from a lengthy oral recital. Quoting out of context is one of the most frequent and powerful modes of misquotation. We think it consistent with this legislative history, and with the generally restrictive terms of the statutory provision, to require that summaries of an oral statement which evidence substantial selection of material, or which were prepared after the interview without the aid of complete notes, and hence rest on the memory of the agent, are not to be produced [under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203500\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e)(2) ].
