Dennis Saylor IV, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This is a civil rights action arising out of the use of an incorrect Spanish-language\n   advice-of-rights form by the Methuen Police. Plaintiff Patricia Pimentel is a citizen of the Dominican Republic who illegally immigrated to the United States in 2003. She was arrested for drunk driving on October 21, 2014. After she was arrested, she was given an advice-of-rights form in Spanish, her native language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Spanish version of the form included incorrect information; for example, it stated that the legal limit for blood alcohol content (\"BAC\") while driving was 0.10 percent (it was actually 0.08 percent) and that a jury would be informed of her refusal to take a breathalyzer test (it would not). She was then given a separate \"Statutory Rights and Consent Form\" that correctly stated her rights. She then submitted to a breathalyzer test, which revealed her BAC to be 0.25 percent, more than three times the legal limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pimentel eventually received a continuance without a finding (\"CWOF\") after admitting to sufficient facts to one count of operating under the influence (\"OUI\") and two counts of leaving the scene of an accident causing property damage. That disposition, however, caused her immigration problems; she had previously qualified for protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (\"DACA\") program, and the CWOF jeopardized that status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   After securing new counsel, Pimentel was able to obtain a new trial on the ground that her prior counsel had rendered ineffective assistance. In its order, the state court stated that the breathalyzer test likely would have been suppressed because the incorrect advice-of-rights form coerced her consent. Prosecutors then agreed to dismiss one of the property-damage charges and the remaining charges were resolved in a manner that did not threaten her immigration status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Pimentel has now brought suit against the City of Methuen, the Methuen Chief of Police, three police officers, and the Essex County District Attorney. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. For the following reasons, the motion will be granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The facts are set forth as described in the complaint and attached exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     Events Leading Up to Pimentel's Arrest\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Patricia Pimentel is a citizen of the Dominican Republic. (Compl. \u00b6 80). Her primary language is Spanish. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In 2003, when Pimentel was nine years old, her parents paid a \"coyote\" (that is, a smuggler) to bring her illegally into the United States. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81). After arriving in the United States, she attended public schools in Lawrence, Massachusetts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83). She graduated from Lawrence High School in 2013. Although she hoped to enroll in college to study criminal justice, her status as an illegal immigrant precluded her from qualifying for certain forms of financial aid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 15, 2012, then-President Obama announced the creation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85). Among other things, DACA provided that the federal government would not pursue immigration action against illegal immigrants who were brought to the United States as minors, provided they were not convicted of serious crimes or otherwise posed a threat to public safety. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86). The program allowed qualified individuals to seek employment and higher education opportunities legally. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Pimentel applied for DACA status on May 14, 2013, and her application was granted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88). She then began working in the packaging department at JMB\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Industries in Hudson, New Hampshire. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On the evening of October 21, 2014, Pimentel and two of her friends were drinking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91). Pimentel was 20 years old at the time, and therefore under the legal drinking age. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). She became ill from the alcohol and called a taxi to bring her home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92). One of her friends offered to drive her home instead in Pimentel's car. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). That friend then got into an argument with her husband over the phone while driving, and pulled up to her own home rather than Pimentel's. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 93). Pimentel remained in the car in the driveway. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   According to the complaint, Pimentel then saw her ex-boyfriend sitting in a nearby car. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94). He called her cell phone, and an argument ensued. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 95-96). During the conversation, she asked the boyfriend to stop following her, and he replied that he was going to \"fuck [her] up.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96). After the boyfriend started walking towards her car, she panicked, moved into the driver's seat and began driving away. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). She hit two nearby parked vehicles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A short pursuit ensued, and the boyfriend cut her off at a stop sign. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). He opened the driver's door to Pimentel's vehicle and hit her in the face. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At that point, the boyfriend heard police sirens and fled the scene. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Methuen police officers Shawn Tardiff and David Souther were the first to arrive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99). Tardiff asked Pimentel for her license and registration and began to question her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Shortly afterward, a Spanish-speaking officer, Elvin Alacron, pulled up and joined in the questioning, because she preferred to have an interpreter present. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Tardiff and Alacron then asked Pimentel to perform various field sobriety tests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 100). After concluding she was driving while under the influence of alcohol, they arrested her and transported her to the Methuen police station. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Pimentel is Given the Incorrect OUI Advice-of-Rights Form\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Once at the police station, Pimentel was observed for 15 minutes by Alacron and Lieutenant James Jajuga, who was the booking officer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101). After the observation period, Pimentel was given the Spanish-language version of the Methuen Police advice-of-rights form given to persons arrested for OUI. The Spanish version included multiple incorrect statements of law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   First, the form stated that if OUI arrestees refused to consent to a breathalyzer test, the jury would be informed of that refusal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36; Ex. 6). However, the Supreme Judicial Court had held in 1992 that such an instruction would violate a defendant's right against self-incrimination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Second, the form stated that if the breathalyzer test results showed a BAC of 0.10 percent or more, \"it is presumed that you are driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor, and this proof can be used as evidence against you in court.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38; Ex. 6). The form further stated that \"the court will suspend your license for a period of time up to 90 days.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). However, the legal BAC level is 0.08 percent, not 0.10 percent, and the license-suspension penalty for registering a BAC of 0.08 percent or higher is capped at 30 days, not 90. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39). The complaint further alleges that the form omitted any mention of the \"per se\" theory of liability, under\n   which the state can convict a defendant of OUI simply by showing that the defendant drove with a BAC higher than 0.08 percent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Third, the form stated that if the breathalyzer test showed a BAC higher than 0.05 percent but lower than 0.10 percent, \"there is no presumption that you are driving under the influence of an intoxicating liquor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40; Ex. 6). Again, the legal BAC level is 0.08 percent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Fourth, the form stated that if the breathalyzer test result showed a BAC of 0.05 percent or lower, the arrestee would be \"liberated\" or \"set free\" from the charge. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42; Ex. 6). Although a BAC of 0.05 percent or lower creates a \"permissible inference that such defendant was not under the influence of intoxicating liquor,\" a defendant can still be prosecuted for an OUI if there is other evidence of impairment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43). The form also did not include information specific to drivers under the age of 21-specifically, that Massachusetts subjects such drivers to certain penalties if their BAC is 0.02 percent or more. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Fifth, the form stated that a refusal to submit to the breathalyzer test would result in a 120-day suspension of the arrestee's driver license. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44; Ex. 6). However, the penalty for refusing a breathalyzer test is a mandatory 180-day license suspension for drivers aged 21 or over, and a mandatory three-year license suspension for drivers under age 21. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After reviewing the Spanish advice-of-rights form, Pimentel signed the document a few minutes after 2 a.m. on October 22. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 103; Ex. 5). She was then given a \"Statutory Rights and Consent Form\" that listed further rights in both Spanish and English, which she also signed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105; Ex. 11). The parties do not dispute that the Statutory Rights and Consent Form correctly stated her rights. After signing both forms, Pimentel took the breathalyzer test, which showed her BAC to be 0.25 percent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 108).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Subsequent Criminal Proceedings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Later that day, Pimentel was arraigned on one count of OUI and two counts of leaving the scene of an accident causing property damage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 109). She received a court-appointed attorney and discussed her immigration status with him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110). She asked her attorney whether she could obtain a CWOF and how the proceedings would affect her immigration status. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 112). The attorney replied that a CWOF would not constitute an adjudication of guilt, preserving her DACA status. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 113).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On January 6, 2015, Pimentel pleaded to sufficient facts, and a district court judge continued the matter without a finding for one year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 114). As a consequence of the plea, she lost her license for 210 days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). She was placed on probation, and was required to complete a 14-day inpatient alcohol treatment program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). In addition, near the end of her probation period, she was informed she had to participate in a 16-week first-time-offender alcohol-education program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The district court continued her probation four months so she could complete the program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On April 30, 2015, Pimentel applied to renew her DACA status and employment authorization, which were set to expire on May 13, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 115). Approximately four months later, on September 7, 2015, she received two letters from the Department of Homeland Security denying her applications. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 116). The letters stated that the applications were denied because she had been convicted of \"a felony or a significant misdemeanor.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Exs. 13 and 14). Without the protection of DACA, she was potentially subject to deportation to the Dominican Republic. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 118).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Pimentel then sought new counsel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 119). At some point in December 2015, she learned that the Spanish version of the advice-of-rights form had included incorrect information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 120). On July 26, 2016, her attorney moved for a new trial on the ground of ineffective assistance of counsel-specifically, that her prior plea was constitutionally invalid because her prior counsel had failed to advise her of the consequences to her immigration status and did not explore a motion to suppress the breathalyzer test evidence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 121). The motion was granted on March 2, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 122). A state district court judge agreed that her prior counsel had provided ineffective assistance and that she stood a reasonable chance of suppressing the breathalyzer test evidence. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Ex. 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Approximately two months later, the district attorney's office agreed to dismiss one of the property-damage charges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 124). In addition, the assistant district attorney agreed to a \"guilty-filed\" disposition of the remaining charges, which would not threaten Pimentel's immigration status. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 124-25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     Methuen's Alleged Awareness of Errors in the Advice-of-Rights Form\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On August 12, 2012-more than two years before Pimentel was arrested-another Spanish-speaking individual had been arrested in Methuen for operating under the influence. That individual was given a Spanish-language advice-of-rights form identical to the one Pimentel received. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50). That individual similarly moved to suppress his breathalyzer test results. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On May 9, 2013, Assistant District Attorney Lindsay Nasson conceded the motion to suppress, and the individual was eventually acquitted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On May 10, 2013, Nasson e-mailed her superiors explaining why she conceded the motion to suppress-specifically, that the Spanish-language advice-of-rights form included incorrect statements of law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52). The e-mail stated that \"I just wanted to put everyone on notice that this is a live issue, and something that we will be working with [the] Methuen [Police Department] to rectify.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54). The complaint implies, but does not explicitly state, that Nasson ultimately followed through and communicated her concerns to the Methuen Police Department. It alleges that the Methuen police continued using the incorrect advice-of-rights form at least through November 2016, and that \"even high-ranking police officers ... were completely unaware\" of the situation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Pimentel's counsel submitted Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") requests \"pertaining to the use of an erroneous Spanish language form previously used by the Methuen Police Department in connection with [OUI] cases.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Exs. 2, 3). The Essex County District Attorney's Office identified two cases, one from 2012 and one from 2014, in which the incorrect advice-of-rights form was used. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 3). The Essex County District Attorney's Office also provided counsel a list of possible Hispanic OUI defendants who may have been given that form. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Ultimately, the District Attorney's Office identified approximately 300 defendants who may have received the erroneous form. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 129). However, the city and District Attorney were unable to locate many requested records, such as \"[a]ll records and communications related to any complaint about the Rights Form\" and \"[a]ll records and communications reflecting the identity of any person(s) who drafted, edited, revised or approved the Rights Form.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   On October 5, 2017, Pimentel brought suit against the City of Methuen, Methuen\n   Police Chief Joseph Solomon (in his individual and official capacities), Officers Jajuga, Alacron, and Tardiff (in their individual capacities), and Jonathan Blodgett, the Essex County District Attorney (in his official capacity).
