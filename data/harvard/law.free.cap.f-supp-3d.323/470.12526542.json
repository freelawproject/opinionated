Vullo, the Superintendent of Financial Services of the State of New York. This case involves the interplay between a proposed risk adjustment program by the New York State Superintendent of Financial Services for individual and small group insurance markets in New York State, and a federal risk adjustment program under the Affordable Care Act (the \"ACA\"). A risk adjustment program attempts to balance risks to insurers by requiring insurers with less risky groups of insureds to contribute to a pool to assist insurers with more risky pools. The plaintiffs contend that some of the funds awarded to them by the federal program will be taken away to assist other insurers in New York State because of specific New York State considerations. They contend that the New York State program is therefore preempted by the federal program and constitutes and unconstitutional taking and illegal exaction of their property in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The facts alleged in the complaint are accepted as true for purposes of the defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This case concerns the interaction of two government programs that were developed to regulate the health insurance market. One program was authorized by New York State and implemented by the defendant, Superintendent Vullo. The second program was authorized by the federal government and is implemented by two agencies of the federal government, the Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"). The plaintiffs' claims in this case concern the interaction of the state program with the federal program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Both the state and federal programs are \"risk adjustment\" programs that operate in the health insurance market. The purpose of a risk adjustment program is \"to encourage insurers to compete for enrollees' business based on the value and efficiency of an insurer's particular health insurance plan, rather than only competing for the healthiest enrollees.\" Compl. \u00b6 27. Risk adjustment programs fulfill this purpose by requiring insurers with enrollees who are healthier than the state-covered average in a given plan year to make payments into a common fund. Compl. \u00b6 28. Those funds are then transferred to insurers that incurred higher claim costs due to having enrollees who are sicker than the state-covered average in that same plan year. Compl. \u00b6 28. This system eliminates an insurer's incentive to seek to cover only the healthiest individuals, because such an insurer will be required to pay into the fund if its overall population of insureds is healthier than the state average. Various methodologies are employed by risk adjustment programs to determine which insurance companies must pay into the fund and which insurance companies are owed money from the fund in any given plan year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 1992, New York State enacted a law that required the Superintendent of the Department of Financial Services to promulgate regulations creating New York-specific risk adjustment pools.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Insurance%20Law%20%C2%A7%203233\">\n    N.Y.

In accordance with this mandate, on March 9, 1993, the Superintendent adopted regulations creating a risk adjustment program for the individual and small group health insurance markets in\n   New York. 11 NYCRR Part 361. From 1993 through 2013, the Superintendent administered this risk adjustment program in New York in the small and individual group insurance markets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The ACA was enacted in 2010 and made fully operational on January 1, 2014. Compl. \u00b6 19. The ACA is administered by HHS and CMS. Compl. \u00b6 21. One feature of the ACA was the development of a federal risk adjustment program (the \"FRAP\"), which the ACA authorized HHS to develop.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2018063\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 18063\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

New York State opted to have HHS implement the FRAP on Its behalf. Compl. \u00b6 45. HHS therefore operates the FRAP in New York. Compl. \u00b6 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   HHS developed the risk adjustment methodology to be applied under the FRAP. The methodology determines which insurance companies owe money into the program and which companies are owed money from the program in any given plan year. Compl. \u00b6 46. The final risk adjustment methodology is \"detailed and complex\" and has been amended by HHS over time. Compl. \u00b6 46. HHS uses data provided by the insurers to calculate the amount of the payments.

With respect to risk adjustment, the rule noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Based on our experience operating the 2014 benefit year risk adjustment program, HHS has become aware that certain issuers, including some new, rapidly growing, and smaller issuers, owed substantial risk adjustment charges that they did not anticipate. HHS has had a number of discussions with issuers and State regulators on ways to help ease issuers' transition to the new health insurance markets and the effects of unanticipated risk adjustment charge amounts. We believe that a robust risk adjustment program that addresses new market dynamics due to rating reforms and guaranteed issue is critical to the proper functioning of these new markets. However, we are sympathetic to these concerns and recognize that States are the primary regulators of their insurance markets.

They argue that it is \"simply implausible\" that HHS would have established methods of approval of a state risk adjustment program if those methods could be avoided by adopting a risk adjustment program pursuant to state law. The Superintendent has adopted a state risk adjustment program that operates after the FRAP has determined the adjustments to be made and after the payments are made using the federal methodology.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   But the requirements set forth in \u00a7 153.310 only apply to States who opt to implement the FRAP themselves. In other words, if a State wishes to \"administer the applicable Federally certified risk adjustment methodology\" itself, it must comply with the requirements set forth in \u00a7 153.310. But that provision does not require a State to seek HHS approval to implement a risk adjustment program that is governed by risk adjustment methodologies developed by that State, that takes into consideration state-specific concerns, and that is meant to remedy unintended consequences of the FRAP in the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Here, the Superintendent seeks to implement a state risk adjustment program pursuant to a state insurance law passed more than 25 years ago that granted the Superintendent the power to develop a risk adjustment program for the State.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Insurance%20Law%20%C2%A7%203233\">\n    N.Y. Insurance Law \u00a7 3233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Superintendent seeks to use a risk adjustment methodology developed by the State that is sensitive to factors unique to the New York health insurance markets and intended to remedy the adverse consequences of the FRAP in New York.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   11 NYCRR \u00a7 361.9(a)(4) (\"The federal risk adjustment methodology as applied in this State does not adequately address the impact of administrative costs and profit of the carriers and how this State counts children in certain calculations.\");\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Insurance%20Law%20%C2%A7%203233\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at (b)(1) (\"The [S]uperintendent anticipate that the federal risk adjustment program will adversely impact the small group health insurance market in this State in 2017 ....\"). The development of such a program does not conflict with \u00a7 153.310 because it does not seek to implement the FRAP, but rather seeks to develop a separate risk adjustment program focused on remedying adverse consequences of the FRAP in New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Additionally, HHS has explicitly acknowledged that such local programs may be necessary and encouraged States to consider adopting them. The defendant has represented that there were such adverse consequences from the FRAP on the health insurance market in New York.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Powell Decl. \u00b6 41, Docket No. 40 (\"Since the implementation of [the FRAP], two companies operating in New York's small group market, both of whom were required to make large payments into the [FRAP], have left the market.... The departure of both of these insurers has had negative and destabilizing effects on the health insurance market in New York with adverse impacts for both consumers and small businesses.\"); 11 NYCRR \u00a7 361.9(a)(2) (\"In certain respects, however, the calculations for the federal risk adjustment program do not take into account certain factors, resulting in unintended consequences.\"). The 2017 NYRA seeks to resolve those unintended consequences of the FRAP by using state authority to adopt a state specific risk adjustment program. The 2017 NYRA does not impede the federal program, but instead is complementary to the FRAP and furthers the purposes of the FRAP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   A final rule issued by CMS in April 2018, adopting regulations effective June 18, 2018, makes plain that the FRAP is not intended to preempt state programs. The rule addressed adjustments made to CMS's prior regulations implementing the ACA. With respect to risk adjustment, the rule reiterated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   However, we recognize that States are the primary regulators of their insurance markets. In the May 2016 Interim Final Rule, HHS recognized some State regulators' belief that reducing the magnitude of risk adjustment charge amounts could be beneficial to the insurance markets in their States. For some States, an adjustment to risk adjustment transfers calculated under the HHS-operated risk adjustment program might more precisely account for cost differences attributable to adverse selection in the respective State market risk pools. We encouraged States to examine whether any local approaches under State legal authority are warranted to help ease the transition for new entrants to the health insurance markets and mitigate the effects of large risk adjustment charge amounts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2016930\">\n    83 Fed.

The plaintiffs argue that the 2017 NYRA accomplishes the exact same reduction contemplated by this regulation, but does so without HHS approval. Accordingly, the plaintiffs argue that this regulation is a signal from HHS that States may not unilaterally make those reductions, but must submit a proposal for those reductions and gain approval of HHS. Essentially, the plaintiffs argue that, because HHS has set forth in a regulation a pathway for the States to request the very reduction that the defendant seeks to accomplish with the 2017 NYRA, HHS plainly believes those reductions should only be completed through this pathway and with HHS approval.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   But the final rule also directly addressed the 2017 NYRA in response to comments made about that regulation, and CMS made clear that the new regulation was not meant to displace State action taken pursuant to State authority.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2016930\">\n    83 Fed.

The final rule noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   [a] few commentators noted that New York has already taken action to reduce transfers under the State's authority, and requested clarification whether other\n   States could take steps under existing State authority. One commenter noted that the New York adjustment could be seen as permitting States to make adjustment without HHS approval and requested clarification that States making adjustments to the risk adjustment formula must first obtain approval from HHS under the risk adjustment program prior to implementing any State-specific adjustments.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2016930\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In response, rather than condemning the New York program as contrary to the FRAP, the rule reiterated that \"States are the primary regulators of their insurance markets\".\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20Fed.%20Reg.%2016930\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The rule continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   [W]e encourage States to examine whether any local approaches under State legal authority are warranted to help ease the transition for new participants to the health insurance markets. States that take action and make adjustments do not generally need HHS approval as these States are acting under their own State authority and using State resources.

Rather, it confirms that each State may take action pursuant to its own authority, but also notes that, if the State instead chooses to request a reduction from HHS, the State must submit that proposal for approval in accordance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20153.320\">\n    45 C.F.R. \u00a7 153.320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Thus, under the ACA and the implementing regulations as amended by the final rule, States have two options for addressing any unintended negative impacts of the FRAP in their local markets: (1) take action and make adjustments pursuant to state authority; or (2) request an adjustment to the federal risk adjustment transfers from HHS in accordance with the procedures set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20153.210\">\n    45 C.F.R. \u00a7 153.210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In sum, the fact that the agencies responsible for implementing the FRAP -- HHS and CMS -- have repeatedly stated that States may turn to their own authority to adjust for unintended consequences of the FRAP -- and have acknowledged that there have been such unintended consequences -- is strong evidence that the ACA does not preempt the 2017 NYRA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Accordingly, the plaintiffs' argument that the 2017 NYRA is preempted by the ACA is without merit.
