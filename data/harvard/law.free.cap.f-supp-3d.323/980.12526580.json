Before the Court is Defendant's motion for summary judgment, focused on the issue of whether GE owed Mr. Lawson a duty of care, as provided by federal permissible radiation dose limits. For the following reasons, Defendant's motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Prior to his retirement, Mr. Lawson was a highly skilled welder employed by The Great Atlantic Pacific Pipe Welding &amp; Construction Company, Inc. (\"GAPCO\"). GAPCO was created as a wholly owned subsidiary of Dimetrics, a company formed by Mr. Lawson's father-in-law to do business in the welding industry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   From 1979 through 1986, Mr. Lawson performed welding work on Boiling Water Reactors (\"BRW\") that were designed and manufactured by GE for use in nuclear power plants. Mr. Lawson worked on\n   BWRs installed in nuclear power plants located in California, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Illinois, Nebraska, Alabama, and Vermont. Mr. Lawson also performed welding work on a BWR located in Spain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The purpose of Mr. Lawson's work was to address and repair intergranular stress corrosion cracking that had developed in pipes attached to the BWRs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As an employee of GAPCO, Mr. Lawson's work on the BWRs consisted of two main categories: weld overlay and pipe replacement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This work required both manual and automated welding, with the latter using automated welding equipment developed by Dimetrics. Mr. Lawson spent most of his time working on the BWRs running the automated welding equipment, although he also performed some manual welds. Mr. Lawson was additionally tasked with training and supervising local welders hired to assist with the weld overlay and pipe replacement projects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Each power plant where Mr. Lawson worked was owned and operated by a \"Licensee.\" The term Licensee is this context refers to the utility that applied for and received a license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (\"NRC\") to operate a commercial nuclear power plant. Def.'s SOMF \u00b6 4. GE was not the Licensee of any of the power plants where Mr. Lawson worked. GE has produced a list of the Licensees for all of the power plants where Mr. Lawson worked. The list was compiled from publically available documents maintained by the NRC. Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint (\"FAC\") alleges that GE was a Licensee or otherwise maintained ownership or control over the relevant nuclear power plants or BWRs. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11, 14, 16, 19, 22, 40. Despite these allegations, Plaintiffs do not presently dispute that GE was not the Licensee of any of the power plants where Mr. Lawson worked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Licensees of the power plants where Mr. Lawson worked were responsible for hiring the various companies to complete the weld overlay and pipe replacement projects on the BWRs. The Licensees coordinated the projects through prime contractors, which in turn hired specialty subcontractors-including GAPCO-to perform specific maintenance activities. GE's role in repairing the BWRs was to ensure that the welds completed by Mr. Lawson and other GAPCO employees complied with relevant industry standards. GE also generally supported various aspects of the welding projects at the power plants where Mr. Lawson worked. GE initially contacted Dimetrics because the company had developed automated welding equipment that could remotely complete the welds on the BWRs. GE provided Dimetrics with weld specifications and Dimetrics developed the necessary procedures and protocols for its automated welding equipment. Dimetrics then contracted directly with the various prime contractors to provide the automated welding equipment. GAPCO was hired directly by the prime contractors to provide supervisors, such as Mr. Lawson, who had the expertise to use Dimetric's automated welding\n   equipment, as well as other qualified workers to complete the BWR welding projects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs' FAC alleges that GE failed to take the necessary precautionary measures to ensure that Mr. Lawson was not exposed to an amount of radiation in excess of federal permissible radiation dose limits\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   while working on the BWRs. FAC \u00b6\u00b6 10, 11, 33, 38. Plaintiffs additionally allege that GE required Mr. Lawson to continue working on its BWRs with knowledge that he had been cumulatively exposed to excessive and harmful levels of radiation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202011\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202011\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 34, 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The FAC specifically alleges that GE had a duty to protect Mr. Lawson from incurring occupational doses of radiation in excess of applicable federal permissible dose limits.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202011\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202011\">\n    \u00b6 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Mr. Lawson suffers from brain degeneration with dementia, allegedly as the result of his repeated exposure to excessive doses of radiation while working on the BWRs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their initial complaint against GE in the Northern District of California on May 28, 2015. In their initial complaint, Plaintiffs set forth six causes of action against GE: (1) Negligence; (2) Strict Liability for Ultra Hazardous Activities; (3) Strict Liability Manufacturing and Design Defect; (4) Premises Liability; (5) Negligence Per Se; and (6) Loss of Consortium. In response, GE filed a motion to dismiss based on two separate grounds: (1) Plaintiffs' six state claims were preempted by the Price-Anderson Act; and (2) the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In its September 23, 2015 Order, the court granted in part and denied in part GE's motion to dismiss. As an initial matter, the court considered whether Plaintiffs' complaint alleged a \"public liability action\" as defined by the Price-Anderson Act. The court stated that \"[u]nder the Price-Anderson Act, a public liability action is 'any suit asserting public liability,' \" with public liability defined as \"any legal liability arising out of or resulting from a nuclear incident.\"\n   <em>\n    Lawson v. Gen. Electric Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4198044\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/140/968/#p972\">\n    140 F.Supp.3d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 972 (N.D. Cal. 2015) (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202014\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (hh) and (w) ). The court further stated that \"[a] nuclear incident is 'any occurrence...causing ...bodily injury, sickness, disease, or death, or loss of or damage to property, or loss of use of property, arising out of or resulting from the radioactive, toxic, explosive, or other hazardous properties of source, special nuclear, or byproduct material.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202014\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202014\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (q) ). Based on these provisions, the court concluded that Plaintiffs' \"alleged exposure to radiation on the job is enough to constitute a nuclear incident,\" and therefore Plaintiffs' complaint alleged a public liability action under the Price-Anderson Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Next, the Court held that Plaintiffs' state law claims were preempted by the Price-Anderson Act because they were based on theories of liability that are inconsistent with the duty of care set by the applicable federal permissible dose limits. In reaching this decision, the court noted that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Courts have interpreted the effect of the Price-Anderson's \"hybrid\" provision as allowing state claims to proceed, but only so long as the measure of the Defendant's duty is proscribed by federal safety regulations setting forth radiation exposure limit. The dose limits are an attempt to reconcile public and worker safety with the inevitable reality that \"radiation workers of necessity will receive\n   some low level radiation exposure because some exposure in an unavoidable aspect of working in a radiation area.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202014\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202014\">\n    at 973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted). However, the court permitted Plaintiffs' negligence claim to proceed, but held that \"it becomes the 'public liability action' created by Price-Anderson, with the sole duty of care provided by\" the applicable federal permissible dose limits in Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202014\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202014\">\n    at 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court also noted that the applicable standard of care set by federal permissible dose limits would \"depend on the dates of the incident.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202014\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    TMI\n   </em>\n   , 67 F.3d at 1108 n. 10 ). Finally, in denying Defendants' motion in part, the Court held that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Following the court's dismissal of the state law claims, Plaintiffs filed their FAC alleging two causes of action: (1) a public liability action under the Price-Anderson Act; and (2) a state law negligence claim. Both causes of action alleged that GE breached the applicable federal permissible dose limits. However, Plaintiffs' negligence claim also alleged theories of liability based on negligence per se.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 41. In response, GE filed a motion to strike this portion of the FAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The court granted GE's motion to strike, holding that Plaintiffs' \"negligence per se theories of liability alleging a duty of care other than the regulations proscribing radiation exposure limits are preempted by the Price-Anderson Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Lawson v. Gen. Electric Co.\n   </em>\n   , 15-CV-02384-TEH,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%207710296\">\n    2015 WL 7710296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (N.D. Cal. Nov. 30, 2015). Thus, the court reaffirmed that \"while the Price-Anderson Act is not a complete preemption statute, it does preempt causes of action that are based on duties of care that are inconsistent with the sole duty of care in a public liability action, which is proscribed by federal safety regulations setting forth radiation exposure limits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On February 29, 2016, GE filed a motion to transfer venue under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202210\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (n)(2), arguing that venue was improper in the Northern District of California because Plaintiffs lacked evidence to support that Mr. Lawson's injuries arose from a nuclear incident in that district. The Court agreed, holding that GE demonstrated \"an absence of credible evidence that Mr. Lawson received an occupational dose of radiation at the Humboldt Bay Nuclear Power Plant...which is the location upon which Plaintiffs rely.\"\n   <em>\n    Lawson v. Gen. Electric Co.\n   </em>\n   , 15-CV-02384-TEH,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201427501\">\n    2016 WL 1427501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (N.D. Cal. Apr. 12. 2016). In determining the proper venue, the court considered Mr. Lawson's NRC Form 4: Occupational Dose History (\"Form 4\")-a document maintained by the NRC for the purpose of tracking the occupational radiation exposures of nuclear workers. The court noted that \"[t]he operators of power plants and other Licensees under the Price-Anderson Act are required to contribute to the Form 4.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201427501\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *3 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2020.2104\">\n    10 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.2104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The court found venue was proper in the Northern District of Illinois under 42 U.S.C.\u00a7 2210(n)(2), given that Mr. Lawson's Form 4 indicated that he received an occupational dose of radiation at the Dresden Generating Station nuclear power plant located in the Northern District of Illinois.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2020.2104\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2020.2104\">\n    at *4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiffs' counsel provides no citation to the court's September 23, 2015 Order, but rather presents the copied paragraphs as their own argument.

However, Plaintiffs fail to present any analysis showing how imposing a duty upon GE under Illinois law to comply with Part 20 dose limits is\n   <em>\n    consistent\n   </em>\n   with the Price-Anderson Act. Moreover, Plaintiffs argument completely ignores that Part 20 regulations impose this duty on the Licensee alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    O'Conner\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit held that \"federal regulations must provide the sole measure of the defendants' duty in a public liability cause of action.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1834611\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/13/1090/#p1095\">\n    13 F.3d at 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reaching this conclusion, the court explained that \"the field of nuclear safety has been occupied by federal regulation; there is no room for state law. Consequently, 'states are preempted from imposing a non-federal duty in tort, because any state duty would infringe upon pervasive federal safety regulations in the field of nuclear safety, and thus would conflict with federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1834611\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/13/1090/#p1095\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    TMI\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10525812\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/940/832/#p852\">\n    940 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   859 ). The Court further explained that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Congress has attempted for nearly fifty years to encourage private sector involvement in the nuclear industry and at the same time has sought to protect the public. The Price-Anderson Act was enacted to promote these goals of \"protect[ing] the public and ... encourag[ing] the development of the atomic energy industry.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202012\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the Price-Anderson Act limits liability and provides for indemnification, but does so against a stringent regulatory background. The federal nuclear safety regulations are part of this statutory scheme. Imposing a standard of care other than the federal regulations would disturb the carefully crafted balance between private involvement and safety that Congress has achieved. Thus, the application of something other than the federal safety regulations as a standard\n   of care is inconsistent with the Price-Anderson scheme and consequently cannot be applied in a public liability action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202012\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202012\">\n    at 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Part 20 regulations, including Part 20 dose limits, apply only to the Licensees of nuclear power plants.

Thus, following the court's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    O'Conner\n   </em>\n   , imposing a duty upon GE under Illinois law to comply with Part 20 dose limits would be inconsistent with the pervasive federal safety regulations that are part of the Price-Anderson statutory scheme.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Conner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1834611\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/13/1090/#p1095\">\n    13 F.3d at 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he Amendments Act provides that state law shall be applied only as long as it is consistent with the Price Anderson Act\" (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202014\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (hh) ).

GE was never the Licensee the power plants where Mr. Lawson worked and received occupational doses of radiation. Therefore, GE owed no duty to Mr. Lawson to comply with the dose limits set forth in section 20.101. Further, imposing a duty upon GE under Illinois law to comply with section 20.101 would be inconsistent with the federal nuclear safety regulations that are part of the Price-Anderson statutory scheme. Thus, to the extent that Illinois law would impose a duty upon GE in this case to comply with section 20.101, it is preempted.
