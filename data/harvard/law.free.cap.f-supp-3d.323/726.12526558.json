Hawaii\n   </em>\n   will likely provide dispositive guidance on some or all of the issues in this case; (2) other courts hearing challenges to the Proclamation and other versions of the travel ban have stayed district court proceedings pending a ruling from the Supreme Court; and (3) the Supreme Court might resolve the merits of Plaintiffs' claims, eliminating the need for further district court proceedings. The Government further argues that, at a minimum, this case should not proceed to discovery because (1) appellate decisions will likely provide important guidance regarding the scope of discovery; (2) Plaintiffs have not justified a need for immediate discovery; and (3) the requested stay is reasonable in length and will not prejudice Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiffs oppose the Motion to Stay, arguing that a stay would cause further injury in the form of prolonged separation from family members, some of whom are elderly, very ill, or at risk of persecution. They claim that the prospect of the Supreme Court deciding the merits of their claims is speculative, and, in any event, their free speech, equal protection, due process, free association, and Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") claims are not before the Supreme Court. Plaintiffs also argue that the Government has not shown that it will be significantly burdened without a stay. They instead request to move forward with discovery now, regardless of whether a motion to dismiss is filed, and assert that discovery can initially be limited to (1) obtaining two reports with attachments submitted by the Secretary of Homeland Security to the President, identified in Sections 1(c) and 1(h) of the Proclamation; (2) receiving materials related to procedures used by government officials to implement the waiver process described in Section 3(c) of the Proclamation; and (3) responding to Government requests relating to the extent of Plaintiffs' injuries. Plaintiffs acknowledge the prospect of contested discovery but argue that the specter of discovery disputes necessitates that the discovery process begin sooner rather than later, to account for any attendant delays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

First, where the questions presented are framed not in terms of Plaintiffs' likelihood of success on them, but as specific legal questions to be resolved by the Supreme Court, there is the potential that the Supreme Court will resolve them on the merits.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hobby Lobby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12582424\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2751/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2785 ; (resolving the merits of legal issues in an appeal of a motion for a preliminary injunction);\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/\">\n    567 U.S. at 416\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Second, in the absence of a stay, the next step in these cases would be for the Government to file either an answer or a motion to dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12. The Government has stated its intention to file a motion to dismiss in which it will assert several threshold bases for dismissal relating to justiciability, including that immigration exclusion decisions are non-reviewable and that Plaintiffs lack standing. Beyond these threshold questions, the Government also plans to assert that Plaintiffs have failed to state a viable statutory claim under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\") or constitutional claim under the Establishment Clause. Although this Court ruled on these issues in resolving the Motion for a Preliminary Injunction, and it has controlling guidance on the constitutional claim from the Fourth Circuit, which ruled that the Establishment Clause claim is justiciable and that the Proclamation likely violates the Establishment Clause,\n   <em>\n    IRAP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516071\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/883/233/\">\n    883 F.3d at 257, 269-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and persuasive authority from the Ninth Circuit on the justiciability and viability of the statutory claims,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hawaii\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265601\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/662/\">\n    878 F.3d at 678, 694, 697-98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the Government continues to contest these issues in the Supreme Court. Thus, waiting for the Supreme Court to rule would likely simplify this Court's task in resolving a motion to dismiss, while moving forward without a stay would likely result in a ruling by this Court that would be subject to revisitation and potential modification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For example, where the Government would likely make the same justiciability challenges in a motion to dismiss that it has asserted before the Supreme Court, the Court's determination of these issues would not be definitive until after the Supreme Court rules and, in all likelihood, until after one party or the other seeks reconsideration of this Court's rulings on the justiciability issues in light of the new Supreme Court guidance. Likewise, any ruling on a motion to dismiss on whether Plaintiffs have a plausible claim that the President exceeded his statutory authority under the INA would be effectively provisional and thus inefficient. While neither this Court's issuance of the preliminary injunction nor the Fourth Circuit's upholding of it relied on Plaintiffs' INA claims, the INA was the basis for the decisions of both the District of Hawaii and the Ninth Circuit, whose opinion is now squarely before the Supreme Court. With the Supreme Court poised to answer the questions of law on the INA claims in\n   <em>\n    Trump v. Hawaii\n   </em>\n   , which largely if not entirely map onto the INA claims here, it would be a waste of scarce resources for this Court to resolve a motion to dismiss on these claims at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As for the Government's arguments for dismissal of an Establishment Clause claim, this Court's analysis would be informed by any Supreme Court guidance on the proper standard for reviewing such a claim. In enjoining the Proclamation on the basis that Plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that it violated the Establishment Clause, this Court relied on\n   the Fourth Circuit's analysis and application of the holding of\n   <em>\n    Kleindienst v.

To consider and resolve a motion to dismiss in advance of the Supreme Court's decision would be inefficient, regardless of whether that decision proves to be consistent or inconsistent with this Court's ruling on such a motion, because one or more parties would undoubtedly and justifiably seek re-litigation of the motion in light of the new guidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In light of this reality, Plaintiffs alternatively argue that rather than consider a motion to dismiss, this Court should simply permit the parties to commence discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   However, in the normal practice of this District, discovery does not commence until after resolution of a motion to dismiss. The reason for this general practice is sensible: a court's ruling on a motion to dismiss may assist in defining the contours of discovery. The Court presently does not see any persuasive reason to deviate from this path. Because, as discussed above, there are questions relating to all aspects of this case-its justiciability, its statutory basis, and its constitutional basis-presently before the Supreme Court, allowing discovery to proceed would likely not quicken the pace of this case, but instead bog it down in motions practice, with the parties essentially relitigating unsettled legal questions through discovery. Whether documents such as the reports sought by Plaintiffs must be produced in discovery likely depends on both the justiciability of Plaintiffs' claims and the applicable review standard for constitutional claims, to be defined by the Supreme Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re United States\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12615187\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/443/#p445\">\n    138 S.Ct. 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 445,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12615187\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/443/#p445\">\n    199 L.Ed.2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017) (stating that the district court should have deferred ordering the production of documents for completion of the administrative record until after it had ruled on the Government's threshold arguments for dismissal). Until the legal landscape is charted by the Supreme Court, discovery will be a fraught enterprise, steeply taxing both the parties and this Court. While such an expenditure of resources might be necessary if resolution of this case by the Supreme Court was remote in time,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Landis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5722825\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/299/248/#p254\">\n    299 U.S. at 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5722825\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/299/248/#p254\">\n    57 S.Ct. 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting a stay that threatened to stretch over two years while parallel appellate proceedings unfolded), in light of the briefing and argument schedule implemented by the Supreme Court, a decision will likely be issued by the end of June 2018, resulting in a total delay in the case of approximately six months. In light of all of these considerations, the Court concludes that judicial economy weighs strongly in favor of a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Harm to the Government\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On the factor of the hardship to the moving party if the case is not stayed, the Court does not find that potential prejudice to the Government provides a compelling basis for a stay. Although a denial of a stay will require the Government to expend resources in litigation, where the Government unilaterally adopted a sweeping Proclamation affecting millions of individuals across multiple nations and the American family members and other interested parties to whom those individuals are connected, it is not unfair to expect that the Government would be required to devote significant resources to litigation defending its action. Moreover, unlike certain private parties, the Government has the resources to litigate without significant hardship or prejudice. Accordingly, this factor does not weigh in favor of a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Harm to Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The potential harm or prejudice to Plaintiffs resulting from a stay is more significant. For example, Plaintiff Sumaya Hamadmad's father-in-law is currently in Syria, is 81-years-old, and has been diagnosed with cancer. Another individual Plaintiff is 79-years-old and wheelchair bound, and she and her 90-year-old husband are separated from their son, who is currently in Iran. At least two relatives of individual Plaintiffs, currently residing in Turkey and Kuwait, respectively, are at risk of being returned to Syria, where they could face persecution. Another individual Plaintiff's husband lives in the United Arab Emirates but is at risk of being returned to Iran, where he could be subjected to persecution. The Proclamation has thus separated children from parents and husbands from wives, perhaps forever,\n   and it has increased the risk that Plaintiffs' family members could face persecution. These \"human aspects\" of the potential impact of a stay upon Plaintiffs are of \"particular significance in balancing the competing interests of the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Williford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1882320,6127795\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/715/124/\">\n    715 F.2d at 127-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, this factor weighs against a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Balance of Factors\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   On balance, however, the Court concludes that the orderly course of justice requires that all three cases be stayed pending the Supreme Court's resolution of\n   <em>\n    Trump v. Hawaii.\n   </em>\n   The Court reaches this conclusion not because factors of judicial economy are more important than the potential harm to Plaintiffs, but because the Court is convinced that proceeding with this case now does not necessarily mean that Plaintiffs will receive a faster resolution. As noted above, the immediate litigation of a motion to dismiss, the next step in this case, would likely be wasted once the Supreme Court issues its ruling in\n   <em>\n    Trump v. Hawaii\n   </em>\n   , because a renewed round of briefing would almost certainly be required to allow for proper consideration of the Supreme Court's guidance, leaving the parties no closer to a resolution than if the matter were stayed. Furthermore, the lack of final resolution on the applicable law would likely prolong and burden the discovery process, such that commencement of discovery at this point may prove less, rather than more, efficient. The Court concludes that a more appropriate way to address the ongoing harm to Plaintiffs would be to proceed with the case on an expedited basis following the Supreme Court's decision, in the event that the preliminary injunction is not reinstated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Thus, in granting a stay, the Court offers two qualifications. First, the Court's ruling is based on the assumption that the Supreme Court will issue a decision by the end of June 2018, approximately two months from now, resulting in a total stay of approximately six months. The Court's Order will therefore impose a stay until the issuance of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Trump v. Hawaii\n   </em>\n   or June 30, 2018, whichever comes first. If no opinion is issued in that time frame, the parties may renew their respective motions. Second, in order to mitigate the harm of a stay to Plaintiffs, in the event that the Supreme Court's decision does not result in a reinstatement of the preliminary injunction, the Court will proceed with these cases on an expedited basis, which may include steps such as shortening the typical time periods for briefing motions, responding to discovery requests, and completing all discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Motion for a Stay is GRANTED.\n   <em>\n    International Refugee Assistance Project v. Trump\n   </em>\n   , TDC-17-0361;\n   <em>\n    Iranian Alliances Across Borders v. Trump\n   </em>\n   , TDC-17-2921; and\n   <em>\n    Zakzok v.
