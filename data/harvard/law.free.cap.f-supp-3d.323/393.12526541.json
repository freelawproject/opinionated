WOODS, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In 2014, Brazil found itself embroiled in what has become a widely publicized scandal. Brazilian authorities launched an investigation (Operation \"Lava Jato\" or \"Car Wash\") into a sprawling bribery and kickback scheme. Construction and engineering conglomerates were accused of bribing government officials in order to secure lucrative contracts. Not initially implicated in the scandal, Defendant Odebrecht, S.A. and several of its subsidiaries later joined the ranks of those targeted by Brazilian prosecutors and police investigators. Odebrecht's CEO was arrested, indicted, and sentenced to prison in connection with his participation in the scheme. Odebrecht itself pleaded guilty to charges brought against it in the Eastern District of New York. Plaintiffs, who purchased substantial quantities of Notes issued\n   by Defendant Odebrecht Finance, Ltd. and guaranteed by Defendant Construtora Norberto Odebrecht (\"CNO\"), saw the value of their holdings drop precipitously after news of Defendants' participation in the bribery scheme. Plaintiffs filed suit, asserting claims against Defendants under Section 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, as well as various state law claims. Defendants Odebrecht Finance, CNO, and Odebrecht Engenharia E Constru\u00e7\u00e3o S.A. (\"OEC\") have moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' claims. Because Plaintiffs adequately plead that CNO's failure to disclose its participation in the bribery scheme rendered its explanation for its success materially misleading, Plaintiffs' Section 10(b) claim with respect to that statement survives. And because Plaintiffs sufficiently plead their intentional fraudulent conveyance claim, that claim also survives dismissal. Defendants' motion is granted with respect to Plaintiffs' remaining claims against the moving Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Rather, its only listed assets are long-term receivables from Odebrecht and other \"Odebrecht-related entities of questionable solvency.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Plaintiffs, Odebrecht and CNO have treated Odebrecht Finance as \"their own piggy-bank, sweeping every dime out of the company in exchange for only a small number of utterly worthless 'receivables.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.

From 2010 through 2014, the company issued billions of dollars in notes, all of which were guaranteed by CNO.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. Between May 6, 2013 and March 31, 2015, Plaintiffs purchased significant quantities of two bonds issued by Odebrecht Finance: (1) 7.125% Notes due on June 26, 2042 (the \"7.125% Notes\"), and (2) 7.50% Perpetual Notes (the \"7.50% Notes\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-26.

Odebrecht Finance immediately conveyed all of the proceeds from sales of the notes to CNO and Odebrecht without receiving anything of equivalent value in return.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.

Defendants' Alleged Bribery and Kickback Scheme\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Between 2001 and 2016, CNO and Odebrecht paid at least $800 million in bribes to government officials in Brazil and at least a dozen other countries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. These bribes were paid \"in order to influence the award of more than 100 large construction contracts to CNO.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In furtherance of this scheme, Defendants established the Division of Structured Operations (the \"Division\") as a \"standalone division\" of Odebrecht in 2006.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41. The Division had one purpose: to act as a \"bribe department,\" making \"illicit payments\" to government officials in exchange for public contracts for CNO.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. From 2006 to 2009, Marcelo Odebrecht approved the Division's payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. After Marcelo became the CEO of Odebrecht in 2009, Hilberto Silva became the head of the Division.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Silva reported directly to Marcelo, providing Marcelo with periodic updates of the bribes paid by the Division.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Of the $788 million that was paid by the Division in bribes from 2001 through 2016, $349 million was paid to Brazilian officials and political parties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-50. The Division paid, for example, $20 million to Guido Mantega, Brazil's former Finance Minister, and other officials to secure a $184 million transportation project for CNO.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. The Division also paid $9.7 million to Paulo Roberto Costa, a Brazilian legislator, in exchange for a $142 million public construction contract for CNO.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52. In all, Defendants received over $1.9 billion in benefits from the contracts secured by the bribes to Brazilian officials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50. The Division also paid approximately $439 million to officials and political parties outside of Brazil.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. Defendants obtained contracts valued in excess of $1.4 billion as a result.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Overall, Defendants benefited in excess of $3.3 billion from contracts secured by bribes between 2001 and 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The money used to make the bribes was obtained through various \"off the books\" means, including: (1) collection of standing overhead charges from clients; (2) attributing overcharges and fees to service providers and subcontractors as legitimate without including them in project budgets; (3) undeclared retainers and success fees for the purchase of company assets; and (4)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   self-insurance and self-guarantee transactions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46. After the funds were generated, they were not recorded.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Rather, the funds were sent by the Division to a series of offshore entities that were not identified as related entities in CNO or Odebrecht's financial statements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Division laundered the bribe payments through a network of banks located in countries with \"strict bank-secrecy laws.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. The Division also funneled the money through various \"dummy corporations\" that transacted with \"friendly\" banks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. By 2010, one of the banks used by the Division located in Antigua collapsed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. Division executives Fernando Migliaccio and Luiz Eduardo Soares then purchased the majority interest in another Antigua bank, and that bank began to charge Odebrecht a 2% \"commission\" to launder the bribe payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43, 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Division did not record the bribe payments in CNO and Odebrecht's accounting records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44. Rather, the Division used two \"shadow\" systems to track the payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The \"MyWebDay\" system was used to generate payment requests, process payments, and create spreadsheets documenting the payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The \"Drousys\" system was used by Division employees to communicate with each other and \"other co-conspirators\" using secure email and instant messaging.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Both of these systems were accessible only by Division members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Neither CNO nor Odebrecht reported the bribe payments in their reported financial results, and the payments were also concealed from external auditors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In 2014, Brazilian law enforcement began investigating bribes accepted by executives of a state-owned oil company, Petrobras, in an operation coined Lavo Jato, or \"Operation Car Wash.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 56, 81. Initially, Odebrecht and CNO were not targets of that investigation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56. After the investigation began, Defendants concealed and destroyed evidence of their own bribe payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57. In addition, Odebrecht bribed Antiguan Prime Minister Gaston Browne so that he would prevent Brazilian authorities from obtaining subpoenaed documents from Antigua banks through which the Division had laundered bribe money.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   By the time of Operation Car Wash, the Division ran a \"substantial portion\" of the bribery scheme in the United States.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. In light of the investigation, Marcelo Odebrecht told Silva to flee Brazil and to continue the Division's work outside of the grip of Brazilian authorities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, Marcelo told Silva, \"I think you all should go abroad to work because here, when you use the phone you will be scared, when you use the computer you will be afraid. You will be afraid your offices will be bugged ... [a]nd you will fall asleep wondering whether the next day the police will come for you.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alterations in original). Silva stayed in Brazil, but Migliaccio and Soares moved to Miami and \"got cover jobs\" working in Odebrecht's office there.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   By 2015, due to Silva's medical issues, Migliaccio and Soares were operating the Division.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59. Migliaccio and Soares conducted some business for the Division in the Dominican Republic, but a majority of the bribe-related work was conducted from Florida.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   According to the second amended complaint, it was not until June 19, 2015, when Marcelo Odebrecht was arrested, that Odebrecht and CNO were implicated in the scandal.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82. Silva, Migliaccio, and Soares were also arrested by Brazilian law enforcement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63. They, along with Marcelo, all agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for leniency.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C. CNO's GAAP Violations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that many of Defendants' public statements were rendered\n   false or misleading as a result of the undisclosed bribery scheme. Among those statements are CNO's quarterly and annual financial statements. According to Plaintiffs, those statements were false and misleading because they did not comply with Brazilian generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege four ways in which CNO's financial statements violated Brazilian GAAP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   First, Plaintiffs allege that the 2009 through 2015 financial statements failed to provide for \"the clearly foreseeable and estimable financial obligations arising from [CNO's] ongoing illegal bribery scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68. According to Plaintiffs, the illicit bribery scheme carried with it \"a knowable and estimable range of possible civil, criminal and financial penalties and consequences.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70. Paragraph 37 of the\n   <em>\n    Conceptual Structure for the Preparation and Presentation of the Financial Statements\n   </em>\n   promulgated by the Brazilian Accounting Standards Committee (Comit\u00ea de Pronunciamentos Cont\u00e1beis or \"CPC\") recognizes that certain liabilities may only be measured \"using a high degree of estimation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69. A \"provision\" must be identified as a charge against income under the Brazilian\n   <em>\n    Technical Pronouncement CPC 25 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Assets\n   </em>\n   when \"(1) it is probable that a present obligation for a past event or conduct exists; (2) which will more likely than not require a future disbursement to settle the obligation; and (3) a reasonable estimate of the required disbursement to settle the obligation can be made after weighing all possible outcomes or ranges of outcomes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the potential financial consequences of the bribery scheme were estimable, Plaintiffs allege that CNO's failure to accrue a provision for those estimated consequences and to simultaneously charge the estimate against income violated CPC 25.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Second, and related to the first, Plaintiffs allege that CNO failed to disclose the illegal bribery scheme and its \"clearly foreseeable and estimable expected financial costs\" in the notes to the company's publicly filed financial statements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71. Brazilian GAAP, and CPC 25 in particular, requires a separate disclosure in the financial statement notes that includes a \"(1) brief description of the nature of the provision or contingent liability, including an expected timeline during which disbursement will be made to settle the obligation; and (2) an indication of any uncertainties related to the value or amount of settlement of the liability, including the main assumptions adopted related to future events.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72. This disclosure in the notes is required even if a company does not accrue a provision because there is no present obligation or it is impossible to create a sufficiently reliable estimate of the cost of such a liability.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73. Because CNO failed to disclose any information related to the bribery scheme, Plaintiffs allege that CNO has separately violated this provision of CPC 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Third, Plaintiffs allege that CNO's financial statements violated Brazilian GAAP because they failed to disclose the revenues from foreign and domestic contracts that the company obtained as a result of the bribes that it paid separately from CNO's other contract revenue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74. CPC 00 (\n   <em>\n    Conceptual Structure for the Preparation and Presentation of the Financial Statements\n   </em>\n   ) explains that common practice is to separately disclose different types of revenue \"to assist investors\n   in assessing the ability of a business to generate cash in the future and distinguish revenues that arise in the normal course of the entity's business from revenues stemming from contingent activities that may not be repeated on a regular basis.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75. Plaintiffs allege that investors and others would not \"necessarily\" have expected contract revenue obtained by fraud to be a reliable indicator of future revenue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs allege that CNO's financial statements were prepared in violation of Brazilian GAAP because they failed to disclose the monies that were paid in bribes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77. CPC 00 (Basic Conceptual Pronouncement) and CPC 17 (Construction Contracts) require that the books and financial records of a company reflect the \"assets and expenses directly associated with generating particular contract revenue.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Those assets and expenses must also be reflected in a company's income statement in the same period as the revenue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   By concealing the costs of the CNO contracts (the bribes), Plaintiffs allege, CNO failed to comply with GAAP.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs further allege that CNO was required to disclose the bribe funds in the notes to its financial statements, yet failed to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Other False and Misleading Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiffs also allege that Defendants misrepresented CNO's financial status from March 23, 2011 through May 6, 2016 (the \"Relevant Period\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 83. The allegedly false and misleading statements were contained in offering memoranda, public statements including press releases, and statements made directly to Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Offering Memoranda\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Odebrecht Finance initially sold its Notes in private offerings pursuant to various offering memoranda.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84. Those offering memoranda disclosed CNO's financial condition, including that a majority of the company's revenues were from large-scale engineering and construction projects completed for governmental and quasi-governmental entities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to the second amended complaint, Odebrecht Finance was responsible for all of the statements in the offering memoranda as the issuer of the Notes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 100, 113, 129. Plaintiffs allege that various statements in the offering memoranda were false or misleading, as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    a. 7.50% Notes Offering Memorandum\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The offering memorandum issued on November 15, 2011 in connection with the Odebrecht Finance 7.50% Notes (\"7.50% Notes OM\") included the following financial information for CNO: CNO's unaudited financial statements for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2010 and June 30, 2011; CNO's audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2010; and CNO's audited financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 85-86. According to the second amended complaint, those financial results were false and misleading because they violated Brazilian GAAP, as discussed earlier in Section I.C.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.

Besides being uncharacteristic of the executive, it would make no sense to suggest \"destroying\" (not the contents, as intended, but literally, as interpreted the police authority) emails that were seized during the operation conducted in November 2014, which were widely investigated and made public. Destroying something that is already in the custody of the PF and Judge Sergio Moro makes no sense. In other words, the term \"destroy\" must have a different meaning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-189\">\n   Finally, Odebrecht regrets that an attempt was made to create a procedural issue regarding an expression that was clearly taken out of context. Through a petition and personal contact, the company's lawyers have attempted to show the police that it makes no sense to raise suspicions about the subject, but unfortunately they have opted to publicize it and lend a whiff of scandal to a note that merely contains a client's instructions to his lawyers-thereby violating the [confidential] relationship that the law guarantees to all Brazilian citizens.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alteration in original).

A review of the context of that statement is particularly illuminating. In the paragraphs immediately leading up to that statement, CNO explains the competitive bidding process. Carlinsky Decl., Ex. A at 59 (\"7.125% Notes OM\"), Ex. B (\"7.50% Notes OM\") at 65. CNO then states that it faces competition from international construction companies in Brazil \"as a result of liberalization of Brazilian government rules that had previously limited foreign competitors.\" 7.125% Notes OM at 59; 7.50% Notes OM at 65. The offering memoranda explain that international firms at the time were \"seeking to increase their presence in the Brazilian construction industry,\" but that CNO believed that \"domestic players\" maintained certain advantages. 7.125% Notes OM at 59-60; 7.50% Notes OM at 65. Internationally, CNO stated, the company competed with \"some of the largest contractors in the world.\" 7.125% Notes OM at 60; 7.50% Notes OM at 65. This context would suggest to an ordinary investor that CNO faced increasingly stiff competition, both domestically and internationally. Any advantages that CNO had over its competitors would likely have been relevant to a potential investor's decision to purchase Notes guaranteed by CNO. Therefore, Plaintiffs allege that CNO sufficiently placed in issue the reasons for its success amidst such competition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-329\">\n   While CNO's ability to secure projects that it bid on may very well have been due to its engineering capabilities and experience, decentralized management approach, and access to Brazilian governmental funding, an ordinary investor would be misled by the company's failure to disclose that an additional reason for its success was its illegal bribery scheme.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    VEON\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204162342\">\n    2017 WL 4162342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (finding defendant's failure to disclose bribes actionable when the company disclosed only the legitimate reasons for its success);\n   <em>\n    City of Brockton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204832321\">\n    2014 WL 4832321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *17 (\"[A]lthough a defendant does not have a Rule 10b-5 duty to speculate about the risk of future investigation or litigation, if it puts the topic of the cause of its financial success at issue, then it is obligated to disclose information concerning the source of its success, since reasonable investors would find that such information would significantly alter the mix of available information.\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) );\n   <em>\n    In re Par Pharm., Inc.

SAC \u00b6 75. Plaintiffs allege that under CPC 00, CNO should have disclosed separately the revenue derived from unlawfully obtained contracts and that derived from lawfully obtained contracts.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74-75. However, as discussed below, Plaintiffs fail to identify which, if any, revenue derived from unlawfully obtained contracts during the periods for which CNO's financial figures were disclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-338\">\n   The fourth alleged GAAP violation is insufficiently pleaded for the same reason as the third. Plaintiffs allege that CNO violated CPCs 00 and 17, \"which require that assets and expenses directly associated with generating particular contract revenue must be reflected in the books and records of the entity and must be simultaneously recognized in the income statement in the same period as the revenue.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77. According to the second amended complaint, CNO violated CPCs 00 and 17 by failing to report the bribe payments as expenses associated with the contracts that CNO secured. Plaintiffs allege that between 2001 and 2016, CNO, through the Division, paid over $788 million in illicit bribes to secure contracts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49. Specifically, between 2010 and 2014, the Division paid more than $20 million to Guido Mantega, the former Finance Minister of Brazil, as well as other public officials in exchange for assistance in securing a $184 million contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. Between 2011 and 2014, the Division paid $9.7 million to Paulo Roberto Costa, a Brazilian legislator, for aid in securing a $142 million contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52. The second amended complaint also lists various bribes paid to officials in countries other than Brazil.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 232. All of the bribe payment allegations, however, do not provide specific dates on which the bribes were paid or on which their corresponding contracts were granted to CNO or Odebrecht. Plaintiffs merely provide date ranges, which involve several years, and the total sums paid in each country. As explained above, the offering memoranda contain CNO's financial results for 2009 through the first quarter of 2012. Therefore, any bribe payments that resulted in contract revenue obtained before or after those periods-or otherwise not reported during the relevant periods-could not have been considered costs to be reported against the revenues listed in the offering memoranda. Because the second amended complaint does not identify which illegally obtained contract revenues were reported in those financial statements and the corresponding bribe payments that should have been reported as expenses, the second amended complaint fails to plead with particularity CNO's violation of CPCs 00 and 17.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   And to the extent that Plaintiffs allege that CNO violated CPCs 00 and 17 because it also failed to report the income generated \"off the books\" to pay the bribes, Plaintiffs do not allege that CNO itself-as opposed to another Odebrecht-related entity-generated that income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-339\">\n   <strong>\n    iii.

Nonetheless, the Court observes that Plaintiffs' allegations in this respect are internally inconsistent. Plaintiffs allege that the reported statement was false because \"despite their statements to the contrary, Defendants Odebrecht and CNO were embroiled in the Petrobras investigation, and were certain to be charged criminally or civilly by Brazilian and a host of other governments.\" SAC \u00b6 174. Plaintiffs provide no further facts to support this conclusory allegation. At the same time, Plaintiffs allege that \"the first indication that CNO and Odebrecht were involved in this scandal was the June 19, 2015 arrest of Odebrecht's Chief Executive Officer, Marcelo Odebrecht.\" SAC \u00b6 82. It is unclear from these allegations what Plaintiffs mean when they assert that CNO was \"certain to be charged criminally or civilly,\" yet also allege that the company was first implicated in the scandal in mid-2015. Given the competing allegations of the complaint, Plaintiffs insufficiently allege that the statement that CNO had not been impacted by the Petrobras investigation was false when it was made.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Salahuddin v.

The offering memoranda at issue here state that CNO \"ha[s] applied to list the notes on the Official List of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange\" and that CNO \"will furnish to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange all such information required in connection with the listing of the notes.\" Carlinsky Decl., Ex. A at iv, Ex. B at iv. These statements strongly suggest that it was CNO, as the guarantor of the Notes, that undertook the filing of the prospectuses in connection with the Notes' listing. Further, as the Court has explained, it is CNO, not Odebrecht Finance, that has made the warrants required by Article 9, section 1. On these facts, it appears that CNO is the entity responsible for the information contained in the prospectus, and not Odebrecht Finance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-365\">\n   Plaintiffs point to no additional authority that supports the proposition that an issuer of securities, as a matter of law, is always the maker of any statement contained in a prospectus or offering memorandum that is issued in connection with those securities. In the absence of such authority, and for the reasons stated above, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs have failed to plead Odebrecht Finance's ultimate authority over CNO's financial disclosures reported in the offering memoranda. Because Odebrecht Finance is not alleged to be a \"maker\" of those statements, it cannot be held liable under Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-366\">\n   <strong>\n    c. CNO's Other Misstatements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-367\">\n   Defendants argue that CNO's misstatements made during conference calls and meetings are also inactionable. Defs.' Mem. at 19;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 142-44, 174. Plaintiffs' allegations with respect to those statements are sparse: they do not identify the statements that were made. The allegations regarding the March 23, 2011 conference call, for example, merely explain that the call was held on that date \"regarding various issues related to the Odebrecht Finance Notes, including issues related to potential tender offers and consent fees for covenant changes for investors.\" SAC \u00b6 142. The second amended complaint says nothing about what particular statements were made during that call or why they were false or misleading. Similarly, the allegation regarding the March 24, 2011 meeting states that CNO employees met with Plaintiffs' representatives on that date \"to discuss CNO's operating results and business prospects.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 143. According to Plaintiffs, CNO's \"disclosures\" were false and misleading,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , but Plaintiffs fail to identify what those disclosures were or even the specific reporting period for which CNO's \"operating results\" were discussed. Continuing in similar fashion, Plaintiffs next allege the falsity of CNO's \"disclosures\" made during a January 11, 2012 conference call in which CNO \"discussed its operating results and future business prospects, including the funding\n   of 'sister subsidiaries.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 144. Once again, Plaintiffs fail to allege the specific disclosures that were false. And finally, Plaintiffs allege that CNO's \"disclosures\" made during a March 24, 2015 conference in Miami were false, yet fail to plead the particular disclosures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 175. These allegations are insufficient to state a Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5 claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ATSI Commc'ns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3512868\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/493/87/#p99\">\n    493 F.3d at 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that, to satisfy Rule 9(b)'s requirement, a complaint must \"(1) specify the statements that the plaintiff contends were fraudulent, (2) identify the speaker, (3) state where and when the statements were made, and (4) explain why the statements were fraudulent\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-368\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Odebrecht Finance's Financial Statements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-369\">\n   Defendants also move to dismiss Plaintiffs' Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims against Odebrecht Finance that are predicated on Odebrecht Finance's financial statements contained in the offering memoranda. Plaintiffs allege that Odebrecht Finance's financial disclosures were false and misleading because \"they failed and omitted to disclose that the possibility of Odebrecht Finance repaying the Notes had been materially diminished because the parties upon which Odebrecht Finance was completely dependent were engaged in the Bribery and Kickback Scheme, which subjected them to serious undisclosed risks and made the possibility of repayment significantly less than disclosed.\" SAC \u00b6\u00b6 100, 114. Plaintiffs point to no duty requiring Odebrecht Finance to disclose the bribery scheme-of which, as discussed below, Plaintiffs fail to allege that Odebrecht Finance had knowledge. And Plaintiffs point to no particular statement made by Odebrecht Finance that was rendered false and misleading by this omission, such as any disclosure by Odebrecht Finance regarding its ability to repay the Notes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. This is insufficient to state a claim under Section 10(b) or Rule 10b-5.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ATSI Commc'ns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3512868\" index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/493/87/#p99\">\n    493 F.3d at 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-370\">\n   <strong>\n    e.

Defs.' Mem. at 24 n.23. The Court agrees. Those statements, among other things, declared unlawful the arrest of Marcelo Odebrecht and touted Marcelo's innocence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 190, 192, 196, 197, 204. They were each issued after Marcelo Odebrecht's June 2015 arrest.

SAC \u00b6\u00b6 176-85. Defendants have not argued that the Annual Report's statements are not actionable, and Odebrecht has not appeared to defend the claims lodged against it. The Court therefore declines to address the merits of Plaintiffs' claims against this Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-376\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-377\">\n   In sum, for purposes of this motion, the only statements and omissions that Plaintiffs sufficiently plead as the basis for their Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims, or that Defendants fail to argue are inactionable, are: (1) CNO's statements contained in the offering memoranda regarding the reasons for its success and CNO's failure to disclose the bribery scheme in connection with those statements; (2) CNO's statements contained in its 2012 through 2014 financial statements regarding the company's credit ratings; and (3) the statement made in CNO's third quarter 2014 earnings release that the Petrobras investigation had not impacted CNO. Because these are the only actionable statements, the Court continues to address the parties' remaining Section 10(b) arguments with respect to those statements only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-378\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Scienter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-379\">\n   Defendants do not challenge Plaintiffs' allegations of scienter with respect to Odebrecht and CNO. They assert, however, that Plaintiffs have failed to plead Odebrecht Finance or OEC's scienter. The Court need not address these arguments, however, as it has already concluded that Plaintiffs have abandoned their claim of direct liability against OEC and have not sufficiently pleaded that Odebrecht Finance made any false or misleading statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-380\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

Those documents, however, are extrinsic to the complaint.

SAC \u00b6 82. Therefore, drawing all inferences in Plaintiffs' favor, Marcelo Odebrecht's arrest and the reports that prosecutors had proof of Odebrecht senior executives' knowledge of the company's bribe payments are sufficiently alleged to have been the first revelations to the market of Odebrecht's participation in the bribery scheme.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-390\">\n   Defendants' other argument-that the news reports of Marcelo's arrest did not reveal the falsity of CNO's representations regarding its competitive strengths-also fails. CNO's statements, according to the second amended complaint, concealed the fact that CNO had successfully secured large contracts as the result of bribes that it had paid, both to Brazilian officials and\n   to international officials. The June 20, 2015 New York Times article revealed that Brazilian police had proof that senior Odebrecht executives participated directly in the division of the overbilled Petrobras contracts. This is sufficient to allege that the falsity of CNO's statement-that its successful bidding within Brazil was the result of legitimate factors-was revealed to the market when this article was published.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-391\">\n   Plaintiffs' allegations are also sufficient to plead that the news of Marcelo Odebrecht's arrest and of the Brazilian police's proof of Odebrecht's involvement in the Petrobras scandal resulted in a decline of the market value of the Notes. Plaintiffs allege that the Odebrecht Finance Notes were issued at, or very close to, par value and continued to trade at par value until mid-June 2015-the time of Marcelo's arrest. SAC \u00b6 186. As Reuters reported, immediately following the arrest, Odebrecht's bonds dropped 10 points.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 187. Between June 19 and June 20, 2015, Plaintiffs allege that the value of the Notes similarly dropped 6.7% (the 7.125% Notes) and 10.0% (the 7.50% Notes).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 189 &amp; n.38. From these allegations, it can reasonably be inferred that the revelation of Odebrecht's involvement in the bribery scheme led to the losses. This is sufficient at this stage to plead that the disclosure of CNO's misleading statement about the reasons for its success in Brazil caused Plaintiffs' losses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Braskem\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274753\" index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/246/731/#p760\">\n    246 F.Supp.3d at 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that allegations that \"the disclosure of th[e] scheme caused Braskem's shares to drop more than 20% on the day ... when the scheme was revealed\" sufficiently pleaded loss causation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-392\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that several subsequent news reports further disclosed additional details of Defendants' involvement in the Brazilian bribery scheme, leading to even greater declines in the value of the Notes.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , SAC \u00b6\u00b6 195, 200-03, 211-13. The additional details offered in each of those news articles, however, did not reveal the falsity of any of the actionable misstatements. The misleading nature of CNO's statement that its successful bidding on Brazilian projects had already been revealed by the news reports immediately following Marcelo Odebrecht's arrest. The June 24, 2015 article reporting Marcelo's note to his lawyers to destroy emails merely confirmed what the New York Times's earlier article had reported: that there was proof of Odebrecht's involvement in the scandal. The July 2015 reports likewise confirmed what had already been disclosed. The Down Jones report of notes found on Marcelo's phone again confirmed the existence of incriminating evidence; the Wall Street Journal's report of the Swiss investigation into bribes paid by Odebrecht and CNO to Brazilian and Petrobras officials offered no new material information to the market; and the reports that Brazilian prosecutors were ready to press formal charges against Marcelo confirmed that authorities could link him to the scandal. Similarly, the August 20, 2015 Economist article did nothing more than to summarize already public information. Nor did Odebrecht's press release announcing the resignation of Marcelo transmit any new information that proved the falsity of any of the alleged misstatements; his resignation by itself says nothing regarding CNO's success, its prior credit ratings, its selectivity in bidding in Venezuela, or about the impact of the Petrobras investigation on CNO in the last quarter of 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-393\">\n   The initial reports of Marcelo's arrest and the existence of proof tying Odebrecht officials to the Petrobras scheme let the cat out of the bag.

All of the previously discussed partial disclosures revealed details about the bribery scheme, but they were limited to bribes paid to Brazilian officials. Plaintiffs allege that it was not until early 2016 that the international scope of CNO's bribery scheme was revealed. However, the news reports at that time discussed only bribes paid to officials in Peru and Argentina.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 207-08. It was not until Odebrecht entered into the plea agreement, which was publicly filed on December 21, 2016, that the bribes paid to Venezuelan officials came to light.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 226, 232. Yet Plaintiffs allege nothing regarding any further decline in the value of the Notes after that date, or any other losses that they purportedly suffered as a result of this corrective disclosure. In the absence of allegations of loss in connection with this statement, Plaintiffs' Section 10(b) claims predicated on this statement fail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lentell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9033680\" index=\"266\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/396/161/#p168\">\n    396 F.3d at 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-395\">\n   With respect to CNO's other statements-regarding its prior credit ratings and the fact that the Petrobras investigation had not impacted CNO in the third quarter of 2014-Plaintiffs fail to allege loss causation. None of the partial corrective disclosures identified by Plaintiffs revealed the falsity of either of these statements. CNO's prior credit ratings themselves were not shown to have been false when reported. And the fact that CNO was publicly implicated in the scandal in 2015 does not render false its prior statement-that it was not impacted by the scandal the year before. In fact, Plaintiffs allege that the Notes continued to trade at par value during the third quarter of 2014, when that statement was made.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 173, 186. Without any allegation of the disclosure of the falsity of these statements, Plaintiffs cannot logically plead that their losses are the result of these misstatements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vivendi\n   </em>\n   , 838 F.3d at 261.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-396\">\n   Defendants additionally argue that Plaintiffs can attribute only a \"fraction\" of the alleged decline in market value of the Odebrecht Finance Notes to Defendants because the second amended complaint reflects declines in the Notes' value during periods unaccounted for by Plaintiffs.

SAC \u00b6\u00b6 25-26 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs also allege that \"[i]n making their purchases of the Odebrecht Finance 7.50% Notes, Plaintiffs specifically relied upon the above-identified statements (in addition to the other false and misleading statements identified below), without the knowledge that such statements were materially false and misleading, in making their decisions to purchase the Odebrecht Finance 7.50% Notes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 99. This allegation is repeated in connection with the 7.125% Notes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 113. In addition, Plaintiffs allege that they \"received, reviewed and relied upon each of the financial reports and Earnings releases identified below.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 141. The reports \"identified below\" include CNO's 2011 end-of-year financial statements,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 145-47, CNO's 2012 earnings release,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 148-50, CNO's first, third, and fourth quarter 2013 and end-of-year 2013 financial statements,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 151-62, CNO's first, second, and third quarter 2014 financial statements,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 163-74, and Odebrecht's 2014 annual report,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 176-85. Finally, Plaintiffs allege that they \"directly relied upon\n   <em>\n    many\n   </em>\n   of the false statements identified above in deciding to purchase the Odebrecht Finance Notes, including the 7.125% Notes, the 7.50% Notes, and\n   <em>\n    various\n   </em>\n   other statements made directly to Plaintiffs, and statements made in\n   <em>\n    various\n   </em>\n   earnings releases or telephonic conferences related to earnings releases.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 248 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-413\">\n   Defendants argue that these allegations are nothing more than conclusory, and the Court agrees. Plaintiffs purchased the 7.125% Notes in thirty-four transactions over the course of nearly two years, between May 6, 2013 and March 31, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Similarly, Plaintiffs purchased the 7.50% Notes in a series of twenty-eight\n   transactions over the course of eighteen months, between August 22, 2013 and March 31, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. Given the dates of these transactions, it would have been impossible for Plaintiffs to rely on\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the alleged misstatements in deciding to purchase each of the securities. For example, Plaintiffs' purchases in May 2013 predate the statements in CNO's fourth quarter 2013 financial statements, CNO's annual 2013 financial statements, and CNO's 2014 quarterly financial statements. Plaintiffs apparently recognize this by alleging only that they relied on \"many\" and \"various\" of the misstatements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 248. With the same token, Plaintiffs also acknowledge that they relied on either the misstatements or the integrity of the market prices of the Notes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25-26. Moreover, Plaintiffs do not allege that they read or reviewed either of the offering memoranda or that they read or reviewed CNO's financial figures in its 2009 and 2010 financial statements-documents which contain several of the alleged misstatements. And because Plaintiffs' allegations are not specific, they also plead reliance on the alleged misstatements contained in the 4.375% Notes OM and the 5.250% Notes OM. Plaintiffs concede, however, that they did not purchase any of the 4.375% Notes, and their claims rest only on the 7.125% and 7.50% Notes. Therefore, it is entirely unclear how Plaintiffs relied on the representations in the other offering memoranda in their purchases of the Notes at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-414\">\n   These allegations fail to provide Defendants with notice of which misstatements were relied upon by Plaintiffs in their decision to purchase the Notes.

These sections define different types of conveyances that become recoverable by a creditor because of the conveyance's fraudulent nature. Plaintiffs allege that Odebrecht Finance transferred the proceeds of the Note sales to CNO and Odebrecht immediately after those sales were completed. SAC \u00b6 39. The proceeds were used to finance CNO's \"general corporate purposes\" and as additional equity investments in other Odebrecht subsidiaries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. Odebrecht Finance is alleged to have been insolvent since incorporation, and at least since March 31, 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. Accordingly, Plaintiffs bring a claim for constructive fraudulent transfer under section 273 of the DCL and argue that Odebrecht Finance, an insolvent entity, conveyed the proceeds of the Note sales to CNO and Odebrecht without fair consideration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 278-81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-421\">\n   Plaintiffs also bring a claim for an actual fraudulent transfer under DCL \u00a7 276.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 282-89.

Because\n   the conveyances left Odebrecht Finance without the means to satisfy any judgment against it, Plaintiffs allege that Odebrecht and CNO are liable to Plaintiffs for damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 289.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-422\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs seek recovery of their reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in prosecuting their fraudulent conveyance claims under DCL \u00a7 276-a.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 292.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-423\">\n   Plaintiffs bring these claims against Odebrecht, CNO, and OEC.

We [CNO] intend to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate purposes and Odebrecht intends to use the remaining portion of the net proceeds of this offering for additional equity investments in OPI and OE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-444\">\n   Carlinsky Decl., Ex. A at 24. The 7.50% Notes OM contains similar language.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Carlinsky Decl., Ex. B at 25. These statements would have informed a reasonable investor that the proceeds of the Note sales were to be conveyed to Odebrecht and CNO, and not retained as assets by Odebrecht Finance. The 5.250% Notes OM, on the other hand, tells a different story. That offering memorandum explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-445\">\n   Odebrecht Finance intends to use the net proceeds of this offering to purchase certain amounts of the 2020 notes, 2022 notes, 2023 notes and/or 2025 notes tendered to it in connection with the anticipated tender offer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-446\">\n   Carlinsky Decl., Ex.

Pls.' Opp. at 15. The Court is not convinced that this allegation is logical in light of Plaintiffs' other alleged facts. The second amended complaint alleges that the money that was used to pay the near $800 million in bribes was generated by \"off the books\" operations and was never recorded. SAC \u00b6 46. Taking these allegations as true, as the Court must for purposes of this motion, the bribes were not paid out of reported revenues from the secured contracts, or out of any other revenue source that CNO reported in its financial disclosures. Accordingly, the fact that the bribes were not listed as costs in the public disclosures does not, by itself, render the reported net income false.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-477\">\n    Plaintiffs' allegations in paragraphs 124 and 134 similarly assert that the financial figures contained in the 4.375% Notes OM and the 5.250% Notes OM were false and misleading because they were overstated.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    SAC \u00b6\u00b6 123-24, 133-34.
