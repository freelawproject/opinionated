(# 10.) For the reasons below, the court finds that plaintiff served Michaud on time and her late service with respect to the MBTA was excusable. Plaintiff's failure to serve Andrews, on the other hand, is fatal to her claims against him. Moreover, plaintiff fails to state a claim for employment discrimination under the various laws cited except for her Title II ADA claim against the MBTA. This claim alone survives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff Served the MBTA and Michaud\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiff has successfully served the MBTA and Norman Michaud, as explained below. However, plaintiff has not served defendant Scott C. Andrews; the claims against him should be dismissed on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Plaintiff filed the present action, pro se, on May 22, 2017. (# 1.) Plaintiff was initially given 90 days from August 14, 2017, to serve defendants, and was permitted to \"have service completed by the United States Marshals Service (USMS).\" (# 7.) Plaintiff claims to have provided the USMS with papers for service by giving the papers to her son, residing in federal custody, to pass on to the USMS. (# 29 at 6, 11.) Michaud was served on November 2, 2017. (# 9.) The USMS possessed the remainder of the summons no later than November 7, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ## 14-16, 18-19. The MBTA was served on November 20, 2017. (# 18.) Scott C. Andrews has not been served to date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   # 15 (reflecting return of service unexecuted). The MBTA and Andrews moved to dismiss the claims against them on November 24, 2017, based on insufficient service, contending that the 90-day deadline for service was November 12, 2017. (# 10 at 13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiff's late service to the MBTA is excused for good cause. Plaintiff provided the summons to the USMS, which was apparently unable to make service on time.
