The dressmaking business was conducted in an upper story of the house-which the defendant and his wife both occupied, though they were living in a state of marital separation. After her death, the plaintiff called at the home on a visit of condolence, and in the course of her conversation with the defendant on that, occasion mentioned to him, as she testified, that she had left some garments and dress goods in his wife\u2019s possession, and the defendant said that he would arrange with a woman, who had been employed as his wife\u2019s assistant in the business, to identify and separate the dresses belonging to the various patrons, and that, if the plaintiff would return in a week or ten day's, she could obtain any of the clothing to- which she was entitled. According to the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, she returned as the defendant had suggested, and he then told her that he did not know \u201cwhose clothes were upstairs,\u201d- and while he was not afraid to trust her, he wanted her to get Mrs. Bishop (the former assistant) to identify the dresses \u201cbefore he would let anything go- out of the house,\u201d but he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>said that he did not know where Mrs. Bishop lived. Subsequently, the plaintiff said, she located Mrs. Bishop, and after repeatedly failing to see the defendant when she called at his home, and after further delay because of an injury to her foot, she finally found the defendant at home and asked him to remain there while she brought Mrs. Bishop to the house, .and he said it was not necessary to do so, that she should go upstairs and get what belonged to her, and the defendant <em>went </em>up with her, but all of her dresses, <em>except one, </em>had disappeared, and \u201ceverything had been renovated.\u201d On her visit to the house immediately after the defendant\u2019s wife died, the plaintiff, as she testified, went upstairs and saw all of the dresses and goods specified in her claim. It may be inferred from the evidence that the defendant was thereafter in sole charge and control of the pLace where his wife\u2019s dressmaking business had been carried on, and had assumed the duty of having the dresses of her customers assorted and properly distributed. The former assistant of his wife did not testify in the case, and was not summoned by either party, although she is said to have promised the plaintiff to .appear as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">While the evidence is conflicting in some respects, the plaintiff is entitled to have the legal sufficiency of her testimony determined independently of its contradiction by the defense. It was a legally permissible inference from the evidence that the defendant succeeded his wife in the custody of the clothing described and claimed by the plaintiff, that she was its lawful owner and rightfully demanded its return, and that the articles were lost to her because of the defendant\u2019s attitude towards her efforts to recover their possession. The defendant\u2019s responsibility does not depend upon proof that he personally disposed of the plaintiff\u2019s property or profited from its disposition. There was an adequate basis for his liability in this action, if he unwarrantably interforred with the plaintiff\u2019s right of possession, and the goods were consequently misappropriated during the period of his control. <em>Kirby v. Porter, </em>144 Md. 261; <em>Martin v. Lanahan, </em>133 M.d. 525; <em>Hammond v. </em>DuBois, 131 Md. 116; <em>Merchants </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number><em>Bank v. Williams, </em>110 Md. 334; <em>Manning v. Brown, </em>47 Md. 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The opinion by Judge Offutt in <em>Kirby v. Porter, supra, </em>quoted from 1 <em>Poe\u2019s Pl. &amp; Pr., </em>sec. 522, as follows: \u201cLooking to the form of declaration as given in the Code, it will be found to contain the simple averment \u2018that the defendant converted to his own use, or wrongfully deprived the plaintiff of the use of the plaintiff\u2019s goods.\u2019 This indicates very plainly that the wrong may consist either (1st) in the defendant\u2019s converting to his own use the plaintiff\u2019s goods, or (2nd) in wrongfully depriving the plaintiff of their use, even without converting them to his own use; and, hence, suit may properly be brought accordingly. In order, therefore, to give a plaintiff a right of action in trover, it is not necessary that he should be able to show an acquisition \u2022 of the property by the defendant \u2014 for any wrongful interference with the owner\u2019s possession or right of possession is, in law, either a conversion itself, or evidence from which a previous or continuing conversion may be implied.\u201d The section quoted from thus concludes: \u201cIn short, any one who, without authority, interferes with the rightful owner\u2019s absolute dominion over his goods, whether he do it for his own personal advantage or for the advantage of another, or through inadvertence, or under a mistake as to his own legal rights, or otherwise, may be made responsible in trover.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Upon the evidence in the record, we think the court below was justified in its refusal to withdraw the case from the jury, as proposed by the defendant\u2019s first prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">By his third prayer the defendant requested an instruction that if, at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s demand for the delivery of the articles of clothing claimed in this suit, the defendant did not have them in his possession, then no conversion was committed by him, and a verdict in his favor should be rendered. There was no evidence that the goods in question were not in the defendant\u2019s possession when the demand was made for their return, and if they had previously passed from his control and custody, that fact would not be conclusive against the theory of the alleged conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>The first prayer of the plaintiff is the only one granted at her instance to which the defendant\u2019s brief makes objection. It is consistent with the principle which we have stated as applicable to the issue involved in the case, and was therefore properly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">There were several exceptions in the record to the admission of evidence, but those exceptions were not pressed, and we find no error in the rulings to which they were reserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\"><em>Judgment </em>affirmed, <em>with costs.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
