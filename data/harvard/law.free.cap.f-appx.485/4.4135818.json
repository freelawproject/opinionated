He argues that the within guidelines sentence is procedurally and substantively unreasonable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Muro argues that the district court failed to adequately explain the sentence because the court did not specifically address his nonfrivolous arguments in support of a below guidelines sentence in light of a then pending amendment to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B). He also argues that the sentence is substantively unreasonable based on the staleness of the offense underlying the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B) adjustment and the district court\u2019s erroneous evaluation of the seriousness of his prior criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-16\">This court ordinarily reviews sentences for reasonableness by engaging in a bifurcated review. <em>See Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). First, this court must ensure that the sentencing court committed no significant procedural error, such as \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3558(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the sentence is procedurally sound, this court then considers whether the sentence is substantively reasonable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b31-17\">Muro did not object to the sentence below, and correctly concedes that review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 361 (5th Cir.2009). To show plain error, the appellant must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number><em>States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If the appellant makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">Where a district court \u201cdecides simply to apply the Guidelines to a particular case, doing so will not necessarily require lengthy explanation.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). \u201cWhere the defendant or prosecutor presents nonfrivo-lous reasons for imposing a different sentence, however, the judge will normally go further and explain why he has rejected those arguments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 357, 127 S.Ct. 2456. This explanation by the district court will \u201callow for meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">At sentencing, Muro argued that he should be sentenced to 24 months of imprisonment because a proposed amendment to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(b) would reduce the adjustment to his offense level based on a stale conviction from 12 levels to eight levels. As a result of the application of the proposed amendment, the guidelines range of imprisonment would be reduced from 37 to 46 months to 24 to 30 months. The district court stated that the court was aware of the proposed amendment to the guidelines. In rejecting Muro\u2019s request for a below guidelines sentence based on the application of that amendment, the district court explained that a guidelines sentence was warranted based on Muro\u2019s five prior deportations and his extensive criminal history. The district court based the sentence on Muro\u2019s characteristics and history and the need to protect the public from his dangerous criminal behavior, namely, his repeated impaired driving offenses. The record shows that the court listened to Muro\u2019s statements and counsel\u2019s arguments at the sentencing hearing and gave reasons for rejecting the request for a below guidelines sentence. The district court\u2019s explanation was adequate and did not constitute reversible plain error. <em>See Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d at 362-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">Because Muro\u2019s sentence was within the guidelines range, his sentence is presumptively reasonable. <em>See United States v. Cooks, </em>589 F.3d 173, 186 (5th Cir.2009). The presumption of reasonableness \u201cis rebutted only upon a showing that the sentence does not account for a factor that should receive significant weight, it gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or it represents a clear error of judgment in balancing sentencing factors.\u201d <em>Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">This court has recognized that \u201cthe staleness of a prior conviction used in the proper calculation of a guidelines-range sentence does not render a sentence substantively unreasonable,\u201d nor does it \u201cdestroy the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to such sentences.\u201d <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>660 F.3d 231, 234 (5th Cir.2011). The subsequent amendment of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B) does not undermine the reasoning in <em>Rodriguez. Cf. United States v. Scott, </em>654 F.3d 552, 557-58 (5th Cir.2011). Furthermore, Muro\u2019s disagreement with the district court\u2019s assessment of the seriousness of his criminal history is insufficient to rebut the presumption of reasonableness afforded his within guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Ruiz, </em>621 F.3d 390, 398 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">Muro fails to overcome the presumption that his sentence was substantively reasonable, <em>see Cooks, </em>589 F.3d at 186, and has not demonstrated that the district court plainly erred in imposing the 46-month sentence. Bee <em>Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>129 S.Ct. 1423. Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b31-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b31-13\">. He also raises, solely for purposes of preserving for further appellate review, the argument that the presumption of reasonableness afforded within guidelines sentences should not apply to sentences calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 because that Guideline is flawed. He concedes, however, that his argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent. See, e.g., <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 367 (5th Cir.2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
