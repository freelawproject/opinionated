On appeal, Butler argues that the reasoning of <em>Freeman v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2685, 180 L.Ed.2d 519 (2011), undermined to the point of abrogation this Court\u2019s rationale in <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008). He asserts that even though he was sentenced as a career offender, he is not categorically ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because the offense level for his underlying crack cocaine offense was \u201ca relevant part of the analytical framework the district court used to determine\u201d Butler\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>Id, </em>at 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">A district court may modify an imprisonment term \u201cin the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">However, a reduction in the imprisonment term is not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) where the listed amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range \u201cbecause of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision (e.g., a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. 1; <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1330 (\u201cWhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">A district court follows a two-step process in ruling on a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 780 (11th Cir.2000). First, the court must recalculate the defendant\u2019s sentence \u201cby substituting the amended guideline range for the originally applied guideline range, and then using that new base level to determine what ultimate sentence it would have imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn undertaking this first step, only the amended guideline is changed. All other guideline application decisions made during the original sentencing remain intact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). If it reaches the second step, the court must decide, in its discretion, whether to retain the original sentence or to resentence the eligible defendant under the amended guideline range. <em>Id. </em>at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">Where a defendant\u2019s sentence is \u201cbased on\u201d the guideline range applicable to career offenders under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the defendant\u2019s base offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 plays no role in the calculation of his guideline range. <em>See Moore, </em>541 F.3d at 1327. Thus, even when a retroactive amendment reduces such a defendant\u2019s base offense level, the amendment would not lower his applicable guideline range because of the application of the career offender guidelines. <em>See id. </em>at 1327-28,1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">In <em>Freeman, </em>five justices of the Supreme Court held that entering into a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) plea agreement did not categorically bar a defendant from obtaining relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Freeman, </em>\u2014 U.S. at -, 131 S.Ct. at 2695 (Sotomayor, J., concurring). Rather, where such a plea agreement \u201cexpressly uses a Guidelines sentencing range applicable to the charged offense to establish the term of imprisonment, and that range is subsequently lowered by the United States Sentencing Commission, the term of imprisonment is \u2018based on\u2019 the range employed and the defendant is eligible for sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">We remain bound by the rule of our prior precedent \u201cunless and until it is overruled or undermined to the point of abrogation by the Supreme Court or by this [C]ourt sitting <em>en banc.\u201d United States v. Archer, </em>531 F.3d 1347, 1352 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cWhile an intervening decision of the Supreme Court can overrule the decision of a prior panel of our court, the Supreme Court decision must be clearly on point.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">We disagree with Butler\u2019s contention that <em>Freeman </em>abrogated <em>Moore. Freeman </em>has nothing to do with how retroactive amendments affect career offenders. <em>Freeman </em>was decided in the context of a Rule 11(c)(1)(C) guilty plea, which allows the prosecutor and defendant to reach a plea bargain specifying a particular term of imprisonment. In <em>Freeman, </em>the Court held that because such an agreement might be expressly based on a guideline range, the resulting sentence could be affected by a retroactive amendment. The career offender guidelines, by contrast, are based on the statutory maximum sentence for the offense, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(h), and a career offender\u2019s sentence is based on that statute. <em>Freeman </em>is not \u201cclearly on point\u201d and therefore did not abrogate <em>Moore. See Archer, </em>531 F.3d at 1352.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Here, the district court properly denied Butler\u2019s 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because it is undisputed that the retroactive application of Amendment 750 would not lower his guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-9\">. <em>See Marks v.
