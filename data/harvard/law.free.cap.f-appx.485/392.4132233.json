Moss argues that the district court abused its discretion by not allowing him to -withdraw his guilty plea after the probation officer recommended a sentence that was higher than the otherwise applicable guideline range.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-12\">We review a district court\u2019s denial of a request to withdraw a guilty plea for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Izquierdo, </em>448 F.3d 1269, 1276 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cThe denial of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea is not an abuse of discretion unless the denial was arbitrary or unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-15\">\u201cAfter the district court has accepted a plea and before sentencing, a defendant may withdraw a guilty plea if the defendant can show a fair and just reason for requesting the withdrawal.\u201d <em>United States v. Brehm, </em>442 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2006) (quotations omitted). \u201cIn determining whether the defendant has met his burden to show a fair and just reason, a district court may consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding the plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-16\">Moss\u2019s argument is that the sentence proposed by the probation officer in the PSI was longer than Moss and the government had expected, and that this unexpected sentence undermined the negotiations that had secured Moss\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-17\">We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Moss\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. During the plea colloquy, the magistrate judge stated that \u201cthe court will not be able to determine the advisory guideline range for your case until after a presentenee report has been prepared.\u201d The court then warned Moss that \u201ceven if the sentence that is imposed on you is more severe than the sentence you expect, you will not have the right to withdraw your guilty plea. Do you understand that?\u201d Moss indicated that he did. The magistrate judge later reiterated that \u201cany sentence ultimately imposed on you may be different from any estimate that [your attorney] has given you. Do you understand that?\u201d Again, Moss indicated that he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-18\">This colloquy follows language in the plea agreement stating that the probation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>officer would calculate the offense level and Moss\u2019s criminal history, which \u201cmay differ from that projected by [Moss\u2019s] counsel or the United States Attorney.\u201d The plea agreement stated that \u201c[i]n the event that the [District] Court determines [Moss\u2019s] offense level or criminal history category to be higher than [Moss] anticipated, [he] will have no right to withdraw the plea on that basis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Clearly, Moss and the government had recognized the real possibility that the PSI would propose \u2014 and the district court would then impose \u2014 a longer sentence than Moss expected. The occurrence of this planned-for possibility did not undermine the negotiations leading to the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">We also note that Moss (1) had the assistance of counsel in negotiating, reviewing, and deciding to accept his plea agreement; (2) indicated in his colloquy that no promises were made to him outside those listed in the plea agreement; (3) stated that he understood the elements of cocaine distribution and acknowledged the rights he would be waiving by foregoing trial and being convicted; and (4) acknowledged that the district court was free to choose its own sentence without regard to the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1019 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Considering the totality of the circumstances, we see no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to deny Moss\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>See Brehm, </em>442 F.3d at 1298.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b419-13\">. The government contends that this appeal is barred by Moss\u2019s plea agreement. We decline to revisit the motions panel\u2019s determination that Moss did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to appeal his underlying convictions. <em>See United States v. Bushert, </em>997 F.2d 1343, 1352 (11th Cir.1993); dkt. 154 at 10-11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b420-9\">. To the extent that Moss argues a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, we decline to consider that issue on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002). Any other issues mentioned in Moss\u2019s brief are too conclusory to be entertained, and are deemed abandoned.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
