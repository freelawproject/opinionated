After review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-11\">Mr. Clowers sought a reduction of sentence based on Amendments 505 and 750 to the Sentencing Guidelines, which have been made retroactive. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(e). The district court ruled that Mr. Clowers was not entitled to a reduction because he had received a statutory mandatory sentence of life imprisonment for engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise (Count 18) in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(a). <em>See </em>D.E. 945 (stating reasons for denial of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>D.E. 690 at 6 (statement of reasons for amended criminal judgment) (adopting Presentence Investigation Report); Presentence Investigation Report \u00b6 163 (indicating that Mr. Clowers faced a statutory mandatory sentence of life imprisonment on Count 18).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">The district court correctly denied Mr. Clower\u2019s motion. A sentence reduction is \u201cnot authorized\u201d if the applicable amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(a)(2)(b), and here the statutorily mandated sentence of life imprisonment \u201ceffectively displace[d]\u201d the otherwise applicable range for Mr. Clowers under the Sentencing Guidelines and \u201cbec[a]me[] the guideline sentence\u201d for him. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1340 (11th Cir.2008). Because Mr. Clowers was not sentenced based on the offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, Amendments 505 and 750 did not have the effect of lowering his statutory mandatory sentence of life imprisonment. <em>See id. </em>at 1340-41; <em>United States v. Pope, </em>58 F.3d 1567, 1572 (11th Cir.1995) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">Mr. Clowers argues that he should never have faced a statutory mandatory term of life imprisonment on Count 18 because the government charged him only under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(a) and not 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848(b). As Mr. Clowers sees it, \u00a7 848(b) sets forth a different (and more severe) offense than \u00a7 841(a), and the jury therefore was required to make the necessary factual findings (as to his leadership status and drug quantity) before he could be subject to a statutory mandatory penalty of life imprisonment under \u00a7 848(b). Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>though Mr. Clowers\u2019 argument as to \u00a7 848(b) is .supported by dicta from a Second Circuit case, <em>see United States v. Torres, </em>901 F.2d 205, 240 (2d Cir.1990) (\u201c[S]ection 848(b) requires the jury to find, beyond a reasonable doubt, elements in addition to those stated in section 848(a).... \u201d), the Second Circuit ruled after <em>Torres </em>that a district court can make the requisite findings necessary for a mandatory life sentence under \u00a7 848(b) because \u00a7 848(a) itself provides for a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Rivera, </em>282 F.3d 74, 76-77 (2d Cir.2000) (per curiam).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Torres, </em>therefore, does not help Mr. Clowers.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">More importantly, Mr. Clowers\u2019s motion for reduction of sentence did not permit the district court to revisit rulings and findings made at the initial sentencing hearing. As the Supreme Court has held, \u201cproceedings under \u00a7 3582(c) do not implicate the Sixth Amendment right to have essential facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d and \u201c\u00a7 3582(c) does not authorize a resentencing.\u201d <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 2694, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Thus, Mr. Clowers was not entitled to use his motion for reduction of sentence to correct any alleged errors in the initial sentencing hearing. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000) (holding that, in a \u00a7 3582(c) proceeding, <em>\u201call </em>original sentencing determinations remain unchanged with the sole exception of the guideline range that has been amended since the original sentencing\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-12\">. Mr. Clowers says that he never received the district court's statement of reasons for denial of his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Assuming that is correct, Mr. Clowers was apprised of the district court\u2019s rationale in the government's response brief (which quoted the district court\u2019s language) and had the opportunity to address that rationale in his reply brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b418-8\">. We note that other circuits have come to the same conclusion as the Second Circuit in <em>Rivera. See, e.g., United States v. Avila Vargas, </em>570 F.3d 1004, 1007 n. 2 (8th Cir.2009); <em>United States v. Soto-Beniquez, </em>356 F.3d 1, 44-45 (1st Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>223 F.3d 554, 563-66 (7th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
