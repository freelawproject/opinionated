He contends that his convictions for armed bank robbery and the firearm carrying violated the Double Jeopardy Clause because they were based upon the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>weapon. Howard also asserts that his trial attorney rendered ineffective assistance by advising him to plead guilty to the named offenses despite the purported double jeopardy violation and despite the lack of evidence supporting his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Typically, in reviewing the denial of a \u00a7 2241 petition, we review the district court\u2019s legal determinations de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 425 (5th Cir.2005). However, because Howard failed to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s report, we review for plain error. <em>See Douglass v. United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>79 F.3d 1415, 1429 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc). To establish plain error, Howard must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but will do so only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">As a general rule, a federal prisoner who seeks to collaterally challenge the legality of his conviction or sentence must file a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>Padilla, </em>416 F.3d at 426-27. Such claims may be raised in a \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255(e) only if the prisoner shows that the \u00a7 2255 remedy is \u201cinadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e). Howard has not made such a showing, as he has not established that his claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision establishing that he was convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Howard also asserts that the district court failed to liberally construe his pro se pleadings, as required by <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), because it did not conduct a \u201cmeticulous review\u201d of the record to determine whether relief was warranted on the merits of Howard\u2019s allegations. The district court determined that it lacked jurisdiction over Howard\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition because the pleading did not challenge the execution of Howard\u2019s sentence and did not satisfy the \u00a7 2255(e) savings clause. The district court could not consider Howard\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition as his initial \u00a7 2255 motion because it lacked jurisdiction over such a pleading. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(a). To the extent that Howard may be asserting that the district court could not recharacterize his \u00a7 2241 petition as a \u00a7 2255 motion, he is incorrect. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877-78 (5th Cir.2000). Because Howard has not shown a clear or obvious error, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b690-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
