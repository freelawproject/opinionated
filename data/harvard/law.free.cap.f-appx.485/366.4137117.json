The court sentenced Kalu to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment for Counts 1 through 3 to be served concurrently, to 2 years for Count 5 to be served consecutively to Counts 1 through 3, and to 2 years for Count 6 to be served consecutively to Count 5. On appeal, Kalu argues that (1) the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress physical evidence and statements, and (2) the district court incorrectly applied the Sentencing Guidelines and improperly imposed an upward variance at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Kalu argues that the district court clearly erred in denying his motion to suppress. Kalu contends that, because the court was presented with conflicting witness testimony, it had to make detailed credibility determinations that it did not believe a witness\u2019s claim, which it failed to do. Further, Kalu contends that the report and recommendation that the district court adopted was contradictory and vague. Kalu also argues that his motion sought the suppression of incriminating statements that he had made following his arrest, but the court failed to address this argument in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, we review its findings of fact for clear error and its application of law to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Ramirez, </em>476 F.3d 1231, 1235 (11th Cir.2007). The voluntariness of a defendant\u2019s statement is a question of law. <em>United States v. Farley, </em>607 F.3d 1294, 1326 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 369, 178 L.Ed.2d 238 (2010). We construe all facts in the light most favorable to the party prevailing in the district court. <em>Ramirez, </em>476 F.3d at 1236. \u201cCredibility determinations are typically the province of the fact finder because the fact finder personally observes the testimony and is thus in a better position than a reviewing court to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez-Chilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002). We accept the district court\u2019s choice of whom to believe \u201cunless it is contrary to the laws of nature, or is so inconsistent or improbable on its face that no reasonable factfinder could accept it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We defer to a district court\u2019s factual determinations unless its understanding of the facts appears to be unbelievable. <em>Id. </em>We may affirm the denial of a motion to suppress on any ground supported by the record. <em>United States v. Caraballo, </em>595 F.3d 1214, 1222 (11th Cir.2010). Further, we may consider evidence presented at a defendant\u2019s trial and are not limited to the evidence introduced at the suppression hearing. <em>United States v. Villabona-Garnica, </em>63 F.3d 1051, 1056 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">The Fourth Amendment protects \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. In most circumstances, unless there is consent, law enforcement officers must obtain a warrant supported by probable cause to justify a search under the Fourth Amendment. <em>United States v. Magluta, </em>418 F.3d 1166, 1182 (11th Cir.2005). There are, however, a number of exceptions to the warrant requirement. <em>Id. </em>A full search incident to a lawful arrest is one such exception to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>warrant requirement. <em>United States v. Goddard, </em>312 F.3d 1360, 1364 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cThe justification or reason for the authority to search incident to a lawful arrest rests quite as much on the need to disarm the suspect in order to take him into custody as it does on the need to preserve evidence on his person for later use at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). Thus, \u201c[sjince the custodial arrest of a suspect based on probable cause is a reasonable intrusion under the Fourth Amendment, a search incident to the arrest requires no additional justification.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Another exception to the warrant requirement is an inventory search of a legally impounded vehicle that is conducted pursuant to an established procedure. <em>South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 U.S. 364, 372-76, 96 S.Ct. 3092, 3098-3101, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1976). The government has the burden to show the requirements of an inventory search have been met. <em>Sammons v. Taylor, </em>967 F.2d 1533, 1543 (11th Cir.1992). An inventory search permits a thorough search of property lawfully in police custody, as long as that search is consistent with the police caretaking function. <em>United States v. O\u2019Bryant, </em>775 F.2d 1528, 1534 (11th Cir.1985). To show that an inventory search is lawful, the government must establish, first, that the officers had the authority to impound the defendant\u2019s vehicle, and second, that the officers complied with departmental policy in conducting the search. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>936 F.2d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.1991). \u201cAn inventory search is not a surrogate for investigation, and the scope of an inventory search may not exceed that necessary to accomplish the ends of the inventory.\u201d <em>United States v. Khoury, </em>901 F.2d 948, 958 (11th Cir.1990). Ordinarily, the prosecution presents evidence at the suppression hearing concerning the standardized procedures limiting the discretion of the investigating officers. When this evidence is presented, \u201c[t]he prosecution assures itself a smoother and surer path when it provides concrete evidence that the inventory search followed a standardized procedure pursuant to regulatory strictures.\u201d However, where law enforcement provides uncontroverted testimony that an inventory search \u201cwas routine and required, that is, the search was performed as a matter of course when a vehicle was impounded and the investigating officer was not at liberty to decline to inventory the contents,\u201d we have held that the evidence is sufficient to show that an inventory search was properly executed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">The Fifth Amendment states that no person \u201cshall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. V. The Fifth Amendment\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination is fully applicable during a custodial interrogation, but a suspect may still waive his right to remain silent after being properly advised of it, if he does so \u201cvoluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.\u201d <em>Farley, </em>607 F.3d at 1326 (quotation omitted). However, voluntary incriminating statements not made in response to an officer\u2019s questioning are freely admissible without regard to whether a suspect properly waived his right to remain silent. <em>United States v. Suggs, </em>755 F.2d 1538, 1541 (11th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">A review of the record shows that any search that occurred at the time of Kalu\u2019s arrest was constitutional. Kalu\u2019s main argument is that the district court should have made specific credibility determinations to conclude whether the physical evidence seized was in his vehicle or discovered near Kalu\u2019s person. To the extent evidence was discovered on or near Kalu\u2019s person, it occurred incident to a lawful arrest, and to the extent evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>was discovered in Kalu\u2019s vehicle, it was discovered during a lawful inventory search of his impounded vehicle. Thus, the search was proper either way, and the district court did not err. Further, contrary to Kalu\u2019s position on appeal, the court properly addressed whether Kalu\u2019s statement was voluntary. The court cited Officer Surman\u2019s unchallenged testimony that Kalu\u2019s statements were voluntarily made. Thus, we affirm the court\u2019s decision denying Kalu\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Kalu argues that, because the district court erred in failing to sustain numerous objections to his guideline calculation and abused its discretion in its decision to upwardly vary from the applicable guideline range, his total sentence of 168 months\u2019 imprisonment is unreasonable. First, Kalu contends that the court erred in assessing a two-level enhancement, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, for obstruction of justice based on his testimony at trial. Next, Kalu argues that the evidence offered by the government did not show that he intended a loss of over $400,000, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(H). Kalu further argues that the court erred in assessing him 1 criminal history point for his prior felony conviction for driving while his license was suspended and sentence of 19 days\u2019 imprisonment. Kalu contends that the Guidelines expressly state that a conviction for such a crime, regardless of whether it is a felony or misdemeanor, cannot be used for calculating a criminal history category unless the term of the sentence imposed was at least 30 days\u2019 imprisonment or more than 1 year of probation. Kalu also contends that the court erred in not granting his request for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 because his criminal history category of III over-represented the seriousness of his past criminal history. Finally, Kalu asserts that the court abused its discretion in its 49-month upward variance from the guideline range and imposition of a total sentence of 168 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">We undertake a two-part inquiry in evaluating a sentence\u2019s reasonableness. First, we ensure that the district court did not commit a significant procedural error, such as improperly calculating the guideline range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous factors, or failing to explain adequately the chosen sentence. <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1323 (11th Cir.2008). If there are no such errors, the second step is to review the sentence\u2019s substantive reasonableness by \u201cexamining the totality of the circumstances, including an inquiry into whether the statutory factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1323-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Obstruction of Justice Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">We review the district court\u2019s factual finding that a defendant obstructed justice only for clear error. <em>United States v. Tapia, </em>59 F.3d 1137, 1144 (11th Cir.1995). Under the Guidelines, the obstruction of justice enhancement applies where \u201cthe defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. The enhancement should not apply based on false testimony where the testimony at issue is the result of confusion, mistake, or faulty memory. <em>United States v. Dunnigan, </em>507 U.S. 87, 94, 113 S.Ct. 1111, 1116, 122 L.Ed.2d 445 (1993). Enhancing a defendant\u2019s sentence because of his perjury does not interfere with his right to testify, because a defendant\u2019s right to testify does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>not include a right to commit perjury. <em>Id. </em>at 96, 113 S.Ct. at 1117.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Although concern can arise that courts will enhance sentences pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 as a matter of course whenever the accused takes the stand and is found guilty, this concern is alleviated by the requirement that, if an accused challenges a sentence increase based on perjured testimony, the trial court must make findings to support all the elements of a perjury violation in the specific case. <em>Id. </em>at 96-97, 113 S.Ct. at 1118. Thus, we prefer that the district court make specific findings as to each alleged instance of obstruction by identifying the materially false statements individually. <em>United States v. Dobbs, </em>11 F.3d 152, 155 (11th Cir.1994). An enhancement for perjury properly applies where a court makes a determination that the testimony of the defendant on a material matter is false because it is inconsistent as compared to another witness\u2019s testimony that the judge determines is truthful. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The court did not clearly err in applying U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 to Kalu\u2019s offense level because his testimony was contradicted by overwhelming evidence at trial and shows that he testified falsely on matters material to the government\u2019s case against him.</p>\n<p id=\"A3l\">Loss Amount Determination</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The district court\u2019s determination of loss is reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Barrington, </em>648 F.3d 1178, 1197 (11th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>(U.S. Jan. 9, 2012) (No. 11-7635). The Guidelines do not require a precise determination of loss, and a court \u201cneed only make a reasonable estimate of the loss, given the available information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). District courts are in a unique position to evaluate the evidence relevant to a loss determination, and thus, their determinations are \u201c \u2018entitled to appropriate deference.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Bradley, </em>644 F.3d 1213, 1290 (11th Cir.2011) (quoting U.S.S.G. 2B1.1, comment. (n.2(c))), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Dec. 12, 2011) (No. 11-844). The court may make factual findings with respect to its loss determination based on \u201cevidence heard during trial, undisputed statements in the PSI, or evidence presented during the sentencing hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">A court \u201cmay not speculate about the existence of a fact that would result in a higher sentence.... \u201d <em>Barrington, </em>648 F.3d at 1197 (quotations omitted). In these circumstances, the government must \u201cestablish those facts by a preponderance of the evidence\u201d and \u201csupport its loss calculation with reliable and specific evidence.\u201d <em>Bradley, </em>644 F.3d at 1290 (quotation and alteration omitted). If a loss exceeds $400,000, 14 levels are added to a defendant\u2019s offense level. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1)(H). \u201c[L]oss is the greater of actual loss or intended loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2B1.1, comment. (n.3(A)). Intended loss includes \u201cthat pecuniary harm that would have been impossible or unlikely to occur.\u201d <em>Id., </em>comment. (n.3(A)(ii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">Here, the court did not clearly err in its determination that a loss of over $400,000 was attributable to Kalu based on the evidence at trial. First, evidence presented at trial showed that an altered check in the amount of $83,625 was deposited in a Bank of America account. Kalu was connected to the fraudulent transfer as demonstrated by photographs depicting him withdrawing $5,500 and $4,500 from the Bank of America account soon after the deposit. Next, evidence showed that $287,000 from Cassel\u2019s home equity credit line was deposited by wire transfer into a SunTrust bank account that had Kalu\u2019s previous addresses associated with it. Further, Sanon testified that Kalu gave her a check from the SunTrust account to deposit in an account in the name of Ste<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>phanie L. Athea. Photographic evidence later depicted Kalu withdrawing $1,000 from the account. Third, evidence showed that $60,000 from Cassel\u2019s credit line was deposited by wire transfer into the same Bank of America account that Kalu had withdrawn funds from earlier. The Bank of America account, after all of the fraudulent deposits had been made, including the $83,625 check and the $60,000 wire transfer, had an ending balance of $19.38. These 2 amounts total $143,625, the amount the district court found was the total actual loss. The evidence at trial showed that the SunTrust account, where the $287,000 was deposited on February 20, 2009, was frozen on April 7, after it was determined that the wire transfer was fraudulent. Based on this evidence, it appears that Kalu could not access $287,000 because the account had been frozen. Thus, the $287,000 was not depleted from the SunTrust account because Kalu\u2019s fraud was discovered and that intended loss of $287,000 was properly attributable to Kalu. Based on both the actual and intended loss attributable to Kalu, the district court did not abuse its discretion in its application of the 14-level enhancement to Kalu\u2019s offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Criminal History Calculation</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">We review a district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo. United States v. Maxwell, </em>579 F.3d 1282, 1305 (11th Cir.2009). We also review <em>de novo </em>its subject matter jurisdiction. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). Courts calculate criminal history points by evaluating each of the defendant\u2019s prior convictions according to a variety of factors, including the length of sentence imposed for each conviction. <em>United States v. Coast, </em>602 F.3d 1222, 1223 (11th Cir.2010). In order to calculate criminal history points, sentences for all felony offenses are counted, regardless of the length of the sentence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c). Sentences for misdemeanor and petty offenses are counted only if the sentence imposed for the commission of the offense \u201cwas a term of probation of more than one year or a term of imprisonment of at least thirty days,\u201d or the prior offense was similar to, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201c[djriving without a license or with a revoked or suspended license.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1)(A), (B); <em>Coast, </em>602 F.3d at 1223. A defendant\u2019s criminal history points are used to calculate a defendant\u2019s criminal history category. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">A district court may grant a downward departure from a criminal history category, \u201c[i]f reliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially over-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(1). Our review of decisions regarding downward departures is limited because we do not have jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a) to consider a defendant\u2019s appeal of a district court\u2019s discretionary decision to not apply a downward departure. <em>Winingear, </em>422 F.3d at 1245-46. This limited review applies so long as the court did not incorrectly believe that it lacked the authority to apply a departure. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[W]hen nothing in the record indicates otherwise, we assume the sentencing court understood it had authority to depart downward.\u201d <em>United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1228 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted). Thus, where the parties do not dispute that the district court recognized its authority to depart downward, we will not review the decision because we lack the jurisdiction to do so. <em>Winingear, </em>422 <em>F.3d </em>at 1246.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">The court properly assessed a criminal history point for Kalu\u2019s felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>conviction for driving with a license suspended because all felonies, regardless of the term of imprisonment, are counted for the purposes of calculating criminal history points, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c). Further, we will not consider the district court\u2019s decision to deny Kalu\u2019s request for a downward departure, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(b)(1), because we lack jurisdiction to review the court\u2019s decision where, as here, the record shows that it was aware of its authority to depart.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Upward Variance</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">We generally review the reasonableness of a sentence under a deferential abuse of discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, 552 </em>U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court has wide discretion to decide whether 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify a variance. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>628 F.3d 1258, 1264 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2166, 179 L.Ed.2d 946 (2011). \u201cA district court\u2019s sentence need not be the most appropriate one, it need only be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1191 (11th Cir.2010) <em>(en </em>banc), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1813, 179 L.Ed.2d 772 (2011). We will reverse only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the acts of the case.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>628 F.3d at 1264-65 (quotations omitted). The party challenging the sentence has the burden of establishing that the sentence was unreasonable based on the record and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). We will not presume that a sentence outside of the guideline range is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Mateos, </em>623 F.3d 1350, 1366 (11th Cir.2010), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1540, 179 L.Ed.2d 310 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-13\">The district court must impose a sentence \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary to comply with the purposes\u201d listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), including the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment for the offense, deter criminal conduct, and protect the public from the defendant\u2019s future criminal conduct. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). In imposing a particular sentence, the court must also consider the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, the kinds of sentences available, the applicable guideline range, the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to victims. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-14\">The level of discussion and detail a judge must give regarding his consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is often up to his own professional judgment, and a full opinion is not required in every case. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The judge must \u201cset forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is sufficient that the district court considers the defendant\u2019s arguments at sentencing and states that it has taken the \u00a7 3553(a) factors into account. <em>United States v. Alfaro-Moncada, </em>607 F.3d 720, 735 (11th Cir.2010), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 1604, 179 L.Ed.2d 505 (2011). However, where a district court varies from the Guidelines, the court \u201cmust explain its conclusion that an unusually lenient or an unusually harsh sentence is appropriate in a particular case with sufficient justifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>tions.\u201d <em>Mateos, </em>623 F.3d at 1366 (quotation omitted). A major variance from the guideline range should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor variance. <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1186. Thus, the justification for the variance must be \u201csufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d Id (quotation omitted). Because economic and fraud-based crimes are \u201cmore rational, cool, and calculated than sudden crimes of passion or opportunity, these crimes are prime candidates for general deterrence.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1240 (11th Cir.2006) (quotations and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">Because the court considered the arguments Kalu made at sentencing, considered the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and justified its decision to vary from the Guidelines, we hold that the district court had a reasoned basis for exercising its own legal decision-making authority and did not abuse its discretion in imposing a total sentence of 168 months\u2019 imprisonment. The court determined that Kalu had committed this type of offense before and that he was a \u201ccon man.\u201d After it expressly stated that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, it determined that an above the guideline sentence was necessary to deter Kalu from committing such an offense again, as well as necessary to protect the public from his conduct. Because of the nature of Kalu\u2019s criminal history, deterrence was a particularly appropriate factor to consider based on the calculated nature of his fraudulent activities. <em>Martin, </em>455 F.3d at 1240. Thus, Kalu failed to carry his burden to show that his sentence was procedurally or substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Based upon the foregoing and our review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Kalu\u2019s convictions and total sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
