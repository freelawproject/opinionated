On appeal, Miller argues that the district court erred in refusing to give his proposed jury instruction on constructive possession. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-14\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to reject a proposed jury instruction for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>525 F.3d 1083, 1046 (11th Cir.2008). Under that standard, we will reverse only if \u201c(1) the requested instruction correctly stated the law; (2) the actual charge to the jury did not substantially cover the proposed instruction; and (3) the failure to give the instruction substantially impaired the defendant\u2019s ability to present an effective defense.\u201d <em>United States v. Palma, </em>511 F.3d 1311, 1315 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation marks omitted). We bear in mind that \u201ca district court judge is vested with broad discretion in formulating [her] charge to the jury so long as it accurately reflects the law and the facts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-15\">The district court in this case relied on the Eleventh Circuit pattern jury instruction for the element of possession. <em>See generally </em>Eleventh Circuit Pattern Jury Instructions (Criminal Cases) Special Instruction 6 (2010). The court told the jury that \u201c[t]he law recognizes several kinds of possession,\u201d including both \u201cactual possession\u201d and \u201cconstructive possession.\u201d The court explained that \u201c[a]ctual possession of a thing occurs if a person knowingly has direct physical control of it.\u201d The court also said that \u201c[cjonstructive possession of a thing occurs if a person doesn\u2019t have actual possession of it, but has both the power and the intention to take control over it later.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-16\">Miller requested the district court to provide an additional instruction regarding constructive possession:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1010-17\">Also for possession to exist, the government must show that a defendant \u201chas knowledge of the thing possessed coupled with the ability to maintain control over it or reduce it to his physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>possession even though he does not have actual personal dominion\u201d or has \u201cownership, dominion or control over the premises or the vehicle in which the contraband was concealed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1011-5\">Mere presence near contraband, or awareness of its location, is insufficient to establish possession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1011-6\">The district court found the pattern jury instruction the appropriate one to give and denied Miller\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-7\">On appeal, Miller argues that the district court erred in rejecting his proposed instruction. However, Miller has not met the standard required for a reversal due to a jury charge. The instruction given by the district court \u201csubstantially cover[ed]\u201d Miller\u2019s proposed charge. <em>Palma, </em>511 F.3d at 1815 (quotation marks omitted). The district court\u2019s instruction that the defendant must have had the \u201cpower ... to take control\u201d of the firearm means, as the proposed instruction put it, that the defendant must have had the \u201cability to maintain control over it or reduce it to his physical possession\u201d \u2014 for instance, by having \u201cownership, dominion or control over the premises ... in which the [firearm] was concealed.\u201d We see no meaningful difference between the two, and Miller urges none.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-8\">Likewise, the district court\u2019s instruction that the defendant must have had an \u201cintention to take control\u201d of the firearm necessarily includes the idea that the defendant must have had \u201cknowledge of the thing.\u201d Further, the requirement that there be an \u201cintention to take control\u201d precludes a finding of guilt based on \u201c[m]ere presence\u201d or the mere \u201cawareness of [the firearm\u2019s] location.\u201d <em>See United States v. Rojas, </em>537 F.2d 216, 220 (5th Cir.1976) (holding that an instruction requiring the jury to find that the defendant had \u201cthe power and intention to exercise dominion and control over the cocaine\u201d was adequate to convey the principle that \u201cmere presence or proximity\u201d is not sufficient).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the district court\u2019s instruction substantially covered the requested charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-11\">Neither can we say that any failure on the part of the district court to give the requested instruction \u201csubstantially impaired [Miller\u2019s] ability to present an effective defense.\u201d <em>Palma, </em>511 F.3d at 1315 (quotation marks omitted). Miller raised the issue of whether he had the intention to take control of the firearm during both his opening and closing statements. Specifically, Miller argued to the jury that he did not intend to take control of the firearm, despite his presence on the premises. He thus conveyed the idea that he was merely present and that this was not enough to support a conviction. In view of this, we cannot say that the district court erred. <em>See United States v. Freyre-Lazaro, </em>3 F.3d 1496, 1505 (11th Cir.1993) (holding that the district court\u2019s failure to give the instruction was not error given that the defendant\u2019s theory was \u201cfully explained ... in [his] opening and closing argument\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-12\">For these reasons, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1011-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1011-9\">.
