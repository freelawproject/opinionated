Ammedie did not specify a cause of action in his complaint, which he filed in state court, but Sallie Mae removed the action to federal court, asserting federal question jurisdiction based on the complete preemption doctrine. According to Sallie Mae\u2019s notice of removal, Ammedie\u2019s \u201cstatement of claim,\u201d which requested the return of his tax refund that Sallie Mae had intercepted for a student loan debt, was necessarily federal in character because the Higher Education Act (\u201cHEA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1070 <em>et seq., </em>completely preempts all state-law claims in the area of student loan debt collection. Ammedie did not move to remand or otherwise object to jurisdiction below, and, on appeal, he does not address whether the district court had subject matter jurisdiction over his case. Rather, liberally construed, Ammedie argues that removal was improper because his \u201ctrial was supposed to be held\u201d in the state court, which failed to follow proper protocol, including failing to notify him of removal. After careful review, we vacate the judgment of the district court and remand to the district court to remand the case to the state court from which it came.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-14\">We are \u201cobliged to notice any lack of jurisdiction regardless of whether the question is raised by the parties themselves.\u201d <em>Edge v. Sumter County Sch. Dist., </em>775 F.2d 1509, 1513 (11th Cir.1985). We review subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Cmty. State Bank v. Strong, </em>651 F.3d 1241, 1251 (11th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-15\">In removed cases, a plaintiff cannot waive arguments regarding subject matter jurisdiction by failing to move for remand. <em>See Wilson v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>888 F.2d 779, 781 n. 1 (11th Cir.1989). Procedural defects in removal, however, are waived if the plaintiff fails to move for remand within thirty days of the notice of removal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number><em>See id,.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Where a district court entered judgment without objections to removal, we \u201canalyze simply whether original jurisdiction existed over the case at the time the court entered the judgment,\u201d not at the time of removal. <em>Maseda v. Honda Motor Co., Ltd., </em>861 F.2d 1248, 1252 n. 5 (11th Cir.1988). We may consider the complaint, the notice of removal, and, where the pleadings are inadequate on the issue of subject matter jurisdiction, the reeord to consider whether there is jurisdiction. <em>See Williams v. Best Buy Co., </em>269 F.3d 1316, 1319-20 (11th Cir.2001) (considering <em>sua sponte </em>whether subject matter jurisdiction existed in a case in which plaintiff did not move for remand after removal and neither party raised the issue of jurisdiction on appeal).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">In relevant part, \u201cdistrict courts [ ] have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. Generally, a federal question must appear on the face of a plaintiffs well-pleaded complaint for a claim to arise under federal law. <em>See Cmty. State Bank, </em>651 F.3d at 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">If a federal question does not appear on the face of the complaint, then the plaintiffs claim arises under federal law only if it \u201cfalls within the special category of federal question jurisdiction created by the doctrine of complete preemption.\u201d <em>Cotton v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., </em>402 F.3d 1267, 1281 (11th Cir.2005). This doctrine applies where Congress has \u201cpreempt[ed] an area of law so completely that any complaint raising claims in that area is necessarily federal in character and therefore necessarily presents a basis for federal court jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">Complete preemption is \u201ca rare doctrine,\u201d <em>Cmty. State Bank, </em>651 F.3d at 1261 n. 16, and \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has applied [it] to only three federal statutes: \u00a7 301 of the [Labor-Management Relations Act], the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132, and \u00a7\u00a7 85 and 86 of the National Bank Act.\u201d <em>Atwater v. Nat\u2019l Football League Players Ass\u2019n, </em>626 F.3d 1170, 1176 n. 7 (11th Cir.2010). Moreover, \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has cautioned that complete preemption can be found only in statutes with \u2018extraordinary\u2019 preemptive force.\u201d <em>Geddes v. Am. Airlines, Inc., </em>321 F.3d 1349, 1353 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-10\">Complete preemption, a jurisdictional doctrine, is distinct from \u201cdefensive,\u201d or \u201cordinary,\u201d preemption, which \u201callows a defendant to defeat a plaintiffs state-law claim on the merits by asserting the supremacy of federal law as an affirmative defense.\u201d <em>Cmty. State Bank, </em>651 F.3d at 1261 n. 16. Defensive preemption does not create subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See id. </em>That is, \u201ca case may <em>not </em>be removed to federal court on the basis of a federal defense, including the defense of pre-emption, even if the defense is anticipated in the plaintiffs complaint, and even if both parties concede that the federal defense is the only question truly at issue.\u201d <em>Cater</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number><em>pillar Inc. v. Williams, </em>482 U.S. 386, 393, 107 S.Ct. 2425, 96 L.Ed.2d 318 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Complete preemption is narrower than defensive preemption, such that a state-law claim may be defensively preempted but not completely preempted for jurisdictional purposes. <em>Cotton, </em>402 F.3d at 1281. However, \u201cclaims that are completely preempted are also defensively preempted,\u201d and \u201c[t]hus, if it appears that a claim is not even defensively preempted, then it will not be completely preempted either.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, \u201cdefensive preemption cases may inform the complete preemption analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1281-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">In <em>Cliff v. Payco Gen. Am. Credits, Inc., </em>363 F.3d 1113 (11th Cir.2004), we considered whether the Higher Education Act defensively preempted the plaintiffs state-law consumer protection claim resulting from wage garnishments for student loan debt. <em>See id. </em>at 1118 &amp; n. 4, 1124-31. We held that none of the three types of defensive preemption \u2014 express, field, or conflict \u2014 existed as to the plaintiffs claim. <em>See id. </em>at 1124-31. In examining field preemption, the question of whether the HEA \u201c \u2018occupies] the field\u2019 of debt collection practices,\u201d we noted that \u201cconsumer protection is a field traditionally regulated by the states.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1125-26. We also concluded that \u201cthe HEA does not occupy the field of student loan debt collection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1130. Although not applicable to the plaintiffs claims in <em>Cliff, </em>we noted that \u00a7 1095a of the HEA, which governs wage garnishment, defensively preempts \u201conly those provisions of state law that would otherwise prohibit or hinder the ability of a guaranty agency to garnish a debtor\u2019s wages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1125.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Ammedie\u2019s complaint, which asked simply for the return of his $400.00 tax refund and removal of his name from the IRS collection list, did not state any tort theory of recovery, or any violation of any state or federal law. As a result, it did not raise a federal question on its face. Therefore, Ammedie\u2019s claim arose under federal law only if it \u201cf[ell] within the special category of federal question jurisdiction created by the doctrine of complete preemption.\u201d <em>Cotton, </em>402 F.3d at 1281. Although it is not clear what claim Am-medie\u2019s complaint raised, we view it as an improper garnishment or improper levy claim existing in the field of consumer protection, an area traditionally regulated by the states. <em>See Cliff, </em>363 F.3d at 1125; <em>see also Brown v. Masonry Products, Inc., </em>874 F.2d 1476, 1479 (11th Cir.1989) (affirming the district court\u2019s finding \u201cthat any remedy [plaintiff] was entitled to because of an allegedly improper garnishment was a matter of state law\u201d). The HEA does not defensively preempt all state-law claims in the area of consumer protection. <em>See Cliff, </em>363 F.3d at 1125-26. Moreover, even viewing the area at issue more narrowly \u2014 as the area of student loan debt collection \u2014 \u201cthe HEA does not occupy the field of student loan debt collection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1130. It follows then that complete preemption does not exist either, <em>see Cotton, </em>402 F.3d at 1281 (where \u201cit appears that a claim is not even defensively preempted, then it will not be completely preempted\u201d); that is, that Congress has not preempted this \u201carea of law so completely that any complaint raising claims in that area is necessarily federal in character and therefore necessarily presents a basis for federal court jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Because complete preemption does not exist, the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction based on federal question jurisdiction when it granted Sallie Mae\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) motion for Am-medie\u2019s failure to respond and ordered the clerk to dismiss the action. Moreover, the court did not have subject matter jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>tion through 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1846 (granting the district court original jurisdiction to hear civil actions against the United States in certain circumstances), because no precedent establishes that Sallie Mae is considered to be the United States for the purposes of that provision. Finally, it is apparent from the face of the complaint that the amount in controversy is much less than $75,000, precluding diversity jurisdiction. <em>See Williams, </em>269 F.3d at 1319; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(1). Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand with an order for the district court to remand the action to state court.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b427-7\">. Thus, to the extent that Ammedie is raising procedural, non jurisdictional defects regarding the removal of his case, like issues regarding notice, he has waived these by failing to move for remand below. <em>See Wilson, </em>888 F.2d at 781 n. 1. Moreover, because we conclude below that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, we do not address whether the district court properly dismissed Ammedie\u2019s case for failure to respond except to note that, first, the notice of removal and notice of the motion to dismiss were sent to Ammedie\u2019s address as listed in his complaint. Further, the district court does have the discretion under <em>Magluta v. Samples, </em>162 F.3d 662 (11th Cir.1998), to dismiss based on a failure to respond. <em>See id. </em>at 664-65. And, third, no theory of recovery or theory of wrongdoing by Sallie Mae is apparent from the face of the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
