(Citi). She also moves this court for appointment of counsel and summary judgment. By moving for IFP status here, Tyler is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that her appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a). Tyler\u2019s brief on appeal contends that Citi should have reduced her payoff amount and that Citi harassed her, threatened foreclosure, and placed her in foreclosure. She does not address, however, the district court\u2019s certification that her appeal was not taken in good faith, nor does she address any of the district court\u2019s reasons for its certification decision. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202. Accordingly, her challenge to the district court\u2019s certification decision is deemed abandoned. See <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Additionally, Tyler has not shown that her appeal involves \u201clegal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-14\">Tyler\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal is DENIED; her motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED; her motion for summary judgment is DENIED; and her appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b727-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
