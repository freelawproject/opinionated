Lamb then pled guilty to Count 5 of the indictment, possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The District Court sentenced Lamb as a career offender, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a), because he was over 18 years of age at the time of the offenses and had at least two felony convictions for controlled substance offenses. Because the maximum penalty for the Count 4 offense was life imprisonment, his offense level was 37. Given his criminal history category of VI, Lamb\u2019s imprisonment range under the Guidelines was 360 months to life.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The District Court, granting Lamb a significant downward variance, sentenced him to concurrent prison terms of 120 months on Counts 1 and 3 and 121 months on Counts 2 and 5, and a consecutive term of 60 months on Count 4,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for a total term of imprisonment of 181 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">Lamb appealed his convictions on Counts 1-4 and his sentence on Count 5, and this court affirmed. <em>United States v. </em>Lamb, 214 Fed.Appx. 908 (11th Cir.2007). On November 14, 2011, Lamb, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>moved the District Court to modify his sentencing package pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), on the ground that Amendment 750 of the Sentencing Guidelines, a retroactive amendment that reduced the base offense levels for crack cocaine offenses, and the sentencing factors of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) warranted a reduction. The court denied his motion, concluding that Amendment 750 was inapplicable because he had been sentenced as a career offender. Lamb now appeals. He argues that, even though he was a career offender, he qualifies for a sentence reduction under Amendment 750 because the starting point or basis of the District Court\u2019s determination of his sentences was U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(which applies to drug offenses), not U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Moreover, a reduction is necessary to satisfy the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and to alleviate the sentencing disparity between crack cocaine and cocaine powder.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-12\">We are not persuaded. The District Court lacked authority to reduce Lamb\u2019s Count 5 sentence based upon Amendment 750 because Lamb was sentenced as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. He would not have been eligible for relief even if he were not a career offender. Why? His offense level was not calculated under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, but pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1, which applies to the possession of firearms, and Amendment 750 has no application in sentencing range calculations made under \u00a7 2K2.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-13\">To the extent that Lamb simply asserts that he merits a sentence reduction based on \u00a7 3553(a) factors, his claim fails because a sentence adjustment under \u00a7 3582(c) is not a <em>de novo </em>re-sentencing; a court may apply the \u00a7 3553(a) factors only if it first has the authority to grant a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>reduction and then decides to reduce the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-2\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b407-8\">. In addition, Lamb's conviction on Count 4 required a mandatory consecutive sentence of 60 months, raising the bottom of the Guidelines sentence range to 420 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b407-14\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i) provided a mandatory minimum sentence of \"not less than 5 years\u201d for the Count 4 offense, to be imposed \"in addition to the punishment provided for such ... drug trafficking crime,\u201d i.e., the offenses charged in Counts 2 and 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
