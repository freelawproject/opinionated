He filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition, arguing that the time that he spent in a community corrections center (CCC), or halfway house, prior to sentencing, and the time that he spent in the CCC after sentencing but prior to the date that he reported to the designated Bureau of Prisons (BOP) facility, should be credited against his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b). The district court denied the \u00a7 2241 petition, reasoning that Munoz\u2019s claim was vitiated by <em>Reno v. Koray, </em>515 U.S. 50, 57-65, 115 S.Ct. 2021, 132 L.Ed.2d 46 (1995), in which the Supreme Court held that time spent while released on bail subject to restrictions, including confinement in a community treatment facility, does not constitute official detention for purposes of \u00a7 3585(b) and is not credited toward the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-23\">On appeal, Munoz again challenges the BOP\u2019s sentence calculation, and he argues that the district court failed to recognize that his request for credit comprised two different time periods: (1) the time spent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>in a halfway house prior to the oral pronouncement of sentence, and (2) the time spent in a halfway house after he was sentenced. He also maintains that the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) opinion, set forth in a memorandum dated December 16, 2002, that a CCC constitutes a penal or correctional facility, undermines the reasoning in <em>Koray </em>and mandates credit for pre-sentencing time served in a CCC.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Munoz\u2019s arguments are without merit. Prior to reporting to the BOP facility, Munoz was released on bail, subject to the restriction that he maintain residence in a halfway house or CCC; he was not \u201ccommitted to the custody of the Attorney General\u201d or otherwise \u201csubject to BOP\u2019s control.\u201d <em>Koray, </em>515 U.S. at 57-58, 115 S.Ct. 2021 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Accordingly, Munoz was not in \u201cofficial detention\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 3585(b), and the district court did not err when it held that the BOP correctly denied Munoz\u2019s requested credit. <em>See id. </em>at 58-65, 115 S.Ct. 2021. Additionally, any challenge by Munoz to the district court\u2019s failure to make findings about the purportedly restrictive nature of the time he spent in the halfway house is foreclosed by <em>Ko-ray, </em>in which the Court specifically rejected the \u201cjail-type confinement\u201d test as being \u201csufficiently vague and amorphous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63-64, 115 S.Ct. 2021. Finally, Munoz\u2019s reliance on the DOJ memorandum of December 16, 2002, is misplaced. Even if a CCC may constitute a place of imprisonment, Munoz cannot show that he was in the custody of the BOP. <em>See id. </em>at 58, 63, 115 S.Ct. 2021.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Munoz\u2019s motion to supplement the record on appeal is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b725-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
