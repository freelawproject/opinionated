No justification has been made for the late filing. The court\u2019s strike of the claims of the appellants was not an abuse of discretion, and the order and judgment were therefore legally correct. The claims of all parties were resolved and the judgment was final.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b699-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
