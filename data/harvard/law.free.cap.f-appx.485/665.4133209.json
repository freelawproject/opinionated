Flores challenges the imposition of a 16-level enhancement, which was based on a finding that his prior California conviction for sexual battery by restraint qualified as a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-19\">Because Flores did not object to the enhancement in the district court, we review his claim for plain error. <em>See United States v. Gutierrez, </em>635 F.3d 148, 152 (5th Cir.2011). To show plain error, Flores must show an error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights. <em>Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009). If he makes such a showing, we have the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-20\">The Sentencing Guidelines provide for an increase of 16 levels when a defendant was previously deported after a conviction for a crime of violence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii). The definition of a crime of violence in the Commentary to \u00a7 2L1.2 lists various enumerated offenses, including \u201cforcible sex offenses\u201d or \u201cany other offense under federal, state, or local law that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 1(B)(iii). The term \u201cforcible sex offenses\u201d specifically includes offenses \u201cwhere consent to the conduct is not given or is not legally valid, such as where consent to the conduct is involuntary, incompetent, or coerced.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This language was added \u201cto make it clear that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>forcible sex offenses, like all offenses enumerated in Application Note l(B)(iii), are always classified as crimes of violence, regardless of whether the prior offense expressly has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d <em>United States v. Diaz-Corado, </em>648 F.3d 290, 293 (5th Cir.2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The Government supplemented the record with state court documents which establish that Flores was convicted under California Penal Code \u00a7 243.4(a). Although we have not specifically addressed whether \u00a7 243.4(a) constitutes a crime of violence, we have held that similar statutes from other states do qualify as forcible sex offenses, and consequently as an enumerated offense, pursuant to the definitions in the Commentary. <em>See United States v. Herrera, </em>647 F.3d 172, 176-180 (5th Cir.2011) (Arkansas offense of sexual conduct by forcible compulsion); <em>Diaz-Corado, </em>648 F.3d at 293 (Colorado offense of unlawful sexual contact). We found in <em>Diaz-Corado </em>that because the defendant\u2019s conduct \u201cnecessarily involved\u201d non-consensual sexual contact, the defendant\u2019s conviction \u201cfalls squarely within\u201d the Sentencing Guidelines\u2019 definition of a forcible sex offense. <em>Id. </em>In the instant case, the California statute also requires non-consensual sexual contact. <em>See </em>\u00a7 243.4(a) (requiring, in part, that the sexual touching be \u201cagainst the will of the person touched\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Because we have not specifically held that \u00a7 243.4(a) does not qualify as a crime of violence, and because we have held that similar statutes do qualify as a crime of violence, we conclude that Flores has not met his burden to show that the district court plainly erred when it imposed a 16-level enhancement to Flores\u2019s sentence. <em>See Puckett, </em>556 U.S. at 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b692-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
