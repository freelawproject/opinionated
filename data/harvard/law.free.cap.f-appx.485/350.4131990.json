After review, we conclude that Towells\u2019s sentence is directly impacted by <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012), and that Towells preserved the <em>Dorsey </em>issue in the district court and in this direct appeal. Therefore, we vacate Towells\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for resen-tencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">On November 1, 2009, police in Gadsden, Alabama, observed Defendant Towells leave his vehicle, enter another car, and exit that car to go to a nearby house. Police ordered Towells to stop and observed Towells throw a clear plastic bag over a house as he walked away. Police recovered the plastic bag, which appeared to contain crack cocaine, and arrested To-wells.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">Forensic analysis showed that the plastic bag contained 20.36 grams of crack cocaine. On September 29, 2010, Towells pled guilty to one count of possessing five grams or more of crack cocaine with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-15\">A. Presentence Investigation Report</p>\n<p id=\"Aof\">Towells\u2019s presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) assigned a base offense level of 22 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(a)(5), (c)(9). The PSI recommended a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility and a one-level reduction for providing complete information about his involvement in the offense or timely notifying authorities of his intent to plead guilty, which together resulted in a total adjusted offense level of 19. The PSI assigned Towells a criminal history category of III, which yielded an advisory guidelines range of 37 to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-16\">Prior to Towells\u2019s plea, the government filed a notice claiming that Towells had been convicted of a felony \u201cViolation of the Georgia Controlled Substances Act.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The government alleged that this crime was a \u201cprior conviction for a drug felony offense\u201d under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) that triggered that statute\u2019s 10-year mandatory minimum sentence for persons convicted of possessing five grams or more of crack cocaine.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years became Towells\u2019s guidelines sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.1(b) (\u201cWhere the statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guide<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>line range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\u201d)-</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">B. Fair Sentencing Act Objection</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Towells did not object to any of the facts alleged in the PSI, including his prior Georgia felony drug conviction. At his January 2011 sentencing hearing, Towells argued that the Fair Sentencing Act (\u201cFSA\u201d) applied to his sentence. Towells committed this federal crime in November 2009, before the FSA was enacted, on August 8, 2010. Towells argued that the FSA still applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">The FSA raised from five to 28 grams the threshold amount of crack cocaine necessary to trigger the 10-year mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). Fair Sentencing Act of 2010, Pub.L. No. 111-220 \u00a7 2(a), 124 Stat. 2872 (2010). To-wells pled guilty to possessing only 20.36 grams of crack cocaine. Thus, if the FSA applied, Towells would not be subject to the 10-year mandatory minimum sentence. Rather, Towells would be subject to his advisory guidelines range of 27 to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">The district court declined to apply the FSA-amended penalty provisions and sentenced Towells to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. The United States Supreme Court recently held that the FSA\u2019s <em>\u201cmore </em>lenient penalty provisions apply to offenders who committed a crack cocaine crime before August 3, 2010, but were not sentenced until after August 3.\u201d <em>Dorsey v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2321, 2326, 183 L.Ed.2d 250 (2012). We therefore vacate Towells\u2019s sentence and remand for the limited purpose of resentencing in light of <em>Dorsey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b377-13\">. The government\u2019s notice did not specify which provision of the Georgia Code Towells violated, but documents attached to the government's notice showed that Towells pled guilty in 1997 to one count of violating Georgia Code \u00a7 16-13-30(a), which provides, \"Except as authorized by this title, it is unlawful for any person to purchase, possess, or have under his control any controlled substance.\u201d Under Georgia Code \u00a7 16\u2014 13 \u2014 3 0(g), \"Any person who violates subsection (a) of this Code section with respect to a controlled substance in Schedule III, IV, or V shall be guilty of a <em>felony-\"</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b377-18\">. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) stated that \"[i]f any person commits such a violation [of \u00a7 841(a) ] after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final, such person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 10 years....\"</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
