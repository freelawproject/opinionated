Anderson\u2019s complaint arises out of an arrest warrant application signed by Jacquelyn Byrd alleging child abandonment against Anderson and the subsequent warrant application hearing held in the magistrate court. On appeal, Anderson alleges due process violations, malicious prosecution, denial of his right to appeal, false arrest, false imprisonment, excessive bond, failure to train, and intentional infliction of emotional distress against Fulton County, Magistrate Kim Warden, and Assistant Solicitor Monica Benning. Anderson also seems to argue that denial of his application to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>on appeal was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-16\">The Prison Litigation Reform Act provides that any <em>informa pauperis </em>action or appeal shall be dismissed at any time if it is frivolous or malicious. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). We review determinations of frivolity for abuse of discretion. <em>Bilal v. Driver, </em>251 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11-th Cir.2001). A claim is frivolous if it is without arguable merit either in law or fact. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-17\">\u201cJudges are entitled to absolute judicial immunity from damages for those acts taken while they are acting in their judicial capacity unless they acted in the \u2018clear absence of all jurisdiction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sibley v. Lando, </em>437 F.3d 1067, 1070 (11th Cir.2005). Absolute judicial immunity \u201capplies even when the judge\u2019s acts are in error, malicious, or were in excess of his or her jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhether a judge\u2019s actions were made while acting in his judicial capacity depends on whether: (1) the act complained of constituted a normal judicial function; (2) the events occurred in the judge\u2019s chambers or in open court; (3) the controversy involved a case pending before the judge; and (4) the confrontation arose immediately out of a visit to -the judge in his judicial capacity.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b421-18\">Anderson\u2019s claims against Warden all stem from conduct that occurred while she was acting within her judicial capacity. <em>See id. </em>A Georgia magistrate has authori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>ty to conduct an arrest warrant hearing for a claim of child abandonment, including a determination that there is probable cause to arrest the accused.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A magistrate also has ample authority to set bond at $1000 for a misdemeanor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court properly dismissed the complaint as frivolous as it relates to Warden.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Anderson\u2019s complaint does not describe any specific allegations against Ben-ning, and thus the district court was proper to dismiss the complaint as frivolous as it relates to Benning.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The district court also properly dismissed Anderson\u2019s claim against Fulton County for failure to train. \u201cIn limited circumstances, a local government\u2019s decision not to train certain employees about their legal duty to avoid violating citizens\u2019 rights may rise to the level of an official government policy for purposes of \u00a7 1988. A municipality\u2019s culpability for a deprivation of rights is at its most tenuous where a claim turns on a failure to train.\u201d <em>Con-nick v. Thompson, </em>- U.S. -, -, 131 S.Ct. 1350, 1359, 179 L.Ed.2d 417 (2011). \u201c[T]o impose \u00a7 1983 liability on a municipality, a plaintiff must show: (1) that his constitutional rights were violated; (2) that the municipality had a custom or policy that constituted deliberate indifference to that constitutional right; and (3) that the policy or custom caused the violation.\u201d <em>McDowell v. Brown, </em>392 F.3d 1283, 1289 (11th Cir.2004). Anderson cannot meet the strong showing required to properly allege a failure-to-train claim. <em>See Connick, </em>131 S.Ct. at 1360. He has not shown that his constitutional rights were violated by Warden, nor has he shown that Fulton County itself had a policy or custom that constituted deliberate indifference. <em>See id. </em>(noting that a plaintiff \u201ccannot rely upon the theory of <em>respondeat superior </em>to hold the [municipality] liable\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-8\">. <em>See </em>Ga.
