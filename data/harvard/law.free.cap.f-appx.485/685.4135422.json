(\u201cDelta\u201d) brought suit against Randy J. Maxwell, Concordia Parish Sheriff; Bradley J. Bur-get, Concordia Parish District Attorney; the Concordia Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office; the Louisiana Department of Justice; and James D. Caldwell, the Attorney General of the State of Louisiana. Delta\u2019s complaint purported to bring suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985 and included a federal equal protection claim, a state law claim for wrongful conversion, a claim entitled \u201cState Law Wrongful Conversion: The \u00a7 1983 Action,\u201d and a claim for punitive damages. Delta alleged that the defendants individually and as co-conspirators violated its clearly established rights to protect its property, to access the courts, and to be treated equally under the law. Its claims were based on the state\u2019s dismissal of criminal charges against Barry Maxwell, a former Delta employee, following the state trial judge\u2019s rejection of a plea deal. The defendants moved to dismiss Delta\u2019s complaint pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-17\">The defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss were referred to Magistrate Judge James D. Kirk. The magistrate judge agreed that Delta\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his Report and Recommendation, the magistrate judge found: (1) that the Concordia Parish Sheriffs Department was not a legal entity capable of being sued;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (2) that the Concordia Parish District Attorney\u2019s Office was not a person capable of being sued under \u00a7 1983 and that Louisiana law did not permit the District Attorney\u2019s Office to be sued in its own name;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (3) that the claim against Burget was based on his recusal in the criminal case against Barry Maxwell and that, because the recusal was done in Burget\u2019s role as district attorney, Burget was entitled to absolute prosecuto-rial immunity;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (4) that Caldwell was enti-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>tied to Eleventh Amendment immunity as a state official acting in his official capacity and to absolute prosecutorial immunity for his decision to dismiss criminal charges against Barry Maxwell;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (5) that the Louisiana Department of Justice, a state agency, was not a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1983 and that it was an arm of the state entitled to Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (6) that Delta failed to state a cognizable conspiracy claim or claim of deprivation of a civil right under \u00a7 1983 and had not and could not set forth facts establishing a conspiracy or violation of constitutional rights under \u00a7 1985. The district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendations in full and entered judgment for the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">We find no error in the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations, as adopted by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b712-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
