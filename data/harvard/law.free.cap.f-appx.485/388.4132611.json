Of relevance, McClain was convicted in 1989 of conspiring to manufacture, distribute, and possess with intent to distribute 50 or more grams of crack cocaine, and two counts of possessing 50 or more grams of crack cocaine with intent to distribute. The sentencing court adopted the PSI\u2019s undisputed statements that the offenses involved \u201capproximately 900 grams\u201d of crack cocaine. Based upon these statements, the sentencing court calculated a Guidelines range of 360 months\u2019 to life imprisonment, and imposed concurrent life sentences as to each of McClain\u2019s crack cocaine offenses. In 2008, the district court granted McClain\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion based upon Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines, and imposed a 292-month sentence (or time served, if greater) as to each crack cocaine offense after calculating a new Guidelines range of 292 to 365 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">McClain filed a second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, which is the subject of the instant appeal, and relied upon Amendment 750.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, McClain argues the sentencing court did not make a specific finding as to the amount of crack cocaine for which he was responsible, and the district court could not speculate that the sentencing court held him responsible for at least 840 grams of crack cocaine&amp;emdash;the threshold amount of crack cocaine over which Amendment 750 would not alter his applicable Guidelines range.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s conclusions regarding its authority to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. James, </em>548 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>F.3d 983, 984 (11th Cir.2008). A district court may not reduce a defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment that has been imposed unless the defendant\u2019s sentence was based upon a sentencing range that the Sentencing Commission subsequently lowered, the district court considers the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors to the extent they are applicable, and the reduction is consistent with the applicable policy statements of the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction is not consistent with the Guidelines\u2019 policy statement if it does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable Guidelines range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">McClain concedes the sentencing court adopted the PSI\u2019s undisputed statements holding him accountable for approximately 900 grams of crack cocaine. The sentencing court\u2019s adoption of those undisputed statements was sufficient to hold him accountable for that amount, <em>see United States v. Davis, </em>587 F.3d 1300, 1304 (11th Cir.2009), such that the district court did not speculate as to the amount of crack cocaine for which the sentencing court held McClain responsible. Amendment 750 thus did not have the effect of lowering McClain\u2019s applicable Guideline range of 292 to 365 months\u2019 imprisonment because his responsibility for approximately 900 grams of crack cocaine subjected him to that same Guidelines range even after Amendment 750\u2019s application. Accordingly, the district court lacked authority to reduce McClain\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b415-11\">. Part A of Amendment 750 amended U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1 by revising the Drug Quantity Table in \u00a7 2D 1.1(c) and reducing the offense levels associated with various amounts of crack cocaine. U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750, Pt. A, <em>cross-referencing </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 748. After Amendment 750, a defendant who is held responsible for at least 840 grams, but less than 2.8 kilograms, of crack cocaine receives a base offense level of 34. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend. 750; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D 1.1 (c)(3) (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b415-16\">. McClain also argues that the rule of lenity mandated that the district court resolve any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>ambiguity created by the word \"approximately\u201d in his favor. However, the rule of lenity is a tool of statutory construction that applies to resolve ambiguities in a criminal statute that remain after all of the tools of statutory construction have been exhausted. <em>See United States v. Tobin, </em>676 F.3d 1264, 1273 (11th Cir.2012). As McClain did not raise any issues of statutory construction, the rule of lenity does not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
