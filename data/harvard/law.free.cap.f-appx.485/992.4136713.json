On appeal, Searcy raises various counsel-related claims that he argues were improperly rejected by the state courts: (1) he was denied his right to counsel at a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of his criminal proceeding; (2) he received ineffective assistance of appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>counsel because appellate counsel did not argue on appeal that his counsel at the evidentiary hearing should have moved to have trial counsel\u2019s phone records admitted, that the trial judge made improper comments about trial counsel\u2019s testimony, that the transcript was incomplete, or that the trial court failed to make a pronouncement of guilt at a August 25, 2008 hearing; (3) he- received ineffective assistance of trial counsel because trial counsel did not communicate with Searcy about a proper defense and did not investigate or call Federico Wilson to testify at trial; (4) the trial court fundamentally erred in denying trial counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw based on a pending bar complaint; and (5) he was denied his right to counsel post-trial by trial counsel, who should have represented him until after a notice of appeal was filed or the time to file a notice of appeal had passed. After careful review, we affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant or denial of a habeas corpus petition. <em>Ward v. Hall, </em>592 F.3d 1144, 1155 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 647, 178 L.Ed.2d 513 (2010). The district court\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for clear error, while mixed questions of law and fact are reviewed <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1020-7\">If a state court has adjudicated a claim on the merits, then federal courts are precluded from granting habeas relief on those claims, unless the adjudication:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1020-8\">(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7lF\">(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1020-11\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). \u201c[A] summary adjudication \u2014 a state court decision denying a petitioner\u2019s claim without an accompanying statement of reasons \u2014 is an adjudication on the merits.\u201d <em>Childers v. Floyd, </em>642 F.3d 953, 968 (11th Cir.2011) (en banc), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Jul. 6, 2011) (No. 11-42).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-12\">\u201c[Cjlearly established Federal law\u201d refers to Supreme Court holdings that were in effect at the time of the relevant state court decision. <em>Ward, </em>592 F.3d at 1155. Under the \u201ccontrary to\u201d clause, federal habeas relief may be granted if the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by the Supreme Court on a question of law or if the state court decides a case differently than the Supreme Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts. <em>Borden v. Allen, </em>646 F.3d 785, 817 (11th Cir.2011), <em>cert. denied, </em>(U.S. Apr. 16, 2012) (No. 11-8303, 11A489). Thus, where the law at the time was unclear as to an issue, a habeas petitioner will be unable to demonstrate that it was \u201cclearly established.\u201d <em>See Anderson v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>462 F.3d 1319, 1327 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1020-13\">The \u201cunreasonable application! ] of clearly established Federal law\u201d clause within \u00a7 2254(d)(1) permits federal habeas relief if the state court correctly identified the governing legal principle from Supreme Court precedent but unreasonably applied that principle to the facts of petitioner\u2019s case. <em>Borden, </em>646 F.3d at 817. A federal court may grant relief when a state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>court has misapplied a governing legal principle to a set of facts different from those of the case in which the principle was announced. <em>Id. </em>For a federal habeas court to find a state court\u2019s application of Supreme Court precedent \u201cunreasonable,\u201d the state court\u2019s adjudication must have been \u201cobjectively unreasonable,\u201d rather than merely \u201cincorrect or erroneous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cA state court\u2019s determination that a claim lacks merit precludes federal habeas relief so long as fairminded jurists could disagree on the correctness of the state court\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Harrington v. Richter, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 770, 786, 178 L.Ed.2d 624 (2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-7\">First, we are unpersuaded by Sear-cy\u2019s claim that the state courts\u2019 denial of his right to counsel at a \u201ccritical stage\u201d of his criminal proceeding was contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law. The Sixth Amendment provides that in all criminal prosecutions, \u201cthe accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defen[s]e.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. The right to counsel attaches in a criminal prosecution after the initiation of adversarial judicial proceedings. <em>Kirby v. Illinois, </em>406 U.S. 682, 689-90, 92 S.Ct. 1877, 32 L.Ed.2d 411 (1972). As the Supreme Court has explained, once attachment occurs, the accused is entitled to counsel during any \u201ccritical stage\u201d of the post-attachment proceedings, and \u201cwhat makes a stage critical is what shows the need for counsel\u2019s presence.\u201d <em>Rothgery v. Gillespie County, </em>554 U.S. 191, 212, 128 S.Ct. 2578, 171 L.Ed.2d 366 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-8\">Supreme Court precedents \u201chave defined critical stages as proceedings between an individual and agents of the State (whether \u2018formal or informal, in court or out,\u2019 ...) that amount to \u2018trial-like confrontations,\u2019 at which counsel would help the accused \u2018in coping with legal problems or ... meeting his adversary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 212 n. 16, 128 S.Ct. 2578 (internal citations omitted). \u201cEven though the defendant has no substantive right to a particular sentence within the range authorized by statute, the sentencing is a critical stage of the criminal proceeding at which he is entitled to the effective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Gardner v. Florida, </em>430 U.S. 349, 358, 97 S.Ct. 1197, 51 L.Ed.2d 393 (1977) (citing <em>Mempa v. Rhay, </em>389 U.S. 128, 88 S.Ct. 254, 19 L.Ed.2d 336 (1967)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-10\">In <em>Mempa, </em>the Supreme Court determined that indigent defendants were entitled to the representation of counsel at probation revocation proceedings at which a recommendation was to be made about the length of sentence to be imposed as a result of the violation. 389 U.S. at 135-37, 88 S.Ct. 254. Counsel\u2019s assistance was necessary to establishing the facts of the probation violation, introducing evidence of mitigating circumstances, and generally aiding and assisting the defendant in presenting his case as to the appropriate sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 135, 88 S.Ct. 254. In <em>Gagnon v. Scarpelli, </em>411 U.S. 778, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973), the Supreme Court distinguished <em>Mempa </em>because the probation revocation sentence to be served in the event of a violation had been established at the time of trial. <em>Id. </em>at 779-81, 93 S.Ct. 1756.</p>\n<p id=\"b1021-11\">Here, the Florida courts\u2019 decision that Searcy\u2019s December 14, 2005 hearing\u2014 when the trial judge was to decide whether he was to be sentenced to 364 days\u2019 or 15 years\u2019 based on an alleged violation of the conditions of his 30-day furlough \u2014 was not a critical stage in his criminal proceedings was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. As the record shows, Searcy was sentenced by the trial court at his plea hearing on <em>November H, 2005, </em>when the court sentenced Searcy to the maximum penalty after Searcy requested a 30-day furlough, and thoroughly explained to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>Searcy that, if he complied with the three conditions of his furlough, his sentence would be mitigated to 364 days\u2019 imprisonment. As a result, the Florida courts reasonably concluded that the <em>December </em>hearing was a <em>surrender </em>hearing, not a sentencing hearing, especially since, based on a review of the December 14, 2005 transcript, the December hearing did not \u201camount to \u2018trial-like confrontations,\u2019 at which counsel would [have] help[ed] the accused \u2018in coping with legal problems or ... meeting his adversary.\u2019 \u201d <em>See Rothgery, </em>554 U.S. at 212 n. 16, 128 S.Ct. 2578. Further, we have not located any Supreme Court precedent holding that a surrender hearing is a critical stage in the criminal proceedings that requires the representation of counsel. Thus, the Florida courts\u2019 conclusion that the December 2005 surrender hearing was not a critical stage cannot be held to be contrary to or an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law within the meaning of \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-4\">Next, we find <em>no </em>merit to Searcy\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims. In <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>the Supreme Court set out a two-part inquiry for ineffectiveness claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1022-5\">First, the defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1022-6\">466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). A habeas petitioner claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must succeed on both prongs of the <em>Strickland </em>test. <em>Johnson v. Alabama, </em>256 F.3d 1156, 1176 (11th Cir.2001). If the defendant makes an insufficient showing on the prejudice prong, the court need not address the performance prong, and vice versa. <em>Holladay v. Haley, </em>209 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-8\">Prejudice is a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052. A reasonable probability is one sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome. <em>Id. </em>\u201cIt is not enough for the defendant to show that the error[ ] had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 693, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-9\">Claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel are governed by the same standards applied to trial counsel under <em>Strickland. See Heath v. Jones, </em>941 F.2d 1126, 1130 (11th Cir.1991). In assessing an appellate attorney\u2019s performance, we are mindful that \u201cthe Sixth Amendment does not require appellate advocates to raise every non-frivolous issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1130-31. Rather, an effective attorney will weed out weaker arguments, even though they may have merit. <em>See id. </em>at 1131. In order to establish prejudice, we must review the merits of the omitted claim. <em>See id. </em>at 1132. Counsel\u2019s performance will be deemed prejudicial if we find that \u201cthe neglected claim would have a reasonable probability of success on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Appellate counsel is not ineffective for failing to raise a nonmeritorious claim on direct appeal. <em>Diaz v. Sec. for the Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>402 F.3d 1136, 1144-45 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b1022-10\">A defendant claiming ineffective assistance of trial counsel in the context of a guilty plea must show not only that counsel committed professional error, but also a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would not have pleaded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 58-59, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985). We have held that \u201ccounsel owes a lesser duty to a client who pleads guilty than to one who decides to go to trial, and in the former case counsel need only provide his client with an understanding of the law in relation to the facts, so that the accused may make an informed and conscious choice between accepting the prosecution\u2019s offer and going to trial.\u201d <em>Wofford v. Wainwright, </em>748 F.2d 1505, 1508 (11th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">Where ineffective assistance is based on trial counsel\u2019s failure to call a witness, the burden to show prejudice is heavy because \u201coften allegations of what a witness would have testified to are largely speculative.\u201d <em>Sullivan v. DeLoach, </em>459 F.3d 1097, 1109 (11th Cir.2006) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">In Florida, a trial judge is not allowed to comment on the testimony of a -witness. <em>See State v. Fullwood, </em>22 So.3d 655, 657 (Fla.App.3d Dist.Ct.App.2009). However, the trial judge\u2019s role in an evidentiary hearing is to make credibility determinations and findings of fact. <em>Shere v. State, </em>742 So.2d 215, 218 n. 8 (Fla.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-7\">As for Searcy\u2019s claims that appellate counsel unreasonably failed to argue that counsel at his evidentiary hearing should have moved to have trial counsel\u2019s phone records admitted, that the trial judge made improper comments about trial counsel\u2019s testimony, that the transcript was incomplete, or that the trial court failed to make a pronouncement of guilt at a August 2008 hearing, Searcy has not shown that the Florida court\u2019s summary denial of these appellate-ineffectiveness claims was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, <em>Strickland. </em>For starters, it is merely Searcy\u2019s speculation that phone records existed that would have discredited trial counsel\u2019s testimony and proven that trial counsel told Searcy that the court would grant the motion to extend the furlough. Trial counsel\u2019s testimony at the evidentia-ry hearing established that counsel kept timesheets that reflected when and for how long he spoke with Searcy about his case, and there was no testimony that suggested that any phone records existed that reflected the substance of these conversations. Since it is merely speculation that phone records existed at all, it would have been frivolous for appellate counsel to raise such an issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">Further, we do not see how the trial judge\u2019s comments about trial counsel\u2019s testimony could be improper since the judge commented on counsel\u2019s credibility at the end of the evidentiary hearing when making the necessary credibility determinations and findings of fact. As for the completeness of the transcript, Searcy cites no authority and we have located no authority that establishes that it was impermissible for the State to use an incomplete transcript to refresh Searcy\u2019s memory at the evidentiary hearing. Lastly, there was no need for the trial court to make an oral pronouncement of guilt at the August 25, 2008 hearing because Sear-cy was adjudicated guilty at the plea hearing and that adjudication was never overturned. Therefore, it would have been frivolous for appellate counsel to raise any of these claims on appeal. Accordingly, appellate counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise the nonmeritorious claims on appeal. <em>See Diaz, </em>402 F.3d at 1144-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">Searcy has also failed to show that the Florida court\u2019s conclusion that his ineffective-assistance-of-trial counsel claims (concerning trial counsel\u2019s failure to communicate with Searcy about a proper defense and to investigate or call Federico Wilson to testify) were meritless was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, <em>Strickland. </em>First, the record contradicts Searcy\u2019s claim that trial counsel was ineffective for not communicating with him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>about a proper defense prior to Searcy\u2019s acceptance of the plea. Among other things, Searcy has not shown prejudice as his rights at trial were fully explained to him during the change of plea hearing. Also, Searcy did not show that there was a reasonable probability that he would not have pled guilty if his counsel had not made the alleged error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-4\">Searcy has also not shown that the outcome of his case would have been different if counsel had investigated and called Wilson to testify. Indeed, there was no trial in which to call Wilson to testify since Searcy pled guilty, and moreover, Searcy makes no assertion that there was a reasonable probability that he would not have pled guilty if his counsel had investigated Wilson. Accordingly, the Florida court\u2019s denial of his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, <em>Strickland.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-5\">We similarly reject Searcy\u2019s argument that the Florida court\u2019s conclusion that his claim that the trial court erred in denying his counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw was without merit was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law. Searcy cites to no authority and we have located no authority that establishes that a court must allow an attorney to withdraw based on a pending bar complaint. Further, the record reflects that the trial court intended to grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw from the case at the plea hearing. However, Searcy expressly asked the state trial court if he could speak with trial counsel about the plea because he wished to resolve his case at that time. Thus, we cannot conclude that the Florida courts\u2019 rejection of this claim was contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-7\">Finally, we are unpersuaded by Searcy\u2019s claim that the Florida court\u2019s rejection of his post-trial-denial-of-counsel claim was contrary to or an unreasonable application of federal law. It is true that if an appeal right is granted by statute, an indigent defendant also has a right to appointed counsel in his first appeal as of right. <em>Douglas v. California, </em>372 U.S. 353, 357-58, 83 S.Ct. 814, 9 L.Ed.2d 811 (1963). Criminal defendants in Florida are entitled to a direct appeal as a matter of right. Fla. Const. Art. 5, \u00a7 4(b)(1); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 924.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-8\">However, the district court did not err in denying Searcy\u2019s petition on the basis that he was denied his right to counsel for the purposes of his direct appeal of his judgment and conviction. The record reflects that, after Searcy timely filed his <em>pro se </em>notice of appeal, the Florida appellate court appointed counsel to represent him on his first appeal as of right. Accordingly, the State court\u2019s denial of this claim was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, <em>Douglas.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1024-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1020-9\">.
