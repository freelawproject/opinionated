On appeal, Hoyos states that the underlying basis for his motion to reopen is the subsequent grant of his parents\u2019 asylum applications. Hoyos argues that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen because the BIA failed to consider all of the evidence submitted with the motion; the evidence submitted with Hoyos\u2019s motion purports to show that since his application for asylum and withholding of removal was denied in 2004, the persecution in Colombia has continued to escalate.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-16\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). Our review is limited to determining whether the BIA exercised its discretion in an arbitrary or capricious manner. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-17\">A party may only file one motion to reopen removal proceedings, and that motion \u201cshall state the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the motion is granted, and shall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material.\u201d INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(A), (B); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (B). Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i), a \u201cmotion to reopen shall be filed within 90 days of the date of entry of a final administrative order of removal,\u201d subject to certain exceptions. INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). The 90-day period for filing a motion to reopen is jurisdictional and mandatory. <em>Abdi v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>430 F.3d 1148, 1150 (11th Cir.2005). An exception to the time and number limit applies if the motion to reopen is for the purpose of reapplying for relief \u201cbased on changed circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(h); <em>see </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">We have held that, at a minimum, the BIA may deny a motion to reopen on the following three grounds: (1) failure to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case; (2) failure to introduce evidence that was material and previously unavailable; or (3) a determination that an alien is not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion despite statutory eligibility for relief. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1302 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Even in the context of a ruling on the merits, the BIA or the IJ is not required to discuss in its opinion every piece of evidence presented. <em>Tan v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1369, 1374 (11th Cir.2006). Where the BIA has given reasoned consideration to the petition, and made adequate findings, we will not require that it address specifically each claim the petitioner made or each piece of evidence the petitioner presented. <em>See id. </em>Rather, the BIA must \u201cconsider the issues raised and announce its decision in terms sufficient to enable a reviewing court to perceive that it has heard and thought and not merely reacted.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Hoyos\u2019s motion to reopen, because that motion was untimely and Ho-yos failed to establish changed country conditions in Colombia. The fact that Ho-yos\u2019s family was granted asylum in 2009 based on the same set of facts does not establish that conditions in Colombia have materially changed since the BIA affirmed Hoyos\u2019s order of removal in 2004. In support of his motion to reopen, Hoyos submitted four affidavits from three people in Colombia who rented Hoyos\u2019s family\u2019s home and his father\u2019s affidavit stating that he was unable to rent their home in Colombia because people associated with FARC continued to search for and threaten Hoyos and his family. These affidavits do not establish changed country conditions in Colombia, but instead show that he faced the same fear of persecution that he did at the time of his removal hearing. Likewise, the expert witness affidavit and the 2010 State Department Country Report are not material because they do not establish changed country conditions in Colombia. The affidavit and the Country Report show that FARC <em>continues </em>to commit human rights abuse and violence in Colombia. Having not demonstrated materially changed country conditions, Ho-yos\u2019s motion to reopen was both time- and number-barred. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(A), (C); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A), (C); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">Although Hoyos argues that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion to reopen because the BIA failed to consider all of the evidence submitted, the record shows that the BIA noted that Ho-yos submitted \u201climited evidence\u201d with his motion but concluded that the evidence did not demonstrate changed country conditions. Because the BIA adequately explained the decision, it was not required to provide a detailed explanation about how the affidavits and Country Report did not support Hoyos\u2019s claim of changed country conditions. <em>See Tan, </em>446 F.3d at 1374.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
