INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"b737-28\">Plaintiffs, investors in Cardinal Health, Inc. (\u201cCardinal\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d) bring securities fraud actions against Cardinal, Cardinal executives, Robert D. Walter, George L. Fotiades, Richard J. Miller, James F. Millar, Gary S. Jensen, and Mark Parrish (collectively, the \u201cIndividual Defendants\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>), and Cardinal\u2019s independent auditor, accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young (\u201cE &amp; Y\u201d). Plaintiffs allege that from 1998 through 2002, while Cardinal\u2019s pharmaceutical distribution unit underwent a reorganization, the corporation engaged in an elaborate accounting scheme designed to artificially inflate its earnings and conceal debt. Further, Plaintiffs allege that E &amp; Y, hired as the Company\u2019s independent auditor in 2002, aided Cardinal in perpetuating its fraudulent accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-29\">Cardinal and the Individual Defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 9(b) and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\u201cPSLRA\u201d), alleging that Plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Defendants Miller, Mil-lar, and Jensen, and E&amp;Y also filed separate motions dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint under Rules 12(b)(6) and 9(b) and the PSLRA. Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Strike Defendants\u2019 Appendixes ## 58-60, 64-65, and 70, as well as any and all arguments relying on these Appendixes in Defendants\u2019 various motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-33\">This Court holds that: (1) Plaintiffs allegations of Defendants\u2019 accounting fraud, insider trading, motive, and opportunity were sufficient to state a \u00a7 10(b) claim against the Corporation and all of the various Individual Defendants except Defendant Jensen, and Defendants failed to show they were entitled to the protection of the statutory safe harbor for certain allegedly fraudulent forward-looking statements upon which Plaintiffs relied; (2) Plaintiffs stated \u00a7 20(a) claims against the Corporation and all of the Individual Defendants- except Defendant Jensen; (3) Plaintiffs\u2019 failed to state a \u00a7 10(b) claim against Defendant E&amp;Y because their allegations that E&amp;Y had intimate knowledge of Cardinal\u2019s fraudulent activities and that E&amp;Y had failed to adhere to GAAP and GAAS rules did not establish the necessary inference of scienter required under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-34\">Defendants\u2019 motions are GRANTED in part and DENIED in part. The following motions are GRANTED: (1) Cardinal Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss as to Defendant Jensen; (2) Defendant E &amp; Y\u2019s Mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>tion to Dismiss. The following motions are DENIED: (1) Cardinal Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss as to Cardinal and Defendants Walter, Fotiades, Miller, Millar and Parrish; (2) Defendant Miller\u2019s Motion to Dismiss; (3) Defendant Millar\u2019s Motion to Dismiss. Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Strike is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">II. BACKGROUND<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">This case involves a securities class action lawsuit brought on behalf of all persons and entities who purchased Cardinal\u2019s publicly traded securities between October 24, 2000 and July 26, 2004, inclusive (the \u201cClass Period\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Complaint alleges that all Defendants knowingly or recklessly disregarded errors in Cardinal\u2019s methods of revenue recognition, and that, through their public misrepresentations about the Company\u2019s Operating Revenue, Defendants fraudulently induced Plaintiffs to purchase Cardinal stock at artificially inflated prices in violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78j(b) and 78t(a), and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder by the Securities Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), including Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5. The Complaint further alleges that the Individual Defendants are liable as \u201ccontrolling persons\u201d of Cardinal, under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-12\">A. Defendants</p>\n<p id=\"b738-13\">The Complaint asserts causes of action against numerous defendants. The defendants have been grouped together based on their roles and the claims asserted against them. The first such group, which is collectively referred to as \u201cthe Cardinal Defendants,\u201d includes Cardinal and the following six individuals who were either Cardinal directors or members of the Company\u2019s senior management during the Class Period: Robert D. Walter, George L. Fo-tiades, Richard J. Miller, James F. Millar, Gary S. Jensen, and Mark Parrish.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The roles and responsibilities of each of these six individuals during the Class Period, as alleged in the Complaint, are described below.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-14\">1. Robert Walter</p>\n<p id=\"b738-15\">Defendant Robert D. Walter (\u2018Walter\u201d) founded Cardinal, and served, at all relevant times, as the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (\u201cCEO\u201d) of the Company. During the Class Period, Walter pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>pared and signed the Company\u2019s SEC filings, issued statements in press releases and led the Company\u2019s conference calls with analysts and investors, representing himself as one of the primary persons with knowledge about Cardinal\u2019s business, financial reports, and business practices. In conjunction with each of Cardinal\u2019s public financial statements filed with the SEC beginning in the Company\u2019s September 30, 2002, Form 10-K for FY 2002, Walter signed a certification pursuant to \u00a7 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, attesting that he had reviewed the contents of the filing to confirm that the \u201creport does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading.\u201d During the Class Period, Walter received $136 million in total compensation, with bonuses and option awards totaling more than $132 million.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Further, during the Class Period, Walter sold 593,910 shares of his personal Cardinal stock for proceeds of $38.19 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">2. George L. Fotiades</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">During the Class Period, Defendant George L. Fotiades (\u201cFotiades\u201d) served as the President and CEO of Cardinal\u2019s Life Science Products and Services division, overseeing Cardinal\u2019s Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services segment. In February 2004, Fotiades was promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer (\u201cCOO\u201d) of Cardinal. Further, throughout the Class Period, Fo-tiades was a member of the Executive Operating Committee (the \u201cEOC\u201d), a committee led by Walter, which met monthly to discuss Cardinal\u2019s business, operations and finance. Fotiades participated in the preparation of the Company\u2019s SEC filings and press releases, and took part in the Company\u2019s conference calls with analysts and investors. During the Class Period, Fotiades received $48,984,750 in total compensation. Further, during the Class Period, Fotiades sold 65,960 shares of his personal Cardinal stock for proceeds of $4.68 million and obtained bonuses and option awards worth more than $46 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">3. Richard J. Miller</p>\n<p id=\"A3T\">Defendant Richard J. Miller (\u201cMiller\u201d) served as Cardinal\u2019s Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer (\u201cCFO\u201d) and Principal Accounting Officer from March 1999 through July 2004. Prior to that time, Miller had served as Cardinal\u2019s acting CFO since August 1998, and as a Controller and Vice President from August 1995 through March 1999. Before joining Cardinal, Miller had been a partner with Deloitte &amp; Touche with over thirteen years of financial and accounting experience; he is a certified public accountant (\u201cCPA\u201d) and holds a bachelor\u2019s degree in accounting from Ohio State University. Miller prepared and signed the Company\u2019s SEC filings, issued statements in press releases and participated in the Company\u2019s conference calls with analysts and investors. Like Walter, in conjunction with each of Cardinal\u2019s public financial statements filed with the SEC beginning in the Company\u2019s September 30, 2002, Form 10-K for FY 2002, Walter signed a certification pursuant to \u00a7 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Defendant Miller left Cardinal in July 2004. Upon his resignation, Miller admitted that \u201c[cjertain financial reporting practices and judgments that occurred during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>my tenure as CFO have come under scrutiny in the ongoing investigations.\u201d During the Class Period, Miller received $16,659,563 in total compensation, $15.4 million of which were incentive-based bonuses and option awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">4. James F. Millar</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Defendant James F. Millar (\u201cMillar\u201d) served as the Executive Vice President and President and COO of Cardinal\u2019s Pharmaceutical Distribution segment from the beginning of the Class Period through December 2002, at which time Millar was promoted to President and CEO of the Company\u2019s Healthcare Products Segment. In February 2004, Millar was again promoted, this time to the position of Executive Director, Strategic Initiatives. Moreover, throughout the Class Period, Millar was a member of Cardinal\u2019s EOC. Miller participated in the preparation of the Company\u2019s SEC filings and press releases, and participated in the Company\u2019s conference calls with analysts and investors, representing himself as one of the primary persons with knowledge about Cardinal\u2019s pharmaceutical distribution business, financial reports and outlook and business practices. During the Class Period, Millar received $43,657,910 in total compensation. Further, during the Class Period, Millar sold 86,043 shares of his personal Cardinal stock for proceeds of $5.15 million and obtained incentive-based bonuses and option awards worth more than $41.76. million.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">5. Gary S. Jensen</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Defendant Gary S. Jensen served as the Senior Vice President of Audit and Financial Services, Corporate Controller and Principal Accounting Officer for fiscal years 2003 and 2004, throughout the Class Period, and until February 2005, at which point he was asked to resign following Cardinal\u2019s internal review in connection with investigations of the Company\u2019s accounting practices by both the SEC and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. Though Plaintiffs contend that a Cardinal spokesperson acknowledged that Jensen\u2019s resignation was \u201ctied to the audit over how the company classifies revenue from its pharmaceutical distribution business,\u201d the Cardinal Defendants counter that Jensen\u2019s resignation was, in fact, voluntary. During the Class Period, Jensen sold 10,357 shares of his personal Cardinal stock for proceeds of $743,984.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">6.Mark Parrish</p>\n<p id=\"b740-10\">Defendant Mark Parrish (\u201cParrish\u201d) was promoted to Chairman and CEO of Cardinal\u2019s Pharmaceutical Distribution business in August 2004. Prior to that time, Parrish had served as the Executive Vice President and Group President of the Pharmaceutical Distribution businesses in which he was responsible for Cardinal\u2019s pharmaceutical and specialty distribution businesses and reported directly to Defendant Millar. Further, in fiscal year 2003, Parrish became a member of Cardinal\u2019s EOC. Parrish participated in the preparation of the Company\u2019s SEC filings and press releases, and participated in the Company\u2019s conference calls with analysts and investors. During the Class Period, Parrish sold 16,032 shares of his personal Cardinal stock for proceeds of $972,835.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">7.Cardinal</p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">Defendant Cardinal is generally recognized as one of the three largest distributors of pharmaceutical products in the United States. Headquartered in Dublin, Ohio, Cardinal employs more than 55,000 people on six continents and produces annual revenue of nearly $75 billion. Cardinal divides its business into four reporting units: (1) Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services; (2) Medical Products and Services; (3) Pharmaceutical Technologies and Services; and (4) Clinical Tech<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>nologies and Services (formerly known as Automation and Information Services). Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations primarily involve Cardinal\u2019s oldest and historically largest segment, Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services, which moves pharmaceutical products from manufacturers to retailers and from which Cardinal derives approximately 85% of its revenues. Despite Cardinal\u2019s reputation as a leader in the pharmaceutical industry, by July 27, 2005, the end of the Class Period, the Company\u2019s stock price had dropped 41% to $44.00 per share.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">8. Ernst &amp; Young</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Plaintiffs, however, do not place the blame solely on Cardinal and the Individual Defendants; they also allege that E &amp; Y, serving as Cardinal\u2019s independent auditor, assisted the Company \u201cin orchestrating or profiting from [its alleged] fraud.\u201d On May 8, 2002, E &amp; Y received $2.31 million from Cardinal for pre-engagement services, and took on Cardinal\u2019s multi-mil-lion dollar account after Arthur Anderson (\u201cAA\u201d), Cardinal\u2019s previous long-term auditor, imploded under the weight of its involvement in massive alleged accounting frauds.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">A large portion of E &amp; Y\u2019s services related to work that fell outside the scope of financial statements audits. In fact, in addition to auditing, during the Class Period, E &amp; Y provided Cardinal with the following services: (1) due diligence services related to mergers and acquisitions, audit-related research and assistance and employee benefit plan audits; (2) tax advice and planning services; and (3) other services related to matters such as litigation assistance and internal audit services.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">E &amp; Y made no public statement relating to Cardinal until September 30, 2002 when Cardinal filed its 10-K for FY 2002, containing its audited financial statement. E &amp; Y certified Cardinal\u2019s FY 2002 financial results, previously audited by AA. The only other public statement E &amp; Y made during the Class Period was its audit opinion with respect to Cardinal\u2019s financial statements for FY 2003, which was published in Cardinal\u2019s 2003 10-K filed on September 29, 2003.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Over the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>the Class Period, E &amp; Y received a total of $27.1 million in fees from Cardinal, which was one of the largest clients of E &amp; Y\u2019s Columbus, Ohio office. E &amp; Y\u2019s fees were particularly important to the partners in E &amp; Y\u2019s Columbus, Ohio office whose incomes and bonuses depended on Cardinal\u2019s continued business. Plaintiffs contend that, from the time it became Cardinal\u2019s auditor, through the end of the Class Period, E &amp; Y ignored obvious red flags and blindly certified Cardinal\u2019s financial statements knowing that, in reality, Cardinal had intentionally misstated its financials to maintain an artificially inflated stock price.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">B. Plaintiffs\u2019 Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">1. Cardinal\u2019s Operating Model-Shifting from B + H to FFS</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">The timing of the instant litigation is significant as the Class Period coincides with a monumental shift in the pharmaceutical distribution business\u2019 operating model. As such, background information on this transition period is integral to the parties\u2019 dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">At the start of the Class Period, Cardinal and its major pharmaceutical distribution competitors operated through a \u201cbuy- and-hold\u201d (B + H) model. Under a B + H model, pharmaceutical distributors \u201cbuy\u201d pharmaceuticals from manufacturers and \u201chold\u201d those products for a period of time before re-selling them to retailers.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Through successful B + H acquisitions, Cardinal expanded its regional markets and customer base. Cardinal took advantage of the rapidly rising drug prices in the 1990s, and, accordingly, from the early 1990s through the year 2002, Cardinal regularly reported annual growth exceeding 20%.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">Nevertheless, Cardinal\u2019s ability to continue such significant growth was sharply curtailed in FY 2001. By that time, the pharmaceutical distribution market was effectively divided between three major companies: Cardinal, McKesson Corporation, and AmerisourceBergen Corporation. In fact, when Cardinal made a $2.2 billion acquisition of Bindley Western Industries, Inc. in February 2001, and AmeriSource Health Corporation made a $2.4 billion merger with Bergen Brunswig Corporation in March 2001, the top three distributors effectively controlled 90% of the entire pharmaceutical distribution business. Investors realized that Cardinal\u2019s distribution business would soon face increasing pressure on its profit margins as the top three distribution companies battled each other for the same market.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>Though the traditional B + H model had functioned well for many years, as the pharmaceutical business became increasingly complex, it became less efficient. On the one hand, pharmaceutical manufacturers could place their products into the retail market without significant line-item distribution expenses, and retailers, institutions, and other customers could receive those products with, at most, only minor markups. On the other hand, manufacturers were partially deprived of the advantage of their own price increases as B + H distributors would sell their existing inventory at the new, higher cost before buying more from the manufacturer. Over time, this latter dynamic led manufacturers to restrict the flow of pharmaceuticals to distributors like Cardinal \u2014 limiting the ability of these distributors to profit from B + H.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Cardinal was one of the first to recognize this changing dynamic, advising investors in February 2003 that the market was beginning to transition to Inventory Management Agreements (\u201cIMAs\u201d) under which wholesalers would be compensated not through investment in an inflationary product, but rather through negotiated fees for inventory management and distribution services \u2014 a \u201cfee-for-service\u201d (FFS) model.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Under the FFS model manufacturers pay a negotiated fee to Cardinal for the Company to distribute their products. Accordingly, manufacturers sell and ship their products to Cardinal and other pharmaceutical distributors only when there is a corresponding retail request. Thus, instead of making bulk shipments to the distributors without regard for demand, Cardinal began to make shipments only when they had an order to fill \u2014 \u201cjust-in-time\u201d (JIT) shipments.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">Though Cardinal was considered to be a \u201cpioneer\u201d in the B + H to FFS business-model migration,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> analysts were skeptical about whether the Company would be able to continue to generate returns. Facing increasingly intense competition and mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>gin pressure and losing the ability to profit from rising drug prices, investors turned their focus to whether Cardinal could continue to grow its revenues and earnings in the changing market. Cardinal began negotiations with several manufacturers, and in October 2003, eight months from its initial announcement of the possibility of a shift to IMAs, Cardinal disclosed that it had finalized its first largely FFS contract with drug manufacturing giant, Merck. Moreover, Cardinal revealed that it was \u201cin active negotiations\u201d on 47 other potential additional FFS contracts as of January 2004 and confirmed that the Company\u2019s entire distribution process was \u201cin transition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">2. Corporate Acquisitions and Note Offerings</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">At the same time that Cardinal underwent a switch from a B + H to an FFS model, the Company also began to expand its other business segments through both acquisition efforts and internal growth, making pharmaceutical distribution a smaller part of Cardinal\u2019s overall revenues and earnings. In fact, during the four years covered by the putative class period, Cardinal acquired twenty-four companies, and the percentage of Cardinal\u2019s earnings that came from pharmaceutical distribution declined from 52% to 46%. Further, to finance these acquisitions, Cardinal exchanged over 36 million shares of Cardinal stock (valued at over $3.0 billion) and expended more than $656 million in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">During the Class Period, Cardinal also completed three separate note offerings, raising $1.3 billion. These note offerings \u201cwere necessary and used, in part, to repay Cardinal\u2019s indebtedness (as of December 31, 2001, Cardinal had an outstanding debt of approximately $1.96 billion, and Cardinal\u2019s subsidiaries had an outstanding debt of $611.20 million).\u201d Plaintiffs allege that \u201cCardinal\u2019s acquisition spree would not have been possible without the cash infusions\u201d from the note offerings.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">Cardinal\u2019s \u2019 acquisitions and note offerings allowed the Company\u2019s stock to continue to trade at high levels. As such, over the course of the Class Period, Cardinal achieved and maintained investment grade commercial ratings. By achieving investment grade ratings, Cardinal was eligible to gain access to commercial paper,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and Cardinal\u2019s participation in the commercial paper program provided for issuance of up to $1.5 billion in credit facilities by June 30, 2001. That $1.5 billion was pursuant to unsecured bank facilities, $750 million of which were set to expire on March 27, 2003, and the other $750 million of which were set to expire on March 31, 2004. In FY 2003, because of Cardinal\u2019s high stock value, the expiration dates were extended to March 26, 2004 and March 27, 2008. During a December 13, 2004 conference call, the Company\u2019s then CFO, Mike Losh,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-10\">We are definitely committed to maintaining investment grade ratings ... One, when you get to be noninvestment-grade, not only are there the costs of money costs, but we think there are certain hidden costs that you have to deal with that we do not think that is appropriate for us to ever put ourselves in that position. Also we want to regain access to the commercial paper market. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>So on a longer-term basis, we are targeting the return to an A-debt rating level.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Complaint \u00b6249. By FY 2004, however, Cardinal\u2019s stock price dropped, and Cardinal\u2019s debt and commercial paper ratings were downgraded far below the A-level.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">3. Bulk Deliveries and Operating Revenue</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The parties\u2019 dispute centers on Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of Cardinal\u2019s fraudulent or misstated accounting. Plaintiffs\u2019 allege that over the four-year Class Period, Cardinal\u2019s numerous accounting misstatements allowed the Company to overstate its revenues by approximately $26 billion.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 56-58, 63-66, 72-76, 80-85, 88-95, 97-105, 108-14, 118-28, 132-38, 141-46, 150-51, 153-59, 163-68, 171-78, 181-87, 191-95, 199-223. To provide the necessary background, a brief discussion of Cardinal\u2019s basic accounting policies follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">Cardinal\u2019s Pharmaceutical and Distribution and Provider Services (\u201cPharmaceutical Distribution\u201d) primarily sells pharmaceutical products to its customers through \u201cdirect store door\u201d (\u201cDSD\u201d) sales.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Not all of Cardinal\u2019s sales, however, are made in small shipments directly to retailers\u2019 store doors. Customers who operate their own warehouses sometimes order products in bulk. On some occasions, Cardinal receives these bulk orders and fills them from the company\u2019s own inventory. On other occasions, however, Cardinal receives bulk orders under terms that its customers have previously negotiated with manufacturers. For these orders, while Cardinal does not bear the risk of the transaction, Cardinal also has no significant opportunities to derive a profit from it. In 1998, to account for these non-DSD sales, Cardinal began to report its revenue in two separate categories: (1) \u201cOperating Revenue\u201d; and (2) \u201cBulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses and Other\u201d (\u201cBulk Deliveries\u201d).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>Cardinal differentiated between \u201cOperating Revenue\u201d and \u201cBulk Deliveries\u201d solely by considering how long the product was in the Company\u2019s possession prior to its being shipped. If Cardinal possessed the product for more than 24 hours before its shipment, the proceeds were classified as \u201cOperating Revenue\u201d; however, if Cardinal possessed the product for less than 24 hours before its shipment, the Company considered those proceeds to be \u201cBulk Deliveries.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">The Individual Defendants touted Cardinal\u2019s reported Operating Revenue as \u201cthe main driver\u201d of the Company\u2019s growth rate. Further, investors and analysts considered Operating Revenues to be crucial in ascertaining the success of Cardinal\u2019s conversion to an FFS model. Over the course of the Class Period, in their SEC filings and press releases, Defendants highlighted their steady Operating Revenue as a strong indicator that Cardinal was successfully increasing its market, expanding its customer base, migrating sales from no margin Bulk Deliveries to profitable direct-store business, and, most importantly, adapting well to the shifting drug distribution market.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Unlike Operating Revenue, Cardinal\u2019s Bulk Deliveries were unpredictable and provided little or no margin. Hence, most investment analysts did not consider them to be good indicators of Cardinal\u2019s growth. Further, the market interpreted escalating Bulk Deliveries as a sign that Cardinal was not successfully converting pharmaceutical manufacturers from a B + H to an FFS model because, with most Bulk Deliveries, the large pharmaceutical retailers used Cardinal only as an intermediary, significantly limiting the Company\u2019s earnings potential.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">4. SEC Inquiries Begin</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">From FY 2000 through FY 2003, Cardinal\u2019s press releases and SEC filings made it appear to be a thriving company. Considering its burgeoning Operating Revenue, which increased at least 10 percent each quarter, Cardinal seemed to be making an easy transition to an FFS model. In actuality, however, Cardinal was not as successful as its numbers suggested, and on October 9, 2003, Cardinal disclosed that the SEC had opened an informal inquiry into its accounting practices.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Primarily, the SEC sought information about the Company\u2019s accounting treatment of $22 million that it had received in settling antitrust litigation with various vitamin manufacturers (the \u201cVitamin Litigation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-12\">5. Vitamin Litigation Settlement</p>\n<p id=\"b746-13\">The Vitamin Litigation began in May 2000, when Scherer, a company acquired by Cardinal in 1998, filed a civil antitrust lawsuit against a group of vitamin manufacturers alleging that certain of its raw material suppliers and others had unlawfully conspired to fix wholesale vitamin prices. During the Class Period, Scherer entered into a series of multi-tiered settlement agreements with the various vitamin manufacturers under which Cardinal re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>ceived settlement payments of $35.3 million by June 30, 2002. Cardinal recognized $22 million of these proceeds in two allotments disclosed specifically in its September 30, 2002 10-K filing.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In its 2002 10-K, the Company disclosed for the first time that, in the second quarter of fiscal 2002 (before E &amp; Y became its outside accounting firm) it had booked $10 million and $12 million reductions, respectively, in the cost of goods sold, to reflect anticipated recoveries for claims it had asserted in the course of the Vitamin Litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Six months later, critics began to question Cardinal\u2019s accounting treatment of the first $22 million of the Vitamin Litigation settlement. On April 2, 2003, <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>published a \u201cHeard on the Street\u201d column challenging Cardinal\u2019s decision to recognize those anticipated recoveries before an actual settlement agreement had been reached.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Though the article acknowledged that Cardinal had subsequently entered into binding settlement agreements and had received payments in the amount of $35.5 million by the end of FY 2002, the article suggested that Cardinal had recognized the $22 million prematurely to avoid falling short of analysts\u2019 quarterly earnings estimates.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">As established above, the SEC was also concerned that Cardinal may have prematurely recognized that $22 million in order to meet analyst estimates, in violation of Generally Accepted'Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The Audit Committee of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>Cardinal\u2019s Board of Directors, assisted by independent counsel, began its own internal review of the Company\u2019s accounting procedures in April 2004. On May 6, 2004, the SEC converted its informal inquiry of Cardinal\u2019s accounting into a <em>formal </em>investigation, while Cardinal\u2019s Audit Committee continued to work with independent counsel to review the Company\u2019s financial reporting. Further, Cardinal disclosed that the SEC and Audit Committee investigations were no longer limited to the Company\u2019s accounting treatment of the $22 million from the Vitamin Litigation settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">Nonetheless, Cardinal\u2019s problems did not end with SEC and Audit Committee investigations. On June 21, 2004, as part of the SEC formal investigation, Cardinal received a subpoena, including a request for the production of documents relating to its revenue classification policies, and specifically those policies used in the Company\u2019s pharmaceutical distribution segment.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Further, the State Attorney General of New York, Eliot Spitzer, commenced an inquiry allegedly relating to the Company\u2019s revenue classification. On July 30, 2004, Cardinal announced both the subpoena and the Spitzer inquiry to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">6. The October 2004 Restatement</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">On September 13, 2004, due to its discussions with the SEC and the Spitzer investigation, Cardinal announced its plans to restate its financial statements for FY 2001 through FY 2003 and the first three quarters of FY 2004. The Company reversed its previous recognition of estimated recoveries from the Vitamin Litigation and recognized the income from such recoveries as a \u201cspecial item\u201d in the period it received the cash from the manufacturers. Moreover, Cardinal decided to delay its announcement of its FY 2004 financial re-suits until it had both completed its restatement and changed its accounting policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">On October 26, 2004, more than three months after the end of the Class Period, Cardinal issued its delayed 4Q and FY 2004 results and filed a Form 10-K (the \u201cRestatement\u201d) in which the Company restated certain items to correct past errors and announced changes in other accounting policies on a prospective basis, without restating past results. In the Restatement, Cardinal announced its decision to change its accounting policies to abandon the distinction between \u201cOperating Revenues\u201d (which included bulk sales out of Cardinal\u2019s inventory) and \u201cBulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses.\u201d From the fourth quarter of FY 2004 forward, Cardinal classified all sales of pharmaceutical products as \u201cOperating Revenue.\u201d For FY 2002 through FY 2004, Cardinal reclassified all of the revenues it had previously reported and consolidated them in a single revenue line. Cardinal stated, \u201c[t]he re-classifications have no effect on previously reported total revenue, related cost of products sold, net earnings or earnings per share,\u201d and assured analysts that the \u201conly impact of the reclassification\u201d was on \u201cpreviously reported growth rates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">Also on October 26, 2004, during a conference call with investors and analysts, Mike Losh, admitted that the Company had misclassified $23.5 billion over three years. He also revealed, among other things, that the Audit Committee had concluded that over the past few years, Cardinal had based its revenue classifications on its 24-hour rule, and that, at certain, specifically identified times, the Company had intentionally held Bulk Deliveries for more than 24 hours so as to label them high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>margin Operating Revenues instead. These transactions, Losh admitted, had caused the Company to overstate its Operating Revenues by $813 million in FY 2003 and to understate its Bulk Deliveries to Customer Warehouses by $414 million in FY 2002. Further, Losh conceded that Cardinal was feeling the pressure of the pharmaceutical distribution business model transition to an FFS model.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Moreover, Cardinal restated its FY 2001 and FY 2002 financials to shift its recognition of the Vitamin Litigation settlement into later quarters, in particular, adding $22 million to the cost of goods sold in the relevant quarters in 2001 and 2002 and recording the $22 million as an income item in its fourth quarter 2004 results.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">C. The Parties\u2019 Dispute</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">On April 22, 2005, Lead Plaintiff, PFG, filed a Consolidated Amended Complaint (the \u201cComplaint\u201d) alleging that, during the Class Period, Defendants engaged in a scheme to defraud Plaintiffs by knowingly or recklessly disregarding errors in revenue recognition, and, through their public misrepresentations about Cardinal\u2019s Operating Revenue, fraudulently induced Plaintiffs to purchase Cardinal\u2019s stock at artificially inflated prices.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-11\">In summary, Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint alleges the following: (1) Defendants materially misrepresented Cardinal\u2019s revenues and earnings in violation of GAAP as evidenced by the Company\u2019s press releases and SEC filings concerning revenues and earnings from FY 2000 through FY 2004, and Individual Defendants\u2019 statements that routinely highlighted \u201cincreased revenues\u201d over consecutive periods; (2) though Cardinal represented that its financial statements were prepared in compliance with GAAP, they were not: (a) Cardinal\u2019s financial statements mis-characterized Operating Revenues and made inadequate disclosures regarding revenue classification procedures; (b) Cardinal improperly and prematurely recognized $22 million of expected lawsuit settlement proceeds prior to a settlement being reached in the Vitamin Litigation; (c) Cardinal used improper reserve accounting and improper accrual adjustments to overstate the Company\u2019s net income by $64.2 million in violation of GAAP;<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> (d) Cardinal failed to disclose the Company\u2019s recognition of cash discounts earned from suppliers for prompt payment;<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> (e) Cardinal improperly recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>nize Bulk Deliveries as Operating Revenue by manipulating its use of the 24-hour rule; (f) Cardinal understated its regular expenses by making excessive \u201cspecial charges\u201d;<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> (g) Cardinal engaged in illegal off-balance sheet transactions, understating its receivables through securitization of Pyxis receivables;<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> (h) Cardinal violated SEC regulations due to its inadequate internal controls; (i) Cardinal had ineffective internal mechanisms to dissuade Defendant misconduct; and (3) Cardinal\u2019s financial statements artificially inflated the net income and earnings of Cardinal and caused Plaintiffs to suffer significant financial losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">The Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint identifies all of Cardinal Defendants\u2019 allegedly false and misleading statements occurring over the course of the Class Period in 105 pages. <em>See </em>Complaint 55-238. The Plaintiffs allege that Cardinal Defendants made these misleading \u25a0 statements in forward-looking statements, press releases, conference calls, and corporate documents, and they aver that analysts relied on these statements in their reports to the market. The Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint is meticulously detailed.</p>\n<p id=\"AS5\">On August 22, 2005, the Individual Defendants, and Defendant Cardinal, jointly brought a Motion to Dismiss the Complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), staying all discovery pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(3)(B).<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>on August 22, 2005, Defendant E &amp; Y brought its own Motion to Dismiss the Complaint. Defendants deny the existence of a scheme to defraud and maintain that Cardinal\u2019s drop in stock value was primarily due to the Company\u2019s transition from a B + H to an FFS model. Further, they assert that Plaintiffs fail to plead scienter and do not connect Defendants\u2019 alleged fraud to any true market loss. The Court conducted oral argument on these motions on February 6, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">III. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">It is settled law that a court may not grant a defendant\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss unless it appears beyond doubt that the claimant can prove no set of facts supporting its claim which would entitle it to relief. <em>See H.J. Inc. v. Northwestern Bell Tel. Co., </em>492 U.S. 229, 249-50, 109 S.Ct. 2893, 106 L.Ed.2d 195 (1989); <em>Windsor v. The Tennessean, </em>719 F.2d 155, 158 (6th Cir.1983). The purpose of Rule 12(b)(6) is to allow a defendant to test whether, as a matter of law, the plaintiff is entitled to legal relief even if everything alleged in the complaint is true. <em>See Mayer v. Mylod, </em>988 F.2d 635, 638 (6th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">In considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the Court must assume as true all well-pleaded facts, and must draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmovant. <em>Murphy v. Sofamor Danek Group, Inc., </em>123 F.3d 394, 400 (6th Cir.1997). \u201cIn the securities context, Rule 12(b)(6) dismissals are difficult to obtain because the cause of action deals primarily with fact-specific inquiries such as materiality.\u201d <em>See Grossman v. Novell, Inc., </em>120 F.3d 1112, 1118 (10th Cir.1997) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Nevertheless, \u201ccourts do not hesitate to dismiss securities claims pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) where the alleged misstatements or omissions are plainly immaterial, or where the plaintiff has failed to allege with particularity, circumstances that could justify an inference of fraud under Rule 9(b).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). The issue in reviewing the sufficiency of a complaint is not whether the plaintiff will ultimately prevail, but whether the claimant is entitled to offer evidence to support its claim. <em>See Scheuer v. Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-10\">IV. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b751-11\">\n<em>I. Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Strike Defendants\u2019 Appendices and Any Arguments Arising Therefrom</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">The parties are not in agreement as to what materials outside the Complaint the Court may properly consider in ruling on Cardinal Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. Cardinal Defendants have attached 70 appendices to their brief in support of their Motion to Dismiss.

It is a drastic remedy to be resorted to only when required for the purposes of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. United States, </em>201 F.2d 819, 822 (6th Cir.1953) (citations omitted). Though many courts disfavor motions to strike for fear that they serve only to delay, they can also expedite cases by removing \u201cunnecessary clutter.\u201d <em>See Heller Fin., Inc. v. Midwhey Powder Co., Inc., </em>883 F.2d 1286, 1293 (7th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">1. Judicial Notice of Public Documents</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">When considering a motion to dismiss, courts should generally not consider matters outside the pleadings. <em>Weiner v. Klais &amp; Co., </em>108 F.3d 86, 88-89 (6th Cir.1997). In securities fraud cases, however, courts may consider the full text of SEC filings, prospectuses, and analysts\u2019 reports regardless of whether they are attached to a plaintiffs complaint (in part or in whole) as long as they are <em>integral </em>to statements within the complaint. <em>See Albert Fadem Trust v.

When considering public documents in the context of a motion to dismiss, however, the court may not accept a document to decide facts that are in dispute. <em>See In re Firstenergy Corp. Sec.

Therefore, this Court may take judicial notice of these documents <em>only </em>if it finds: (1) that they are public documents integral to the parties\u2019 dispute; and (2) that the documents do not ask the Court to adopt disputed facts as true. <em>See Keithley Instruments, </em>268 F.Supp.2d at 887.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Appendixes ## 58, 59, and 60 consist of the annual reports and Form 10-K\u2019s of AmerisourceBergen (\u201cAmBerg\u201d), and McKesson Corporation for certain years within the Class Period. <em>See supra </em>note 33.

Such documents are generally \u201ccapable of accurate and ready determination by resort to sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\u201d <em>see </em>Fed. Rule Evid. 201(b). Because this Court finds Cardinal Defendants\u2019 theory that Cardinal\u2019s stock drop was due to a general downturn in the drug distribution market integral to the parties\u2019 dispute, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike Appendices ## 58, 59, 60, 64, and 65 and any arguments arising therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-10\">Appendix # 70 is a <em>Business Week Online </em>article from July 2, 2004. Among other things, the article cites the industry switch from a B + H model to a JIT model as being responsible for the drop in Cardinal\u2019s stock price, as well as the downward trend of both AmBerg and McKesson\u2019s stock prices. The article reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-11\">Beginning in late 2003, the [drug distribution] industry pushed to change the payment system for distributing medical products (drugs, devices, and other supplies) to customers (hospitals, doctors\u2019 offices, etc.). Wholesalers essentially want \u201cfee-for-service\u201d deals with manufacturers that would create less volatility in profit margins. However, the switchover to such contracts could remain problematic. The dramatic hit to Cardinal suggests other wholesalers are pretty deep in the woods, ... Cardinal had expected many customers to have agreed to [the] new contracts by now. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Instead, the majority are still in negotiations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b754-4\"><em>See </em>Amy Tsao, \u201cA Common Cold for Drug Distributors?

Cardinal Defendants rely on Tsao\u2019s argument that the switch from a B + H business model to a FFS business model caused financial problems for <em>all </em>drug distribution companies, not just Cardinal. Plaintiffs, however, contend that Cardinal\u2019s stock price dropped because of the Company\u2019s fraud, not because of a general market downturn. As such, Cardinal Defendants urge the Court to accept the truth of the matters asserted in the article to decide factual disputes in their favor. Because this is an improper use of documents, the Court GRANTS Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike Appendix # 70 and any arguments related thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">3.

In considering a motion to dismiss, a court may not \u201cassume the truth of the statements cited by defendants [in Appendices], or accept the inferences asserted by defendants ... based on [those statements].\u201d <em>See Firstenergy Corp., </em>316 F.Supp.2d at 592. Plaintiffs concede that they cite Appendices ## 61, 62, 66, and 67 in their Complaint. They contend, however, that the Court may examine these exhibits \u201cfor the sole purpose of determining whether particular statements were made,\u201d and posit that Cardinal Defendants unlawfully ask the Court to assume the truth of the statements they cite in the Appendixes.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-9\">Plaintiffs argued that Cardinal\u2019s fraud was the impetus for the Company\u2019s significant drop in stock price. Cardinal Defendants cite the analysts\u2019 reports to counter that \u201cfinancial analysts long have lauded Cardinal\u2019s management team and Cardinal\u2019s strong market positions.\u201d Plaintiffs aver that this statement directly contradicts Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that Cardinal Defendants\u2019 malfeasance stunned investors and materially impacted the Company\u2019s earnings. Nevertheless, because Plaintiffs cited to the Appendixes in their Complaint, and because the dispute over the effect of Cardinal\u2019s fraud is certainly integral to the instant litigation, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike these appendixes and any arguments related thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">4. Jensen Motion at 8-9</p>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">In addition to the Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike the foregoing appendixes, Plaintiffs also ask the Court to strike Cardinal Defendants\u2019 argument in Defendant Jensen\u2019s Motion to Dismiss asserting that Defendant Jensen voluntarily resigned from Cardinal. In their Complaint, Plaintiffs allege that a source informed them that Jensen was <em>forced </em>to resign from Cardinal as a result of his involvement in the Company\u2019s accounting fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-12\">After Congress\u2019 enactment of the PSLRA, in assessing whether a plaintiff has offered \u201cfacts giving rise to a <em>strong inference </em>\u201d of defendants\u2019 <em>scienter, </em>\u201cplaintiffs are entitled only to the most plausible of competing inferences.\u201d <em>Id.; see Miller v.

Therefore, to advance the purpose of the PSLRA, the Court should not adopt Plaintiffs\u2019 view of the facts without also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>considering the merits of Cardinal Defendants\u2019 assertions. Therefore, without adopting either side\u2019s assessment of why Jensen left Cardinal, the Court DENIES Plaintiffs\u2019 motion to strike the contents of Jensen Motion at 8-9, allowing both sides\u2019 arguments to remain on the record.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">\n<em>II. Cardinal Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">A. Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">Cardinal Defendants first contend that the Court must dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 claims pursuant to Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act on the following grounds: (1) Plaintiffs\u2019 fail to plead that any Defendant possessed scienter, particularly in light of the heightened pleading standard mandated by the PSLRA, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4 and controlling Sixth Circuit law; (2) the Complaint does not state a claim based upon any of Cardinal\u2019s alleged accounting misstatements; (3) the Complaint fails to plead loss causation as to any of the seven \u201cimproprieties\u201d they enumerate in the Complaint; and (4) the Complaint does not allege particularized facts sufficient to state a claim based upon Cardinal\u2019s transition to a new business model.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-14\">Section 10(b)<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder prohibit \u201c[fjraudulent, material misstatements or omissions in connection with the sale or purchase of a security.\u201d <em>See PR Diamonds v. Chandler, </em>91 Fed.Appx. 418, 426 (6th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Morse v. McWhorter, </em>290 F.3d 795, 798 (6th Cir.2002)). In order to state a claim under Section 10(b)<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 <footnotemark>40</footnotemark> pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>mulgated thereunder, a plaintiff must allege: (1) that defendants made a false statement or omission of material fact; (2) in connection with a purchase or sale of securities; (3) scienter; (4) reliance; and (5) damages. <em>See In re Comshare, Inc. Secs. Litig., </em>183 F.3d 542, 548 (6th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Prior to the enactment of the PSLRA, the pleading requirements for stating a claim under Section 10(b) were governed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). <em>See In re Telxon Sec. Litig., </em>133 F.Supp.2d 1010, 1025 (N.D.Ohio 2000) (citing <em>DiLeo v. Ernst &amp; Young, </em>901 F.2d 624, 627 (7th Cir.1990)). Rule 9(b) provides: \u201c[i]n all averments of fraud or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake shall be stated with particularity. Malice, intent, knowledge and other condition of mind of a person may be averred generally.\u201d Fed. R. Crv. Pro. 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Originally, the Rule 9(b) heightened pleading requirement (requiring a plaintiff to plead fraud with particularity) was meant to curb any possible vexatious litigation under Rule 10b-5. <em>See Comshare, </em>183 F.3d at 548 (citing <em>Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, </em>421 U.S. 723, 739-44, 95 S.Ct. 1917, 44 L.Ed.2d 539 (1975)). In 1995, however, Congress concluded that Rule 9(b) had \u201cnot prevented the abuse of the securities laws by private litigants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 104-369 (1995), reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 730, 818)<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> \u201cIndeed, Congress echoed the concerns expressed by the Supreme Court in <em>Blue Chip, </em>noting that frivolous securities fraud litigation \u2018unnecessarily increased] the cost of raising capital and ehill[s] corporate disclosure [and is] often based on nothing more than a company\u2019s announcement of bad news, not evidence of fraud.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing S.Rep. No. 104-98 (1995), reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 679, 690). Thus, on December 22, 1995, Congress passed the PSLRA,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> which, amends the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>Exchange Act and applies to private class actions brought pursuant to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77k, 771, 77z-l, 77z-2, 78a, 785-1, 78t, 78u, 78u-4, 78u-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">Adding to the Rule 9(b) requirement that plaintiffs state them fraud allegations with particularity, the PSLRA requires a plaintiffs to, \u201cspecify each statement alleged to have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the statement is misleading, and, if an allegation regarding the statement or omission, or made on information and belief, ... [to] state with particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">1. Whether the Complaint Sufficiently Alleges Facts Establishing a \u201cStrong Inference\u201d of Scienter</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">Courts consider scienter the most difficult element of a 10(b) and 10b-5 claim for plaintiffs to plead under the PSLRA; therefore, should the Court find that Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint does not adequately plead the scienter element of their Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claims, it must grant Cardinal Defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. <em>See PR Diamonds, </em>91 Fed.Appx. at 426. The parties\u2019 dispute centers on whether the Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint adequately pleads scienter. As such, before getting to the merits of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, the Court will first examine the meaning of \u201cscienter\u201d in the securities fraud setting. If the Court finds that the Plaintiffs have established scienter, then it may consider whether Plaintiffs have adequately pled the other elements of their prima facie case.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">a. \u201cScienter\u201d under the PSLRA</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">The Supreme Court has defined \u201cscienter\u201d as \u201ca mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.\u201d <em>Ernst &amp; Ernst, </em>425 U.S. at 193 n. 12, 96 S.Ct. 1375. In securities fraud claims based on statements of present or historical fact \u2014 such as the claims Plaintiffs bring in this case \u2014 scienter consists of <em>knowledge </em>or <em>recklessness. PR Diamonds, </em>91 Fed.Appx. at 426 (citing <em>Helwig v. Vencor, Inc., </em>251 F.3d 540, 552 (6th Cir.2001) (en banc)). The Sixth Circuit defines \u201crecklessness\u201d as \u201chighly unreasonable conduct which is an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary care. While the danger need not be known, it must be at least so obvious that any reasonable man would have known of it.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Mansbach v. Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben, </em>598 F.2d 1017, 1025 (6th Cir.1979)). Recklessness is \u201ca mental state apart from negligence and akin to conscious disregard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Comshare, </em>183 F.3d at 550).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">Next, the Court must examine the special requirements for pleading scienter in federal securities fraud claims such as this. As with all fraud claims, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) applies to pleading a defendant\u2019s state of mind, allowing that \u201c[m]alice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of mind of a person may be averred generally.\u201d <em>PR Diamonds, </em>91 Fed.Appx. at 426. Through the passage of the PSLRA, however, Congress heightened the standard of pleading scienter in a securities fraud case. <em>See supra </em>Part <em>IV. II.A.l.a. </em>The PSLRA provides that if a plaintiff fails to meet its requirements, a court may, on any defendant\u2019s motion, dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>miss the complaint. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(3); <em>PR Diamonds, </em>91 Fed.Appx. at 427. As courts have noted, \u201cthe PSLRA did not change the scienter that a plaintiff must prove to prevail in a securities fraud case but instead changed what a plaintiff must <em>plead </em>in his complaint in order to survive a motion to dismiss.\u201d <em>See Comshare, </em>183 F.3d at 548-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">As the foregoing authorities make clear, a plaintiff may survive a motion to dismiss by pleading with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with knowledge or recklessness. <em>See PR Diamonds, </em>91 Fed.Appx. at 427. In other words, not only must the complaint make particular factual allegations but the inference of scienter which those allegations generate must be strong. <em>Id.; see Comshare, </em>183 F.3d at 550 (citing <em>Mansbach v. Prescott, Ball &amp; Turben, </em>598 F.2d 1017, 1024 (6th Cir.1979) (emphasis added)). In <em>Helwig, </em>the Sixth Circuit provided a definitive explanation of the meaning of a \u201cstrong inference,\u201d instructing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-5\">Inferences must be reasonable and strong but not irrefutable. \u201cStrong inferences\u201d nonetheless involve deductive reasoning; their strength depends on how closely a conclusion of misconduct follows from a plaintiffs proposition of fact. Plaintiffs need not foreclose all other characterizations of fact, as the task of weighing contrary accounts is reserved for the fact finder. Rather, the \u201cstrong inference\u201d requirement means that plaintiffs are entitled only to the <em>most plausible </em>of competing inferences.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">251 F.3d at 553 (emphasis added). The PSLRA does not change the Rule 12(b)(6) maxim that when an allegation is capable of more than one inference, it must be construed in the plaintiffs favor. <em>Id. </em>(\u201cOur willingness to draw inferences in favor of the plaintiff remains unchanged by the PSLRA.\u201d). The \u201cstrong inference\u201d requirement, however, means that a plaintiff is entitled to only the most plausible of competing inferences. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b758-9\">Moreover, the <em>Helwig </em>Court enumerated factors which, though not exhaustive, may be probative of scienter in securities fraud actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-10\">(1) insider trading at a suspicious time or in an unusual amount;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-11\">(2) divergence between internal reports and external statements on the same subject;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-12\">(3) closeness in time of an allegedly fraudulent statement or omission and the later disclosure of inconsistent information;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-13\">(4) evidence of bribery by a top company official;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-14\">(5) existence of an ancillary lawsuit charging fraud by a company and the company\u2019s quick settlement of that suit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-15\">(6) disregard of the most current factual information before making statements;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-16\">(7) disclosure of accounting information in such a way that its negative implications could only be understood by someone with a high degree of sophistication;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-17\">(8) the personal interest of certain directors in not informing disinterested directors of an impending sale of stock; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b758-18\">(9) the self-interested motivation of defendants in the form of saving their salaries or jobs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-19\">251 F.3d at 552 (citing <em>Greebel v. FTP Software, Inc., </em>194 F.3d 185, 196 (1st Cir.1999)).<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b759-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>b. Applying the Scienter Standard</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">The Sixth Circuit employs a \u201ctotality of the circumstances analysis\u201d whereby the facts argued <em>collectively </em>must give rise to a strong inference of at least recklessness. <em>See PR Diamonds, </em>91 Fed.Appx. at 427 (citing <em>Telxon, </em>133 F.Supp.2d at 1026 (\u201cThus, the Sixth Circuit employs a form of \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 analysis; this Court, accordingly, declines to examine plaintiffs\u2019 allegations in piecemeal fashion, and will instead assess them collectively to determine what inferences may be drawn therefrom.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Plaintiffs maintain that the Complaint in its entirety, establishes a strong inference that, throughout the Class Period, the Cardinal Defendants either knew or were at least reckless in disregarding serious accounting improprieties at Cardinal and the effect that such improprieties had on the Company\u2019s financial condition. Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that, when considering the following factors in their totality, a strong inference of the Defendants\u2019 scien-ter arises: (1) the nature and magnitude of the accounting improprieties at Cardinal; (2) the Individual Defendants\u2019 access to Cardinal\u2019s financial information by virtue of their positions at the Company; (3) the fact that the accounting improprieties occurred in \u201ckey areas of focus\u201d; (4) the Individual Defendants\u2019 motives and opportunities to commit fraud; and (5) other red flags potentially signaling Cardinal\u2019s accounting errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">Accordingly, in the following discussion, this Court examines each of Plaintiffs\u2019 scienter allegations. <em>See PR Diamonds, </em>91 Fed.Appx. at 429. As the Sixth Circuit has noted, \u201crecklessness in securities fraud is an untidy case-by-case concept, [which] necessarily involves a sifting of allegations in the complaint.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Helwig, </em>251 F.3d at 551 (citing <em>Mansbach, </em>598 F.2d at 1025)). Accordingly, this Court \u201csifts\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations individually, and then aggregates the \u201cnuggets of inference\u201d they generate, concluding in the end that a strong inference of scienter arises and finding that Plaintiffs have pled facts that create a strong inference of scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">i. Accounting Improprieties</p>\n<p id=\"b759-11\">Plaintiffs contend that their allegations of Cardinal\u2019s improper accounting practices and internal control deficiencies comprise circumstantial evidence supporting a strong inference of the Defendants\u2019 scien-ter. The alleged accounting improprieties include: (1) the mis-classification of bulk deliveries as operating revenue in FY 2001 through FY 2003; (2) the premature recognition of $22 million gained from the Vitamin Litigation settlement in FY 2002; (3) the decision to change Cardinal\u2019s revenue recognition policy for its Pyxis business in FY 2002; (4) balance sheet reserve and accrual adjustments in the Company\u2019s 2004 10-K; (5) as announced in the 2004 10-K, the Company\u2019s decision to change its method of accounting for cash discounts received from vendors for prompt payment; (6) the mis-classification of an unidentified amount of expenses as \u201cspecial charges\u201d related to mergers and acquisitions; and (7) improper off-balance sheet transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-12\">In <em>Comshare, </em>the Sixth Circuit held that GAAP violations are, by themselves, insufficient to establish scienter for a securities fraud claim. 183 F.3d at 553. Nonetheless, in later cases, the Sixth Circuit recognized that an inference of knowledge or recklessness may be drawn from allegations of accounting violations that are so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>\u201csimple, basic, and pervasive in nature, and so great in magnitude, that they should have been obvious to a defendant.\u201d <em>See PR Diamonds, </em>91 Fed.Appx. at 430 (finding that plaintiffs\u2019 allegations as to defendants\u2019 GAAP violations were of \u201csuch a great magnitude\u201d that they rose to create a strong inference of defendants\u2019 scien-ter); <em>Firstenergy Corp., </em>316 F.Supp.2d at 598 (the fact that defendants\u2019 accounting practices resulted in such enormous overstatements of revenue for several years further supported an inference of scien-ter). In addition, in <em>PR Diamonds, </em>the court acknowledged that many other courts consider GAAP violations relevant to establishing scienter when those violations were significant. <em>See In re Smar-Talk Teleserv., Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>124 F.Supp.2d 527, 539 (S.D.Ohio 2000) (finding that when viewed in light of the magnitude of the overstatements, the nature of the accounting principles violated, and the importance of the contracts to which these principles were applied, plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of GAAP violations rose to create a strong inference of scienter); <em>Telxon, </em>133 F.Supp.2d at 1031 (the nature and number of defendants\u2019 accounting manipulations, when coupled with the magnitude of the difference between the originally reported financial disclosures and their restatements, convinced the court that the plaintiffs .had adequately alleged scienter); <em>In re MicroStrategy, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>115 F.Supp.2d 620, 644 (E.D.Va.2000) (\u201cBut this is not to say that a misapplication of accounting principles or a restatement of financials can never take on significant inferential weight in the scienter calculus; to the contrary, when the number, size, timing, nature, frequency, and context of the misapplication or restatement are taken into account, the balance of the inferences to be drawn from such allegations may shift significantly in favor of scienter.\u201d); <em>see In re Oxford Health Plans, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>51 F.Supp.2d 290, 294 (S.D.N.Y.1999) (\u201c[P]laintiffs allege \u2018in your face facts,\u2019 that cry out, \u2018how could [defendants] not have known that the financial statements were false.\u2019 \u201d); <em>Rehm v.

Corp., </em>954 F.Supp. 1246, 1256 (N.D.Ill.1997) (finding that plaintiffs\u2019 allegations about defendants\u2019 GAAP violations were of great enough magnitude that, when combined with the other available circumstantial evidence, they raised a strong inference of defendants\u2019 scienter).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">First, Cardinal Defendants contend that despite the trend signaled by <em>PR Diamonds, Telxon, </em>and its progeny, GAAP violations alone do not constitute scienter. Nevertheless, Cardinal Defendants argue that should this Court consider the Cardinal Defendants\u2019 GAAP violations in its scienter analysis, many of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations do not even amount to actual GAAP errors, altogether negating any inference of scienter.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Plaintiffs, counter, however, that Cardinal\u2019s GAAP misstatements were <em>so </em>egregious in terms of \u201cnumber, size, timing, frequency and context,\u201d that they are more than sufficient to create a strong inference of scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Although <em>Comshare </em>sets forth the prevailing view in this Circuit that GAAP violations do not ipso facto establish scien-ter, as it is factually inapposite, <em>Comshare </em>does not control here. <em>See id. </em>at 542. <em>Comshare </em>was a consolidated securities fraud action arising from the company\u2019s restatement of certain financial statements after it had acknowledged that its original financial statements had contained a num<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>ber of recognition errors. <em>See id. </em>The errors were based on a British subsidiary\u2019s violation of company policy and GAAP principles that proscribed the inclusion in financial statements of revenue from sales that were not assured. <em>See </em>id,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The subsidiary had been recognizing revenues from sales that were conditioned by side letter agreements allowing the buyer to back out of the sale under certain circumstances. <em>See id. </em>When Comshare discovered the undisclosed agreements, it was forced to announced that it had overstated its recognized revenue causing the market value of its stock to drop significantly. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\">The plaintiff-shareholders brought claims of securities fraud under 10(b) based on Comshare\u2019s accountings errors in addition to bare allegations demonstrating the company\u2019s motive and opportunity to commit fraud. <em>See id. </em>The district court, however, granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, finding that the plaintiff-shareholders had failed to plead facts establishing that the subsidiary\u2019s GAAP violations constituted \u201cknowing misrepresentation\u201d by the defendants. <em>Id. </em>at 554. The court of appeals affirmed the district court\u2019s ruling, holding, \u201c[plaintiffs have failed to plead facts that show that the revenue recognition errors at Comshare\u2019s UK subsidiary should have been obvious to Coms-hare or that Comshare consciously disregarded \u2018red flags\u2019 that would have revealed the errors prior to their inclusion in public statements.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">In this case, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations arise from Cardinal\u2019s own GAAP violations, as opposed to a recently acquired subsidiary\u2019s violations, like those alleged in <em>Comshare. </em>183 F.3d at 554. Though it is conceivable that Comshare was unaware of the details of agreements entered into by a foreign subsidiary, it is less likely that Cardinal was unaware that it had consistently manipulated its 24-hour rule to overstate its Operating Revenue consistently for <em>four years </em>to create inflated Operating Revenues of approximately <em>$26 billion. </em>Further, in <em>Comshare, </em>aside from their claims based on the subsidiary\u2019s accounting violations, plaintiff-shareholders\u2019 only other allegations were based on Comshare\u2019s \u201cmotive\u201d and \u201copportunity\u201d to commit fraud, which in isolation, <em>cannot </em>establish a strong inference of recklessness. <em>See id. </em>at 549 (\u201c... we conclude that plaintiffs may plead scienter in \u00a7 10b and 10b-5 cases by alleging facts giving rise to a strong inference of recklessness, but <em>not </em>by alleging facts merely establishing that a defendant had the motive and opportunity to commit securities fraud.\u201d) (emphasis added). In the case sub judice, however, Plaintiffs have alleged 200 pages of circumstantial evidence in addition to allegations of motive and opportunity, making their case stronger than that of the Coms-hare plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Further, in addition to being distinguishable from <em>Comshare, </em>the facts of the instant litigation resemble more closely those of cases in which courts found that, when combined with plaintiffs\u2019 other allegations, GAAP violations provided the strong inference of recklessness required to establish scienter. <em>MicroStrategy, </em>115 F.Supp.2d at 620<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> (finding allegations that defendants had overstated the company\u2019s revenues by $66 million over <em>three </em>years were egregious enough to support an inference of scienter); <em>Telxon, </em>133 F.Supp.2d at 1029 (finding overstatement of revenues by over $20 million in a single quarter and the fact that company reported profits when it should have reported losses to provide a strong inference of scienter); <em>Rehm, </em>954 F.Supp. at 1246; <em>SmarTalk, </em>124 F.Supp.2d at 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">The Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are parallel to those of plaintiffs in <em>SmarTalk. </em>124 F.Supp.2d at 527. In <em>SmarTalk, </em>plaintiff-shareholders sued defendant SmarTalk alleging that, over the course of two years, the company\u2019s officers and directors had overly-inflated SmarTalk\u2019s stock price by presenting a false picture of the company through its SEC filings, press releases, and conference calls with analysts and investors. <em>See id. </em>at 531. The plaintiffs alleged a number of accounting violations, which they listed in their complaint.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 532. Further, plaintiffs alleged that the SmarTalk defendants engaged in insider trading of 2.7 million shares of stock to raise $63 million in profits for themselves. Finally, during the relevant time period, SmarTalk acquired at least two companies and raised $180 million in capital through a \u201cconvertible notes offering and an equity offering.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">The court held that the plaintiffs \u201cadequately alleged widespread and varied accounting errors that led to a drastic overstatement of SmarTalk\u2019s financial success,\u201d supporting an inference of scienter. <em>Id. </em>at 540; <em>see, e.g. Rehm, </em>954 F.Supp. at 1255-56 (\u201cthe more serious the error, the less believable are [corporate] defendants\u2019 protests that they were completely unaware of [the corporation\u2019s] true financial status and the stronger is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>the inference that defendants must have known about the discrepancy\u201d). Moreover, the court held that \u201cirrespective of whether the [defendants\u2019] accounting errors violated GAAP, the substance of the alleged errors smacks of fraud, and strengthens the inference of scienter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">As in <em>SmarTalk, </em>Plaintiffs here make a number of detailed violations based on Cardinal\u2019s accounting misstatements.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Moreover, like the <em>SmarTalk </em>plaintiffs, Plaintiffs in this case do not end their allegations with GAAP violations; they also allege that, when considered together, the Individual Defendants\u2019 insider trading, the presence of red flags evidencing overinflated revenues, and the sheer magnitude of the actual fraud point to a strong inference of scienter. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Hence, this Court finds Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations to be at least as \u201cwidespread and varied\u201d as those of the <em>SmarTalk </em>plaintiffs. <em>See id. </em>Further, though Cardinal Defendants counter that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are not even <em>actual </em>GAAP violations, just as in <em>SmarTalk, </em>the substance of the errors strengthens the inference of scien-ter, and accounting errors of the type here have been held to be sufficient to establish scienter. <em>See id. </em>at 540; <em>see also PR Diamonds, </em>91 Fed.Appx. at 430.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A9S\">ii. Access to Information</p>\n<p id=\"b763-10\">To buttress their argument that the Individual Defendants\u2019 knew of or recklessly disregarded adverse information about Cardinal when making representations about the Company to the public, Plaintiffs point to the Individual Defendants\u2019 high-level positions in the Company. Plaintiffs state, \u201cDefendants Walter, Miller, Fo-tiades, Millar and Parrish also routinely communicated with analysts and investors during the Class Period and represented that they were informed of and knowledge<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>able about Cardinal\u2019s business and finances, specifically including the Company\u2019s accounting for revenue and fee-for-service in the Pharmaceutical Distribution business.\u201d <em>See </em>Complaint 226. Essentially, Plaintiffs contend that the Individual Defendants\u2019 positions, in combination with their representations that \u201cthey had intimate knowledge\u201d of the Company, are enough to create a strong inference of scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Courts may presume that high-level executives are aware of matters related to their business\u2019 operation where the misrepresentations or omissions pertain to \u201ccentral, day-to-day operational matters.\u201d <em>See In re Complete Mgmt. Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>153 F.Supp.2d 314, 325-26 (S.D.N.Y.2001). Fraudulent intent, however, <em>\u201ccannot </em>be inferred merely from the Individual Defendants\u2019 positions in the Company and alleged access to information.\u201d <em>see PR Diamonds, </em>91 Fed.Appx. at 432 (finding that where the plaintiffs\u2019 allegations turned largely on obscure accounting issues at the company\u2019s subsidiary, the court could not rely on defendant\u2019s high-level positions in the company to infer that they knew or could have known of the errors) (emphasis added). The Plaintiffs Complaint itself must allege specific facts or circumstances reflecting the Individual Defendants\u2019 knowledge. <em>Id. </em>Without more, Plaintiffs fail to state with particularity facts giving rise to a strong inference of scienter \u2014 the PSLRA requirement. <em>Id.; see also Alaska Electrical Pension Fund v. Adecco S.A., </em>371 F.Supp.2d 1203, 1216-17 (S.D.Cal.2005) (though allegations regarding the individual defendants\u2019 positions in the company may give rise to a \u201creasonable inference\u201d those defendants were aware of the falsity of the Company\u2019s statements, they do not satisfy the PSLRA\u2019s pleading requirements); <em>In re Peritus Software Servs. Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>52 F.Supp.2d 211, 228 (D.Mass.1999) (finding that general allegations that a defendant, through his board membership or executive position, had actual knowledge of false statements or reckless disregard for the truth are insufficient to raise a strong inference of scienter).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">In this case, Cardinal Defendants argue, and this Court agrees, that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations appear to be no more than conclusory allegations based on the Individual Defendants\u2019 high-level positions. <em>See Comshare, </em>183 F.3d at 553 (a defendant cannot be considered a participant in a company\u2019s securities fraud simply because of his or her executive title or position within that company). In their Opposition Motion, Plaintiffs argue that even if the Court can infer no wrongful intent from a job title alone, the Court should be able to infer scienter from a defendant\u2019s job title <em>combined </em>with that defendant\u2019s assurance that he is \u201cknowledgeable\u201d of the company and \u201cresponsible\u201d for the its financial statements. In support of their argument, Plaintiffs point to a number of specific statements made by the Individual Defendants in press releases and during conference calls, all of which they believe show that the Individual Defendants were at least reckless in not recognizing Cardinal\u2019s fraud. <em>See </em>Complaint 229-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Rather than repeat each of the Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations verbatim, this Court finds that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are too broad and conclusory to establish scienter. The Second Circuit has held that \u201callegations that defendants should have anticipated future events and made certain disclosures earlier than they actually did do not suffice to make out a claim of securities fraud\u201d and that \u201cas long as the public statements are consistent with reasonably available data, corporate officials need not present an overly gloomy or cautious picture of current performance and future prospects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>...\u201d <em>In re Xerox Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>165 F.Supp.2d 208, 216 (2d Cir.2001).<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> In this case, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations lump all the Individual Defendants together, stating that their positions as high-level executives show that they must have misled investors as to Cardinal\u2019s financial health. Plaintiffs\u2019 efforts to cite particular Cardinal press releases and statements that <em>support </em>these conclusory allegations still do not raise their allegations to the heightened level of specificity required by the PSLRA.</p>\n<p id=\"Aca\">iii. Areas of Focus</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Plaintiffs seek to draw additional support for a strong inference of the Cardinal Defendants\u2019 scienter by claiming that Cardinal\u2019s accounting improprieties occurred in areas of the business that the Company had specifically identified as targets of intense focus for the Company \u2014 areas in which the Company felt pressure to show continued growth.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">In this case, Plaintiffs contend that, to showcase Cardinal\u2019s successful to transition from a B + H to an FFS model, the Company improperly booked zero-margin sales as Operating Revenue \u201cto give investors the false and misleading impression Cardinal was achieving revenue growth.\u201d <em>See </em>Complaint 285. Plaintiffs allege that because Cardinal Defendants had consistently highlighted \u201cOperating Revenue\u201d as the \u201cmain driver of its growth,\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Cardinal Defendants\u2019 inflation of this area of focus for both analysts and investors implies scienter. <em>See id. </em>293-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations resemble those of plaintiffs in <em>Telxon. See </em>133 F.Supp.2d at 1029. In <em>Telxon, </em>the court considered a variety of circumstances indicating defendants\u2019 scienter, including allegations of motive and opportunity, large restatements of the defendant company\u2019s financial disclosures, and accounting manipulations of substantial magnitude. <em>Id. </em>Another factor the court considered, however, was \u201c[t]he fact that Telxon and its officers were in a very difficult position, facing <em>unusual pressures </em>to perform during the class period, and stood to benefit substantially from a performance record which matched the healthy ones [a company executive] continually projected to the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). In that case, the pressures to make public statements reflecting profitable performance stemmed from the company\u2019s need to \u201cstave off\u2019 another company\u2019s take-over efforts and an ensuing proxy-battle. <em>Id. </em>at 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-10\">This Court has already found that Plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that Cardinal Defendants\u2019 GAAP violations, particularly its overstatement of Operating Revenue, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>suggested a strong inference of scienter. <em>See supra </em>Part <em>IV.II.A.l.b.i. </em>Moreover, in this case, Cardinal was under severe scrutiny while adjusting to the significant changes in the pharmaceutical distribution market, much like Telxon had faced unusual pressure to perform in avoidance of competitors\u2019 take-over efforts. <em>See Telx-on, </em>133 F.Supp.2d at 1029. Thus, this Court determines that because Operating Revenues were analysts\u2019 and investors\u2019 primary area of focus during Cardinal\u2019s operating model transition, Cardinal\u2019s alleged manipulation of these areas raises a strong inference of Cardinal Defendants\u2019 scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">iv. Motive &amp; Opportunity</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">Next, Plaintiffs argue that the Complaint alleges that Cardinal Defendants had motives and opportunities to defraud investors. These allegations, Plaintiffs maintain, when considered <em>together </em>with the other allegations in the Complaint, support a strong inference of knowledge or reckless disregard on the part of Cardinal Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">\u201c[T]he bare pleading of motive and opportunity does not, <em>standing alone, </em>constitute the pleading of a strong inference of scienter.\u201d <em>See PR Diamonds, </em>91 Fed.Appx. at 434 (citing <em>Comshare, </em>183 F.3d at 551) (emphasis added). \u201cWhile it is true[, however,] that motive and opportunity are not substitutes for a showing of recklessness, they can be catalysts to fraud and so serve as external markers to the required state of mind.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Helwig, </em>251 F.3d at 550). \u201c[F]acts regarding motive and opportunity may be relevant to pleading circumstances from which a strong inference of fraudulent scienter may be inferred, and may, on occasion, rise to the level of reckless or knowing conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Comshare, </em>183 F.3d at 551 (internal quotation and citation omitted)). Therefore, while bare allegations of motive and opportunity, without more, are insufficient to establish scienter, the Court must assess whether such allegations, considered in conjunction with the remainder of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations raise an inference of recklessness or knowing disregard. <em>See id. </em>(referencing <em>Telxon, </em>133 F.Supp.2d at 1028).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">Opportunity to commit fraud \u201centail[s] the means and likely prospect of achieving concrete benefits by the means alleged.\u201d <em>PR Diamonds, </em>91 Fed.Appx. at 434 (citing <em>In re Criimi Mae, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>94 F.Supp.2d 652, 660 (D.Md.2000) (internal quotations and citations omitted)). With respect to the Individual Defendants\u2019 opportunities to engage in fraud, there can be little doubt that they could have, had they wanted to, committed such acts. <em>See id.; see, e.g., San Leandro Emergency Med. Group Profit Sharing Plan v. Philip Morris Cos. Inc., </em>75 F.3d 801, 813 (2d Cir.1996) (\u201cThere is no doubt that defendants as a group had the opportunity [to manipulate stock prices] ... [because they] held the highest positions of power and authority within the company.\u201d). Therefore, the more compelling question in this case is whether the Complaint alleges <em>motives </em>on the part of Cardinal Defendants from which the Court could infer a knowing or reckless state of mind. <em>See PR Diamonds, </em>91 Fed.Appx. at 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-9\">In order to demonstrate motive, a plaintiff must show \u201cconcrete benefits that could be realized by one or more of the false statements and wrongful nondisclosures alleged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Phillips v. LCI Int'l, Inc., </em>190 F.3d 609, 621 (4th Cir.1999)). A perusal of the cases cited by both parties shows that courts distinguish general motives common to most corporations and executives from more specific \u201cmotives to commit fraud.\u201d <em>See Chill v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number><em>Gen. Elec. Co., </em>101 F.3d 263, 268 (2d Cir.1996) (finding that because all corporate managers share a desire for their companies to appear successful \u201ca generalized motive which could be imputed to any publicly-owned, for-profit endeavor, is not sufficiently concrete for purposes of inferring scienter\u201d). The Plaintiffs allege that Defendants had the following motives: (1) motive to profit from insider trading; (2) motive to receive significant incentive-based executive compensation packages; and (3) motive to meet analysts\u2019 expectations so as to preserve Cardinal\u2019s position as one a successful and profitable company. The Court will examine each of these motives, and determine whether, considered in conjunction with the remainder of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, they raise a strong inference of scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">1) Insider Sales<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">In addition to considering them to be a <em>Helwig </em>\u201cred flag,\u201d courts also consider a plaintiffs allegations that the individual defendants engaged in insider trading to be a motive to commit fraud. By trading on inside information, executives stand to profit from what may turn out to be other shareholders\u2019 losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">The Complaint alleges that the Individual Defendants were motivated to commit the alleged fraud, in part, because they were able to benefit from the resulting inflation of Cardinal\u2019s stock price. Plaintiffs allege that during the Class Period, the Individual Defendants sold at least 774,156 shares of Cardinal stock, for proceeds of $49.7 million; they argue that the magnitude and timing of these sales of stock \u2014 independent of any sales in the context of an offering-by themselves raise a strong inference of scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-10\">Indeed, \u201c[i]nsider trading at a suspicious time or in an unusual amount comprises one of the \u2018fixed constellations of facts\u2019 that courts have found probative of securities fraud.\u201d <em>See Helwig, </em>251 F.3d at 552; <em>Firstenergy Corp., </em>316 F.Supp.2d at 599 (noting that insider selling at an opportunistic time supports an inference of fraudulent intent to mislead the market for personal gain, and insider sales made when a company\u2019s stock price is near an all time high are probative of scienter). The \u201cmere pleading of insider trading, [however,] without regard to either context or strength of the inferences to be drawn, is not enough.\u201d <em>See Greebel, </em>194 F.3d at 198; <em>see also Maldonado v. Dominguez, </em>137 F.3d 1, 9-10 (1st Cir.1998). Courts should not \u201cinfer fraudulent intent from the mere fact that some officers sold stock ... Instead, [plaintiffs must allege that the trades were made at times and in quantities that were suspicious enough to support the necessary strong inference of scienter.\u201d <em>In re Burlington Coat Factory Sec. Litig., </em>114 F.3d 1410, 1424 (3d Cir.1997) (stock sales did not permit an infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>ence of scienter because only three of the five defendants sold stock, plaintiffs provided information on the total stock holdings of only one defendant, who had traded only 0.5% of his holdings, and plaintiffs failed to plead facts indicating whether such trades were \u201cnormal and routine\u201d for the defendants, and whether the trading profits were substantial in comparison to their overall compensation); <em>see, e.g., Gree-bel, </em>194 F.3d at 197 (\u201cUnusual trading or trading at suspicious times or in suspicious amounts by corporate insiders has long been recognized as probative of scienter.\u201d); <em>In re Advanta Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>180 F.3d 525, 540 (3d Cir.1999) (stock sales did not permit an inference of scienter where three of the five individual defendants sold no stock during the class period and those who did trade, sold only small percentages of their stock); <em>Shaw v. Digital Equip. Corp., </em>82 F.3d 1194, 1224 (1st Cir.1996) (\u201c[T]he mere fact that insider stock sales occurred does not suffice to establish scienter.\u201d); <em>MicroStrategy, </em>115 F.Supp.2d at 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Nevertheless, if the executive officers\u2019 stock sales were \u201cunusual in scope or timing,\u201d they may support an inference of scienter. <em>See Burlington Coat Factory, </em>114 F.3d at 1424. Courts generally consider the following factors in analyzing allegations of insider trading: (1) whether the alleged trades were \u201cnormal or routine\u201d for the insider; (2) whether profits reaped \u201cwere substantial enough in relation to the compensation levels for any of the individual defendants so as to produce a suspicion that they might have had an incentive to commit fraud\u201d; and (3) whether, in light of the insider\u2019s total stock holdings, the sales are unusual or suspicious. <em>MicroStrategy, </em>115 F.Supp.2d at 644 (citing <em>Burlington Coat Factory, </em>114 F.3d at 1423).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">There is no bright line test, however, as to the amount or percentage of stock that must be sold to constitute a \u201csuspicious amount\u201d \u2014 nor should there be, for, in the end, the determination of whether insider sales were \u201csuspicious\u201d is highly context-specific and depends on the other allegations offered in the Complaint.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Courts have classified stock sales as unusual or suspicious based on a variety of factors, which include \u201cthe amount of profit from sales,\u201d \u201cthe portion of stockholdings sold,\u201d \u201cthe change in volume of insider sales,\u201d \u201cand the number of insiders selling.\u201d <em>See Rothman v. Gregor, </em>220 F.3d 81, 94 (2d Cir.2000) (citing <em>Oxford Health Plans, </em>187 F.R.D. 133, 140 (S.D.N.Y.1999)) ($78 million profit from sale of 1.2 million shares during the class period is \u201cmassive by any measure\u201d); <em>Stevelman v. Alias Research Inc., </em>174 F.3d 79, 85 (2d Cir.1999) (president and CEO of company sold 40 percent of his stock holdings in a company while making optimistic statements about company\u2019s financial position); <em>In re Quintet Entm\u2019t Inc.

Cardinal Defendants contend that Plaintiffs\u2019 calculations are erroneous because courts do not view executives\u2019 decisions to exercise imminently expiring stock options to be \u201csuspicious.\u201d In other words, Cardinal Defendants insist that Plaintiffs incorrectly argue that \u201cexercising options and selling stock out of personal holdings\u201d is a \u201cdistinction without a difference\u201d when in fact, courts recognize that options are part of many executives\u2019 standard compensation package and that there is nothing \u201csuspicious\u201d in exercising an option before it expires. <em>See, e.g. Ad-vanta Corp., </em>180 F.3d at 540; <em>Burlington Coat Factory, </em>114 F.3d at 1424; <em>Friedman v. Rayovac Corp., </em>291 F.Supp.2d 845, 855 (D.Wis.2003); <em>In re Century Bus. Serv. Secs. Litig., </em>2002 WL 32254513, at *7 n. 17 (N.D.Ohio June 27, 2002). Cardinal Defendants also aver that because Plaintiffs fail to show that compensation at Cardinal was higher than that of its corporate peers, they incorrectly label Individual Defendants\u2019 exercise of options \u201crelevant,\u201d \u201cunusual,\u201d and \u201csuspicious.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">This Court agrees that most courts do not view an executive\u2019s decision to exercise bas stock options before they expire as evidence of fraudulent insider trading.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Nonetheless, in their Motion to Dismiss, Cardinal Defendants confirm that Walter made approximately 31% of his sales during the Class Period through exercising stock options set to expire in 2002 and 2004. That leaves 69% of his other sales activity to be unrelated to exercising his stock options, and all 69% of these sales, if inconsistent with Walter\u2019s past trading activity, could be considered suspicious.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Moreover, Cardinal Defendants argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 chart fails to account for Walter\u2019s stock <em>purchases </em>during the Class Period. They contend that any \u201cfair analysis\u201d would more properly measure the net proceeds from trading activity during the relevant period, accounting for the significant portion of the sale proceeds that were offset by the amounts Walter paid during the same period for acquired shares, including open-market purchases, \u201coption exercises and relevant payroll taxes associated with his option purchases.\u201d Def.\u2019s Motion to Dismiss at 46. Cardinal Defendants, however, cite no authority for this technical dispute.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-8\">Further, Cardinal Defendants argue that the fact that Walter actually <em>purchased </em>40,000 shares during the Class Period, augurs against an inference of scien-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>ter, \u201cas no rational person would acquire stock whose price was misleadingly-propped up.\u201d <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Motion to Dismiss at 51; <em>see Century Bus., </em>2002 WL 32254513 at *8 (finding it improbable that defendant would seek to increase his wealth by purchasing stock at inflated prices); <em>Schuster v. Symmetricon, Inc., </em>2000 WL 33115909, at *8 (N.D.Cal. Aug.1, 2000) (purchase of stock at allegedly inflated prices undermined a finding of scien-ter); <em>Morse, </em>200 F.Supp.2d at 853 (company\u2019s decision to reinvest in its own stock undermined scienter, since it would make no sense to knowingly purchase at inflated prices); <em>Mathews v. Centex Telemgmt., Inc., </em>1994 WL 269734, at *8 (N.D.Cal. June 8, 1994) (\u201cIt would have made no sense to purchase that stock if defendants knew the prices to be inflated.\u201d). Cardinal Defendants also argue that the fact that Defendant Walter did not sell stock in the last 18 months of the Class Period points against scienter. Cardinal Defendants rely on a number of cases, particularly from the Ninth Circuit, for the proposition that, \u201c[i]f Walter intended to inflate the price of Cardinal shares in order to cash in, his trading pattern certainly did not reflect this.\u201d <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Motion to Dismiss at 44; Def.\u2019s Reply at 24; <em>see In re Vantive Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>283 F.3d 1079, 1093-94 (9th Cir.2002) (rejecting insider trading allegation where most of the sales occurred more than a year before the press release announcing the damaging news); <em>In re Party City Sec. Litig., </em>147 F.Supp.2d 282, 313 (D.N.J.2001) (\u201ca broad temporal distance between stock sales and a disclosure of bad news defeats any inference of scienter\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The Court agrees with the Ninth Circuit that, in some cases, a broad temporal distance between stock sales and a disclosure of bad news defeats any inference of scien-ter; however, the Court does not believe the principle applies to the case sub judice. <em>See Vantive Corp., </em>283 F.3d at 1093-94. The magnitude of the Individual Defendants\u2019 sales must be viewed along a continuum where maximum profits and total loss of control are at one end, and minimum profits and maximum retention of control are at the other. <em>See MicroStrategy, </em>115 Fed. Supp.2d at 646. In <em>MicroStrategy, </em>however, \u201cthe fact that the point on this continuum that the Individual Defendants chose to draw did not entail near-total divestment of their total holdings in Mi-croStrategy [stock did] not preclude an inference of an intent on the Individual Defendants\u2019 part to profit from fraud <em>and </em>maintain control of the Company.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, in this case, Cardinal Defendants mistakenly assume that the only motive probative of scienter is the Individual Defendants\u2019 motive to \u201ccash out\u201d fully by divesting themselves of their stake in the Company. To this end, Cardinal Defendants highlight the fact that, in addition to his sales, Defendant Walter <em>purchased </em>40,-000 shares during the Class Period. This Court is persuaded, however, that \u201cthe calculus is clearly more complicated [because] \u2018an insider may not always trade all his shares in the company for which he possesses the inside information; the trader may hold on to a portion of his shares to hedge against the unforeseen or to obscure the insider trading from the SEC.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 647 (citing <em>In re Worlds of Wonder Sec. Litig., </em>35 F.3d 1407, 1427 (9th Cir.1994)). Thus, the Court does not agree with Cardinal Defendants that Walter\u2019s purchase of 40,000 shares \u2014 a trifling amount when compared with the 593,910 he sold \u2014 cuts against any unusual or suspicious trading.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Finally, Cardinal Defendants argue that, irrespective of whether the Court accepts Cardinal Defendants\u2019 arguments concerning stock options and stock purchases, Walter\u2019s trading activity is still not unusual or suspicious because Walter\u2019s \u201csales <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>during his Class Period followed his pre-established tendency to dispose of a small percentage of his Cardinal holdings within a day or a few days\u2019 time when the opportunity presented itself, and then not to sell again for months.\u201d <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Motion to Dismiss at 44. Further, they argue that Walter\u2019s trading history is \u201cnecessarily lumpy\u201d because \u201chis ability to sell stock in any given period has been subject to frequent \u2018closed windows\u2019 based on the company\u2019s internal policies relating to trades by officers, acquisitions, and other company business activity.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 43; <em>see In re Tyco Int\u2019l, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>185 F Supp.2d 102, 112 n. 6 (D.N.H.2002) (\u201cMost publicly traded companies have adopted policies which prevent insiders from trading except during narrow windows that are open for only brief periods following the release of accounting information.... Given this reality, evidence of insider trading following the release of accounting information is of limited value in determining whether the released information is misleading in most cases because it is equally likely that the information is accurate and that the timing of the trades is dictated by the company\u2019s insider trading policy.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">Cardinal Defendants also declare that Plaintiffs\u2019 incorrectly compare Walter\u2019s four years of Class Period trading to his trading in his two years of pre-Class Period trading, and that, in fact, Plaintiffs should have looked at <em>four </em>years of pre-Class Period trading.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> They argue that \u201cPlaintiffs compound their error by comparing, without adjustment, sales during the 45-month Class Period with sales during the preceding 24-month period,\u201d and that \u201cthe numbers Plaintiffs derive from comparisons drawn between these two dissimilar periods are meaningless.\u201d Defs Motion to Dismiss at 43. To the contrary, the Court considers it compelling that Walter\u2019s proceeds during the Class Period exceeded his pre-Class Period sales proceeds by more than 600 percent. In <em>Quintel Entertainment, </em>the court drew an inference of scienter when sales by corporate insiders were 156 percent greater than insider sales in the 14 month pre-Class Period. <em>See </em>72 F.Supp.2d at 296. Accordingly, regardless of whether Walter\u2019s sales are considered against two or four years of pre-Class Period sales, 600 percent is clearly a significant enough jump in trading to suggest that Walter\u2019s Class Period trading was unusual and suspicious.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">\n<em>ii) Defendant Fotiades</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Fotiades personally sold 67,814 shares of Cardinal stock for insider trader proceeds of $4,678,158 during the Class Period. Fotiades\u2019 reported insider trading during the Class Period is detailed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>Transaction Date Shares Sold Price Proceeds</p>\n<p id=\"AJ1R\">12/13/2000 5,561 $63.45 352,909</p>\n<p id=\"Ag4\">05/30/2001 17,300 $71.10 $1,247,330</p>\n<p id=\"Axj\">05/30/2001 808 $72.38 58,483</p>\n<p id=\"AtWF\">04/29/2002 4,144 $68.59 284,237</p>\n<p id=\"AjE\">04/30/2002 40,000 $68.38 $2,735,200</p>\n<p id=\"AuB\">Total 67,814 $4,678,159</p>\n<p id=\"b773-31\">Cardinal Defendants contend that Fo-tiades\u2019 trading is neither unusual nor suspicious because, like Walter, he did not sell stock in the last 27 months of the Class Period. Nonetheless, just as such claims failed to negate an inference of scienter as to Defendant Walter, so too do they fail to negate such an inference as to Defendant Fotiades.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-32\">Next, Cardinal Defendants argue that because the only shares Fotiades sold in the Class Period were made while he was with Cardinal\u2019s Life Sciences segment, <em>before </em>he became Cardinal\u2019s COO, they do not infer scienter. This Court disagrees; a sale by a high-level officer is still a sale, regardless of whether that officer had not yet risen to the highest echelons of the company.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-33\">Finally, Cardinal Defendants argue that Fotiades sold more than twice the number of shares he sold during the Class Period on November 10, 2004, four months after the end of the Class Period, and \u201cafter every alleged \u2018misrepresentation\u2019 Plaintiffs alleged had already been disclosed.\u201d <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Motion to Dismiss at 48. They aver that, \u201c[i]f Fotiades really were participating in an artificial inflation of Cardinal\u2019s price, one would imagine, he would sell his shares while the inflation was effect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Plaintiffs counter that Cardinal Defendants\u2019 failure to cite any authority for their proposition that post-Class Period sales negate scienter nullifies their argument. The Court finds that if such sales negated scienter, a defendant in an insider trading case could simply re-sell the options he had acquired cheaply as a means to evade liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-35\">\n<em>Hi) Defendant Jensen</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b773-36\">Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Jensen personally sold 10,357 shares of Cardinal stock for insider trader proceeds of $743,984 during the Class Period.

Cardinal Defendants, however, counter that Defendant Jensen \u201chad a 10b5-l trading plan during the Class Period, and sold stock during the Period on only two dates.\u201d <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Motion to Dismiss at 49. Plaintiffs point out that Jensen \u201cfails to mention that the purported trading plan\u201d was \u201cnot actually formed until March 5, 2004, and was not filed with the SEC until March 10, 2004, <em>after </em>he had dumped over 4,300 shares of Cardinal stock and immediately before he dumped another 6,000 shares.\u201d <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Opposition at 70 n. 26. Regardless of whether Jensen\u2019s plan was formed <em>before </em>or <em>after </em>the end of the Class Period, Plaintiffs also argue that \u201ca 10b5-l trading plan is typically considered an affirmative defense used to determine when a person\u2019s purchase or sale is not \u2018on the basis of material nonpublic information.\u201d <em>See </em>17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b5-l. As it is typically premature to raise affirmative defenses in a motion to dismiss, this Court will not consider the impact of Jensen\u2019s purported 10b5-l trading plan at this stage of the pleadings. Because Cardinal Defendants do not contest Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations as to Jensen, other than asserting the 10b5-l affirmative defense, the Court finds that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations as to Jensen\u2019s trading activities establish an inference of scienter.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">\n<em>iv) Defendant Parrish</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Parrish personally sold 16,032 shares of Cardinal stock for insider trader proceeds of $972,835 during the Class Period.

Consequently, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that Parrish\u2019s sales were \u201cunusual\u201d or \u201csuspiciously\u201d timed, are merely conclusory allegations. Thus, Plaintiffs have not established scienter as to Parrish\u2019s trading activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">\n<em>v) Defendant Millar</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Millar personally sold 86,043 shares of Cardinal stock for insider trader proceeds of $5,152,292 during the Class Period.

They assert that, when compared to Defendant Millar\u2019s two years of pre-Class trading, in which he sold-17% of his stock shares, the approximately 27% jump in sales should be viewed as suspicious.. Cardinal Defendants counter that, in fact, Defendant Millar\u2019s sales during the Class Period were derived almost entirely from exercising options due to expire in 2002, 2003, and 2004. Further, they contend that when Defendant Millar exercised his options in April 2003, he actually retained 31,000 shares rather than selling them, making him a net acquirer of shares at the end of the Class Period</p>\n<p id=\"b775-38\">Other courts have held that a defendant\u2019s retention of his stock holdings significantly undermines plaintiffs\u2019 assertion of scienter. <em>See Wilson v. Bemstock, </em>195 F.Supp.2d 619, 638 (D.N.J.2002); <em>see also In re Sun Healthcare Group, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>181 F.Supp.2d 1283, 1296 (D.N.M.2002) (insider trading allegations insufficient to plead scienter where insiders collectively purchased more shares than they sold during the class period); <em>In re First Union Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>128 F.Supp.2d 871, 898-99 (W.D.N.C.2001) (holding that increase in holdings of two insiders during the class period demonstrated the absence of scienter). Considering these other cases persuasive, the Court agrees that the fact that Millar was a net acquirer of shares by the end of the Class Period, points against, though does not wholly negate, a strong inference of Millar\u2019s scien-ter.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-40\">\n<em>vi) Defendant Miller</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b775-41\">Though Plaintiffs and Cardinal Defendants agree that Defendant Miller sold <em>no shares </em>of stock during the Class Period, they are in dispute as to whether Miller\u2019s failure to sell a single share of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Cardinal stock, in itself, points strongly away from a finding of wrongful intent. Cardinal Defendants rely on a number of cases, including <em>PR Diamonds, </em>to support their proposition that, though it may not be dispositive proof against Miller\u2019s scien-ter, his \u201cfailure to sell when Plaintiffs allege he had incentive to do so certainly points against scienter.\u201d See 91 Fed.Appx. at 436. The Cardinal Defendants\u2019 reliance on PR <em>Diamonds, </em>however, is misplaced. In that case, the court was persuaded that the absence of stock sales by the Individual Defendants \u201cworks against, but does not conclusively defeat an inference of scien-ter.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 436 (while the \u201cabsence of inside sales dulls allegations of fraudulent motive ... we have never held that the absence of insider trading <em>defeats </em>an inference of scienter\u201d) (emphasis added). The <em>PR Diamonds </em>court based its finding, in part, on the fact that Plaintiffs\u2019 motive allegations in that case suggested that the individual defendants had bought the stock to infuse cash to the company, not to enrich themselves personally. <em>See id. </em>In this ease, however, though Plaintiffs\u2019 allege that the Individual Defendants were struggling to keep up the appearance of Cardinal\u2019s growth during a difficult transition period, they also claim that, beyond making the Company appear successful, Cardinal Defendants also wanted to reap profits for themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">In the end, without considering the impact of the technical disputes between the parties regarding the timing, amounts, and other minute details of the Individual Defendants\u2019 trading activities, the Court finds that, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations against Defendants Walter, Fotiades, Jensen, and Miller, raise a strong inference of scienter and, therefore, survive Cardinal Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss. Though the insider trading allegations Plaintiffs raise against Defendants Parrish and Millar do not raise a strong inference of scienter, the Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations do not rest on insider trading alone. Thus, before the Court can dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 claims against Parrish and Millar as too weak to establish the strong inference of scienter required by the PSLRA, it must first consider the strength of Plaintiffs\u2019 other allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">2) Executive Compensation</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">Pursuant to Cardinal\u2019s FY 2000 Proxy dated September 18, 2000, the Board of Directors established fixed guidelines relating to executive compensation, and among the guiding principles was that executives would receive \u201cpay-for-performance\u201d and be rewarded for positive \u201ccorporate business unit, and individual performance.\u201d Plaintiffs allege that Cardinal Defendants were motivated to recklessly over-inflate Cardinal\u2019s stock price because the terms of their employment agreements tied them compensation directly to Cardinal\u2019s reported financial results and the performance of the Company\u2019s stock. Plaintiffs allege that based on the reported performance of Cardinal during the Class Period, the Individual Defendants each received the maximum possible incentive compensation through salary, cash bonuses, and options.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Plaintiffs argue that because, in total, Defendants Walter, Miller, Fotiades, and Millar collected more than $245 million in incentive-based executive compensation while perpetrating their fraud on the investing public, their compensation package points to their scienter.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>Cardinal Defendants contend that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations fail as a legal matter because, according to <em>PR </em>, <em>Diamonds, </em>\u201ca plaintiff may not establish an inference of \u25a0wrongful intent merely by showing that an executive had motive and opportunity (e.g., an executive position and a compensation package) to commit fraud.\u201d 91 Fed.Appx. at 435. Defendants argue that, to make these types of allegations, a plaintiff \u201cmust allege that the executive was driven by something more than a personal profit motive or producing a higher share price for the benefit of investors,\u201d because precedent has clearly established that, \u201c[a]ll corporate managers share a desire for their companies to appear successful. That desire does not comprise a motive for fraud ... Neither does an executive\u2019s desire to protect his position within a company or increase his compensation.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Cardinal Defendants also aver that the Sixth Circuit has been definitive \u201cmotive and opportunity\u201d to commit fraud cannot establish the necessary strong inference of scienter, and that Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments fall squarely into the category of \u201cmotive.\u201d <em>See </em>id,<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">A careful reading of <em>PR Diamonds </em>reveals that Cardinal Defendants\u2019 interpretation is inaccurate. The <em>PR Diamonds </em>court actually held that <em>\u201cbare allegations </em>of motive and opportunity, without more, are insufficient to establish scienter.\u201d <em>See </em>91 Fed.Appx. at 435. By presenting specific facts tying the Individual Defendants\u2019 compensation to company performance, Plaintiffs do more than just present \u201cbare allegations.\u201d Further, Plaintiffs rely upon a number of cases in which- other courts have held that the magnitude of a defendant\u2019s compensation package, together with other factors, may provide a heightened showing of motive to commit fraud. <em>See Florida State Bd. of Admin. v. Green Tree Fin. Corp., </em>270 F.3d 645, 661 (8th Cir.2001); <em>Am. West, </em>320 F.3d at 944 (strong inference of scienter because defendants\u2019 eligibility for stock options and executive bonuses were based principally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>on the company\u2019s financial performance); <em>In re Metawave Communications Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>298 F.Supp.2d 1056, 1071 (W.D.Wash.2003) (\u201cScienter can be established even if there were no sales of stock by officers during the class period, if there were other motives for fraud, such as receiving benefits tied to the company\u2019s financial performance.\u201d); <em>In re Wellcare Mgmt. Group Sec. Litig., </em>964 F.Supp. 632, 639 (N.D.N.Y.1997) (\u201c[T]he Court will not disregard, as irrelevant, allegations that incentive compensation was affected by the alleged fraudulent conduct.\u201d). In their reply, Defendants merely repeat their arguments about the insufficiency of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations; however, they do not dispute the foregoing precedent. As such, the Court is persuaded that though it does not amount to a <em>strong </em>inference of scienter, in this case, the Court may consider Plaintiffs\u2019 motivation to keep Cardinal\u2019s stock price high in order to profit from their executive compensation packages in analyzing scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">3) Meeting Analysts\u2019 Expectations</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Finally, Plaintiffs also allege that Cardinal was motivated to engage in fraud to meet analysts\u2019 expectations as to its performance, particularly during its transition from a B + H model to an FFS model. Courts have found that this type of \u201cgeneral allegation, though relevant, adds little by itself to the scienter calculus, because these are motives \u2018possessed, to a certain degree\u2019, by every corporate officer.\u201d <em>See MicroStrategy, </em>115 Fed. Supp.2d at 648; <em>see also, In re Stratosphere Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>1 F.Supp.2d 1096, 1116 (D.Nev.1998). Similarly, in this case, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that Cardinal Defendants wanted to maintain a high credit rating and prove its ability to transition in a shifting market, are not probative of scienter.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Af8\">v. Red Flags</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">Finally, Plaintiffs contend that the Cardinal Defendants knowingly or recklessly disregarded numerous red flags indicating Cardinal\u2019s improper accounting practices, GAAP violations, and internal control deficiencies. \u201cSpecific factual allegations that a defendant ignored red flags, or warning signs that would have revealed the accounting errors prior to their inclusion in public statements may support a strong inference of scienter.\u201d <em>See Comshare, </em>183 F.3d at 553-54; <em>see also, Miller v. Material Sciences Corp., </em>9 F.Supp.2d 925, 928-29 (N.D.Ill.1998) (\u201cDeliberately ignoring \u2018red flags\u2019... can constitute the sort of recklessness necessary to support \u00a7 10(b) liability.\u201d). On the other hand, \u201cignoring red flags may indicate that a defendant was merely negligent, not reckless. Courts typically look for multiple, obvious red flags before drawing an inference that a defendant acted intentionally or recklessly.\u201d <em>See PR Diamonds, </em>91 Fed.Appx. at 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">Red flags in this case would be \u201ccircumstances that would have put the [defendants on notice that [Cardinal\u2019s] financial statements and press releases contained material misstatements or omissions, or at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>least would have given them reasons to question the veracity of the statements.\u201d <em>See PR Diamonds, </em>91 Fed.Appx. at 432 (citing <em>Comshare, </em>183 F.3d at 553). The <em>Helwig </em>factors, while not exhaustive, are red flags probative of scienter in securities fraud actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-5\">(1) insider trading at a suspicious time or in an unusual amount;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-6\">(2) divergence between internal reports and external statements on the same subject;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-7\">(3) closeness in time of an allegedly fraudulent statement or omission and the later disclosure of inconsistent information;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-8\">(4) evidence of bribery by a top company official;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-9\">(5) existence of an ancillary lawsuit charging fraud by a company and the company\u2019s quick settlement of that suit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-10\">(6) disregard of the most current factual information before making statements;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-11\">(7) disclosure of accounting information in such a way that its negative implications could only be understood by someone with a high degree of sophistication;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-12\">(8) the personal interest of certain directors in not informing disinterested directors of an impending sale of stock; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-13\">(9) the self-interested motivation of defendants in the form of saving their salaries or jobs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-14\">251 F.3d at 552 (citing <em>Greebel, </em>194 F.3d at 196).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-15\">Cardinal Defendants argue that Plaintiffs suggestion that \u201cthe Court brush aside the absence of a <em>Helwig </em>factor is ... nonsense.\u201d <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Reply to Motion to Dismiss at 19; see <em>Helwig, </em>251 F.3d at 552 (citing <em>PR Diamonds, </em>91 Fed.Appx. at 427) (going through <em>Helwig </em>factors one by one, and affirming dismissal on scienter grounds immediately after recognizing \u201c[f]ew of these factors emerge\u201d); <em>Miller, </em>346 F.3d at 672-73 (affirming dismissal where three <em>Helwig </em>factors at issue were too weak to support an inference of scien-ter); <em>Albert Fadem, </em>334 F.Supp.2d at 1008 n. 24 (noting that plaintiffs\u2019 failure even to mention the <em>Helwig </em>factors was \u201ctelling\u201d that none of the \u201cusual indicia\u201d of securities fraud was present in the case).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-17\">Four of the nine <em>Helwig </em>factors are altogether inapplicable to this case: (1) Plaintiffs concede that there was no bribery of top Cardinal officials; (2) Plaintiffs do not allege the \u201coverly-sophisticated disclosure of information\u201d; (3) Plaintiff do not point to the quick settlement of ancillary lawsuits; and (4) Plaintiffs identify no conflicts of interest among directors. Cardinal Defendants ask the Court to regard the absence of these factors as pointing <em>against </em>an inference of scienter. 251 F.3d at 552. Before concluding that the absence of one of the list of factors defeats an inference of scienter, the Court will closely examine each of the <em>Helwig </em>factors that <em>is </em>present to determine whether they combine to create a strong inference of scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-18\">1) Insider Trading</p>\n<p id=\"b779-19\">Plaintiffs allege that each of the Individual Defendants engaged in suspicious or unusual trading activity over the course of the Class Period and that their trading, considered in its totality, establishes an inference of scienter except with respect to Defendants Parrish and Millar. <em>See supra </em>Part IV.II.A.l.b.iv.1). Thus, the Court must also consider the Individual Defendant\u2019s alleged insider trading in its analysis of whether the <em>Helwig </em>factors imply scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-20\">2) Divergence Between Internal Reports and External Statements on the Same Subject</p>\n<p id=\"b779-21\">Plaintiffs attempt to satisfy the second <em>Helwig </em>factor by suggesting that the Indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>vidual Defendants were either \u201caware\u201d or \u201cshould have been aware\u201d of the alleged fraudulent nature of various financial statements when they were issued because of the Individual Defendants\u2019 high-ranking positions, coupled with their certifications that each defendant was closely involved in Cardinal\u2019s business affairs, accounting and financial reporting. As further support, Plaintiffs cite all of Cardinal Defendants\u2019 monthly committee meetings and personal calls and statements made to industry analysts over the course of the Class Period. Plaintiffs conclude that because \u201callegations errors and improprieties that are significant in nature and magnitude\u201d support an inference of reckless or knowing misconduct,\u201d their allegations clearly establish the existence of this second <em>Helwig </em>factor. <em>See Firstenergy Corp., </em>316 F.Supp.2d at 598.</p>\n<p id=\"AAz\">Cardinal Defendants argue, and this Court agrees, that the Plaintiffs may not rest on such conclusory allegations to establish a \u201cdivergence\u201d between external reports and internal statements. In total, Plaintiffs allege a $26 billion difference between Cardinal\u2019s reported financials and their <em>actual </em>financials.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Though it has yet to be proven whether or not this figure is in fact <em>accurate, </em>the Court need not decide this issue on a motion to dismiss. This Court, therefore, finds that the alleged divergence between the Company\u2019s reported and actual financials resulting from the misstatements implies scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">3)Closeness in Time of the Allegedly Fraudulent Statement or Omission and the Later Disclosure of Inconsistent Information</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Plaintiffs allege that Cardinal Defendants disregarded current information before issuing their allegedly fraudulent statements. Cardinal Defendants, however, argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint pleads the issue in a \u201cconclusory fashion without providing supporting numbers or identifying specific items of information supposedly disregarded.\u201d Def.\u2019s Motion to Dismiss at 53. In <em>Comshare, </em>Plaintiffs alleged that Cardinal Defendants \u201cwere aware of, or were recklessly indifferent to\u201d the revenue recognition errors. <em>See </em>183 F.3d at 553. Nonetheless, the court found that where plaintiffs had alleged no facts to show that Cardinal Defendants <em>knew </em>or <em>could have known </em>of the errors, or that their regular procedures should have alerted them to the errors sooner, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations did not imply scienter. <em>See id. </em>Similarly, in this case, the Court finds that as Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations do not provide specific indications that Defendants should have known about the errors, Plaintiffs may not rest on their conclusory allegations that the existence of errors implies <em>recklessness.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-10\">4)Disregarding Current Factual Information Before Making Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b780-11\">Plaintiffs aver that Cardinal Defendants disregarded current information before issuing their allegedly fraudulent statements. Again, the Cardinal Defendants counter, and the Court agrees, that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are merely conclusory, accompanied by no factual support.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">5)Defendants\u2019 Self-Interested Motivation to Save Their Salaries or Jobs</p>\n<p id=\"b780-13\">As established above, the Court finds that Plaintiffs sufficiently alleged that Cardinal Defendants had a motive to artificially inflate the purchase price of Cardinal\u2019s stock, in part, because of their ineen-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>tive-based compensation, and ostensibly, their self-interest in saving their jobs. <em>See supra </em>Part <em>W.II.A.l.b.iv.2). </em>Because Plaintiffs have successfully alleged Cardinal Defendants\u2019 executive compensation as a possible motive for fraud, this Court will also view it as a suggestive red flag,</p>\n<p id=\"APJ\">c. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">As Plaintiffs stated during oral argument, the scienter analysis in these types of securities fraud cases is akin to looking at a painting. Though one or two brush strokes may be more powerful up close, to fully appreciate the painting, the viewer must step back to take in the \u201cbig picture.\u201d Applying this analogy to the facts in this case, the Complaint viewed <em>in toto </em>the conclusion that Plaintiffs have met their burden under the PSLRA, pleading sufficient facts to raise a strong inference that the Cardinal Defendants acted with the requisite scienter. Specifically, the Complaint\u2019s allegations as to: (1) Cardinal\u2019s GAAP violations; (2) the Individual Defendants\u2019 various motives to commit fraud, in particular, their insider trading, and incentive-based executive compensation packages; (3) Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations highlighting Operating Revenues as an area of focus for Cardinal which Cardinal Defendants had overstated by approximately $26 billion; and (4) Plaintiffs\u2019 sufficient allegations of a number of <em>Helwig </em>factors cumulatively raise a strong inference that the Cardinal Defendants acted intentionally, consciously, or, at the very least, recklessly, in violation of the securities laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">Because the Court finds that the Plaintiffs have alleged scienter, the Court must now analyze whether Plaintiffs have established the other elements of a prima facie case of securities fraud. <em>See Comshare, </em>183 F.3d at 548. Cardinal Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint establishes both reliance and damages. <em>See </em>PL\u2019s Reply at 82.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Accordingly, to make out a prima facie case, Plaintiffs must successfully plead the following: (1) that Defendants made a false statement or omission of material fact; (2) in connection with a purchase or sale of securities. <em>See Comshare, </em>183 F.3d at 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-9\">2. Particularity of Fraud Allegations</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">Cardinal Defendants argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint must be dismissed under Rule 12(b)(6) for failing to allege false or misleading statements or material omissions made by Defendants with the particularity required by both Rule 9(b) and the PSLRA. Def.\u2019s Motion to Dismiss at 28. The Plaintiffs must plead fraud with particularity under Rule 9(b) while also establishing facts demonstrating each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>statement\u2019s falsity, each statement\u2019s speaker, and why each statement was false when made. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u \u2014 4(b)(1); <em>Century Bus., </em>2002 WL 32254513 at *12; <em>Helwig, </em>251 F.3d at 550; <em>Gupta v. Terra Nitrogen Corp., </em>10 F.Supp.2d 879, 885 (N.D.Ohio 1998). Under the PSLRA, a plaintiff pleading on information and belief also must allege all facts on which that belief is based. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(1); <em>Century Bus., </em>2002 WL 32254513 at *12; <em>Telxon, </em>133 F.Supp.2d at 1025. This requirement may be satisfied in two ways: (1) a plaintiff can plead \u201cthe who, what, when, where and how: the first paragraph of any newspaper story\u201d; or (2) a plaintiff can satisfy the requirement through \u201calternative means of injecting precision and some measure of substantiation into their allegations of fraud.\u201d <em>See Telxon, </em>133 F.Supp.2d at 1025 (quoting <em>DiLeo, </em>901 F.2d at 627); <em>S.E.C. v. Lucent Tech., Inc., </em>363 F.Supp.2d 708, 715 (D.N.J.2005) (citing <em>Lum, </em>361 F.3d at 233-24; <em>Seville Indus. Machinery, </em>742 F.2d at 791) (holding that a plaintiff satisfied Rule 9(b) by pleading which machines were the subject of alleged fraudulent transactions and the nature and subject of the alleged misrepresentations). \u201cPlaintiffs also must allege who made a misrepresentation to whom and the general content of the misrepresentation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, to plead adequately the falsity of Cardinal\u2019s financial results reported in statements to the market via press releases and during analyst conference calls, and included in SEC filings, the Complaint need only identify the exact statements or the content Plaintiffs allege were false and misleading, the identity of the speakers, the date on which the statements were made, and the reasons the statements were false. <em>See SmarTalk, </em>124 F.Supp.2d at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint devotes 105 pages,<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> to presenting a detailed description of Cardinal Defendants\u2019 allegedly false statements or omissions of material fact. In their Motion to Dismiss, Cardinal Defendants argue the following: (1) Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint has not sufficiently pled fraud allegations with respect to each Individual Defendant; (2) Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint does not state a claim based upon any of Cardinal\u2019s alleged accounting misstatements; and (3) Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint does not allege particularized facts sufficient to state a claim based on Cardinal\u2019s transition from a B + H to an FFS business model.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">a. Particularity of Fraud Allegations with Respect to Each Defendant</p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Cardinal Defendants argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations fail as a matter of law because Plaintiffs do not specify their allegations with respect to each Individual Defendant. They contend that a plaintiff \u201cis required to meet the Rule 9(b) and PSLRA standards as to <em>each </em>defendant against whom securities fraud is alleged\u201d and that the Fifth Circuit has \u201cexplained the PSLRA\u2019s prohibition on clumping in some detail.\u201d <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Motion to Dismiss at 61; <em>see Southland Sec. Corp. v. Inspire Ins. Solutions, Inc., </em>365 F.3d at 353, 364-65 (5th Cir.2004) (\u201cThese PSLRA references to \u2018the defendant\u2019 may only reasonably be understood to mean \u2018each defendant\u2019 in multiple defendant cases as it is inconceivable that Congress intended liability of any defendant to depend on whether they were all sued in a single action or were each sued alone in several separate action.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">The Plaintiffs, however, contend that they have adequately pled fraud <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>as to each Individual Defendant under the auspices of the \u201cgroup-published information doctrine\u201d (the \u201cDoctrine\u201d). The Doctrine is a presumption, applied in some circuits, which allows plaintiffs to hold a corporation\u2019s officers and directors liable for false statements found in collectively published documents. <em>See Century Bus., </em>2002 WL 32254513 at *13. The Doctrine reasons that, \u201c[i]n cases of corporate fraud where the false and misleading information is conveyed in prospectuses, registration statements, annual reports, press releases, or other \u2018group-published information,\u2019 it is reasonable to presume that these are the collective actions of the corporate officers ...\u201d <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Wool v. Tandem Computers, Inc., </em>818 F.2d 1433, 1440 (9th Cir.1987) (citations omitted)). Under the Doctrine, a plaintiff fulfills the particularity requirement \u201cby pleading the misrepresentations with particularity and[,] where possible^] the roles of the individual defendants ...\u201d <em>See City of Monroe Employees Retirement Sys. v. Bridgestone Corp., </em>399 F.3d 651, 689 (6th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Wool, </em>818 F.2d at 1440 (finding that the Doctrine is premised on the presumption that \u201c[i]n cases of corporate fraud where the false or misleading information is conveyed in prospectuses, registration statements, annual reports, press releases, or other \u2018group-published information,\u2019 it is reasonable to presume that these are the collective actions of the officers\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Cardinal Defendants argue that a plaintiffs vague allegations <em>must </em>fail if the plaintiff fails to attribute them to specific directors, grouping directors together as \u201cDefendants\u201d instead. <em>See Mills v. Polar Molecular Corp., </em>12 F.3d 1170, 1175 (2d Cir.1993); <em>Rich v. Maidstone Fin. Inc., </em>2001 WL 286757, *7 (S.D.N.Y. Mar.23, 2001). Further, Defendants argue, based on <em>Southland Sec. Corp. v. Inspire Ins. Solutions, Inc., </em>that the Doctrine could not have survived Congress\u2019 passage of the PSLRA because pleading in such a manner \u201ccannot withstand the PSLRA\u2019s specific requirement that the untrue statements or omissions be set forth with particularity as to \u2018the defendant\u2019 and that scienter be pleaded with regard to \u2018each act or omission\u2019 sufficient to give \u2018rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind.\u2019 \u201d <em>See </em>365 F.3d at 364-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">Though Defendants\u2019 prudential argument may have appeal, it has been specifically rejected by courts within the Sixth Circuit. <em>See Century Bus., </em>2002 WL 32254513 at *12-13 (though \u201c[defendants argue that the Sixth Circuit has not adopted the [Doctrine] at any point after the Reform Act and that, without [the Doctrine], the plaintiffs have failed to allege particularized facts demonstrating false statements by each defendant,\u201d the court found \u201cthat the [Doctrine] survived the passage of the PSLRA and has continuing viability in the Sixth Circuit\u201d). The <em>Century Bus. </em>court was guided by a number of cases from both inside of and outside of the Sixth Circuit, all of which recognized the continued validity of the Doctrine. <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>67</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>This Court finds that the group-published doctrine does not eviscerate the specificity required by the PSLRA. When high level executives with access to information who signed the corporate documents being questioned for their validity at trial, Plaintiffs should be allowed to attribute those documents to the signors. <em>See Century Bus., </em>2002 WL 32254513 at *14 (citing <em>Benedict, </em>23 F.Supp.2d at 762-63) (holding that conclusory allegations were sufficient as to inside directors with involvement in the day-to-day affairs of the corporation). The standards for applying the Doctrine are relatively lenient. <em>Id. </em>Thus, in this case, the Court finds that, under the relatively lenient group-pleading standards, Plaintiffs are entitled to the group-published information presumption to all Individual Defendants except Defendant Jensen.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-3\">Defendants Walter, Fotiades, Miller, Millar, and Parrish were all high-level executives, responsible for day-to-day operations and issues relating to Cardinal\u2019s financial performance. <em>See supra </em>PartJLA. They also signed off on Cardinal\u2019s corporate disclosure statements or participated in conference calls with analysts and investors. <em>Id. </em>Though Plaintiffs have alleged facts showing that Defendant Jensen was a high-level executive, they have not shown that he had any involvement in certifying corporate documents to the extent of the other Individual Defendants. Also, Plaintiffs have not pled facts showing that Jensen ever participated in conference calls with analysts and investors. Moreover, at oral argument, counsel for Defendant Jensen further convinced the Court that there were not enough facts alleged to link Jensen to Cardinal\u2019s corporate misstatements to the extent of his co-Defendants. And although the Court still finds that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations about Defendant Jensen\u2019s insider trading provide some indications of scienter, in their totality, Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint fails to establish that Defendant Jensen should be found responsible for Cardinal\u2019s alleged misstatements or omissions. Accordingly, the Court GRANTS Defendant Jensen\u2019s Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">b. Whether Plaintiffs Pled Cardinal\u2019s Accounting Misstatements with Particularity</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">Cardinal Defendants emphasize that Plaintiffs have failed to allege GAAP violations because they have not indicated any true \u201cmisstatements\u201d or \u201comissions\u201d by Cardinal Defendants. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Motion to Dismiss 58-87. Cardinal Defendants\u2019 arguments fall short, in part, however, because this Court has already found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>that the Plaintiffs adequately pled scienter as to Cardinal Defendants\u2019 GAAP violations. <em>See supra </em>Part <em>IV.II. </em>A.l.c.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">In <em>Montalvo v. Tripos, Inc., </em>plaintiffs, purchasers of stock in a corporation, sued defendants \u2014 the corporation, certain corporate officials, and the corporation\u2019s outside auditor' \u2014 alleging that defendants had made false and misleading financial misstatements which, when discovered, led to a significant drop in the company\u2019s stock value. <em>See </em>2005 WL 2453964, **7-8, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22752, *23-24 (E.D.Mo. Sept. 30, 2005). Certain defendants moved to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. <em>See id. </em>The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint set forth \u201cnumerous public statements made by the defendants during the class period that the plaintiffs investors believe [gave] rise to a strong inference of scienter because the defendants knew facts or had access to information that suggested that their public statements were not accurate and/or deliberately engaged in making false and misleading statements in order to defraud the investors as to the true financial condition of defendant Tripos.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 2005 WL 2453964, *4, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22752, *15. The plaintiffs declared that, despite the defendants\u2019 knowledge of negative events and accounting irregularities, defendants had continued to forecast extremely positive corporate revenues. <em>Id. </em>Defendants argued that the purchasers failed to allege securities fraud with the particularity required by the PSLRA. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">The <em>Montalvo </em>court held that the purchasers had sufficiently alleged that defendants acted with the requisite scienter, properly identified misleading statements and the circumstances under which the statements were made, and adequately pled fraud in connection with defendants\u2019 accounting irregularities. <em>Id. </em>The court reasoned that where plaintiffs had alleged both far-reaching GAAP violations as well as facts showing the evidence of defendants\u2019 fraudulent intent, they had met the PSLRA\u2019s standards of pleading with particularity. <em>Id. </em>The <em>Montalvo </em>court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-8\">Here the plaintiffs have alleged not only egregious GAAP violations, but also \u201cevidence of corresponding fraudulent intent.\u201d They have set out with particularity the material misstatements in the public statements which omitted, among other things, the on-going problems with the software consulting business, and have set forth GAAP violations which defendants do not deny as evidenced by their restatements. Essentially, the amended complaint alleges that defendants knew that certain company assets were impaired and that losses were certain, but that recognizing these losses (during the Class Period) would have lowered the company\u2019s stock price and threatened the ability to market and sell its products ... It is [also] alleged that the \u201cstrategic non-disclosures\u201d kept [the defendant company\u2019s] stock artificially high, attracting more investors, until the restatements were issued, causing a drastic stock price fall. The plaintiffs have identified specific documents and statements within those documents attributable to the defendants that allegedly artificially inflated [the defendant company\u2019s] earnings and net tangible assets by deliberately hiding specific losses that were also identified.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-9\"><em>See id. </em>at 2005 WL 2453964, *9, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 22752, *23-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">Just as the <em>Montalvo </em>plaintiffs\u2019 complaint identified a number of examples of allegedly inaccurate statements meant to defraud investors, so too does Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint detail 105 pages of detailed errors. Thus, the Court finds that while the Cardinal Defendants spend considerable time and effort explaining how and why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number><em>each </em>of Cardinal\u2019s accounting statements was in fact both legal and proper, at this stage of the litigation, these arguments do not undermine the Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations,</p>\n<p id=\"ATc\">c. Cardinal\u2019s Forward-Looking Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Cardinal Defendants also argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations fail to satisfy the standards of the PSLRA because they are protected by the statutory safe-harbor as \u201cimmaterial\u201d forward-looking statements. During the Class Period, Plaintiffs allege that Defendant Cardinal made numerous statements concerning the Company\u2019s shift from the B + H to the FFS distribution market, and its effect on Cardinal\u2019s business. Cardinal Defendants aver that its statements concerning the Company\u2019s changing distribution model constitute in-actionable \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d protected by the PSLRA\u2019s safe-harbor provision. Def.\u2019s Motion to Dismiss at 83-85; <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78u-5(c)(l)(A), 77z-2(c)(1)(A), 78u-5(c)(l)(A); <em>see Southland, </em>365 F.3d at 371.

To avoid the safe harbor, a plaintiff must plead facts demonstrating that the statement was made with actual knowledge of its falsity. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-5(c)(1)(B); <em>Southland, </em>365 F.3d at 371.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-11\">The safe harbor has two independent prongs: one focusing on the defendant\u2019s cautionary statements, and the other on the defendant\u2019s state of mind. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77z-2(c)(l)(A), 78u-5(c)(l)(A) (1996); 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77z-2(e)(l)(B), 77u-5(c)(l)(B) (1996); <em>Southland, </em>365 F.3d at 371. Under the first prong, there is no liability if, and to the extent that, the forward-looking statement is either: (1) identified as forward-looking and accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statement, or (2) immaterial. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77z-2(c)(l)(A), 78u-5(c)(l)(A); <em>Southland, </em>365 F.3d at 372.

The Court will now analyze whether any of the following statements are protected by statutory safe harbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">I. Materiality</p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">First, Cardinal Defendants would dismiss their optimistic projections and internal estimates as \u201csoft, puffing statements\u201d that are immaterial as a matter of law. Def.\u2019s Motion to Dismiss at 83-85; <em>see San Leandro, </em>75 F.3d at 811 (rejecting plaintiffs\u2019 contention that general announcement by Phillip Morris that it was \u201coptimistic\u201d about its earnings and \u201cexpected\u201d Marlboro to perform well required the company to disclose the possibility of adopting an alternative marketing strategy that would hurt short-term earnings); <em>TSC Indus., Inc. v.

No reasonable investor would rely on these statements, and they are certainly not specific enough to perpetrate a fraud on the market.\u201d <em>In re Royal Appliance Sec. Litig., </em>1995 WL 490131, *3 (6th Cir. Aug.15,1995) (quoting <em>Raab v. Gen.

These policies are that \u201c[t]here cannot be honest markets without honest publicity. Manipulation and dishonest practices of the market place thrive upon mystery and secrecy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Basic, </em>485 U.S. at 230, 108 S.Ct. 978). Further, the Court added that it \u201crepeatedly has described the fundamental purpose of the Act as implementing a philosophy of full disclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Basic, </em>485 U.S. at 230, 108 S.Ct. 978) (citation and internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">In <em>Helwig, </em>Defendants also argued that because their economic projections amounted to puffery, they were not actionable under the securities laws. <em>See </em>251 F.3d at 554-55. The court disagreed, finding that although \u201cplaintiffs had alleged facts to produce a strong inference that defendants knew that the Budget Act could adversely affect their operations ... [they] simply rested on their disavowals of knowledge while continuing to make favorable earnings predictions.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 556. Moreover, the court concluded that there was a \u201csubstantial likelihood that the disclosure of the omitted fact[s] would have been viewed by the reasonable investor as having significantly altered the \u2018total mix\u2019 of information made available.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 556 (citing <em>Basic, </em>485 U.S. at 231-32, 108 S.Ct. 978). The court reasoned,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-5\">[I]t cannot be said that Vencor\u2019s preliminary appraisals and internal assessments of the Balanced Budget Act were material solely by virtue of their omission ... [P]laintiffs have alleged facts to produce a strong inference that defendants knew that the Budge Act could adversely affect their operations. Yet defendants simply rested on their disavowals of knowledge while continuing to make favorable earnings predictions.

Litig., </em>184 F.Supp.2d 626. In <em>In re Ford, </em>plaintiffs sued Ford and its executives under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 alleging that the company made misleading statements about the quality and safety of its \u201cFord Explorer\u201d sport utility vehicles. <em>Id. </em>at 628.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 theory of liability is premised on Ford\u2019s omission of material information which allegedly transformed seemingly innocuous and accurate statements into misleading statements ... By omitting information about this contingent liability, plaintiffs argue, Ford\u2019s accurate statements about sales of Explorers and its bolstering statements regarding corporate responsibility became misleading to investors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 630. The court found that plaintiffs had failed to state a claim under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 because \u201cFord\u2019s statements were <em>general, ... </em>[and] did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>give rise to a duty to disclose information about a specific problem that may occur in the future,\u201d and because \u201cunlike in <em>Helwig, </em>where the company\u2019s public statement were [sic] directly related to the withheld adverse information, Ford\u2019s public statement[s][sic] do not relate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 633 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Moreover, relying on <em>In re Ford, </em>this Court determined in <em>Albert Fadem </em>that plaintiffs\u2019 allegations were, similarly, too general to substantiate plaintiffs\u2019 claims. <em>See </em>334 F.Supp.2d at 1023. In <em>Albert Fa-dem, </em>plaintiffs, investors, sued defendant AEP, a company engaged in energy trading, claiming securities fraud based on defendants\u2019 allegedly inaccurate financial reporting, among other things. <em>Id. </em>at 993\u2014 94. This Court held that plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that defendants\u2019 statements in the \u201cRisks Related to Our Energy Trading and Wholesale Business\u201d section were too general, and did not give rise to a duty on the part of defendant AEP to disclose anything about the specific subject of reporting to the Trade Press, especially where plaintiffs had not alleged a way in which investors had access to those price indices or used them in their investment decisions.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 1023.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">This Court finds the instant case more similar to <em>Hehvig </em>than to <em>In re Ford </em>and <em>Albert Fadem. </em>Just as plaintiffs in <em>Hel-wig </em>pled detailed facts that could not be considered puffery, in this case, Plaintiffs have alleged 105 pages of specific facts, each of which implies that although Defendants knew that Cardinal\u2019s attempted business model transition could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial standing, they recklessly reported accounting misstatements in their SEC filings, their statements to the market, and their statements during conference calls with analysts and investors. <em>See </em>Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 56-58, 63-66, 72-76, 80-85, 88-95, 97-105, 108-14, 118-28, 132-38, 141-46, 150-51, 153-59, 163-68, 171-78, 181-87, 191-95, 199-223. As such, the Court finds that Cardinal Defendants\u2019 statements regarding the Company\u2019s transition from a B + H to an FFS distribution model were <em>not </em>immaterial puffery.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">ii. Meaningful Cautionary Language</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">Though the Court has determined that Cardinal\u2019s statements about its shifting distribution model were not puffery, they may still be protected by the safe harbor if they constitute forward-looking statements accompanied by \u201cmeaningful cautionary language.\u201d Cardinal Defendants argue that each of their alleged \u201cmisstatements\u201d related to the future of the Company in the face of the distribution shift and were forward-looking. The issue, then, is whether the statements were \u201caccompanied by meaningful cautionary language.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-11\">The requirement for \u201cmeaningful cautionary language\u201d calls for \u201csubstantive\u201d company specific warnings based on a realistic description of the risks applicable to the particular circumstances, not merely a boilerplate litany of generally applicable risk factors. <em>Southland, </em>365 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>F.3d at 372 (citing H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 369, 104th Cong., 1st Sess. 31, 44 (1995)); <em>see also Donald J. Trump Casino Sec. Litig., </em>7 F.3d 357, 371-72 (3d Cir.1993) (\u201cTo suffice, the cautionary statements must be substantive and tailored to the specific future projections, estimates or opinions ... which the plaintiffs challenge.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">In <em>Firstenergy, </em>the court found that, though some of defendants\u2019 forward-looking statements were protected by cautionary statements, the cautionary language was \u201cinsufficient to bring them within the safe harbor provision.\u201d <em>See </em>316 F.Supp.2d at 596. The court cited what it termed \u201ctypical example\u201d of defendants\u2019 cautionary language, noting:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-5\">This News Release includes forward-looking statements based on information currently available to management. Such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. These statements typically contain, but are not limited to, the terms \u2018anticipate,\u2019 \u2018expect,\u2019 \u2018believe,\u2019 \u2018estimate,\u2019 and similar words. Actual results may differ materially due to a number of factors including, but not limited to, the speed and nature of regulatory approvals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b790-6\"><em>Id. </em>n. 9. The court reasoned that, considering the facts of the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint suggesting that defendants had \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of the problems at the defendant Company, the above \u201cvague and insipid cautionary language is insufficient to afford the statements protection under [the] PSLRA\u2019s safe harbor provision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>In re Prudential Sec. Litig., </em>930 F.Supp. 68, 72 (S.D.N.Y.1996) (noting that the safe harbor provision provides \u201cno protection to someone who warns his hiking companions to walk slowly because there might be a ditch ahead when he knows with near certainty that the Grand Canyon lies one foot away\u201d)). Such vague language is in sharp contrast to that found sufficiently meaningful in <em>In re Kindred Healthcare, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>in which the court found that defendants\u2019 cautionary warnings specifically admonishing investors about the \u201cactual risks\u201d the defendant company faced brought statements within the protection of the safe harbor. <em>See </em>299 F.Supp.2d 724, 739 (W.D.Ky.2004). Accordingly, should this Court determine that Cardinal\u2019s alleged warnings failed to intimate that the Company\u2019s statements <em>could be </em>inaccurate because of the Company\u2019s problems transitioning from aB + H to an FFS distribution model, they will be considered \u201ctoo vague\u201d to be \u201cmeaningful cautionary language.\u201d <em>See Firstenergy Corp., </em>316 F.Supp.2d at 596.

Plaintiffs\u2019 selective pleading of Walter\u2019s statements is sufficient to make their allegations \u201cimmaterial as a matter of law.\u201d <em>See supra </em>note 72. Considering the effects of the \u201cmissing\u201d language Defendants added in their Reply motion, the Court does not agree that the Defendants have adequately protected their statements with meaningful paution-ary language intimating the \u201cactual risks\u201d faced by the Company. <em>See Firstenergy Corp., </em>316 F.Supp.2d at 596. As such, Walter\u2019s above statements do not fall under the protection of the statutory safe harbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">2) Cardinal\u2019s May 2003 <em>Investor</em></p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">The Plaintiffs cite the May 2003 issue of <em>The Cardinal Health Investor </em>as including a number of actionable misstatements.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> This issue of the <em>Investor </em>identified several \u201cHot Topics,\u201d one of which was the Company\u2019s [IMAs] with manufacturers, writing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-10\">IMAs \u2014 Our critical role</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-11\">We\u2019ve been getting questions about our relationships with' pharmaceutical manufacturers lately, particularly in light of \u201cchannel stuffing\u201d activities being repotted. Manufacturers are looking to better align productivity with health care providers\u2019 product demand and, because of this, are offering less inventory for sale into the channel, which you all are aware has had an impact on our trading company business this year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-12\">[IMAs] ... are an attempt to balance manufacturing production with actual prescription demand by retailers and consumers. IMAs, which often contain provisions limiting the distributor\u2019s inventory investment, are an important part of doing business as a pharmaceutical distributor. The channel can operate more efficiently, and costs to eventual patients can be contained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-13\">We look to structure IMAs to achieve similar levels of profitability and improve our return on capital by reducing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>the capital that is needed for investment in inventory. That frees up capital for reinvestment either in this business or in other areas of the company. With the diversity of our businesses and attractive investment alternatives, we will deploy the capital returned from these agreements into new opportunities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-5\">Evolution occurring in the marketplace over the past several years can be a positive development for the industry, but also one in which we have to remain diligent in understanding how the structure of these agreements will impart our profit over the next several years. We will continue to utilize our experience and competitive expertise to negotiate individually with manufacturers, but we will always weight the economic value of every product we carry to ensure it is consistent with our profit targets and the value we bring to manufacturers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-6\">We are confident that we can work with manufacturers to meet them needs and also preserve our profit consistent with the influential role we play in the pharmaceutical channel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-7\"><em>See </em>Complaint \u00b6 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">Again, Cardinal Defendants argue that Plaintiffs\u2019 silence as to whether the above statement is accompanied by meaningful cautionary language makes it inactionable. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Reply at 65. Further, Cardinal Defendants argue that the above statement merely \u201cconfirms that the market is in \u2018[e]volution\u2019 and that Cardinal recognizes the need to \u2018remain diligent\u2019 in the face of new challenges.\u201d <em>See id. </em>Nevertheless, the Court finds that this brief sentence of cautionary language is not specific enough to allow the <em>entire </em>statement the protection of the statutory safe-harbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">3) Cardinal\u2019s July 31, 2003 Conference Call</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">In Cardinal\u2019s July 31, 2003 conference call with analysts and investors, Cardinal Defendants \u201crepeated and addressed information previously made public in the [Company\u2019s] July 31, 2003 press release.\u201d Complaint \u00b6 164. During that call, Defendant Miller stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-12\">As expected, Cardinal Health\u2019s 4th quarter financial results' capped off the year that delivered on the financial commitment that we made to our shareholders at the beginning of the year. Strong revenue growth across all of our business segments drove continued expansion and operating earnings....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-13\">Now, let me comment on just a few matters of importance in our various operating segments, beginning with the Pharmaceutical Distribution and Provider Services segment. Strong revenue growth of 14 percent was driven by 42 percent growth from alternate site customers and 11 percent growth from chain customers during the 4th quarter. Incremental revenue from previously announced new customer wins had a positive impact during the quarter and served to offset the expected dampening effect of a slow down in our wholesaler-to-wholesaler trading revenues.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-14\"><em>Id. </em>Further, Defendant Walter allegedly provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-15\">Our solid 4th quarter performance capped another strong year for our company. The financial results for the year were outstanding and we did deliver on our commitments....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-16\">... In our analyst meeting last August, we forecasted 14 to 17 percent revenue growth and 20 to 22 percent earnings per share growth for Cardinal Health, and our performance was right on target. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-17\">Now for some of the highlights from the 4th quarter in fiscal 2003, from my perspective, strong revenue growth across <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>the company, and each segment delivers at or above our expectations ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-4\">In our Pharmaceutical Distribution business ... [r]evenue growth was strong with some important new relationships being established that provides us more from a supplier that moves us more from a supplier of products to a solutions provider ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-5\">First, we are confident that revenues in each of our segment will continue to be strong. An I\u2019ve already given you some of the reasons for that. Revenue growth for the corporation should be in the mid-teens. So there is a lot of confidence in sales....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-6\">[I\u2019m] convinced, after extensive conversations with many of our manufacturing partners, that they are not seeking to pull margins from the distribution partners ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b794-7\">And this has led to the statements I made on the call in April, led to more active conversations at the high level with other manufacturers and I am very pleased with those conversations and met with the CEOs of some of the major pharmaceutical manufacturers to talk about and make sure they know about distribution and make sure they understand how moving to what I call a closer \u2014 a model that has sales in production and closer to demand of the patient.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABK\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">Cardinal Defendants argue that \u201c[neither excerpt purports to identify manufacturers who have entered new contracts. The complete transcript makes clear that with the first sentence Walter is <em>cautioning </em>investors about the diminishing margin opportunities that led to the transition.\u201d <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Reply at 66. Defendants aver that Walter began his statement by saying,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhqQ\">First we have concluded that it\u2019s prudent to be more cautious about vendor margins in this environment ... .we expect strong revenue ... but as we pulled our budget together for the fiscal year and reviewed recent activity, we came to the conclusion vendor margins will be down when compared to a relatively strong '02 in first half of '03. Some manufacturers are seeking a distribution relationship that pulls inventory out of the channel when compared to fiscal '02 and fiscal '03. Their goal is to match production in sales more closely to script demand at the patient level. Keep in mind, I said some, but not all. I want to accommodate their needs as we view them as our upstream customer. And [I\u2019m] convinced, after extensive conversations with many of our manufacturing partners, that they are not seeking to pull margins from the distribution partners.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b794-10\"><em>Id. </em>Cardinal Defendants argue that Walter reiterated his warnings in response to analyst questions, and that Plaintiffs intentionally omitted some of Walter\u2019s cautionary language in their pleadings. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Reply at 68. Specifically, they aver that in response to an analyst question about the Company\u2019s management of the IMA model, Defendant Walter responded by stating, \u201c... Let\u2019s put this in perspective, in my conversation I said that the less optimism on buying margin, vendor margin for the next six months affected the overall growth rate of Cardinal\u2019s operating earnings by 2-3%----\u201d <em>Id. </em>They declare that, considering Walter\u2019s statements <em>in context, </em>Cardinal clearly disclosed \u201cthe difficulties that lay both in the past and the future\u201d and also offered \u201cwhat Cardinal hoped would be \u2018perspective\u2019 \u201d \u2014amounting to \u201csound management, not deception.\u201d <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Reply at 68. The Court does not find that these tidbits of \u201cperspective\u201d amount to meaningful cautionary language sufficient to warn an investor that, despite Cardinal\u2019s seemingly successful operating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>revenues, the Company was still hesitant about its transition to a new distribution model. The above conference call does not fall under the protection of the statutory safe harbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">4) Cardinal\u2019s February 19, 2004 Conference Call</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">On February 19, 2004, Cardinal hosted its Semi-Annual Investor Update Conference during which Defendant Parrish allegedly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-7\">We have seen tremendous organic growth in the business and we\u2019re not looking forward maybe projections of winning through large agreement and having to sort of hit one over the fence, if you will, in order to make our numbers ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-8\">Our revenue growth is dependable and sustainable. We\u2019re going to grow slightly faster than the marketplace because of our mix of mail-order business and alternate-care business....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-9\">Now finally, as we have been informing you over the last three quarters, our manufacturers\u2019 needs have shifted. It is our inventory management model, with inventory levels that match demand, production efficiencies and increase the safety and security of the U.S. distribution channel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-10\">Finally, as we move through fiscal year 2005, our results will begin to resemble the traditional model for the distribution company, in which earnings grow faster than revenues, the model that you\u2019re used to seeing from Cardinal Distribution....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-11\">And we\u2019re making significant progress with our branded manufacturer customers at this point....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-12\">And currently, we have in process 47 manufacturers, representing about 80% of our volume in these negotiations in some phase of these five-step processes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AoU\"><em>See </em>Complaint \u00b6 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-14\">Cardinal Defendants argue that, in his statements, Parrish neither \u201cmisrepresented\u201d the \u201cnumber of customers\u201d who had signed IMA contracts nor \u201cthe actual status of the transition.\u201d <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Reply at 74. They opine that, when Parrish mentioned 47 manufacturers \u201cin some phase of these five-step processes\u201d he was not claiming that Cardinal had actually <em>completed </em>new FFS agreements with each manufacturer, and they contend that Plaintiffs intentionally left out the following clarifying statements made by Parrish:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b795-15\">This enabled us to enter into the discussions with the manufacturers armed with documentation and supporting evidence to support the process. Working through this discussion was really a five-stage process involving first establishing awareness of the services that we provide. Then we have to educate our partners on the changes that are going on in the marketplace. We then define the terms of the new agreements, which we\u2019re calling distribution service agreements, or DSAs. We go through the implementation process of those agreements, and then there\u2019s an ongoing refinement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b795-16\"><em>See id. </em>As such, Cardinal Defendants argue that \u201crather than misstating the transition, Parrish was <em>explaining </em>what [the transition] might entail.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Nevertheless, the Court does not find that Parrish\u2019s side note that the development of IMAs was a long-term \u201cprocess\u201d amounts to meaningful cautionary language sufficient to protect Cardinal Defendants\u2019 statements under the statutory safe-harbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-17\">5) Cardinal\u2019s April 22, 2004 Conference Call</p>\n<p id=\"b795-18\">On April 22, 2004, Cardinal Defendants hosted another conference call with ana<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>lysts and investors in which Defendant Fotiades allegedly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-4\">Another important measure of our progress to the just in time business model as seen in our day\u2019s inventory on hand, which declined a significant seven days versus the year-ago period, driven largely by distribution....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-5\">So I think these discussions are now moving into a much more informed kind of discussion because, you know, they now know it\u2019s real. They\u2019re starting to do their own work and it\u2019s making good progress <em>... We have agreements with everybody today and those agreements are going to continue to get refined and we\u2019ll continue to see improvements in our business as a result.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-6\"><em>See </em>Complaint \u00b6 192. The Court is not persuaded that Fotiades one-line statement that the IMAs in development would continue to be refined constitutes meaningful cautionary language to protect Cardinal Defendants\u2019 statements under the statutory safe-harbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">iii. Actual Knowledge of Misleading Nature of Forward-Looking Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">The Cardinal Defendants may also be protected by the statutory safe harbor for material statements as long as the Plaintiffs have not adequately alleged Cardinal Defendants\u2019 \u201cactual knowledge\u201d of the misleading or false nature of their statements. <em>See Helwig, </em>251 F.3d at 556. The <em>Helwig </em>court compared the common law requirements for fraud to a showing of scienter under federal securities laws. <em>See id. </em>at 558 (citing <em>Mansbach, </em>598 F.2d at 1024). Though <em>Helwig </em>acknowledges that the comparison is inexact, it is instructive in the Court\u2019s analysis of the allegations in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-9\">A defendant who asserts a fact as of his own knowledge or so positively as to imply that he has knowledge, under the circumstances when he is aware that he will be so understood when he knows that he does not in fact know whether what he says is true, is found to have intent to deceive, not so much as to the fact itself, but rather as the extent of his information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-11\"><em>See id. </em>(citing Prosser and Keaton on Torts 741-42 (5th ed.1984) (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b796-12\">Nonetheless, in <em>Mayer v. Mylod, </em>the Sixth Circuit held that the truth or falsity of a defendant\u2019s misstatements \u201cis not an issue to be decided under Rule 12(b)(6).\u201d 988 F.2d 635 (6th Cir.1993) (though material statements containing the speaker\u2019s opinion are actionable under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act if the speaker does not believe the opinion and the opinion is not factually well-grounded, this is <em>not </em>an issue to be decided under Rule 12(b)(6)). In <em>Mayer, </em>the court continued that \u201c[ajfter an appropriate time for discovery, the defendants will have an opportunity under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to show that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that they are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 640. Hence, this Court need not determine Cardinal Defendants\u2019 actual knowledge of the truth or falsity of their statements at this stage of the pleadings. <em>See id. </em>Even so, because the Court concluded that Plaintiffs adequately pled scienter based on their numerous allegations, the Court finds that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are, for pleading purposes, sufficient to show scienter as to Cardinal Defendants\u2019 forward-looking statements. <em>See SmarTalk, </em>124 F.Supp.2d at 544 (finding that because the court had determined that plaintiffs had adequately pled scienter based on their allegations of accounting errors together with insider trading, their allegations were, for plead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>ing purposes, sufficient to show scienter for forward-looking statements).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">iv. Liability for Third-Party Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Cardinal Defendants also contend that they cannot be held liable for analysts\u2019 and reporters\u2019 statements regarding Cardinal. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Reply at 68-70. Specifically, Cardinal Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have pointed to no actionable misstatements in their allegations regarding the October 23, 2003 Morgan Stanley Report or the January 22, 2004 Dow Jones News Service Article Regarding Cardinal. <em>See id.; see </em>Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 175,183.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">Cardinal Defendants assert that, to state a viable securities fraud claim with respect to analysts\u2019 statements, the plaintiffs must plead facts demonstrating that the defendants adopted or <em>entangled </em>themselves with the statements. <em>See Albert Fadem, </em>334 F.Supp.2d at 1027 (\u201ccourts have determined that companies generally are not liable for forecasts or statements by analysts unless defendants have \u2018sufficiently entangled\u2019 [themselves] with the analysts\u2019 forecasts [so as] to render those predictions \u2018attributable to [the issuers] ... \u2019 \u201d). To prove entanglement plaintiffs must allege that defendants used the analysts as \u201cconduits,\u201d making false and misleading statements to them in hopes that the analysts would take such information back to the markets and investors would rely on it. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>In re Navarre Corp. Sec. Litig., </em>299 F.3d 735, 743 (8th Cir.2002)). Further, because entanglement is central to fraud allegations, a plaintiff must plead such allegations with particularity and state who supplied the information to the analyst, how the analyst received the information and how the defendant was entangled with or manipulated the information and the analyst. <em>Id.; see also Raab v. Gen. Physics Corp., </em>4 F.3d 286, 288 (4th Cir.1993). Accordingly, the pleadings should: (1) identify the specific forecasts and name the insider who adopted them; (2) point to specific interactions between the insider and the analyst which allegedly gave rise to the entanglement; and (3) state the dates on which the acts which allegedly gave rise to the entanglement occurred.\u201d <em>See id; Southland, </em>365 F.3d at 353, 372; <em>Wool, </em>818 F.2d at 1439.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">In <em>Albert Fadem, </em>Plaintiffs attempted to attribute the forecasts and statements of analysts to the defendants in making out their securities fraud claim. 334 F.Supp.2d at 1027. This Court held that, \u201c[plaintiffs fail to plead the circumstances surrounding the require \u2018entanglement\u2019 theory with sufficient particularity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This Court based its decision, in part, on plaintiffs\u2019 failure to \u201c \u2018point to specific interactions between the insider and the analyst which allegedly gave rise to the entanglement,\u2019 regarding the analyst statement,\u201d explaining that \u201c[generalized statements such as, \u2018[fjollowing conversations with management regarding the Company\u2019s significant growth in wholesale operations,\u2019 are insufficient, as a matter of law, to hold [defendants liable for the analysts opinion.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(internal citations omitted). This Court explained that \u201c[a]ssuming [defendants acted as \u2018conduits,\u2019 if they were unaware of the inaccurate reporting, they cannot be liable for touting [the company\u2019s] success to analysts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">In this case, in addition to the Morgan Stanley and the Dow Jones Reports, Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint presents a number of different analyst and reporter statements regarding Cardinal as fraudulent misstatements for which Cardinal should incur liability. Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 89-90, 93, 99, 101, 114, 120, 122-23, 134, 143, 175, 183, 209-12, 215-16, 218. Though Plaintiffs set forth each statement in detail, like the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number><em>Albert Fadern </em>plaintiffs, they fail to provide specific evidence of \u201centanglement\u201d and do not plead facts showing that the analysts and reporters were \u201caware\u201d of Cardinal\u2019s inaccurate reporting. <em>See </em>334 F.Supp. at 1027. Consequently, this Court agrees that Cardinal Defendants cannot be held liable for the allegedly false and misleading statements of various ana-, lysts and reporters.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">3. Whether the Complaint Fails to Plead Loss Causation as to any of the \u201cImproprieties\u201d Enumerated in the Complaint</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Plaintiffs argue that Cardinal Defendants\u2019 alleged fraud caused Cardinal\u2019s stock to be artificially inflated and that Defendants\u2019 alleged misstatements created Plaintiffs\u2019 false confidence in Cardinal\u2019s performance. Plaintiffs also argue that Cardinal Defendants\u2019 fraud proximately caused their losses because when the Company revealed the truth about its financial struggles and Cardinal\u2019s stock price plummeted, Plaintiffs faced billions of dollars in losses. Cardinal Defendants counter that none of Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations adequately establishes a causal connection between an \u201cact or omission\u201d of any Defendant and the \u201closs for which the Plaintiffs now seek damages,\u201d and Defendants argue that \u201cthis failure is dispositive as to all of Plaintiffs claims.\u201d <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Motion to Dismiss at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">Under \u00a7 78u-4(b)(4) of the PSLRA, private plaintiffs must prove that a defendant\u2019s securities fraud caused their economic loss. In relevant part, the statute provides, \u201c[i]n any private action arising under this chapter, the plaintiff shall have the burden of proving that the act or omission of the defendant alleged to violate this chapter caused the loss for which the plaintiff seeks to recover damages.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(4). For loss causation claims, the Federal Rules require only \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed. Rule Crv. Pro. 8(a)(2). Essentially, a plaintiff needs to allege a drop in stock price; establish a causal connection; and connect the alleged fraud with the ultimate disclosure and loss. <em>See DE &amp; J Ltd. P\u2019ship. v. Conaway, </em>133 Fed.Appx. 994, 998-99 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">The Supreme Court recently interpreted the securities laws\u2019 causation requirement in <em>Dura Pharmals., Inc. v. Broudo, </em>a case determining that the 9th Circuit\u2019s loss causation pleading standard was insufficient under the PSLRA. <em>See </em>544 U.S. 336, 125 S.Ct. 1627, 161 L.Ed.2d 577. In <em>Dura, </em>the plaintiff represented a class of individuals who had bought stock in Dura Pharmaceuticals on the public market between April 15, 1997 and February 24, 1998. <em>Id. </em>at 1629. The plaintiffs alleged that, during that class period, Dura (or its officials) made false statements concerning its profits and prospects for future approval of its products by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). <em>See id. </em>at 1627. On February 24, 1998, Dura disclosed to the market that its earnings would be lower than previously expected (principally due to slow drug sales), and Dura\u2019s stock shares lost almost half of their value, falling from $39 per share to $21 per share. <em>Id. </em>at 1630. Later, in November 1998, Dura announced that the FDA had decided <em>not </em>to approve its new product, prompting a fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>ther drop in the Company\u2019s stock price. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-4\">The <em>Dura </em>plaintiffs argued that, \u201c[i]n reliance on the integrity of the market, [they] ... paid artificially inflated prices for Dura securities and ... suffered damage[s] thereby.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and emphasis omitted). Nonetheless, the Supreme Court concluded that this interpretation of loss causation, if applied, would do more harm than good. <em>Id. </em>at 1631. First, the Court found that \u201cat the moment the transaction takes place,\u201d the plaintiff must have suffered a loss to be able to establish a securities loss causation claim. <em>Id. </em>The most that can be said is that a higher purchase price can <em>sometimes </em>contribute to bringing about a future loss. <em>Id. </em>at 1632. The <em>Dim </em>Court held that a plaintiff cannot satisfy the PSLRA\u2019s loss causation requirement merely by alleging (and later establishing) that the price of the security on the date of the purchase was artificially inflated because of defendant\u2019s misrepresentation. <em>See id. </em>The Court reasoned, \u201c[t]o \u2018touch upon\u2019 a loss is not to <em>cause </em>a loss, and it is the latter that the law requires,\u201d and continued, \u201cit should not prove burdensome for a plaintiff who has suffered an economic loss to provide a defendant with some indication of the loss and causal connection that the plaintiff has in mind. At the same time, allowing a plaintiff to forgo giving any indication of the economic loss and proximate cause that the plaintiff has in mind would bring about\u201d the strike suits the statutes seek to avoid. <em>See Dura, </em>125 S.Ct. at 1632-34 (citing 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(4)).</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Cardinal Defendants aver that Plaintiffs have failed to plead \u201closs causation\u201d under <em>Dura, </em>arguing that Plaintiffs do no more than allege that they relied on an artificially inflated stock price that caused their loss. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Motion to Dismiss at 31-37. They declare that though Plaintiffs set forth a number of allegedly fraudulent misstatements, because they failed to plead facts showing that Cardinal\u2019s subsequent truthful disclosures led to the Company\u2019s falling stock price, they have not established the necessary causal link between the alleged misstatements and the price decrease required by <em>Dura.

Plaintiffs allege a four-year long fraud in which Defendants, increasingly desperate to improve the outlook of Cardinal\u2019s transition from a B + H to an FFS distribution model, overinflated the Company\u2019s stock price by falsely reporting its operating revenues to misrepresent the Company\u2019s progress. Cardinal Defendants note that the Company did not reveal the truth about the Company\u2019s accounting violations until issuing its October 26, 2004 Restatement, <em>after </em>the Class Period had ended. Nonetheless, this Court is convinced that this issue of timing alone is not enough to defeat Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations of loss causation where they have clearly specified causal connections between Cardinal Defendants\u2019 misstatements over the four-year Class Period and their resulting damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">4. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">As established above, the following allegations, taken together, raise the requisite inference of scienter necessary under the PSLRA: (1) Defendants\u2019 alleged accounting improprieties; (2) Defendants\u2019 alleged manipulation of areas of focus; (3) alleged insider sales by Defendants Walter, Fo-tiades, Jensen, Miller, Millar; (4) the Indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>vidual Defendants\u2019 executive compensation packages; (5) and various red flags. Further, the Plaintiffs pled their allegations with the particularity required by the PSLRA. Though the Court also found that Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations regarding Cardinal Defendants\u2019 access to information, Defendant Parrish\u2019s insider sales, and Cardinal Defendants\u2019 efforts to meet analyst expectations do not raise a strong inference of scienter, at this stage of the litigation, Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled their prima facie case of securities fraud, and.to dismiss their Complaint based upon an undeveloped record or the mere possibility of alternative explanations would be premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Hence, the Court GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Cardinal Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss and DENIES the Motions to Dismiss by Defendants Miller and Millar. The Court GRANTS Cardinal Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss as to Defendant Jensen. As Senior Vice President of Audit and Financial Services, Corporate Controller and Principal Accounting Officer for Cardinal from 2003 through 2005, Jensen was employed by Cardinal <em>after </em>the bulk of the alleged accounting fraud occurred. Thus, Jensen was not involved in the alleged accounting allegations upon which Plaintiffs rest their Complaint, and the Court finds it appropriate to GRANT Cardinal Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss as to Defendant Jensen. The Court, however, DENIES the'motion as to Defendants Walter, Fotiades, and Parrish.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">B. Control Person Claims Under Section 20(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">In their Complaint, Plaintiffs also allege claims against the each of the Individual Defendants and Defendant Cardinal for violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t. Section 20(a) imposes secondary liability on those persons who \u201ccontrol\u201d the violators of Sections 10(b). <em>Id; see, e.g. Albert Fadem, </em>334 F.Supp.2d at 1005 (citing <em>Cooperman v. Individual, Inc., </em>171 F.3d 43, 52 (1st Cir.1999)). \u201cControl person\u201d liability, by its nature, is contingent upon a plaintiff being able to prove a primary violation under section 10(b). <em>Id. </em>If plaintiffs do not establish the primary violation, dismissal of them corresponding control person claim would be warranted for that reason alone. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">This Court had concluded that Plaintiffs have, in fact, sufficiently pled securities fraud as to all Cardinal Defendants, except Defendant Jensen. <em>See supra </em>Part <em>IV.II.A.2.a. </em>Plaintiffs also adequately allege that each of the Individual Defendants had direct and supervisory involvement in the day-to-day operations of Cardinal. Moreover, Plaintiffs maintain that, excluding Defendant Jensen, these Individual Defendants were provided with or had unlimited access to copies of the Company\u2019s press releases, public filings, and other statements alleged to be misleading. <em>See supra </em>Part <em>IV.II.AI. </em>In light of these pleadings, the Court determines that Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled a \u00a7 20(a) claim. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, the Court DENIES Cardinal Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 20(a) claims as to Defendants Walter, Fotiades, Miller, Millar, and Parrish. <em>See Firstenergy Corp., </em>316 F.Supp.2d 581; <em>DE &amp; J Ltd., </em>284 F.Supp.2d at 750; <em>Chronimed Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>2002 WL 1016824, *1 (D.Minn. May 16, 2002). Also, finding that Plaintiffs have failed to make out a securities fraud claim against Defendant Jensen,<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> the Court GRANTS Cardinal Defendants\u2019 Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs\u2019 \u00a7 20(a) claims as to Defendant Jensen.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>\n<em>III. Defendant E &amp; Y\u2019s Motion to Dismiss</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">A. Plaintiffs\u2019 Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Unlike their broader allegations against the Cardinal Defendant, Plaintiffs\u2019 claims against E <em>&amp; </em>Y focus on the alleged GAAP violations in Cardinal\u2019s accounting for FY 2002 through FY 2004. Essentially, Plaintiffs contend that, since being hired as Cardinal\u2019s outside auditor in 2002, E <em>&amp; </em>Y consistently performed audits that did not comply with GAAS. Plaintiffs argue that E &amp; Y\u2019s non-compliant audits raise a strong inference that E &amp; Y either knew or recklessly disregarded the fact that Cardinal\u2019s materially misleading financial statements enabled the Company to artificially inflate its stock price. <em>See </em>Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 367-403.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">The same PSLRA pleading standard applicable to the Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 allegations against the Defendants applies to Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations against E <em>&amp; </em>Y. <em>See PR Diamonds, </em>91 Fed.Appx. at 438. However, the meaning of recklessness in securities fraud cases is especially stringent when the claim is brought against an outside auditor. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>SmarTalk, </em>124 F.Supp.2d at 514). Recklessness on the part of an independent auditor entails a mental state \u201cso culpable that it \u2018approximate^] an actual intent to aid in the fraud being perpetrated by the audited company.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fidel, </em>392 F.3d at 227 (citing <em>PR Diamonds, </em>91 Fed.Appx. at 438;) <em>see also, Decker v. Massey-Ferguson, Ltd., </em>681 F.2d 111, 121 (2d Cir.1982); <em>Pegasus Fund, Inc. v. Laraneta, </em>617 F.2d 1335, 1341 (9th Cir.1980) (auditor\u2019s recklessness \u201cmust come closer to being a lesser form of intent (to deceive) than merely a greater degree of ordinary negligence\u201d) (internal quotations omitted)). Scienter \u201crequires more than a misapplication of accounting principles\u201d; the plaintiff must prove \u201cthat the accounting practices were so deficient that the audit amounted to no audit at all, or an egregious refusal to see the obvious, or to investigate the doubtful, or that the accounting judgments which were made were such that no reasonable accountant would have made the same decisions if confronted with the same facts.\u201d <em>PR Diamonds, </em>91 Fed.Appx. at 438 (citing <em>Worlds of Wonder, </em>35 F.3d at 1426 (quoting <em>SEC v. Price Waterhouse, </em>797 F.Supp. 1217, 1240 (S.D.N.Y.1992)).<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">There is no accountanf/client privilege analogous to that accorded to lawyers. <em>See In re Enron, </em>235 F.Supp.2d at 611. In <em>United States v. Arthur Young &amp; Co., </em>the Supreme Court held, \u201c[b]y certifying the public reports that collectively depict a corporation\u2019s financial status, the independent auditor assumes a public responsibility transcending any employment relationship with the client. The independent public accountant performing this special function owes ultimate allegiance to the corporation\u2019s creditors and stockholders, as well as to the investing public.\u201d <em>See </em>465 U.S. 805, 817-18, 104 S.Ct. 1495, 79 L.Ed.2d 826 (1984). \u201cAlthough a major goal of the PSLRA was to limit the exposure of corporations to frivolous strike suits targeting \u2018deep-pocket\u2019 defendants by heightening the pleading standards and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>imposing procedural hoops, in contrast Congress <em>expanded </em>independent public accountants\u2019 watchdog duties.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(citing Harvey L. Pitt, et -al., <em>\u201cPromises Made, Promises Kept: The Practical Implications of the Private Securities Litigation Reform of 1995,\u201d </em>33 San Diego L.Rev. 845, 848-51 (1996)). Thus, under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j \u2014 l\u2014(a)(1), every audit must have \u201cprocedures designed to provide reasonable assurance of detecting illegal acts that would have a direct and material effect on the determination of financial statement amounts[.]\u201d <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>78</em></footnotemark><em> </em>GAAS and GAAP represent the industry standard for measuring the performance of an examination by an accountant. <em>Id.; see also, Escott v.

Arthur Young &amp; Co., </em>590 F.2d 785, 788 n. 2 (9th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">In summary, \u201c[w]hen the standard of recklessness for an auditor is overlaid with the pleading requirements of the PSLRA, a simple rule emerges: to allege that an independent accountant or auditor acted with scienter, the complaint must allege specific facts showing that the deficiencies in the audit were so severe that they strongly suggest that the auditor must have been aware of the corporation\u2019s fraud.\u201d <em>See PR Diamonds, </em>91 Fed.Appx. at 439 (citing <em>SmarTalk, </em>124 F.Supp.2d at 514-15) (citing <em>Hollinger v. Titan Capital Corp., </em>914 F.2d 1564, 1570 (9th Cir.1990) and <em>In re Software Toolworks, Inc., </em>50 F.3d 615, 628 (9th Cir.1994)); <em>see also Decker, </em>681 F.2d at 120-21; <em>McLean v. Alexander, </em>599 F.2d 1190, 1198 (3d Cir.1979) (scienter can be established by a \u201cshowing of shoddy accounting practices amounting at best to a \u2018pretended audit,\u2019 or of grounds supporting a representation \u2018so flimsy as to lead to the conclusion that there was no genuine belief [in] back of it\u2019 \u201d) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Once again, the Court must examine Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations collectively to determine whether the Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, when viewed in totality, create a strong inference of Defendant E &amp; Y\u2019s scienter. <em>See PR Diamonds, </em>91 Fed.Appx. at 439 (citing <em>Telxon, </em>133 F.Supp.2d at 1026). Plaintiffs\u2019 relevant allegations are that Defendant E &amp; Y: (1) ignored numerous red flags that should have alerted E &amp; Y that Cardinal\u2019s financial statements were materially false and misleading; (2) ignored the audit evidence it gathered from FY 2002 through FY 2004 that suggested Cardinal had consistently overstated its earnings; (3) conducted audits of Cardinal that violated fundamental concepts of GAAS; (4) were motivated to help Cardinal commit fraud in order to maintain the Company\u2019s high-profit business; and (5) were subject to numerous other lawsuits from its audits of companies later found to have engaged in financial fraud. Finally, the class members contend that these allegations, even if insufficient alone, when viewed in their entirety, establish that E &amp; Y acted with scienter.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> The Court addresses these allegations in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>1. Red Flags</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The class members point to a number of red flags that they should have alerted E &amp; Y to likely improprieties at Cardinal and conveyed the need for it to engage in a more exacting audit of the Company\u2019s books. A red flag creating a strong inference of scienter consists of \u201c[a]n egregious refusal to see the obvious, or to investigate the doubtful.\u201d <em>PR Diamonds, </em>91 Fed.Appx. at 440 (citing <em>Novak v. Kasaks, </em>216 F.3d 300, 308 (2d Cir.2000) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). Plaintiffs\u2019 allege the following red flags: (1) Cardinal\u2019s managements\u2019 disdain for effective internal controls; (2) the rapidly changing market for pharmaceutical distributors; (3) the inability to convert manufacturers to the FFS model over the course of the Class Period; (4) a practice by management of committing to unduly aggressive targets; (5) massive insider trading and incentive-based compensation; (6) numerous accounting errors and irregularities; and (7) E &amp; Y\u2019s non-audit related work. <em>See </em>Complaint \u00b6 387; Pl.\u2019s Opposition at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">In <em>Fidel, </em>plaintiff, class members, sued Fruit of the Loom (FOTL), individual officers of FOTL, and E &amp; Y, FOTL\u2019s outside auditor, for securities fraud, and when the district court granted E &amp; Y\u2019s motion to dismiss, the plaintiffs appealed. <em>See </em>392 F.3d at 220. In their appeal, plaintiffs pointed to \u201cnumerous \u2018red flags\u2019 that should have placed [E <em>&amp; </em>Y] on notice about financial improprieties occurring at [FOTL].\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 228. Among other things, plaintiffs alleged the following red flags: (1) because E <em>&amp; </em>Y worked closely with FOTL as both an auditor and an outside consultant, it maintained a presence at FOTL\u2019s headquarters, and was, therefore, well aware of FOTL\u2019s problems; (2) E &amp; Y, knew of a securities fraud lawsuit filed against FOTL before it had completed its final audit report; (3) E &amp; Y had firsthand knowledge of FOTL\u2019s propensity to \u201cskirt financial rules\u201d; (4) E &amp; Y received an anonymous letter detailing some of FOTL\u2019s financial misstatements; (5) E &amp; Y had noted in 1996 audit papers that FOTL \u201cdemonstrated a trend of significant book to physical losses\u201d over the previous years; (6) E &amp; Y\u2019s 1996 audit report revealed that FOTL\u2019s reserve for close-out inventory was understated by 30 percent; and (7) FOTL and its management demonstrated numerous risk factors that should have led E &amp; Y to add audit procedures to evaluate these risks. <em>See id. </em>at 228-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">In the case sub judice, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are nearly identical to those of the plaintiffs\u2019 in <em>Fidel. </em>The <em>Fidel </em>court found that the above red flags \u201c[did] not create the inference, much less a strong inference, that [E <em>&amp; </em>Y], in preparing an audit report of 1998 financial results, acted with scienter\u201d. <em>Id. </em>at 229; <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78u-4(b)(2) (requiring facts \u201cgiving rise to a strong inference that the defendant acted with the required state of mind\u201d).<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>As such, where these red flags were insufficient to establish E &amp; Y\u2019s scienter in <em>Fidel, </em>they are insufficient here as well. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>81</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">Further, in <em>Fidel, </em>the Sixth Circuit found that the fact that E &amp; Y served as a consultant to FOTL and had access to \u201cboth confidential documents and upper- and lower-level management\u201d did not, without more, lend credence to plaintiffs\u2019 allegation that E &amp; Y acted with scienter. <em>See </em>392 F.3d at 229; <em>see PR Diamonds v. Chandler, </em>36 671, 694 (6th Cir.2004) (finding that plaintiffs\u2019 claims that defendant accounting firm had personnel who were regularly present at defendant company\u2019s corporate headquarters throughout the class period with continual access to the company\u2019s confidential business information was <em>not </em>sufficiently concrete to raise a strong inference of scienter). Though the court in <em>Fidel </em>acknowledged that \u201cthe more an auditor is intertwined with a company\u2019s business, the \u2018more support an inference of scienter takes on,\u2019 \u201d it found plaintiffs\u2019 claims \u201cinsufficiently concrete\u201d because \u201cnowhere [did] the class members allege what [E &amp; Y] might have learned from its access to the company\u2019s confidential information, what [E &amp; Y] might have known based on its consulting engagement, of even what documents [E &amp; Y] reviewed as part of its \u2018unfettered access.\u2019 \u201d <em>See </em>392 F.3d at 229-30. In this case, Plaintiffs allege that the fact that E &amp; Y received a large percentage of its total fees for its non-audit work with Cardinal is evidence that E &amp; Y had to have knowledge of Cardinal\u2019s fraud.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> As in <em>Fidel, </em>this claim, without more, does not imply E <em>&amp; </em>Y\u2019s scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">Against the backdrop of <em>Fidel, </em>the class members in this case have not pled with the requisite particularity any facts showing that E &amp; Y knew of or recklessly disregarded these red flags in conducting its audit. Because \u201cclaims of securities fraud cannot rest \u2018on speculation and con-clusory allegations\u2019 \u201d alone, Plaintiffs\u2019 alleged red flags do not create an inference that E <em>&amp; </em>Y acted with scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">2. Ignoring Audit Evidence Gathered from FY 2002 through FY 2004<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">The Plaintiffs also contend that by consistently ignoring GAAS principles while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>auditing Cardinal\u2019s financial statements, E <em>&amp; </em>Y failed to detect Cardinal\u2019s GAAP violations, which were so simple, obvious, and large in magnitude<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> that, together, they support a strong inference of E <em>&amp; </em>Y\u2019s scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Plaintiffs argue that Cardinal engaged in the following acts of fraudulent accounting, which E &amp; Y ignored: (1) the mis-classification of bulk deliveries as operating revenue in FY 2001 through FY 2003; (2) the premature recognition of $22 million gained in the Vitamin Litigation settlement in FY 2002; (3) the decision to change Cardinal\u2019s revenue recognition policy for its Pyxis business in FY 2002; (4) balance sheet reserve and accrual adjustments in Cardinal\u2019s 2004 10-K; (5) as announced in Cardinal\u2019s 2004 10-K, the decision to change the Company\u2019s method of accounting for cash discounts received from vendors for prompt payment; (6) the mis-classification of an unidentified amount of expenses as \u201cspecial charges\u201d related to mergers and acquisitions to understate Cardinal\u2019s regular expenses; (7) improper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>off-balance sheet transactions through improperly classifying Pyxis receivables; and (8) Cardinal\u2019s October 2004 Restatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">a. Cardinal\u2019s Classification of Operating Revenue</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Plaintiffs attack the method Cardinal used to differentiate between its high-margin Operating Revenues and its low-margin Bulk Deliveries \u2014 the 24-hour rule \u2014 in its FY 2002 and FY 2003 statements. Plaintiffs argue that Cardinal should have applied the classification guidelines it adopted in the FY 2004 Restatement during the Class Period, and they claim that Cardinal\u2019s failure to do so caused it to significantly overstate its \u201cOperating Revenue,\u201d giving investors a false impression of the success of the Company\u2019s growth in the face of the shifting pharmaceutical distribution market. Thus, Plaintiffs contend that the fact that Defendant E &amp; Y failed to discover Cardinal\u2019s \u201cmis-classifications\u201d of revenue in its FY 2002 and FY 2003 audits raises an inference of Defendant E &amp; Y\u2019s scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">First, though Plaintiffs argue that Cardinal\u2019s internal bulk order policy did not comply with GAAP, this Court is not convinced that the \u201c24-hour rule\u201d violates fundamental principles of accounting. Plaintiffs cite various pronouncements<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> which they argue tend to show Cardinal\u2019s recklessly or intentionally inaccurate reporting of \u201cOperating Revenue\u201d in violation of the SEC\u2019s assertions that financial reporting should be both \u201caccurate\u201d and \u201creliable.\u201d As Defendant E <em>&amp; </em>Y correctly notes, however, these authorities do not provide guid-<em>ame </em>as to how sales from bulk deliveries should be distinguished from operating revenues, if at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">Further, from FY 1998, when Cardinal began separating its revenues into two different line items, to FY 2004, when Cardinal issued its Restatement, classifying all revenue as a single line item, Cardinal was at all times forthcoming about its treatment of \u201cBulk Deliveries\u201d and \u201cOperating Revenues.\u201d Hence, it was Defendant Cardinal\u2019s use of the \u201c24-hour rule\u201d to manipulate the sales classifying as high-margin \u201cOperating Revenue\u201d that led to investors\u2019 false confidence in the Company\u2019s growth, not the fact that the 24-hour rule violated GAAP in and of itself. The facts alleged do not show that E <em>&amp; </em>Y could have known that the Company\u2019s use of the 24-hour rule during FY 2002 and FY 2003 had artificially inflated Cardinal\u2019s \u201cOperating Revenue.\u201d Moreover, though Plaintiffs correctly argue that Cardinal\u2019s later restated mis-classifications of revenue provides evidence of the <em>Cardinal </em>Defendants\u2019 scienter, a claim based on \u201calleged accounting irregularities fails to raise a strong inference of scienter if it alleges no facts to show that Defendants[, <em>outside </em>auditors,] knew or could have known of the errors, or that their regular accounting procedures should have alerted them to the errors sooner than they actually did.\u201d <em>Fidel, </em>392 F.3d at 230 (emphasis added),</p>\n<p id=\"AMZ\">b. Premature Recognition of the Vitamin Litigation Settlement</p>\n<p id=\"b808-10\">Plaintiffs assert that Cardinal\u2019s premature recognition of $22 million in settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>ment proceeds from the Vitamin Litigation violated GAAP. Among other things, Plaintiffs allege that GAAP requires that \u201cContingencies that might result in gains usually are not reflected in the accounts since to do so might be to recognize revenue prior to its realization.\u201d <em>See </em>Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5 Accounting for Contingencies (March, 1975). As such, they argue that Defendant E <em>&amp; </em>Y\u2019s FY 2002 and FY 2003 audits of Cardinal\u2019s financial statements should have caught such a blatant error, and that, therefore, E <em>&amp; </em>Y acted with scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Defendant E &amp; Y counters that Plaintiffs have not alleged any basis for their assertion that E &amp; Y acted with scienter. Defendant argues that even assuming the timing of Cardinal\u2019s original recognition of the $22 million in revenue violated GAAP, one GAAP violation alone, does not give rise to an inference that E <em>&amp; </em>Y knew that its certification of Cardinal\u2019s financial statements (which had already been approved by AA) violated GAAP. Further, they argue that though Plaintiffs rely upon various GAAP rules to show that a company should not recognize a substantial gain until it can be <em>certain </em>that that particular gain will be realized, Cardinal had considered the $22 million in proceeds to be a virtual certainty.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> Finally, Defendant E &amp; Y argues that the fact that Cardinal had fully explained its accounting treatment of the $22 million in its SEC filings, undermines Plaintiffs\u2019 fraud allegations.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> <em>See Ziemba v. Cascade Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>256 F.3d 1194, 1210 (11th Cir.2001) (finding that whether it was right or wrong, full explanation of accounting treatment \u201csignificantly undermine[s] any hint of fraud\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-9\">The GAAP rules are designed to ensure that public companies, like Cardinal, are truthful in their financial statements, only recognizing income that they are certain to obtain. In that vein, Cardinal\u2019s premature recording of the $22 million can be considered a significant breach of GAAP principles. Nonetheless, it is uncontroverted that Cardinal was at all times truthful about its treatment of the Vitamin Litigation settlement. Moreover, once <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>article had revealed Cardinal\u2019s methods of accounting to the public, Cardinal further explained its reason for treating the settlement proceeds as it did. In addition to Cardinal\u2019s thorough explanations defending the Company\u2019s accounting procedures, Plaintiffs have pled no facts alleging that E &amp; Y certified Cardinal\u2019s financial statements <em>knowing </em>or <em>recklessly disregarding </em>the fact that they were fraught with glaring errors. Therefore, E <em>&amp; </em>Y\u2019s certification of Cardinal\u2019s premature income recognition does not create a strong inference of E <em>&amp; </em>Y\u2019s scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>c. Changes in Cardinal\u2019s Revenue Recognition Policy for its Pyxis Business in FY 2002</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Cardinal\u2019s Automation and Information Services segment offers a mix of products and services for use by hospitals and other health care facilities. It develops, manufactures, leases, sells and services point-of-use systems that automate the distribution and management of medications and supplies. This segment includes Pyxis Corporation (\u201cPyxis\u201d) which leases point-of-use systems that automate the distribution management and control of medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Beginning in FY 2002, Cardinal changed its revenue recognition for Pyxis so that revenue would not be recognized until <em>all </em>of the Company\u2019s installation obligations were complete, the equipmeht was functioning properly, and the customer had accepted it. In the course of its Audit Committee\u2019s internal investigation, however, Cardinal discovered that customers had sometimes been persuaded by Pyxis salespeople to execute equipment confirmations before the equipment had been fully installed.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">In its 2004 10-K, Cardinal acknowledged that certain revenue from the sale of Pyxis machines had been prematurely recognized during the Class Period. The Company was unable to determine precisely how much revenue it had prematurely recognized from improper customer confirmations, but it estimated that in FY 2002, $8.3 million of revenue should have been deterred to a later period, resulting in $5.3 million of operating earnings, and that in FY 2003, the total estimated revenue impact was $1.3 million of revenue and $800,000 of operating earnings.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">Plaintiffs argue that the fact that Cardinal had prematurely recognized its Pyxis revenue supports their assertion that Defendant E <em>&amp; </em>Y acted with scienter. They aver that, if it had correctly performed its duties, E &amp; Y would have undoubtedly discovered Cardinal's fraudulent treatment of Pyxis revenues. Defendants, however, counter that Plaintiffs fail to plead any allegations explaining how E &amp; Y would have become aware of any manipulation. Defendants argue that if E &amp; Y had reviewed the improper Pyxis transactions, it would have seen that there were third-party confirmations that the company\u2019s installation was complete, and, therefore, that E &amp; Y would have not had a reason to question Pyxis\u2019 decision to recognize revenue when it did. <em>See </em>SAS No. 99, <em>Consideration of Fraud in Financial Statement Audit </em>(2002) (stating that collusion \u201csuch as a false confirmation from a third party that is in collusion with management,\u201d may cause an \u201cauditor who has properly performed the audit\u201d to conclude that there is persuasive evidence that a particular transaction was properly recorded when, in fact, it was not). Because E &amp; Y\u2019s review of Cardinal\u2019s treatment of Pyxis revenues would not, on its face, have revealed any accounting misconduct on the part of Cardinal, Plaintiff have failed to plead facts showing that E <em>&amp; </em>Y had scien-ter in certifying Pyxis\u2019 premature revenue recognition.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">d. Balance Sheet Reserves and Accrual Adjustments</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">In its 2004 10-K, Cardinal restated the Company\u2019s balance sheet reserves and accrual adjustments. Cardinal Defendants acknowledged that in connection with the Company\u2019s balance sheet reserves and accrual adjustments, there were various situations prior to and throughout the Class Period in which Cardinal could not substantiate either the amount of its reserves or the timing of its reserve adjustments. In the end, Cardinal\u2019s restatement due to these various reserve and accrual adjustments decreased the Company\u2019s reported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>net income for FY 2000 through 3Q 2004 by $64.2 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">Plaintiffs allege that E &amp; Y was reckless in not discovering the above GAAP errors that were later identified and corrected by Cardinal in its October 2004 Restatement. Defendants respond that Plaintiffs fail to allege how E &amp; Y could have known of the existence of these \u201crelatively minor errors\u201d during the course of the firm\u2019s audit work. Essentially, Defendants allege that the magnitude of these items was so small that E &amp; Y\u2019s failure to discover them does not give rise to a strong inference of scienter. First, they allege that because the 2004 Restatement revealed that Cardinal\u2019s 2002 net earnings had been <em>understated </em>by $14.5 million, these net earnings could not provide a basis for Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that they had been defrauded by artificially <em>inflated </em>financial statements. Second, they argue that, in 2003, the restatement caused a relatively small impact on Cardinal\u2019s net earnings, making a 2.2% drop from $1.405 billion to $1.375 billion.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">\u201c[T]he magnitude of an erroneous financial statement caused by allegedly fraudulent representations, without more, cannot sustain a finding that an auditor acted with scienter.\u201d <em>See SCB Computer Tech., </em>149 F.Supp.2d at 357. In <em>Fidel, </em>the Sixth Circuit held, \u201c[w]e decline to follow the cases that hold that the magnitude of financial fraud contributes to an inference of scienter on the part of the defendant.\u201d 392 F.3d at 231; <em>see SCB Computer Tech., </em>149 F.Supp.2d at 359 (emphasis added). The <em>Fidel </em>Court explained, \u201c[inferring scienter from the magnitude of fraud invites a court to speculate as to the existence of specific (but unpled and unidentified) warning signs that show the accountant acted with scien-ter. To travel from magnitude of fraud to evidence of scienter, the court must blend hindsight, speculation and conjecture to forge a tenuous chain of inferences ...\u201d 392 F.3d at 231 (citing <em>Reiger, </em>117 F.Supp.2d at 1013). Consequently, as Plaintiffs\u2019 claims as to Cardinal\u2019s balance sheet reserves and accrual adjustments focus on nothing but the numbers, the Court finds that they are insufficient to raise a strong inference of E &amp; Y\u2019s scien-ter.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">e. Recognition of Cash Discounts</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">In prior reporting periods, Cardinal treated cash discounts received from vendors for prompt payment as a reduction of the cost of the products sold, recognizing the discount immediately.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> Beginning in FY 2004, however, Cardinal announced that it had decided to change its classification of these cash discounts, to treat them as components of inventory cost, rather than as reductions in the cost of products sold. Thus, Cardinal was able to postpone its recognition of the discount until the Company <em>actually sold </em>the associated products.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">Cardinal did not retroactively restate its financials prior to FY 2004 because it believed that it had simply switched from \u201cone acceptable accounting method\u201d to another, more preferable, but also acceptable, method. E &amp; Y concurred in Cardinal\u2019s judgment, providing a letter that was attached as an exhibit to Cardinal\u2019s 10-K that agreed that Cardinal had changed \u201cto an acceptable alternative method, which, based on [Cardinal\u2019s] business judgment to make this change and for the stated reason [in the 10-K, was] preferable\u201d in Cardinal\u2019s circumstances. Plaintiffs allege <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>that Cardinal should have used this different method of recognizing cash discounts all along, and that its failure to do so constituted a GAAP violation. Plaintiffs assert that E &amp; Y should have, through the auditing process, realized that Cardinal needed to change its method of recognizing these cash discounts and prevented a GAAP violation before it might occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">The Court, however, finds that Plaintiffs have failed to allege that Cardinal\u2019s old method violated GAAP, and, even if it did, that Plaintiffs have inadequately alleged that E &amp; Y <em>knowingly </em>certified a Cardinal GAAP violation. The Supreme Court has acknowledged that accounting rules are subject to a range of reasonable judgments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-5\">Accountants have long recognized that [GAAP] are far from being a canonical set of rules that will ensure identical accounting treatment of identical transactions. [GAAP] rather, tolerate a range of reasonable treatments, leaving the choice among alternatives to management. As a result, \u201can ethical, reasonably diligent accountant may choose to apply any of a variety of acceptable accounting procedures\u201d when that accountant prepares a financial statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-6\"><em>Godchaux v. Conveying Techniques, Inc., </em>846 F.2d 306, 315 (5th Cir.1988) (citing <em>Thor Power Tool Co. v. Comm\u2019r, </em>439 U.S. 522, 544, 99 S.Ct. 773, 58 L.Ed.2d 785 (1979) (internal citations omitted)); <em>see also In re K-tel Int\u2019l, Inc. Sec. Litig., </em>300 F.3d 881, 890 (9th Cir.2001) (noting that there are \u201c19 different GAAP sources, any number of which might present conflicting treatments of a particular accounting question\u201d). An important corollary to the foregoing principle is that changes in a company\u2019s method of accounting do <em>not </em>constitute an admission that the company had violated GAAP in the past. <em>See </em>Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 20 (\u201cAPB\u201d) \u00b6\u00b6 7, 8 (stating that \u201c[a] change in accounting principle results from adoption of a generally accepted accounting principle different from the one used previously for reporting purposes\u201d and explains that \u201c[a] characteristic of a change in accounting principle is that it concerns a choice among two or more generally accepted accounting principles.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">The Court further finds that Plaintiffs have failed to cite accounting literature, which suggests that Cardinal should have restated its recognition of cash discounts before FY 2004. The Court finds that even if Plaintiffs had properly alleged a GAAP violation, they do not set forth any facts suggesting that E &amp; Y could have known the accounting treatment was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">f. Special Charges</p>\n<p id=\"b812-11\">In FY 2001 and FY 2002, Cardinal recorded \u201cspecial charges\u201d of $149.9 million and $141.4 million respectively for merger-related and restructuring costs. Plaintiffs argue that Cardinal inflated its \u201cspecial charges\u201d<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> to enable the Company to understate its normal recurring expenses ei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>ther in the same quarters Cardinal overstated its special charges, or in subsequent quarters, thereby reporting inflated Operating Earnings. In support of its Complaint about these \u201cspecial charges,\u201d Plaintiffs cite: (1) a 1998 speech made by the SEC\u2019s Chairman explaining how merger and restructuring services could be abused,<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> and (2) a 2003 analyst report observing that restructuring charges are \u201cclearly a factor\u201d in analyzing a company as \u201cacquisitive as Cardinal Health had been in recent years\u201d and suggesting that \u201cthis needs to be monitored closely.\u201d<footnotemark>91</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Plaintiffs posit that, consequently, since 1996, Cardinal \u201chas taken \u2018special\u2019 charges for activities that are similar in nature and thereby does not meet the definition of \u2018unusual in nature\u2019 and \u2018infrequency in occurrence\u2019 \u201d under APB No. 30, \u00b6\u00b6 21-22. Plaintiffs contend that \u201cspecial charges also create a serious potential for abuse by permitting a company to manipulate its financial statements by shifting \u2018normal\u2019 operating expenses that otherwise would have been recorded in future periods into the current period.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Opposition at 29.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> They argue that Cardinal\u2019s financials strongly indicate \u201cthat Cardinal improperly overstated its special charges in order to understate its normal recurring charges either in the same quarter that Cardinal overstated its special charges or in subsequent quarters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30. Defendant E &amp; Y retorts, and the Court agrees, that Plaintiffs\u2019 broad allegations do not rise to the necessary of level specificity required by the PSLRA. Essentially, Plaintiffs have provided no facts that show that E &amp; Y knew that these special charges were Cardinal\u2019s efforts at fraudulent \u201cbig bath\u201d accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>g. Off-Balance Sheet Transactions</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">Plaintiffs also argue that during the Class Period, the Cardinal Defendants irii-properly accounted for a securitization<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> of the Company\u2019s Pyxis receivables in IQ 2002 as an off-balance sheet transaction, causing Cardinal\u2019s account receivables and its outstanding debt to be understated in violation of GAAP. Plaintiffs contend that in connection with the change in revenue recognition related to Pyxis, Cardinal Defendants engaged in a securitization transaction in FY 2002 involving its sale-lease portfolio that does not qualify as a \u201ctrue sale\u201d under SFAS standards. <em>See supra </em>note 94. Plaintiffs argue that to sell Pyxis receivables, Cardinal created a wholly-owned special purpose vehicle (\u201cSPV\u201d), Pyxis Funding LLC and that through that SPV, Cardinal sold approximately $150 million in Pyxis sales-type lease receivables during IQ 2002, all of which were sold <em>with </em>recourse,<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> Plaintiffs allege that because the risk of non-collection remained with Cardinal, in the form of Pyxis Funding LLP (a Cardinal subsidiary), proper conservative accounting treatment required Cardinal to treat the transaction as a \u201csecured borrowing,\u201d accounting for it on the Company\u2019s balance sheet. Plaintiffs aver that Cardinal\u2019s accounting for the sale of the Pyxis receivables as an off-balance sheet transaction, Defendant Cardinal violated GAAP, and understated the Company\u2019s accounts receivables and outstanding debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">Defendant E &amp; Y contends that Plaintiffs fail to plead facts showing that E <em>&amp; </em>Y should be liable for the understated receivables related to Cardinal\u2019s Pyxis subsidiary. E &amp; Y asserts that, \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations fail to demonstrate that Cardinal should have treated the securitization of the Pyxis receivables as a loan instead of a sale\u201d because they \u201coffer no factual basis for their allegation that the transaction was not reported in accordance with GAAP\u201d, and because in notes to its FY 2002 statements, Cardinal provided investors with a lengthy explanation of its Pyxis securitization program that does <em>not </em>suggest purchasers had general rights of recourse against Pyxis Funding LLC. Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>dant E &amp; Y also avers that Plaintiffs failed to cite any authority for the proposition that \u201ca very limited right of recourse\u201d would somehow preclude Defendant Cardinal from treating the sale of its Pyxis receivables to a third-party investor as a \u201ctrue-sale.\u201d Moreover, Defendant E &amp; Y counters that, even if the Court should find a GAAP violation occurred, there was no basis \u201cfor any claim that investors were materially misled by the way in which the securitization was accounted for,\u201d and Plaintiffs failed to allege that Company\u2019s 2002 10-K explanation was materially misleading. Finally, Defendant E &amp; Y argues that Plaintiffs\u2019 efforts to classify Cardinal\u2019s financial statements as \u201cEnron-style generalizations\u201d do not raise an inference of scienter <em>in this case.</em><footnotemark><em>95</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations resemble those made by the lead plaintiffs in the landmark <em>Enron </em>litigation. <em>See </em>235 F.Supp.2d at 618-19. In that case, one of plaintiffs\u2019 many allegations against Enron\u2019s independent auditor, AA, was that by viewing certain transfers of financial assets among its subsidiaries as \u201ctrue sales\u201d instead of as \u201csecured borrowings,\u201d AA recklessly allowed Enron to violate GAAP, SFAS No. 125,<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguish-ments of Liabilities. <em>See id. </em>The plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged that, as part of a larger pattern of fraud, Enron repetitively engaged in \u201chedging transactions\u201d that gave the appearance that a third party was obligated to pay Enron the amount of large losses from its trading investments when, in actuality, the third party was an entity in which Enron had a \u201csubstantial economic stake.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 622. The <em>Enron </em>court found that AA\u2019s complicity in Enron\u2019s unscrupulous off-balance sheet transactions was indeed reason to find AA liable for securities fraud under Section 10(b). <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">In this case, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations concerning Cardinal\u2019s sales of Pyxis receivables do not rise to the level of specificity of those in <em>Enron. </em>235 F.Supp.2d at 673-86. The Court concludes with Defendant E &amp; Y that Plaintiffs failed to explain adequately how the mislabeling of Pyxis receivables was materially misleading and fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">h. Cardinal\u2019s October 2004 Restatement</p>\n<p id=\"b815-14\">Finally, Plaintiffs allege that, by issuing an October 2004 Restatement of their FY 2002, and 2003 financials, Cardinal conceded that its accounting was materially false and misleading. <em>See </em>Pl.\u2019s Opposition at 13. Plaintiffs opine, that Cardinal\u2019s Oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>tober 2004 Restatement was meant for the \u201ccorrection of [ ] error[s] in previously issued financial statements,\u201d and that \u201c[b]e-cause restatements dilute investors\u2019 confidence in a company\u2019s financial statements and make it difficult to compare financial statements, GAAP allows restatements <em>only </em>in limited circumstances.\u201d <em>See </em>APB No. 20, \u00b6\u00b6 7-13, 14 (defining errors as \u201cmathematical mistakes, mistakes in the application of accounting principles, or oversight or misuse of facts that existed at the time the financial statements were prepared\u201d). Plaintiffs rely on <em>Firstenergy </em>for the proposition that the need for a restatement can demonstrate the falsity of a company\u2019s previous statement. <em>See </em>316 F.Supp.2d at 594-95 (\u201csince the purpose of a restatement is to correct an error in a previously-issued financial statement ... by definition then, a restatement says that the prior financial statement was false\u201d); <em>see SmarTalk, </em>124 F.Supp.2d at 505 (assuming that GAAP violations were evidence of the falsity of defendant company\u2019s past financial statements). Accordingly, Plaintiffs aver that Cardinal Defendants\u2019 October Restatement amounts to \u201can admission that facts existed at the time the financial statements were prepared that indicated the financial statements were false.\u201d Pl.\u2019s Opposition at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">Defendant E &amp; Y counters that, despite Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations, Cardinal\u2019s October Restatement <em>never </em>conceded that the classification standards Cardinal used in FY 2002 and 2003 to distinguish between operating revenue and bulk revenue were materially improper. <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Reply at 5. Furthermore, Defendant E &amp; Y contends that \u201cthere is no GAAP guidance alleged-nor does any exist \u2014 the <em>prohibits </em>a company from restating if it chooses to do so to correct even immaterial errors.\u201d <em>See </em>Def.\u2019s Reply at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">Whether there is such a GAAP guidance, the Court agrees with Defendant E &amp; Y that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims as to the 2004 Restatement fail to infer scienter because, in their Opposition Motion, Plaintiffs do not \u201crespond to E &amp; Y\u2019s argument that they have failed to allege any factual basis for inferring that E &amp; Y was aware, at the time it issued its audit opinions, that Cardinal\u2019s FY 2002 and FY 2003 financial statements contained material errors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As Plaintiffs have not pled sufficient facts suggesting that Cardinal\u2019s alleged errors were discovered during the course of the 2004 investigation, came to E &amp; Y\u2019s attention during the course of its FY 2002 or 2003 audits, or were so obviously material that it was reckless for E &amp; Y to issue an unqualified opinion unless those errors were corrected, Cardinal\u2019s October 2004 Restatement does <em>not </em>imply that Defendant E &amp; Y acted with scienter.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">Plaintiffs acknowledge that the above accounting issues may not, on their own, establish a strong inference of E <em>&amp; </em>Y\u2019s scienter. Nevertheless, they argue that the fact that E &amp; Y certified Cardinal\u2019s FY 2002 and FY 2003<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> financial statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>despite the clear evidence of the totality of the above accounting errors, raises an inference of scienter. Nonetheless, this Court finds that as Plaintiffs have failed to allege E &amp; Y\u2019s scienter as to any of these alleged mistakes <em>individually, </em>their allegations must also fail when considered in their totality.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">3. Alleged Non-Compliance with GAAS Principles<footnotemark>98</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Next, Plaintiffs contend that E &amp; Y made false and misleading statements by representing that it performed its audits in a manner consistent with GAAS. In support of this claim, Plaintiffs note that for its FY 2002 and FY 2003 audits of Cardinal, E &amp; Y had represented that the Company\u2019s financial statements were fair and accurate and comported with GAAP when in fact, they were riddled with red flags. Plaintiffs allege that E &amp; Y\u2019s failure to \u201cadequately perform its audit procedures to identify [Cardinal\u2019s] improprieties,\u201d enabled those improprieties to continue over a period of four years, leading to inaccurate financial statements, and, eventually, a rapidly dropping stock price. Plaintiffs specifically allege that E <em>&amp; </em>Y failed to adhere to a number of specific GAAS principles, listing and describing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>each of those principles.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> The Court has determined, however, that Plaintiffs have done no more than list these GAAS standards, failing to specify, who, where, when, or how E &amp; Y actually violated them. <em>See Telxon, </em>133 F.Supp.2d at 1025 (quoting <em>DiLeo, </em>901 F.2d at 627) (noting that these elements are crucial to a plaintiffs pleading). To that end, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations are no more than a feeble attempt to convert vaguely pled GAAS violations into evidence of E &amp; Y\u2019s scienter. Such broad allegations are not enough. <em>See SmarTalk, </em>124 F.Supp.2d at 518. (\u201cAt most, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations amount to a speculative attempt to connect generally stated GAAS violations with information discovered after the fact, in an attempt to create the appearance of recklessness. This attempt fails.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">4. E &amp; Y\u2019s Motivation to Keep Cardinal\u2019s Business</p>\n<p id=\"ADj\">Plaintiffs also allege that E &amp; Y committed fraud in order to maintain its lucrative Cardinal account. Though Plaintiffs have established Cardinal was clearly a profitable client for E &amp; Y, such claims have failed in the past. <em>See Fidel, </em>392 F.3d at 232. In <em>Fidel, </em>plaintiffs alleged that E &amp; Y reaped \u201csignificant fees from its relationship with [FOTL] that it did not want to jeopardize by calling attention to [FOTL\u2019s] poor financial condition.\u201d <em>See id. </em>The Sixth Circuit, however, disagreed, holding that \u201callegations that the auditor earned and wished to continue earning fees from a client do not raise an inference that the auditor acted with the requisite scienter.\u201d <em>See id. </em>In this case, Plaintiffs allege that because Cardinal was one of E &amp; Y\u2019s most lucrative accounts, paying E &amp; Y $13.3 million for FY 2004 alone, E &amp; Y ignored Cardinal\u2019s GAAP violations so it could continue to receive Cardinal\u2019s business. According to <em>Fidel, </em>however, \u201csuch claims [only] set forth a motive for the auditor to have engaged in fraud\u201d and, as a matter of law, \u201cbare allegations of motive\u201d are insufficient to imply scienter. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">5. Other Fraud Claims Brought Against E &amp; Y</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">Finally, Plaintiffs allege that the fact that E &amp; Y has been \u201csanctioned in administrative proceedings before the SEC\u201d for failing to comply with auditor independence rules and improper professional conduct in the past, [makes it] more likely that E &amp; Y had scienter in this case. Complaint \u00b6 399-400.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark> Plaintiffs claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>that E &amp; Y\u2019s past scandals are \u201cpertinent to show\u201d, under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b), the knowledge and absence of mistake on E &amp; Y\u2019s part. Plaintiffs also claim that the fact that \u201cfew accounting firms have been implicated in as many public company financial scandals as E &amp; Y,\u201d is evidence of the firm\u2019s efforts to \u201cconsciously circumvent the rules and procedures required of public accountants,\u201d creating what Plaintiffs\u2019 allege is a \u201cfirm-wide culture of client accommodation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">The Court finds that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims regarding E &amp; Y\u2019s \u201cpattern of bad behavior\u201d do not create an inference of scienter. In <em>Fidel, </em>the court noted that plaintiffs relied on settlements that E <em>&amp; Y </em>had made in a case arising from its audits of Cendant Corporation as evidence that it had engaged in fraud while auditing the financial statements of FOTL. 392 F.3d at 233.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> The <em>Fidel </em>court rejected this claim, finding that other lawsuits or settlements \u201care not probative of whether [E <em>&amp; </em>Y] acted knowingly or recklessly in preparing its audit report of [FOTL]\u201d and that such allegations \u201csimply do not create the strong inference required under the PSLRA to show that [E <em>&amp; </em>Y] acted with the required state of mind during its review of FOTL\u2019s financial records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, in this case, where Plaintiffs cite a number of different cases in which E &amp; Y faced shareholder derivative suits for securities fraud, these cases do not amount to a showing that E &amp; Y knowingly or recklessly prepared a fraudulent audit report for Cardinal.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">6. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">Plaintiffs rest on nothing more than broad conclusory allegations to assert that E &amp; Y acted with scienter in preparing its audit reports. In <em>Fidel, </em>the Sixth Circuit explained that such vague allegations, even when viewed in their totality, \u201cdo not create the inference, much less a <em>strong </em>inference, that [an auditor] acted with the required state of mind.\u201d <em>See </em>392 F.3d at 234 (emphasis added). Therefore, as in <em>Fidel, </em>in this case, this Court concludes that, in their totality, Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations do not raise a strong inference that E &amp; Y acted with scienter in recklessly or knowingly affirming Cardinal\u2019s fraudulent accounting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>for FY 2002 and FY 2003. <em>City of Monroe, </em>399 F.3d at 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Because Plaintiffs\u2019 claims do not create a strong inference of Defendant E &amp; Y\u2019s scienter, Plaintiffs cannot establish all the elements of their Section 10(b) prima facie case. Thus, the Court GRANTS Defendant E &amp; Y\u2019s Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Y.

Cardinal representatives wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-9\">[Under the buy-and-hold model, mjargins were earned by distributors based largely on the amount of inventory bought and held, and to a lesser extent, on fees collected for the unique distribution requirements of the individual pharmaceutical products. In an environment where inventory was appreciating at a rate greater than the cost of carrying, distributors were encouraged to carry more and more inventory. Large inventory stocks drove margins through price appreciation and manufacturer incentives, with the resulting profitability more than covering distribution costs for all products. With knowledge of distributors' willingness to buy and hold inventory, manufacturers also periodically offered deals or incentives to carry even more inventory, exacerbating the large supplies of inventory in the channel.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b742-13\">. Cardinal mainly profited from the inflation in pharmaceutical prices between the date the products were purchased from manufacturers and the date the same products were sold to retailers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b742-14\">. The consolidation of the distributor market was matched by a consolidation in the retail pharmacy market in which mass retailers like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>CVS Corporation and Walgreen Company succeeded in capturing enormous shares of the market. These mass retailers began to use their burgeoning power to limit price increases, negotiate directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers, and bypass the big distributors by purchasing discounted and generic drugs directly from specialty wholesalers instead.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b743-7\">. In the May 2003 issue of <em>The Cardinal Health Investor, </em>the Company characterized IMAs writing, \"IMAs, which are agreements negotiated between pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors, are an attempt to balance manufacturing production with actual prescription demand by retailers and consumers.

Defendants argue that what Plaintiffs refer to as \"JIT\u201d transactions are more properly labeled \"anticipatory ordering.\u201d Nevertheless, the system described is the same under both Plaintiffs' and Defendants' classifications. This system is one in which Cardinal uses its electronic ordering and inventory systems to anticipate when customers will need additional product, then order that product so as to have it available in Cardinal's inventory. As with product that Cardinal sold as Bulk from Stock, product that Cardinal used for anticipatory ordering is considered to be a part of Cardinal\u2019s inventory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b743-12\">.Cardinal, however, was not the only pharmaceutical distributor to shift from a B + H to an FFS model. Defendants mention that McKesson and AmerisourceBergen, like Cardinal, changed their business models during the Class Period to respond to manufacturers\u2019 efforts to control the distribution channel. Defendants note that McKesson\u2019s stock dropped from $34.33/share on June 30, 2004 to $30.27/share on July 6, 2004 (11.8% drop), and that AmerisourceBergen's stock declined from $59.78/share on June 30, 2004 to $54.00/share on July 6, 2004 (9.7% drop).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b744-7\">.

All years presented have been reclassified to include these bulk deliveries as revenue (previously only the service fees related to such bulk deliveries were reported as revenue; such service fees were not significant in any period presented). Fluctuations in bulk deliveries result largely from circumstances that are beyond the control of the Company, including consolidation within the chain drugstore industry, decisions by chains to either begin or discontinue warehousing activities, and changes in policy by manufacturers related to selling directly to chain drugstore customers.

In prior reporting periods, Cardinal treated its cash discounts received from vendors for prompt payment as a \"Reduction of the Cost of Goods Sold,\u201d recognizing the discount immediately.

The Court recognizes other courts' concern that relying on magnitude of GAAP errors to establish scienter would require speculation prohibited by the PSLRA. <em>See Reiger v.

Cardinal Defendants are correct in arguing that the market does <em>not </em>ask executives to buy and hold stock options indefinitely. If an executive buys an option at $10.00 per share which expires one year later at $56.00 per share, he should certainly be allowed to profit from the sale of that option before its expiration. Nonetheless, should the executive strategically arrange to sell its option long before its expiration because he knows inside information that would lead him to believe that his company\u2019s stock price would drop before he had a chance to exercise his option, courts might consider that somewhat suspicious \u2014 a \u201cpump and dump\" scheme.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"55\">\n<p id=\"b770-10\">.

Thus, an event or transaction may be unusual in nature for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>one entity but not for another because of differences in their respective environments. Unusual nature is not established by the fact that an event or transaction is beyond the control of management.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3B\"><em>Infrequency of Occurrence. </em>For purposes of this Opinion, an event or transaction of a type not reasonably expected to recur in the foreseeable future is considered to occur infrequently. Determining the probability of recurrence of a particular even or transaction in the foreseeable future should take into account the environment in which an entity operates. Accordingly, a specific transaction of one entity might mean that criterion and a similar transaction of another entity might not be because of different probabilities of recurrence. The past occurrence of an event or transaction for a particular entity provides evidence to assess the probability of recurrence of that type of event or transaction to the foreseeable future.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN6\"><em>See </em>Complaint \u00b6 346.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"90\">\n<p id=\"b813-8\">.On September 28, 1998, SEC Chairman, Arthur Levitt stated in his speech: \"Problems arise, however, when we see large charges associated with companies restructuring. These charges help companies 'clean up' their balance sheet-giving them a so-called \u2018big bath.\u2019 ...

The Complaint provides a good discussion of the basics of \"secured transactions\u201d that is helpful to discussing this element of the parties' dispute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b814-6\">Securitization is the process by which financial assets are transformed into negotiable securities. A company will aggregate or pool a group of similar assets such as loans or mortgages ... and place them in a trust. Thereafter, the trust then sells the negotiable securities for which the loans or leases serve as collateral. Only if structured correctly can the assets and liabilities associated with the securitization transaction be removed from a company's balance sheet. A company may enter into a securitization agreement as opposed to entering into a secured financing arrangement only if certain conditions are met. In a secured financing arrangement, a company borrows funds and the loans or leases serve as collateral (it is similar to a mortgage where the mortgage is secured by the house). <em>In order for a transaction to be considered a secn-ritization arrangement, it must reflect a \u201cTrue sale\" as opposed to a financing arrangement. A securitization transaction may only be considered for off-balance sheet treatment if the company has swrendered control, effectively, as well as legally, over the assets, and the assets have been isolated from the company and its creditors, even in the even of bankmptcy. </em>If any of the above are not met, then the company must account for transaction as <em>secured bonowing.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuJ\">SFAS No. 140, <em>Accounting for Transfers and Serving of Financial Assets and Extinguishment of Liabilities.
