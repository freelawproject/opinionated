On the trial the publication was admitted. The libelous circular was composed and written by the defendant <em>Shea, </em>and it bore the printed signature \u201c Edward Dunigan &amp; Brother,\u201d the name of a firm under which the defendant, Kirker, transacted his business. John Gr. Shea, at the time of writing, issuing and circulating the article complained of, was in the employ of Barker, and was also transacting some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>\"business on Ms own account. Kirker saw the circular, and knew of its being issued and circulated, and the same was issued and circulated from his business establishment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-5\">The action was referred to <em>William Kent, Esq., </em>as referee, who found, among other things, as follows: \u201c The referee finds that the alleged libelous matter was wantonly and unjustifiably made and published by the defendants.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-6\">As a conclusion of law on the facts of the case, \u201c the referee finds that the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages against the defendants for an <em>unjustified </em>libel.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-7\">Upon an idea that one defendant was more censurable than the other, the referee severed the damages, and found \u201c that the plaintiff has sustained damages from the defendant, Kirker, to the amount of $150, and damages from the defendant, John G. Shea, to the amount of $600.\u201d \u201cThe referee, therefore, decides and reports that' the plaintiff, Patrick O\u2019Shea, do recover judgment against the defendant, James B.

At common law it was, in actions of tort, error to sever in awarding damages as against various defendants. The Courts, in order to avert the consequences of that error, invented the proceeding of electing <em>de melioribus damnis. </em>It is at least doubtful how far a Court had the power thus to visit upon a defendant a penalty which the tribunal of fact did not intend he should incur. We insist that no such power ever in fact existed, and it was a gross act of usurpation, especially in a case of trial by jury, to deprive a defendant lightly mulcted, of the conclusion which as to him was reached by the tribunal to whose judgment and its effect he had a constitutional right. That right extended as well to the amount of damages, as to the question of liability. The error seems much greater, considering that this power, though deemed the act of the Court, was, in fact, that of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-5\">2d. It will be found, on an examination of the authorities, that the Court of Kings Bench, in the year 1771, Lord Maftsfield presiding, reversed a judgment in a action for a <em>joint </em>tort, because the jury had found the trespass to be <em>joint, </em>and yet had given several damages. <em>(Hill et al. </em>v. Goodchild, 5 Burrow, 2790.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-6\">But neither in that case, nor in any other known to us, has it been determined that it is error for the jury to sever the damages <em>where there are several acts of </em>trespass, <em>as to some of </em>which, <em>certain of the defendants are guilty and others </em>\u25a0not, <em>or where the defendants are charged jointly and </em>severally, <em>or have pleaded separately. </em>In the case just cited, the Court expressly state that they make no <em>decision as to such instances.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-7\">3d. We are not aware of any case in which it has been held that where several damages are assessed, the plaintiff may take judgment against any defendant alone or jointly with others, <em>for any amount not awarded against him. </em>The election allowed in such cases is to take judgment against any one defendant <em>for the amount in which he is </em>mulcted, simply because the plaintiff might have sued him alone. (See Tidd\u2019s Practice, <em>805; </em>Graham\u2019s Practice; <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Milbank et al., </em>6 T. R., 199; 5 Burrow, 2790, and the cases there cited; Sedgwick on Damages, 584; <em>Holley </em>v. Mix, 3 Wend., 350.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b130-8\">4th. There is, however, a distinction between all the cases heretofore adjudged, and the present, not only in reference to the effect of the Code generally, but because here, the referee, acting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>in the place of <em>the Gourt, has not only declared that the acts of the defendants were several, and differed in delinquency, hut has also assessed separate damages.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-5\">He has found that Shea acted <em>wantonly, </em>and Kirker <em>incautiously.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-6\">The plaintiff could not, on this state of facts, enter <em>any judgment other than such as the report authorized. </em>(See Code, \u00a7 272.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-7\">5th. But the whole fiction, invention or usurpation thus criticised, has fallen through from the want of any reason to maintain it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-8\">The Code authorizes several judgments against several defendants in all kinds of actions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-9\">And the Court has no power under the Code to award any other damages against a defendant than such as have in the first instance been assessed against him.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Alt\">The learned referee, before whom this action was tried and by whom it was decided, found as a fact, \u201cthat the alleged libelous matter was wantonly and unjustifiably made and published by the defendants,\u201d and held, \u201cas a conclusion of law, on the facts of the case,\u201d \u201cthat the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages against the <em>defendants, for an unjustified libel.\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-14\">He father states in his report, that he severed \u201c the damages as the defendant Kirker appears to have taken little part in the libel, and is chiefly censurable for allowing the charges against the plaintiff to go forth attached to a circular under the name of his firm, while the defendant John Gr. Shea wrote and personally caused to be circulated this libelous matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-15\">He further found that <em>Kirker </em>damaged the plaintiff to the amount of $150, and <em>Shea </em>to the amount of $600, and decided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>that the plaintiff should have judgment against the former for $150,' and against the latter for $600.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">If the two, jointly, did the wrong, and if the amount of resulting damage is correctly found, then <em>that wrong </em>damaged the plaintiff to the amount, at least, of $600.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">Each defendant, in judgment of law is liable for the whole of such damage, and one is as absolutely liable to the plaintiff for the whole damage as the other. <em>(Bohun </em>v. Taylor, 6 Cow., 313; <em>Knickerbocker </em>v. <em>Colver, </em>8 id., 111.)</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">When several persons are united as defendants, in an action of tort, alleged to be their joint tort, and it is established,- that all jointly did the wrong-complained of, the damages cannot be severed. The plaintiff, in such a case, is entitled to a judgment against all jointly, for the whole amount of damages,- which it is proved that such wrong caused him.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">When a jury, or referees, on such a state of facts, attempt' to sever the damages, and find that one sum should be paid by one defendant, and a different sum by another, they constitute them: selves into a <em>quasi </em>Court of Chancery, with no rules to guide them in apportioning damages, except such as seem to them \u201c equitable,\u201d in the particular .case, and override the stern rule of the common law, that each defendant is liable for the whole damages. And they seem to forget, for the moment, that a plaintiff can have but one satisfaction, and that settling with one of such wrong-doers, or collecting from one of them the amount assessed against him separately, discharges all. I think it just to say, they seem to forget this rule, because in such cases, it is fair to presume they intend that each defendant shall pay the damages assessed against him. In the case before us, it is quite evident, the referee intended, so far as his action might affect that question, that the plaintiff should recover $750; viz.: $150 of <em>Kirker, </em>and $600 of <em>John Q-. Shea.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">On the facts found by the referee, the plaintiff was \"entitled to a judgment against both defendants for $600, unless the referee\u2019s erroneous severance of the damages, and the -provisions of the Code as to the form and nature of a judgment to be entered on the report of a referee to whom the whole issue has been referred, have deprived him of that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>If the cause had been tried by a jury, and they had found the facts which the referee has found, and had then severed the damages, assessing them as the referee has done, the plaintiff could take judgment against both defendants for $600.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">At all events, we should hardly be justified in holding to the contrary, against the decision of <em>Halsey et al. </em>v. <em>Woodruff, </em>(9 Pick., 555,) and the terms of decided approbation, in which that decision is spoken of in <em>Beal </em>v. <em>Finch, </em>(1 Kern., 135, 136, and 141, 142, id.) (See also <em>Dean </em>v. <em>Thornton &amp; Dutton, </em>3 Kern., 266, and <em>Blodget </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>14 N. Y., 482; <em>Bulkley </em>v. <em>Smith et al, </em>1 Duer, 643.)</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">In <em>Hill et al. </em>v. <em>Goodchild, </em>(5 Burrow, 2790,) (in an action against two for an assault and battery,) Lord Mansfield observed, that \u201c the present question is, whether, upon a charge of a joint trespass, the jury can assess damages according to different degrees of guilt; though the real justice is, that the damages should be respectively assessed in proportion to the real injury done by each defendant.\u201d On delivering subsequently the opinion of the Court, he said, \u201c And the present case is, that the count is of a joint trespass; and the jury have found the defendants guilty of a joint trespass, and yet have severed the damages. We are of opinion that in <em>such </em>case the damages <em>cannot be severed. </em>The consequence is, that the judgment must be reversed.\u201d If that decision declares the law correctly, a judgment, entered upon the report of the referee, against each defendant for the amount assessed against him would be erroneous, and for that cause alone, would be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">In <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Milbank et al, </em>(6 Term. R., 199,) Lord Kenyon, Ch. J., declared, that to enter several judgments against the defendants, (who were found guilty of a joint trespass,) on separate and several assessments of damages against them, would be erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">We have not been referred to any adjudication by which a contrary rule has been applied. In some cases, when the jury have severed the damages, the plaintiff has entered a <em>nolle prosegu\u00ed </em>against all the defendants but one, and taken a judgment against that one only, and that was held to be regular, and to have cured the verdict, as in <em>Rodney </em>v. <em>Strode, </em>(in Carth., 19,) and <em>Holley </em>v. <em>Mix &amp; Clute </em>(3 Wend., 350; See 1 Sand., 207, note 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>The decision in <em>Halsey et al. </em>v. <em>Woodruff, </em>(9 Pick., 555,) seems to us, but an application of the rules, that each is liable for the whole damages, and that there can be but one judgment against those united as defendants in the same action and proved to -be guilty of a <em>joint </em>tort. It follows, logically, that judgment must go against all for the amount of damages established, as the result of such joint tort. In that case, the plaintiff entered a <em>remittitur </em>as to the lesser amount of damages. The same practice was pursued in <em>Bulkley </em>v. <em>Smith &amp; Keteltas. </em>(2 Duer, 267; <em>S. C., </em>1 Duer, 643.)</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">As the judgment was reversed upon grounds which did not involve a decision of the question whether such a judgment was regular and free from error, that question was not passed upon. Mr. Justice Duer intimated very distinctly that, \u201c as at present advised, if the conflict of authorities is such as to allow a liberty of choice, we certainly should refuse to follow \u201d the doctrine that a plaintiff in such a case \u201c may enter his judgment against all the defendants for the largest damages that are given.\u201d (Id., 271.)</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">We must concede it to be well settled that a plaintiff in such a case is entitled to a judgment against all for the amount of damage which he proves he has sustained from their joint tort, and that damages cannot be assessed against the defendants severally, according to their different degrees of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">When, under a misapprehension of the rule forbidding a severance of the damages, the jury have in fact severed them, it is the right of a plaintiff to remit the lesser sum or sums, and take judgment against all for the larger sum. The party, by entering such <em>remittitur, </em>does not deprive either defendant of any <em>substantial </em>right. The issues have been tried in the presence of each defendant in an action to which he was a party, and upon such evidence as he chose to offer, and the actual damages caused by the joint tort of himself and his co-defendants, have been correctly found upon the evidence and under an accurate application of the rules of law to the case. The judgment which follows as a necessary consequence, is declared by law; that judgment is a joint one against all for the damage caused by their joint tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">The entry of a <em>remittitur is </em>a matter of form. The entry of a joint judgment against all for the larger sum (the amount of the. actual damage), and for that only is, <em>per </em>se, an election to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>take judgment against all and for that sum only, and effectually remits all claim to the lesser sum, in addition to that for which the judgment is entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The judgment should not be reversed merely because there is no formal entry on the record of a <em>remittitur </em>of the lesser sum. (2 R. S., 425, \u00a7 7, sub. 13 and 14; Code, \u00a7 176; <em>Bate </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>1 Kern., 237.)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">We therefore think it quite clear that if this action had been tried by a jury, and they had severed the damages, as the referee has done, and a judgment like the one before us had then been entered, it could not be reversed on the mere ground that it had been entered against all for the larger sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Section 274 of the Code has not changed the rule as to the <em>liability </em>of each or either of several defendants, proved to have committed a tort jointly, nor does it introduce any new rule by which to determine when a several judgment against one of several defendants may properly be entered. So far as those questions are concerned, the Code leaves them to be determined by pre-existing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">We cannot accede to the proposition that this section authorizes a severance of damages and several judgments, when all the defendants are proved, at the trial, to have committed jointly the tort complained of, and charged to be their joint act.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">Do the provisions of the Code, as to the trial of actions by referees, and as to the judgment to be entered upon their report, make it necessary that a new trial should be ordered on such a state of facts as this case presents, or preclude the plaintiff from entering a judgment against all for the larger sum ?</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">Referees are required \u201cto state the facts found and the conclusions of law separately.\u201d \u201c The report of the referees upon the whole issue, shall stand as the decision of the Court, and judgment may be entered thereon in the same manner as if the action had been tried by the Court.\u201d (Code, \u00a7 272.)</p>\n<p id=\"b135-11\">\u201c Upon a trial of a question of fact by the Court, its decision shall be given in writing, and filed with the clerk, within twenty days after the Court at which the trial took place. Judgment upon the decision shall- be entered accordingly.\u201d (Id., 267.) \u201c Accordingly,\u201d in this connection, means, probably, \u201c according to such decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>The referee found that the defendants jointly committed the tort, charged in \u25a0 the complaint as their joint act, and that the plaintiff had been damaged thereby to the amount of $600. (There is no question made that the damages have been assessed at too large an amount.) Had the report stopped here, there can be no doubt that a single judgment against both for $600 damages would have been a regular, and the appropriate judgment on Such a state of facts, and that no other could have been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">That part of the report which severs the damages, is irregular, and is outside Of and beyond the full and correct performance by the referee of his whole duty as such referee.\" That part of the report which is to the effect that judgment be entered against Kirker for\" $150, and against Shea for $600, is in conflict with that part which-finds, \u00e1s a fact, \u201cthat the alleged libelous matter was wantonly' and unjustifiably made and published by the defendants,and declares, \u201c as a conclusion of law on the facts of the case,\u201d \u201cthat the plaintiff is entitled to recover damages against the <em>defendants </em>for an unjustified libel,\u201d so made and published by-them.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">The proper judgment on such a state of facts, and under such a rule of law, is a 'joint and single judgment against the two for the amount of the damage caused by such joint act.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">Overruling the decision of the referee, that there shall be a judgment against each for the amount assessed against him, and holding that a singl\u00e9 judgment against the two for the larger sum should be- affirmed, is but pronouncing a judgment in accordance with the facts as found. When no attempt is made \"by either party to question the accuracy of the referee\u2019s conclusions of fact, the Court on an appeal from the judgment, by whichever party the appeal may be taken, should direct such a judgment as the law pronounces, upon the facts thus found.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">In this case, if a judgment had been entered by the clerk, on the report of the referee being filed, and in the terms of the report, and exceptions- to the decision of the referee had been duly filed, and if the plaintiff had appealed from such judgment, the Court would be required (the accuracy of the decision of the allegations of fact being unquestioned) to order such a- judgment as has been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>But the judgment is now regularly before the Court on an appeal from it, and the duty of the appellate Court is the same, whoever may be the party appealing. Such a judgment should be given by the appellate Court, as the facts specially found require.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The severing of the damages, like the severance of damages by a jury, may be regarded as an irregularity, not affecting any substantial right. And all directions based on such irregularity may be corrected, and judgment given according to the justice and law of the case. A correct judgment has been entered. If any irregularity, \u201c error, or defect, in the pleadings or proceedings,\u201d has occurred in the progress of the trial, up to, or in entering the judgment, \u201cwhich shall not affect the substantial rights\u201d of either defendant, the Court is required, by section 176, to disregard it, and is prohibited from reversing the judgment by reason thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">The questions presented by this appeal may be briefly stated thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">These defendants have been sued together, and are charged with having jointly committed <em>a tort. </em>On a trial of the issues, joined in the action, between them and the plaintiff, it has been proved that they jointly did the wrong, and that the plaintiff has been damaged thereby, to the amount of $600. These facts have been established by competent and sufficient evidence. Judgment has been entered against both defendants for $600. This is the proper judgment. Do the facts,'that the referee severed the damages assessing them at $150, against one defendant, and at $600, against the other, and deciding that judgment should be entered accordingly, require a reversal of the judgment that has been entered ? Or shall such severance of damages, and the decision founded on it be disregarded, and the judgment, which is right in itself and according to law, be affirmed ?</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">We are of opinion that it should be affirmed. We, therefore, order an affirmance, giving liberty to the plaintiff, to modify the form of the judgment, (if so advised,) so as to state that he elected to remit the lesser sum, and take judgment against both for the larger sum, and to enter a judgment, that the judgment appealed from be thus modified, and that, as thus modified, it be in all things affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>Hoffman, J. (Dissenting.)</author>\n<p id=\"A1N\">I have not before had occasion to consider the question in this case, and it struck me upon the argument as strange and inequitable, that, when a separate and inferior degree of culpability, in one of two defendants, had been found by a jury, and they had determined the compensation to be rendered for his wrong, a Court could charge him with a higher penalty. The referee, in this case, stands, by consent, in place of a jury. The same rules must prevail. He has found, indeed, that the whole damage sustained from the publication of the libel is $750; but he has, as distinctly found, that the proportion of this amount, for which Kirker should respond for his participation in the act, is $150, and that Shea should bear the rest. \u201c The defendants are guilty, yet the degrees of their guilt are different, and the real justice is, that damages should be assessed respectively, in proportion to the real injury done by each defendant.\" It is inevitable that a principle, thus stated by Lord Mansfield, and commended by its common sense and equity, will be acted upon by juries.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">It seems to me impossible to answer or evade the powerful argument of the counsel of the defendants, that the juridical constitution of the country, has, in cases like the present, as entirely vested in a jury, the right to determine the amount of compensation for a wrong, as to pronounce a party guilty of that wrong. The measure of redress against an offender is as absolutely within their province as the question of his offense. If a Judge or referee, under our system, is substituted by consent, his office and duty are the same. How a Court, sitting to revise and correct errors of law, or to furnish a further opportunity for obtaining justice in matters of fact, can increase the amount thus adjusted, reverse the determination, and impose a further augmented penalty, is beyond my legal comprehension to understand.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Lord Mansfield, in 1771, declared \u201c that there was great confusion in the cases upon the subject; and some of them were diametrically opposite.\u201d Mr. Justice Aston observed, that some were decided upon principle, not agreeably to his understanding. (5 Burrows, 2790.) This complaint was repeated by Chief Justice Kent, in 1806. He \u201c was surprised to meet so much contradiction and uncertainty upon the subject.\u201d (1 John. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>R., 290.) Perhaps obscurity and indefiniteness still linger over some portions of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Some of the numerous authorities establish this rule, a rule not open to dispute, that when the act from which the injury has resulted is one and indivisible, and several have concurred in it, that act is the act of each. If they are sued jointly, (whether they unite or sever in their defense,) and are found jointly guilty, the verdict ought to be taken against them jointly, and but one sum for damages be assessed against all. Such should be the direction of the Court to the jury. If followed by the jury, there is no error. If disobeyed, either the Judge may refuse to receive it, or the verdict may be set aside, and a new trial had, or judgments, if entered in severalty, may be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\"><em>Eliot </em>v. <em>Allen and six others, </em>(1 Com. Bench R., 18,) is a striking example of this class of cases. The action was for false imprisonment, seizing a supposed lunatic and carrying him to, and detaining him in a workhouse. The defense was, that he had been taken up on reasonable information, and that the defendants all acted in an official capacity; but their relative official positions and powers were different, and the acts of some were clearly of a less degree of wrong than those of others. Chief Justice Tindal told the jury that the plaintiff could only recover damages against the defendants for any joint act committed, or assented to by all of them. The jury returned a verdict against all, except Allen, and assessed the damages at \u00a3400.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">On motion for a new trial, it was pressed, that some of the defendants, particularly one Semple, were slightly culpable, and the jury ought to have been instructed to sever in their verdict. But it was <em>held, </em>that there was one joint trespass; all were guilty of the same trespass, or not guilty at all; and the charge of the Judge was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">This was the point, and the only point expressly decided in <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Goodchild. </em>(5 Bur., 2790.) Several damages having been assessed against two, and the judgment entered being against them severally, and it being a case of one joint trespass, the judgment on writ of error to the Common Pleas, was reversed. ' <em>'</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">Everything that is held or said in the case of <em>Bohun </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>(6 Cow. R., 313,) falls within this principle. There was a question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>as to the admissibility of Collins, a co-trespasser, as a witness, a default having been taken against him. \u201c There was one fact one time, and one place. Both being found guilty of the whole trespass, the damages must be entire, although the defendants sever, and one suffer judgment by default.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">And this principle is found in the case of <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Milbank and others. </em>(6 T. R., 199.) In trespass for- assault and battery against three, there was judgment by default. Three writs of inquiry were executed, with different damages. The plaintiff, before judgment, moved to set aside his own proceedings, and execute one new writ. This was permitted, Lord Kenyon saying, if he had entered up final judgment for the several damages it would have been erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">So <em>Crane </em>v. Hummerstone, (Croke Jac., 118,) was simply the case of a reversal on error for taking judgment severally on separate assessments of damages against several. <em>Mathews </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>in the Exchequer Chamber, (Croke Jac., 384,) was exactly the case of <em>Eliot </em>v. <em>Allen. </em>The judgment was joint on damages assessed entirely. And it was sustained, upon a writ of error alleging error in not assessing damages severally, upon the several issues of different defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">To the same point, is the case of <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Crosby. </em>(1 Blackf. R., 140\u2014Indiana.)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Another class of cases involves the rule, that where the act is in itself single, but several have united in it, and the plaintiff has sued the defendants separately, a recovery and satisfaction in one suit is a bar to a recovery in any other. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Rumsey, </em>(6 Johns. R., 26,) was of this character, and may be usefully stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">The action was libel, and there was a plea, <em>puis darrein continu</em>ance, of a former action and recovery, and satisfaction against one Henry Dodd for the same identical writing and publishing, and \u25a0causing or procuring to be written and published, the same identical alleged libel. There were other proper averments in the \u25a0plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">The case arose upon a demurrer to the plea and a joinder. The plea was sustained and judgment given for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">Thompson, J., said: \u201cThe demurrer admits the libel and publication in the present action to be the same, as in the action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>against Dodd. We are therefore to take it for granted that there was but one publication, and that was the joint act of the defendant and Dodd. There is, then, but a single injury, and if the plaintiff could have maintained a joint action, it would be unjust that he should have a double satisfaction. The making and publishing a libel are matters susceptible of a joint concern and undertaking, as much as a trespass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">This rule was recognized in <em>Martin </em>v. Kennedy, (2 Bos. and Pull., 69,) as applicable where a trespass Was one act, such as cutting grass in a field; but the interference of the Court before trial was refused, where several suits on a libel were proceeding against different persons. Lord Eldon, among other things, observed, that the person who disperses the libel as a mere agent, and the principal himself ought to suffer in very different degrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">There is another and important series of cases. If the plaintiff proceed for a joint indivisible wrong, against several, in separate actions, he may go on to judgment, and may elect to enforce his judgment against the party as to whom he obtains the largest damages. And after satisfaction, at least, his proceedings will be stayed against the others. In this sense the doctrine <em>dx melioribus damnis </em>is reasonable and just.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">This is the rule which Chief Justice Kent, as I understand him, declares to be the more rational one, <em>(Livingston </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>1 Johns. R., 290;) and this I take to be the whole extent of the rule - declared in <em>Cocke </em>v. <em>Jenner, </em>(Hob., 66,) and in <em>Corbet </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>(Wm. Jones, 377,) cited by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">There is another class of authorities, within the same principle, of which <em>Holly </em>v. <em>Mix &amp; Clute, </em>(3 Wend., 350,) is an example. Both defendants were found guilty of the false imprisonment. Six cents\u2019 damages were given against Clute, and twenty-five dollars against Mix, The plaintiff was allowed to enter a <em>nolle </em>prosequi, against the former, and to have his judgment against Mix.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">This is also the rule established in two cases in Kentucky, <em>(Stone </em>v. <em>Matherly, </em>3 Mon. R., 137; and <em>Dougherty </em>v. <em>Dersey, 4 </em>Bibb, 208.) If several damages are assessed in trespass, the plaintiff may take judgment for the greater sum, against him or them, on whom they are assessed; but cannot have several judgments. If equal damages are assessed against two, he may enter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>a <em>remittitur </em>as to one, and take judgment against both for the sum assessed against the other; or may enter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>as to one, and take judgment against the other only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">And the old and important case of <em>Rodney </em>v. Strode, (Carth. R., 19,) is precisely to the same point. The action was trespass against three, and an assessment of several damages. The plaintiff entered a <em>nolle prosequi </em>against all but the one, as to whom he had obtained the heaviest amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">But on what authority does the proposition rest, that the doctrine, <em>de melioribus damnis, </em>warrants the entry of judgment for an increased amount against one defendant, when a jury has found that he should only be liable in a lesser sum\u2014to charge him, in fact, with part of the penalty of the delinquency of his associate, as the jury have settled that delinquency ?</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\"><em>Heydon's case, </em>(11 Coke\u2019s R., 5; Croke Car., 192; 1 Wilson\u2019s R., 30), are generally cited. Mr. Tidd (Practice, vol. 1, p. 322,) quotes them for the rule. <em>Eliot </em>v. <em>Allen (ut supra), Clark </em>v. <em>Newsam, </em>(1 Exch. R., 131,) <em>Rochester </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>(1 Bibb, 434,) <em>Halsey </em>v. <em>Woodruff, </em>(6 Pick., 555,) have also been referred to. To these may be added <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>(9 Geo. R., 508,) <em>Schultz </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>(1 Browne\u2019s R., 233, Penn.,) and <em>Beal </em>v. <em>Finch, </em>(1 Kern., 128.)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">In <em>BulJceley </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>in this Court, the Judges, upon consultation by the Chief Justice, first refused to set aside such a judgment upon motion, because the question seemed doubtful, and it could come up on appeal (1 Duer, 643); and when the case was before the Court at General Term, it omitted to decide the point as not necessary in the case, but a strong opinion was intimated against such a proposition. (2 Duer, 271.)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\"><em>Eliot </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>(cited 1 Duer, 644, as <em>Elliot </em>v. <em>Anderson) </em>has been <em>before </em>fully stated, and does not give the slightest support^ to the supposed rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-10\"><em>Clark </em>v. <em>Newsam &amp; Edwards, </em>(1 Exch. R., 131,) has no direct bearing upon the point. It contains, however, a discussion of a rule sometimes stated, that a jury in a joint trespass must adjust the damages against all upon the basis of the guilt of the most criminal. Chief Baron Pollock had refused so to charge, and his remark, when the cause was before the full Bench, deserves great attention, that the plaintiff ought to have selected the party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>against whom he expected to get aggravated damages. The Court appear to think that the injury which the plaintiff had sustained, was to be the rule of damages against all. There was another decisive point in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">In <em>Crawford </em>v. Morris, (5 Grat., 90,) it was considered that the true rule was to give damages adjusted upon the culpability of the greatest aggressor.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">In <em>Gregory </em>v. Slowman, (1 Ellis &amp; Black., 360,) the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench granted a rule to show cause, expressly as Lord Campbell stated, in order to have it determined whether any such law existed. The case was, however, settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The cases of <em>Schultz </em>v. <em>Hunter, Simpson </em>v. Perry, and <em>Halsey </em>v. <em>Woodruff, (ut supra,) </em>are the only authorities I have been able to find, after much research, decided in our own country, expressly in point. That of <em>Schultz </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>in Pennsylvania, is I think much weakened by <em>Weakley </em>v. <em>Royer. </em>(3 Watts\u2019 R. 460.) <em>Halsey </em>v. <em>Woodruff </em>is indeed an express decision, and upon a deliberate reasoned examination. It is entitled to that great weight which the determination o\u00ed the Supreme Court of Massachusetts always commands. <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Perry </em>is also in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">And as to the opinions of those eminent jurists, Judges Denio and Parker, in <em>Beal </em>v. <em>Finch, </em>it may be sufficient to say that their approbation of the rule of <em>Halsey </em>v. <em>Woodruff, </em>is purely <em>obiter; </em>that the purposes of the argument they were using was as effectually served by the rule, that the assessment of several damages, when the tort is joint, and judgment accordingly, requires a new trial or reversal of judgment, as by the principle they gave their authority to sustain, that the <em>tort feasor, </em>found guilty in the less degree, should be mulcted in the penalty of the deepest offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">On the other side the case of <em>Ammonett </em>v. <em>Harris and others, </em>(1 Hen. &amp; Mumf., 488,) settled, that if the jury in a joint action against several for assault and battery, assess the damages severally against the several defendants, the cases of all being before the same jury, it is error, unless the plaintiff enter a <em>nolle prosequi </em>against all but one, and take judgment for the damages assessed against that one. <em>Crane </em>v. <em>Hummerstone, </em>(Croke, James, 384,) and <em>Rodney </em>v. <em>Strode, (ut supra,) </em>are much relied upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>So in <em>Layman and others </em>v. <em>Hendrix, </em>in error, (1 Ala. R., 212,) the verdict in trespass against several, pleading separately was for the plaintiff, fining W. S., $100; G. L., $300; D. S., $300; and S. W., $300. Judgment was entered .against all for $1,000. The Court held, 1st. That an apportionment of damages in a case of joint trespass, was unwarranted by law. 2d. The plaintiff was entitled to a joint verdict against all; an instruction to sever the damages'would be error. 3d. If the jury, returning a joint verdict of guilty, should .assess several-damages, the irregularity could be cured by the plaintiff, either by having a <em>venire de novo, </em>or by entering a <em>nolle prosequi </em>as to all but one of the defendants, whom he may elect, and charge him with the damages assessed against\" him. The cause was remanded for the plaintiff to elect which of these courses he would adopt.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The case of <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Morris, </em>(5 Grat., 90, Va.,) points out the remedy in such a case to be a <em>nolle prosequi </em>as to others, and judgment as to one. Hotting is said as to a new trial; but in our State, at least, a General Term would, have the power to grant it. (Code, \u00a7 330; 17 N. Y. R., 31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">In <em>Knott </em>v, <em>Cunningham, </em>(2 Sneed\u2019s R., 204, Tenn.,) the Court stated that in case of several actions for one trespass, and unequal damages, the plaintiff may elect which defendant to proceed against.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The same rule was declared in <em>Page </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>(4 Bennett, 19 Mo.,) and in <em>Golding </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>(9 Por., 169 Ala.,) the rule was applied with clearness and decision, that the judgment could only be rendered 'against the one for the higher damages, and costs only against the others found also guilty. See also <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Chance. </em>(2 Yer., 94.)</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">And as to English authorities, <em>Heydon\u2019s case, </em>(11 Coke\u2019s R., 5,) is the leading case of those I have been able to find in any way tending to support the proposition. It is the only case cited in <em>Halsey </em>v. <em>Tffoodruff, </em>and deserves careful examination. It is shortly reported in Croke, James, p. 350 Anno., 12 Jacobi in the King\u2019s Bench, under the title of <em>Jeffery Cobb </em>v. <em>Sir John Heydon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The action was assault and battery against <em>Jeffery Cobb, Thomas Walpole, Froxmere Cochet, and four others. </em>The plaintiff declared against them severally with a <em>simul cum </em>as to the others. Cocket <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>plead <em>son assault demesne. </em>The issue was found, against him with \u00a3200 damages. Walpole plead not guilty, and damages were assessed by another jury at \u00a350, and judgment was given against him. Afterwards judgment was given against Jeffery Cobb upon a <em>non sum vnformatus, </em>and a writ of inquiry of damages awarded. Upon the return <em>vicecomes non misit </em>breve, the judgment was entered reciting that in an action for this battery, judgment had been recovered against Cobb for \u00a3200, &amp;c.; and judgment was given against all the other defendants for this \u00a3200 so assessed against Cobb, (11 Coke, 6 B.,) and this judgment was affirmed in King\u2019s Bench.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">When pressed with the argument that excessive damages might be given against one by consent, or negligence, with which the other would be charged, the answer was, that attaint would lie against the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Perhaps the exact case of a previous trial and assesment of damages against one of several jointly charged, could not now regularly take place. It was questioned long ago in England. The same jury, by the practice now, is as well to inquire as to those who are in default, as to try the issues raised by the others.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">I venture to say that the principle of Sir JohnHeydon\u2019s case would not be supported in our tribunals. I cannot believe that a separate trial of one in the absence of another party, charged on the record with the same offense, who has no opportunity of being then heard, could be the basis of a judgment for damages, when he denies the offense, assuming that it can be when he makes default.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The case cited from Croke, Charles, is <em>Johns &amp; Robinson </em>v. <em>JDodsworth, </em>and is certainly in point. On a trial against two pleading separately, the jury assessed \u00a3100 against one, and \u00a350 against the other. Judgment was taken against both in \u00a3100, and it was affirmed. The objection taken was that there had been no <em>remittitur </em>of the \u00a350. This was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">The case from 1 Wilson\u2019s Reports, 30, is <em>Sabin v. </em>Long\u2014Trespass against three. Two pleaded, and the other made default. On the trial of the issue, the verdict was for the plaintiff with thirty-five shillings damages. Upon a writ of inquiry against the other, the jury assessed two shillings damages. Judgment was entered against the two for the thirty-five shillings, and against the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>for two shillings. Motion to strike out the latter, and to enter judgment against all for the thirty-five shillings. It was denied on the ground that it was not made during the same term as the judgment. The Court observed, that when several damages were given the plaintiff might take judgment <em>de melioribus damnis, </em>or enter a <em>remittitur; </em>but taking judgment for the whole, the aggregate of the verdict, was bad at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">This review of the English cases shows that the alleged rule rests upon the doctrine in <em>Hey don's </em>case, never recognized in our State, and I apprehend indefensible in principle; upon the case of <em>Sabin </em>v. <em>Long, </em>where the defendant, by his default, had ad mitted the wrong and may reasonably be treated to have submit ted himself to the measure of compensation found against his associates; and upon <em>Johns </em>v. Dodsworth, which I admit not open to any sound cavil or distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">If the rule was indisputable and unqualified that, in the case of a joint trespass or tort, the damages must be assessed against all upon the basis of the culpability of the chief aggressor, the argument would be strong, that, in charging the least culpable with higher damages, he cannot pay more than he legally ought to pay; that in truth he will be relieved from payment of some amount, short of the compensation which the jury have declared was the measure of the wrong. In the present case, for example, $750 was that measure, and he is charged with $600.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">It is vain to imagine that the rule adverted to can ever be established with and adhered to by the juries. There is something of an innate sense, whether right or wrong, which will make verdicts, in these cases, matters of compromise between the aggravated guilt of one, and the slight participation of another; and through the whole line of cases, this feeling is exhibited in the separation of the damages assessed. In Sir John Heydon\u2019s case, the jury discriminated on this very ground, as appears by the Eeport, (11 Coke, 5,) and similar instances are abundant. If, as Baron Pollock suggests, the plaintiff will not proceed against the chief offender, he must abide by the risk of a verdict resulting from the conflict of these views. The regulation of punishment by the degree of culpability has its origin in the influence of the great law, that one shall not bear the iniquity of another; and we may hesitate in deciding which will answer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>best the high purposes of justice, the reconciliation through the minds of a jury of these combatting principles, in a verdict induced by them all, or the rigid rule which makes the highest guilt the measure of punishment to the slight offender. Even here the rule contended for is not logically consistent with the principle on which it is based, for the aggregate of all the damages is the measure of the compensation and ought to be the Sum charged upon each.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">When the argument is pressed, that the compensation to the plaintiff, and the equal liability of the defendants, are the true principles upon which the whole question turns, we must discriminate. If the action is one which relates to property, a trespass for example in cutting down trees, the value is ordinarily the measure of damages, and each party may reasonably be bound to pay that value, because remuneration is the primary if not exclusive rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">But when the case is one of libel, punitory damages as they are termed, almost always furnish the guide for a verdict. Very frequently there is no measure for damages by which they can be given as compensation for an injury; but they are inflicted wholly with a view to punish and make an example of the defendant. (Wallace, Jr., R., 164; <em>Fry </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>4 Duer R., 247; <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>2 Sand. S. C. R., 269; Sedgwick on Damages, 458-465.)</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">If this is so, then the culpability of a defendant is the standard of punishment, and it seems necessarily to follow, that where there are several defendants, the different degrees of their respective culpability must have, and ought to possess, consideration and effect. If the law will not permit this principle to be carried out, by sanctioning the separation of damages against several defendants, the next best method of preserving it in force is by leaving it to the jury to modify their verdict as against all, beneath its guidance, or at least admitting its influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">My conclusion is, that while the entry of a judgment in a case of a joint trespass against several, for damages separately assessed, is ground of reversal, it is equally so, to enter judgment against two for the higher damages found against one, when lesser damages have been found against the other. This error is ground for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
