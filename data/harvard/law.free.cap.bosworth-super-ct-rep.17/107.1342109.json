G\\ Clark, and put in a separate answer; and the defendants Hart and McOorkle, appeared by D. D. Lord, and put in an answer.' The defendants, in their answers, admitted the making of the notes, and their delivery, and set up by of way defense; a composition agreement, and performance of it, on their part. The composition agreement is as follows, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-5\">\u201cWe, the undersigned creditors of the firm of Tuller, Hart &amp; McOorkle, m consideration of the sum of one dollar, to each of us paid, agree to accept the sum of sixty cents on the dollar, in their notes at six\u00a1 nine, and twelve months, from the 1st of February, 1857, without interest, in full settlement of our respective claims, against said Tuller, Hart &amp; McOorkle.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-6\">\u201c All claims to be put on the same basis, and considered as due February 1, 1857, by allowing or deducting interest; and the original notes are to be held as collateral, until the notes given in compromise are paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-7\">\u201cNew York, 6th January, 1857.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-8\">It was proved, at the trial, that creditors to the amount of about $87,000, signed this, and a duplicate instrument in the same terms. Creditors to about $29,000 signed that which the plaintiffs signed, prior to their signature. Their demand was $16,335.07. And creditors to about $24,000, in amount, signed the same paper subsequently. The liabilities of the firm- were about $225,000. Their assets were valued at about $189,000, by themselves; and at about $164,000, by the creditors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-9\">A number of creditors, who did not sign the agreement, were subsequently settled with; some at under sixty cents on the dollar, for cash; some for sixty cents cash, less interest; some small amounts, not exceeding $300, were paid in full. Some other creditors remain, who have neither signed, nor been settled with in any way, especially E. D. Morgan, to the amount of $28,000, and Earle, Porter &amp; Co., to the amount of about $5,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b116-10\">On the 29th of January, 1857, the defendants tendered, as performance, on their'part, of the composition agreement, three notes to the plaintiffs, all dated January 1, 1857; one at thirteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>months, for $3,226.14; one at ten months, for $3,226; and one at seven months, for $3,225. The plaintiffs refused to accept of the notes. Some evidence was given, tending to prove that, if all the creditors of the defendants (except those whose demands were regarded as confidential) had accepted sixty per cent in compromise, there might have remained, to the defendants, a surplus estimated at not exceeding $10,000. And, also, that one of the defendants believed his interest in the assets of the firm to be worth $10,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-5\">The cause was tried before Mr. Justice Woodruff, and a jury, in May, 1858. When the parties had rested, the Judge stated that he did not perceive that there was any disputed question of fact to be submitted to the jury. The counsel of the plaintiffs requested the Court to submit to the jury, as a question of fact, whether the defendant William G. Tuller, did or did not intend to make $10,000 by the compromise with his creditors; and if so, that that was a fraud upon the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-6\">The Court refused to submit this question to the jury, and the plaintiffs duly excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-7\">The Judge charged the jury that the compromise agreement constituted a defense; to which the plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-8\">The Court directed the jury to find a verdict for the defendants, which was done accordingly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-9\">A motion was made at Special Term for a new trial upon a case and exceptions, and denied by order of the 1st of June, 1858.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-10\">Judgments for the costs were entered on the 2d of June, 1858, as before stated.

The agreement on the part of the plaintiffs to accept, without accepting sixty per cent of their claim in notes of the defendants, at nine, twelve and fifteen months, is without consideration, and not binding upon the plaintiffs. <em>(Heathcote </em>v. <em>Crookshanks, </em>2 T. R., 24; <em>Greenwood </em>v. <em>Lidbetter, </em>12 Price R., 183; <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Bruce, </em>2 H.

R., 79, <em>Dolsen </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>10 How. Pr. R., 530.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-5\">1. The agreement is not under seal. <em>(Acker </em>v. <em>Ph\u0153nix, </em>4 Paige R., 305.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-6\">2. <em>All </em>the creditors did not execute it. <em>(Boothbey </em>v. <em>Sowden, </em>3 Camp., 175.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-7\">In this case there was an agreement for an extension of payment merely, and the Court held there was sufficient consideration for each of the creditors that it was subscribed by <em>all </em>the others.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-8\">(1.) Such agreements stand upon a different footing than composition <em>deeds, </em>and are looked upon with more favor. (3 Chitty\u2019s Com. Law.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-9\">(2.) In <em>Norman </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>4 Exchequer, 755, (Welsby, Hurlstone &amp; Gordon,) the Court said : \u201cThe only question here is whether there is a variance between the agreement as stated in the special verdict, and the averment of it in the plea.\u201d The plea stated that the defendant agreed with the plaintiff and divers other creditors, and the plaintiff and the said last mentioned creditors then mutually agreed with each other to accept ten shillings in the pound as a composition upon and in full satisfaction and discharge of their demands, and it was found by the special verdict that such agreement was made, and that all the creditors, except three, then agreed with each other to accept said compromise. The Court held that there was no variance between the plea and the facts found by the special verdict, and an agreement by each individual to give up part of his claim is a sufficient consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-10\">(3.) The case at bar is distinguishable from that of <em>Norman </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>in this respect: (1.) It involves the validity of the composition agreement, and not the construction of the plea; and (2) the creditors in this case did not agree <em>with each other </em>to give up part of their claim, and, consequently, lacks the essential ingredient of that case. (See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Dakeyne, </em>11 Jur., 39; <em>Reay </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>2 Cr. M. &amp; R., 422.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b118-11\">(4.) No case in the books can be produced (except <em>Norman </em>v.\" Thompson, if it decide otherwise) where an executory agreement such as the one in question has been held to bind the creditors who signed it. It is mere <em>nudum pactum. </em>And those cases in which it has been held that it was not essential to the validity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>of the agreement, that <em>all </em>should enter into it to render it binding on those who executed it, are cases where the agreement was <em>under seal, </em>or where a <em>higher security </em>was given, and which agreement of itself, independent of its being a composition, was a sufficient accord and satisfaction. Such were</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-5\"><em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>(2 Camp., 383,) which is said by the Court in 24 Wend., 302, to be the <em>strangest </em>case, and there a higher security was given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-6\"><em>Wood </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>(2 Starkie R., 417,) which Lord Abutger said, (in <em>Reay </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>2 Cr. M. &amp; R., 428,) \u201c must have been decided on the particular facts of the case,\u201d and there also a higher security was given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-7\"><em>\u25a0 Good </em>v. <em>Gheeseman, </em>(2 Barn, and Adol., 328; id., 22 E. O. L. R., 89,) was an extension agreement, signed by some of the defendant\u2019s creditors. The debtor covenanted to pay two-thirds of his annual income to a trustee of their nomination, and give a warrant of attorney as collateral security. <em>Held a defense to the action.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-8\">(5.) On the other hand, all the authorities concur in the proposition that the agreement in question is not binding. (The counsel commented on <em>Acker </em>v. <em>Ph\u0153nix, </em>4 Paige, 305; <em>Heathcote </em>v. <em>Crookshanks, </em>2 J. R., 24; <em>Greenwood </em>v. <em>Lidbetter, </em>12 Price, 183; <em>Lynn </em>v. <em>Bruce, </em>2d H. Black., 317; <em>Lowe </em>v. <em>Eginton, </em>7 Price, 604; <em>Fitch </em>v. <em>Sutton, </em>5 East. R., 230; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Courtnay, </em>1 B. and Ad., 1.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b119-9\">3. There is no pretense that any creditor was lured to accept the composition by any act of the plaintiffs; if such had been the case, it should have been pleaded; such an act would have been a fraud, and fraud cannot be presumed; and where it is stated that if any creditor has induced any other creditor to compound with the debtor, the creditor luring the other will be bound by the compromise, applies only to those cases where the creditor has parted with his debt, so that he could have no recourse upon his original demand. Such is not the case at bar, even if the plaintiffs induced all the other creditors to sign it. The authorities from which this principle is cited in the elementary works, and referred to in the books, in which it was not necessary to the decision of the cases, do not carry out that principle to the extent in which it is generally stated. <em>(Greenwood </em>v. <em>Lidbetter, </em>12 Price, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>183; <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Gregory, </em>2 Camp., 383; <em>Wood </em>v. Robert, 2 Stark, 416; <em>Hawley </em>v. Foote, 19 Wend., 516.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-5\">II. The defendants failed to perform the agreement on their part. The compromise notes, according to the agreement, were to bear date on the first of February, 1857; those tendered, bore date on the first of January, and had <em>seven, ten, </em>and <em>thirteen </em>months to run, instead of <em>six, nine, </em>and <em>twelve, </em>as called for by the composition agreement. It also appears that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim amounts to but the sum of $7,236.56, while the compromise notes that were tendered amounted to the sum of $9,677.14.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-6\">1. All the cases hold that if the terms of' the composition agreement <em>be not exactly followed </em>by the debtor, the creditor is remitted to his original rights; and the <em>onus </em>is with the debtor to prove -such - performance. <em>(Fellows </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>24 Wend. R., 302; <em>Dolsen </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>10 How. Pr. 530; <em>Oughton </em>v. <em>Trotter, </em>2 Nev. &amp; M., 71; <em>Cranley </em>V. <em>Hillary, </em>2 M. &amp; S., 120; <em>Rosling </em>v. <em>Muggeridge, </em>16 M. &amp; W., 181.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-7\">2. Where it is necessary for a party to plead, or aver performance or a tender thereof, an exact performance must be stated. (1 Chitty on Pleading, 325; <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Tilden, </em>5 Cow. R., 144; <em>Oakey </em>v. <em>Morton, </em>1 Kern,, 25.) '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-8\">3. The compromise notes, if accepted by the plaintiffs, according to the testimony in the case, would have been fraudulent and void.' <em>(Breck v. Cole, </em>4 Sandf. S. C. R., 79).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-9\">III. The agreement, if otherwise valid, has become inoperative upon the plaintiffs by reason of the defendants\u2019 having paid some of their <em>creditors in cash as much as the defendants were to receive in notes.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-10\">1. It was necessary that all the creditors should sign the agreement.- It is* headed) <em>\u201c We, </em>the undersigned,- creditors,\u201d which means <em>ALL, </em>and not \"a PORTION of them; and only $69,000 out of $225,000 would execute the agreement. It also provides that <em>all claims shall be put upon the same basis. </em>-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b120-11\">2. The payment by the defendants to some of their creditors in cash, although those creditors never acceded to the arrangement, or executed the agreement, was a fraud upon the plaintiffs - and the other creditors who did sign; a composition' agreement is, in its spirit, if not' in its terms, an agreement that all the creditors shall stand in the same situation; and-where - the debtor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>allows any creditor to obtain an advantage over the others, or pays one in preference to another, such an act is a fraud upon .the other creditors, and renders the whole agreement inoperative and void. <em>(Spooner </em>v. <em>Whiston, </em>8 J. B. Moore, 580; <em>Id., </em>17 E. C. L. R., 112; <em>Leicester </em>v. <em>Rose, </em>4 East. R., 372; <em>Breck </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>4 Sand. S. C. R., 79\u2014and cases cited.) The judgment should be reversed, and a new trial granted.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b121-5\"><em>Daniel D. Lord </em>for the respondents, Hart &amp; McCorkle.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-6\">I. There was no error in refusing, to submit to the jury whether William Gr. Tuller did or did not intend to make $10,000 by the compromise, and to charge that it was a fraud upon the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-7\">1. There was not evidence enough to sustain this fact if the jury had so found it.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-8\">The only evidence to the point, is in Tuller\u2019s deposition. He states that at the time of the settlement he believed his interest to be worth $10,000; but this is on the supposition that all the creditors not confidential, would accept the terms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-9\">2. Even if the evidence proved it, an intention, much less a mere expectation of saving $10,000, is not necessarily or legally a fraud.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-10\">(a.) It does not appear that any misrepresentation or concealment existed, as to assets or liabilities.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-11\"><em>(b.) </em>The expectation may have arisen, and in fact, as appears by the testimony, did arise from an expectation of realizing by good management, more than the balance of the assets.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-12\">H. There was no error in charging that the compromise agreement constituted a good defense.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-13\">I. It was an agreement signed by plaintiffs and several others, creditors of defendants, releasing them on receiving sixty per cent in notes. It must be held a valid release, unless the plaintiffs show some fatal defect in it. The plaintiffs claim that it is invalid for want of consideration, want of seal, omission of some creditors; none of these objections are sufficient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b121-14\">2. There was a valid consideration; the agreement by each creditor being consideration enough to support the agreement by the others. <em>(Norman </em>v. <em>Tompson, </em>4 Exch., 759.) Held that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>agreement to release, made by a portion of the creditors, is binding.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-5\">Pollock, C.

It was not expressly pleaded that plaintiff\u2019s agreement to accept it was in consideration of all the creditors coming in. Duller, J., admitted, that if the latter had been averred, the accord and tender might have been a bar, (see <em>Fellows </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>24 Wend., 299,) but this decision is overruled by the subsequent decision of <em>Norman </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>above cited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b122-10\"><em>Fitch </em>v. <em>Sutton </em>(5 East.

Such a condition ought to be expressly declared, or clearly deducible from unambiguous language. Compositions could rarely be carried into effect if such stipulation is, in every case, or in every doubtful case to be implied, when the contrary is not declared.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">The phrase is neither <em>all the creditors, </em>nor even <em>the creditors, </em>but merely \u201c creditors.\u201d The clause, \u201c all claims to be put on the \u25a0same basis,\u201d is as applicable to the claims of all who shall sign, .as to the claims of all who may be creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">Late English authorities have fully settled that a composition agreement, made between a debtor and a portion of his creditors, is \u25a0valid and binding. The consideration of the relinquishment of a part of their claim by the others, is sufficient to make the promise and discharge of each obligatory. <em>(Norman </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>4 Exch. R., 755 [1850]; <em>Good </em>v. <em>Cheeseman, </em>2 Barn. &amp; Adol., 328 [1831]; <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Hind, </em>40 Eng. L. and Eq. R., 428 [1857].)</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">Williams, J., in delivering the opinion of the Court in <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Hind, </em>says: \u201c The law with respect to defenses founded on \u25a0compositions between a debtor and his creditors, appears not to have been distinctly defined until the case of <em>Good </em>v. <em>Gheeseman. </em>It used to be sometimes laid down that a right of action once vested, could only be divested by a release or by accord and .satisfaction-; but since the decision of that case, the law has been considered as settled, that a composition agreement by several -creditors, although by parol, so as to be incapable of operating as a release, and although unexecuted, so as not to amount in strictness to a satisfaction, would be a good answer to an action \u25a0by the creditor for the original debt, if he accepted the new agreement in satisfaction thereof; and that for such an agreement there is a good consideration to each creditor, namely, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>undertaking by the other compromising creditors to give up a part of their claim. But no such agreement can operate as a defense if made merely between the debtor and a single creditor. The other creditors, or some of them,' must also join in the agreement with the debtor and with each other; for otherwise it would be a bare contract to accept a less sum in satisfaction of \u00e1 greater, which would be invalid, by reason of want of consideration for relinquishing the residue.\u201d (See the correction of the report of <em>Norman </em>v. Thompson, by Willes, J., at p. 429.)</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">In <em>Norman </em>v. Thompson, Parke, Baron, said \u201c an agreement by two or more of the creditors to enter into a composition is perfectly good and binding as to those parties, whether the others do so or not. The agreement by each individual to give up part of his claim is a sufficient consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Although in <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Hind </em>and <em>Norman </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>the instrument recited that \u201c each of the undersigned creditors in consideration of the agreement therein contained on the part of the others,\u201d agreed with the others, and also with the debtor, yet I apprehend such a clause is not essential. I think an agreement between themselves will be legally inferred from an instrument in which several relinquish part of their demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">In <em>Good </em>v. <em>Cheseman, </em>four creditors, including the plaintiff, signed a paper reciting, that the defendant was indebted to them for goods sold and delivered; that he was unable to make immediate payment of the same, and they agreed to receive payment of the same by his covenanting to pay to a trustee one-third of his annual income, and to execute a warrant of Attorney as collateral security therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">And in <em>Boothbey </em>v. <em>Sowden, </em>(3 Camp. 174,) the agreement was with the debtor only.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">The cases, also, in which, any agreement to pay a particular creditor something beyond the composition amount has been held void, bear upon this point. The agreement in <em>Breck </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>(4 Sandf. S. C. R., 80,) had no stipulation as between the creditors themselves, and Justice Duer says, \u201c every composition deed is, in its spirit, if not in its terms, an agreement between the creditors themselves, as well as between them and the debtor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">There was no such clause in the cases of <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em>(5 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Bingham, 432,) <em>Constantine </em>v. <em>Blache, </em>(1 Cox, 287,) or <em>Cullingworth </em>v. <em>Loyd, </em>(2 Beavan, 385,) an important case.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">The basis of the doctrine is, the relinquishment to the debtor by the others who sign, of a part of their claims, or the concession of some modification of the right to enforce them; this constitutes the consideration, and as this'exists without any such clause as is referred to the implication of an agreement among themselves is raised, and is equivalent to its expression in the instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Is this rule recognized, disavowed, or modified by any binding decision in our own Courts ?</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The general principle that such deeds are agreements between the creditors themselves, as well as between them and the debtor is stated in <em>Breck </em>v. <em>Cole </em>(4 Sandf. S. C. R., 80,) and <em>Hughes </em>v. <em>Alexander </em>(5 Duer, 488-493).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">The decision in <em>Fellows, </em>v. <em>Stevens </em>(24 Wend., 294,) was that the creditor might, under the circumstances of the case, withdraw his assent to a composition deed; and then the debtor was there estopped from setting it up.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\"><em>Acker </em>v. <em>Ph\u0153nix </em>(4 Paige, 305,) was ther case of an explicit condition in the instrument, that the signature should be void unless all the creditors assented to the agreement. An attempt was made to prove a change in this condition by parol, and was rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-10\">My conclusion is, that the agreement in question was operative and binding upon the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-11\">2d. The variation in the date of the notes from the 1st of February to the 1st of January, seems to me immaterial. It is not expressly stipulated that the notes should bear date the 1st, of February. They are to be at six, nine and twelve months from the 1st of February. The period of maturity is the principal matter provided for, and the notes at seven, ten and thirteen months from the 1st of January matured at the same time as the others would have done.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">It is said that the plaintiffs\u2019 claim is only $7,236.56, as demanded in the complaint; while the notes tendered amount to $9,677.-14; and if accepted would have been a fraud upon others. But the debt to the plaintiff is set down at $16,335.67. Sixty oents on the dollar would be $9,801.40. The statement at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>bar was, that other notes had been sued upon in another Court. At any rate, there is nothing, upon the case before us, in this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The discrepancy between the $9,801.40 (sixty per cent of $16,335.67,) and the amount of the notes tendered, $9,677.14, is readily accounted for. The $16,335.67 was not all of it payable until after February 1st, 1857. By the agreement, there was to be a rebate of interest, so as to determine the amount of the compromise notes by \u201cconsidering the debts as due\u201d on that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">3d. It is insisted that the payment to some of the creditors in cash was a fraud, and avoids the composition. The evidence is of various settlements of claims\" for cash; two other small ones at sixty cents; many at a rate varying from fifty to sixty cents, less the interest. The amount over sixty cents actually paid does not exceed $250, as far as can be gathered from the evidence. We are satisfied that the inference of fraud from these facts is unwarranted ; but at any rate, such a question ought to have gone to the jury, and the plaintiffs ought to have requested it to be put to them, if they deemed it possible to support the allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">4th. Some exceptions were taken to the rulings of the Judge in respect to the evidence. No point connected with them is now made by the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel. We have, however, examined them, and think they are all untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">5th. In regard to the exception on account of the refusal of the Judge to submit to the jury whether the defendant Tuller did not intend to make $10,000 by the compromise, and if so, that it was a fraud; no point is now made by the appellants\u2019 counsel. It was slightly adverted to on the argument. We think, that such a point would have been plainly untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">The judgment must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">The other Judges who heard the argument concurred in affirming the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
