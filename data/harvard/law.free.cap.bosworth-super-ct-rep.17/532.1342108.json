A notice of protest, dated on the day a note matures, describing it by the name of the maker, and its amount, and as indorsed by the defendant, and stating that such note is protested for non-payment, and that the holders look to him for payment, is sufficient in form, without stating further descriptive particulars.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b540-6\">2. Although the defendant was, at the time of receiving such notice, the indorser of another note in all respects like it, which was outstanding and unpaid, except that it was payable three instead of six months after its date; still the notice is not insufficient by reason of its uncertainty, it being shown that a suit was pending on the note first due when the second note was protested, and that the defendant had answered in such suit before the note in question matured.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b540-7\">3. It is not sufficient, to charge an indorser, to leave notice of protest at a building in a city corresponding in number with that written under his indorsement, without proving that such building was, at the time, the indorser\u2019s place of residence or business, and was left with some proper person therein.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b540-8\">4. Nor is it sufficient that a notice was sent to the indorser\u2019s office, without proving that it was there delivered to him, or to some person in charge thereof, or that no such delivery could be made.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b540-9\">(Before Bosworth, Ch.

The Judge then decided that the plaintiff was entitled to recover, and so instructed the jury. The-defendant excepted. The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff for the amount of the note and interest, and from the judgment entered thereon, the present appeal is taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b542-6\"><em>J.

The notice must be delivered to the indorser, or left at his place of residence or business with a proper person, or left at such place when there is no person present. (Code, \u00a7 409; <em>U. S. Bank </em>v. <em>Hatch, </em>1 McLean, 90; <em>Rives </em>v. <em>Parmly, </em>18 Ala., 256; <em>Coster </em>v. <em>Thomason, </em>id., 717; <em>Saul </em>v. <em>Brand, </em>1 La. An. R., 95; <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Appleton, </em>3 Shep., 270; <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>13 id., 45.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-8\">II. The notice was insufficient on its face. It did not inform the indorser which note was intended. <em>(Cook </em>v. <em>Litchfield, </em>5 Sand., 330, 332; <em>S. C., </em>Ct. of Appeals, Dec., 1853; Parsons\u2019 Mercantile Law, 112; 5 Seld., 279.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-9\">III. The fa.ct that an action was pending on the note which first matured, was immaterial. The notice given referred as well to the one note as the other, and both were still unpaid. This notice would have been, in every respect true, if the six months\u2019 note had never been presented for payment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b542-10\"><em>H. G. DeForest, </em>for respondent.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-11\">I. The notice of non-payment was clearly sufficient. A notice exactly like it was passed upon in the recent case of <em>Young </em>v. <em>Lee. </em>(2 Kern., 552, and cases cited; see, also, <em>Stackman v. Pan, </em>11 M. &amp; W., 809; <em>Beals </em>v. <em>Peck, </em>12 Barb., 245; <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Litchfield, </em>2 Bosw., 137.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-12\">II. The evidence offered of the existence of another note of the.same amount did not deprive the notice of its legal sufficiency.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b542-13\">Evidence of this nature at most only tended to show that the defendant might have been misled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>The testimony that a suit had been commenced on the other note against Gilbert, and that he answered in that action before the maturity of this note was relevant to show the contrary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-5\">III. The defendant declined going to the jury upon the question whether he was misled, and the Court properly directed a verdict for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b543-6\">Moncrief, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7U\">Upon the hearing of this appeal, the defendant argued the following propositions:</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">1. The service of the notice of dishonor was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">2. The notice was insufficient on its face: it did not inform the indorser which note was intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">3. The fact that an action was pending on the note which first matured was immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">The first and last points were not much pressed upon the argument\u2014the question mainly discussed being that presented by the second point. The first point, however, was distinctly made upon the trial and now forms part of the case, and must be considered in disposing of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">Notice of the non-payment of the note was necessary in order to charge the defendant as indorser. He was entitled to such a notice as would inform him of the protest of the note' in suit. In determining whether the notice was sufficient, the circum-stances of the ease\u2014the fact that he had indorsed but two such notes; that one was past due, and either had or had not been protested; that a suit on that note was actually being litigated by him; that one was payable at three, and the other at six months after date; that the date of the present notice is the day of the maturity of the last note; all of which was within the knowledge of the defendant\u2014may be taken into consideration with a view to show that the defendant could not possibly have been misled or mistaken in regard to the meaning of the notice and the identity of the note. There could be no uncertainty as to which of the two notes was protested on the 3d of July, 1854. One had been due for three months, and a suit thereon had been pending against the defendant for nearly the same period. The other note (the note in controversy) became due on that day. A similar notice was held good in <em>Youngs </em>v. <em>Lee. </em>(2 Kern., 552; see, also, 5 Seld., 286; 23 Wend., 626.)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>It was proper to admit evidence of the fact of the suit pending upon the first note, and the answer of the defendant therein to meet\" the suggestion that he was or might be misled by the notice in the present action\u2014a suggestion based on the fact that the defendant had indorsed two notes of the same date and amount. Whether the defendant could or could not have been misled\u2019was a question of fact; and he declined to submit it to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The Court did not err in its ruling with regard to the second or third point.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">As to the service of the notice, the most liberal view that the evidence will admit on behalf of the plaintiff is, that the Notary left one notice at 64 Trinity Buildings, and sent another to the defendant\u2019s office at <em>22 </em>William street. The address marked on the note, affixed to the indorsement of the defendant, might, under certain circumstances, authorize a notice to be served upon some person at that place, or left there; but that would \u2022 not be a proper place to leave it, if the Notary knew it had ceased to be the\" defendant\u2019s place of business, unless his new place of business was not known or could not be ascertained' upon inquiry. It is the duty of the Notary, or of the holder, to make diligent search and inquiry for the maker, his place of business or residence, in order to present the note and to protest it for non-payment; and I can see no good reason why the same diligence should not be required and exercised as against the party alone to be made liable by such diligence. The proof of service should show either that the notice was served personally, or, if the indorser could not be found, that it was left at his resi denee or place of business, or furnish some sufficient reason for other service being made. It is a just inference from the evidence that the Notary knew the place of business of the defendant. The evidence did not show what place 64 Trinity Buildings was, what connection, if any, the defendant had with it, to whom, if to any person, the notice was delivered, or the relation such person had to the defendant, or what disposition was made of the notice at that place. The other notice was sent to the office of the defendant at <em>22 </em>William street. It does not appear by whom or by what means this was sent, nor to whom it was delivered, nor that- it actually reached the building having that number. This, in my opinion, is not sufficient. Notice should be brought <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>home to the defendant either by personal service or by leaving the same with some person at his place of business or residence, or some reasonable excuse should be given for the omission. (See 6 Duer, 492; 16 N. Y. R., 237; 11 Johns., 232; 3 Seld., 481; 24 Wend., 230.)</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The act of 1857, (ch. 416, p. \u25a0 839,) seems to sustain this view, as its object is to relieve holders of notes, &amp;c., from embarrassment as to the manner of serving notice in order to charge the indorsers. The act, however, in express terms, excludes from its operation all notes made prior to its passage, and, of course, does not affect the note in suit. '</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">The service of the notice not being sufficiently proved, the judgment must be reversed solely oh this ground, and a new trial ordered, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Bosworth, Oh. J., and Hoffman, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
