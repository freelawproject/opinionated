The case presenting only questions of law, they were ordered, at the trial, to be heard hr the first instance at the General Term. The action was tried before Mr. Justice Slosson and a jury, on the 23d of April, 1857. It was brought by the plaintiff (Dudley Smith), a resident of the State of New Hampshire, to recover of the defendant, Symmes Gardner, survivor, &amp;c., the amount of a promissory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>note for $1,466.20, dated 13th September, 1851, made by the firm of Gardner &amp; Bartlett, (of whom defendant is the survivor,) payable six months after date, to their own order, and by them indorsed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-5\">The defendant claims the benefit of a discharge alleged to have been obtained by him under the insolvent laws of Massachusetts, on the 19th May, 1853, whereby he insists he was discharged from liability on the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-6\">The material facts, as proved at the trial, are as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b63-7\">On or about 13th of September, 1851, the firm of Smith &amp; Lou-gee, (composed of Frederick Smith, Jr., and Charles F.

(Laws of Mass., 1838, ch. 163, \u00a7 7; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Wheaton, </em>5 Mass. R., 509; <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Bourne, </em>10 id., 337; <em>Braynard </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>8 Pick.

The plaintiff is, therefore-, entitled to judgment for the amount due on the note, as stated in the case, with interest from the time of the trial, and costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b65-5\"><em>John E. Parsons </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-6\">1. All contracts not expressly providing that they are to be performed elsewhere, are deemed to be contracts of the place where they are made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-7\">This note, for example, made in Boston, and payable generally, was payable in Boston.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-8\">Its obligation, effect, and construction, therefore, are governed, and are to be determined by the Laws of the State of Massachusetts, where it was made and was to be paid. (Story\u2019s Conf. of Laws, \u00a7\u00a7 242, 261, 263, 266, 278a, 280, 314; 2 Kent\u2019s Com., 459; Note to <em>Andrews </em>v. Herriot, 4 Cowen, 511, stating all the authorities. <em>Vide </em>all the cases cited below.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-9\">2. It follows as a part of the same rule, that a discharge which is valid by the laws of the place where the note is made, and is to be paid, is valid everywhere. (Story\u2019s Conf. of Laws, \u00a7\u00a7 331, 333, 335, 340, 346; 2 Kent\u2019s Com., 459; <em>Potter </em>v. Brown, 5 East. R., 124; <em>Blanchard </em>v. Russell, 13 Mass. R., 4.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-10\">3. That this is so where the parties to the contract are all subject to the jurisdiction of the same State, and where the law is made by an authority common to the debtor and creditor, is abundantly demonstrated by the following authorities. (<em>Smith </em>v. Smith, 2 Johns. R., 240; <em>Mather </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>16 Johns., 233; <em>Van Hook v. Whitlock, </em>26 Wend., 53; <em>Baker v. Wheaton, </em>5 Mass., 509.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-11\">4. That the residence of the parties to the contract does not vary the effect of the discharge, but that a discharge in proceedings conformed to the laws of the State where the contract was made, and is to' be performed, (the contract having been originally made between citizens of that State,) absolutely discharges all liability upon the contract, is now established to be the true rule in respect to the effect of a discharge in insolvency. Parties contract with reference to the law of the place where the contract is made; the creditor looks to the remedies which that law provides, and every assignee of a contract takes with notice of every defense to it, given as matter of course by the laws of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>place where the contract was made. The true rule is that the obligation of a contract may be discharged by the same law which gave it force. (Story\u2019s Conf. of Laws, \u00a7 340; 2 Kent\u2019s Com.; <em>Potter </em>v. Brown, 5 East. R. 123, 130; <em>Hicks </em>v. Brown, 12 Johns., 142; <em>Sherrill </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>1 Cowen, 103, 107; <em>Blanchard </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>13 Mass.

H., 38; <em>Brigham </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>1 Cushing, 430.) He also cited, and commented on, <em>(McMillan </em>v. <em>McNeill, </em>4 Wheat., 209; <em>Sturges </em>v. <em>Crowningshield, </em>id., 122; <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Moffat, </em>5 How., 295; <em>Ogden </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>12 Wheat., 213; <em>Donnelly </em>v. <em>Corbett, </em>3 Seld., 500,) and insisted that the discharge terminated all liability of the defendant, as maker of the note in suit.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b66-5\">By the Court\u2014Pierrepont, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AE\">The questions for consideration are: <em>First, </em>whether the defendant has shown a discharge under the insolvent laws of Massachusetts, by competent evidence ?</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">And <em>second, </em>whether such discharge, if proved, is a bar to this action ?</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">We have very grave doubts whether any discharge has been shown by legal proofs. But conceding the discharge to have been established, as claimed by the defendant, we think such discharge no bar to this action. The note was negotiable; and payable at no particular place. It was drawn to the makers\u2019 order; by them indorsed in blank and put into the market, in payment for goods. It passed to the plaintiff, (a resident of Hew Hampshire,) before due, in the regular course of business, and for value. It was not a contract to be performed at any particular place. It was a contract <em>to pay the holder, </em>wherever such holder might reside, at its maturity. If the maker, after default in payment, had been found in Hew Hampshire, he could have been sued there. He was found in Hew York and is sued here. <em>(Braynard </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>8 Pick., 194; <em>Savage </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>10 Met., 594.)</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">He pleads a discharge from his debts under the insolvent laws of Massachusetts, to which discharge, or to any proceedings therewith connected, the plaintiff has never been a party. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>the principle of comity between the States, our courts are asked to recognize this discharge as a good plea in bar to the action. I think it quite clear, from several decided cases, that if this suit were before the courts of Massachusetts, this discharge would not avail the defendant. <em>(Dinsmore </em>v. Bradley, 5 Gray, 487; <em>Houghton </em>v. <em>Maynard, </em>5 id., 552; <em>Savage </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>10 Met., 594; <em>Braynard </em>v. <em>Marshall, </em>8 Pick., 194.)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">It would then be something more than comity, for our courts to give effect to a Massachusetts discharge, which the courts of that State would not.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Since the case of <em>Donnelly </em>v. <em>Corbett, </em>in which Judge Gardiner delivered the opinion of the Court of Appeals, (3 Seld., 500,) the question as to the effect of a discharge under an insolvent law of a sister State, has been considered <em>settled </em>in\" New York. Corbett, a resident of South Carolina, purchased goods of Donnelly, a merchant of New'York, and gave his note for the price, payable eight months after date, at the Bank of South Carolina, in Charleston. The note was dishonored, and Donnelly recovered judgment in the State of South Carolina; a <em>ca. sa. </em>was issued upon the judgment, and Corbett was imprisoned. Subsequently he obtained a discharge from imprisonment, <em>and from his debts, </em>under the insolvent laws of South Carolina, which were passed in 1759, and perpetuated in 1783. Some two years after the discharge, Donnelly commenced suit upon the judgment, by attachment, issued out of the Supreme Court of this State. Corbett pleaded his discharge in bar. The Court <em>held </em>that the discharge was no bar to this action, although the place of the performance of the contract was in South Carolina, and although the law of that State, under which the discharge was granted, had been in force more than fifty years before the debt was contracted.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Judgment must be entered for the plaintiff, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">Judgment accordingly.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-9\"> <em>See Robinson\u2019s Practice, </em>Title \u201cEffect of discharge under Insolvent or Bankrupt Law,\u201d vol. 1, p. 89.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
