In an action against the Sheriff, for the escape of a person arrested by him upon an execution against the body of such person, it is no defense that such execution was issued before one against the property of such person had been issued and returned unsatisfied. \u00ae</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b392-5\">2. The issuing of a <em>ca. sa. </em>before the return of a <em>fi. fa. </em>unsatisfied, is an irregularity merely, and does not make the <em>ca. sa. </em>void.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b392-6\">3. Section 140 of the Code, by abolishing \u201c all the forms of pleading \u201d theretofore existing, has not affected the measure of a sheriff\u2019s liability for the escape of a person committed on a <em>ca. sa., </em>as declared by 2 R. S., 437, \u00a7 66. [Sec. 63.]</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b392-7\">4. In such a case, the sheriff is liable for the debt, damages, or sum of money for which such prisoner was committed, and such debt, damages, or sum of money may be recovered of the sheriff, since the Code, where the complaint states all the facts essential, according to the former practice, to a good declaration in debt; and prays judgment for the amount of the judgment on which such prisoner was committed.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b392-8\">5.

In an action for the escape of a prisoner committed on a <em>ca. sa., </em>and duly admitted to the jail liberties; where the escape counted on is alleged and proved to have occurred in August, 1855, it is no defense that in January of that year there was \u00e1 prior escape; if it appears that the prisoner voluntarily returned into custody and continued there until the second escape, and ii does not appear that the plaintiff had any notice of the first escape before the return of the prisoner into custody; although the action is brought more than a year after the first escape, and the defendant pleads the statute of limitations.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b392-10\">(Before Bosworth, Ch.

That n\u00f3 execution against the property of Poly had been issued or returned, before the issuing of the execution against his person.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-7\">The Court overruled the motion upon each and every of the said points so taken, and to the decision of the Court the defendant excepted, and the exception was duly noted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-8\">The defendant\u2019s counsel then proved that Poly was in Ohio in January and March, 1855, and that he returned to the city; of Hew York in the spring or summer of that year. There was no evidence that the plaintiff or the defendant .knew,.or had,any r\u00e9asoh to suspect that Poly had been to Ohio, until after his .return within the jail limits of the city and county of Hew York. The defendant.also gave evidence in relation to the property.and pecuniary means of Poly at the time he left for California, and rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-9\">The plaintiff then proved that an. execution against the property of Poly had been issued to the defendant as Sheriff of Hew York \u00bfounty, on plaintiff\u2019s judgment against Poly, and that the issuing of the execution against Poly\u2019s body, before the actual return of the execution against his property, was in consequence of information given at the office of the Sheriff by his deputy, t\u00f3 the plaintiff\u2019s attorney^ that the latter execu \u2022 tion had been actually returned unsatisfied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-10\">The evidence tended to show that the deputy was not accu rately understood by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, or that his answer to the question whether they?, <em>fa. </em>had be,en returned, was calculated to be und\u00e9rstood in a sense different from that intended by the deputy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-11\"><em>Th.tdfi. ~fa. </em>was not in fact returned until three days after the <em>ca, sa, </em>was issued to the Sheriff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-12\">When the\" testimony was closed on both sides, the defendant\u2019s counsel moved that the complaint be dismissed on the follpwing grounds: \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-13\">1. By reason of the escape to Ohio, the cause of action accrued more than one year before the commencement of the suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b394-14\">2.

In answer to the question, \u201cWhat was the value of Solomon Poly\u2019s property on the 12th day of August, 1856?\u201d the jury answered, \u201c Not shown.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-11\">The court thereupon directed a general verdict to be entered for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the Court at General Term, upon a motion, to be made by the plaintiff for judgment founded upon a case and exceptions; the defendant\u2019s exceptions to be inserted and to be heard in the first instance at General Term at the same time, with liberty to the Court to adjust the verdict, or to enter judgment for the defendant, or for a dismissal of the complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b395-12\">At the February General Term, 1859, the defendant moved that the verdict be set aside and a new trial ordered, and the plaintiff at the same time moved for judgment on the verdict.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b395-13\"><em>William </em>Stanley, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b395-14\"><em>David Dudley </em>Field, for defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b395-15\">By the Court\u2014Bosworth, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkH\">On the argument before us, the counsel for the defendant submitted the following points, (and neither argued nor suggested any other,) viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>\u201cI. The execution against the person of Poly was void; no execution against his property having been previously issued and returned. (Code, \u00a7\u00a7 178, 288, 283; 3 Abbott, 229.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">\u201cII. If Poly had been legally arrested his escape took place as early as March, 1855. This action was not commenced until April, 1856. It should have been brought within the year. (Code, \u00a794.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">\u201c If it is stated that Poly returned into custody after the escape to Ohio, the answer is, that there is no proof of such return. All the proof is of his being afterwards in the city of Hew York.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">\u201c III. The plaintiff sustained' no damage by Poly\u2019s escape; he had no property beyond what was exempt from execution. This action is for damages. (17 Wend., 543; 3 Seld., 195, 550.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">On the argument, the defendant\u2019s counsel stated that he should argue the first point only, and did not argue any other, at the same time stating that he did not intend to thereby waive either of the other of said two points, or to concede the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover interest on his judgment, if entitled to recover at all, or that in the latter event, he was entitled to recover mote than he had actually lost by reason of the escape of Poly.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">The points made by the defendant\u2019s printed points, will be considered in their order.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">By the 7th section of \u201c An act concerning judgments and executions,\u201d passed April 2, 1813, (1 R. L., 502,) it was provided that \u201cho execution shall hereafter issue upon any judgment rendered as aforesaid, in any action in which special bail shall have been filed, against the body of any defendant\u201d .* * \u201cuntil an execution against the goods and chattels, lands and tenements of such defendant shall have been issued upon such judgment,\u201d &amp;c., and shall have been returned, no property, &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">2 Revised Statutes, (p. 363, \u00a7 4,) contains a provision of the same import, though in not exactly the same words.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-11\">Section 288 of the Code is not, like the two statutes last cited, prohibitory in its terms, but merely declares, that if the action be one in which the defendant might have been arrested, as provided in section 179 and section 181, an execution may be issued against the body, after the return of an execution against his property has been returned unsatisfied, in whole or in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Under the act of 1813, it was expressly adjudged, that the Sheriff, when sued for the escape of a judgment debtor, who was in custody on a <em>ca. sa., </em>could not set up as a defense, that the debtor had been held to bail in such action, and had actually filed special bail, and that no execution against his property had been issued and returned unsatisfied. <em>(Hinman </em>v. <em>Beers, Sheriff, </em>13 J. R., 529.) The Court held that, at most, it was an irregularity, and the only remedy was a motion to set the execution aside, that it was not void, but was merely voidable. <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>(13 J. R., 378,) is to the same effect. These cases were decided in 1816, more than 40 years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">In 1828, in the case of the <em>Ontario Bank </em>v. <em>Hallett, </em>(8 Cow., 192,) the Court decided that, in such an action, it was no defense to the Sheriff that the <em>ca.sa. </em>was issued after a year and a day from the perfecting of the judgment, without the previous issuing of a <em>sci. fa., </em>and cited the two cases in 13 J. R., <em>supra, </em>as an authority for the proposition. (See <em>Ames et al. </em>v. <em>Webbers, Sheriff, </em>8 Wend., 545; <em>Anonymous, </em>2 Hill, 378; <em>Commercial Bank of Oswego </em>v. <em>Ives, </em>2 Hill, 354; Graham\u2019s Practice, 2d ed., 364, 365; 6 How. Pr. R., 73.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">We cannot hold the execution against the body in this case void, without disregarding a long series of express adjudications. If it is irregular merely, and not absolutely void, the def\u00e9ndant\u2019s counsel does not contend that the Sheriff can defend on the ground that an execution against property had not been previously issued and returned unsatisfied. His argument is, that the <em>ca. sa. </em>is void, and that the Sheriff, therefore, is not bound to execute it, and that the fact of its being void is a defense to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">We consider ourselves required by the decisions to which we have referred to hold, that the <em>ca. sa. </em>was irregular merely, and not void, and that the irregularity in issuing it is no defense to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">The escape was a negligent and not a voluntary escape. The return of Poly within the jail limits, after he had been in Ohio, would be an answer and a defense to an action brought aftei such return and while he continued within the limits, for an escape based on his absence from the limits while in Ohio. <em>(Howland </em>v. <em>Squier, </em>9 Cow., 91; <em>Vanhoesen </em>v. <em>Holley, </em>9 Wend., 209; 2 R. S., 435, \u00a7 51, [sec. 48;] id., 437, sec. 64.) There is, therefore, no defense proved arising out of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>Section MO of the Code, by abolishing \u201c all the forms of pleading \u201d theretofore existing, has not changed the liability of a sheriff as declared by 2 Revised Statutes, 437, section, 66, [sec. 63.] By the latter section, the sheriff, in case of the escape of a prisoner .committed to the jail of his county, in execution in a civil action, is liable to the plaintiff in such execution \u201cfor the debt, damages, or sum of money for- which such prisoner was committed.\u201d That section prescribed the action of debt, as the-one in-which such liability for that sum was to be enforced. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">The Code has abolished a <em>capias ad respondendum, </em>and a \u201c declaration,\u201d as a process or proceeding by the service of which an action may be commenced. It requires a plaintiff to state in his complaint the facts constituting his cause of action. The plaintiff in the present-action has done that, and alleged in -his complaint all that was requisite to be stated, in an action of debt; and his complaint concludes with demanding \u201cjudgment against the defendant for five hundred and twelve dollars and four cents,\u201d- (the face of the judgment,) \u201cwith interest -from the 15th of September, 1854,\u201d (the date' of the judgment,) \u201c and the costs of this action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">This is hot an action for the recovery of damages, as such, but is an action to \u201c recover the sum- of money for which such prisoner \u201d (Poly) \u201c was committed \u201d in execution to the jail of defendant\u2019s .county, at the time of .the alleged-escape.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">The Sheriff is liable,, at all-events, for $512.04, the amount of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">The only decisions to which w\u00e9-were-referred, or which have fallen under our observation, hold that, in. an- action'of debt \"for the escape of a defendant in custody on-a <em>ca. sa., </em>only- the -face of the judgment, without interest, is recoverable. \u25a0 \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"AH2\"><em>Rawson </em>v. <em>Dole. </em>(2 J. R., 454.) This case arose prior to the passage of the statute allowing interest upon the amount of - the judgment-to be collected or demanded ripon the execution-issued thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\"><em>Van Slyck </em>v. <em>Hogeboom, </em>(6 J. R., 270 and note <em>d,) Thomas </em>v. <em>Weed, </em>(14 <em>Id., </em>255,) <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Brand. </em>(6 How. Pr. R., 73.) The point of these cases seems to be, that the action of- -debt is in the nature of a penalty, and, by resorting to that action,' the plaintiff,- on the one hand, is not permitted to recover inore than the amount of the judgment, and, on the other, is- not exposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>to the hazard of having his recovery reduced below that sum, by proof of the pecuniary irresponsibility of the judgment debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">If he chooses to sue in ease, as he may do, he may recover more than the face of the judgment if his actual damages are shown to exceed it, and will be exposed to the recovery of nominal damages only, if the debtor shall be proved to be utterly insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">We think that the plaintiff should have judgment for $512.04, and for that sum only.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
