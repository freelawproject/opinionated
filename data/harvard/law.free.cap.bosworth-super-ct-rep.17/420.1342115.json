Where the Directors of a Bank allow its Cashier for several years in succession, without interference or inquiry by them, to transact the business of the Bank in such .manner as in his judgment may be proper and for its interest, they thereby, in effect, authorize him to make all and any contracts which he deems expedient in relation to its business which the Directors might lawfully make, and such contracts will conclude the Bank as between it and a party who has dealt with it through such Cashier, and on the faith of his having authority to make such contracts, has loaned <em>money to </em>such Bank; provided the charter of such Bank does not prohibit it from making such contracts through its Cashier.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b428-9\">2. When such a Cashier applies to another Bank for a loan of its circulating MBs, upon the security of certain assets of the borrowing Bank, and on such apphcation a loan is agreed to be made upon security stipulated to be given, and in pursuance of such agreement the loan is made, and the MBs lent are forwarded from time to time to the borrowing Bank directed to its CasMer and are there received, and the borrowing Bank fails to perform the agreement made by its CasMer; and thereupon the stipulated security is transferred to the lending Bank as originaBy agreed, the latter may enforce the same to coBect the sum due it, and if it consists of MBs discounted by the borrowing Bank, the acceptors or indorsers of such MBs cannot set up as a defense to an action against them as such acceptors and indorsers, that the lending Bank by force of such transaction acquired no title, but that the MBs sued on, notwithstanding such transaction, continue to be the property of the borrowing Bank.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b428-10\">3. Nor wiB it impair the title of the lending Bank to such securities, that the Cashier of the borrowing Bank gave a note for the sum so borrowed signed by Miuself individuaBy, and payable to his order as CasMer, if in fact the apphcation was for a loan to Ms Bank and on its credit, and the loan was in good faith so made.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b428-11\">4. The mere fact, that some bids are forwarded by the lending to the borrowing Bank, under the contract to loan, the circulation of which as money is made Blegal by a statute of the State in wMch the borrowing Bank is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>located, (but not by its charter,) and of which statute the borrowing Batik had no knowledge, will not affect the validity of the contract to loan, nor the title of the lending Bank to the securities transferred to it by virtue of such contract.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b429-5\">5. The fact that the money so loaned and sent to the borrowing Bank, was used by the Cashier of the latter for his individual purposes, and not in the business of l\u00f1s Bank, will not affect the validity of the contract to loan, nor the title of the lending Bank to the securities so transferred to it, so as to prevent its collecting the same and retaining from their proceeds sufficient to satisfy the sum justly due to it</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b429-6\">(Before Bosworth, Ch.

It was tried on the 12th of January, 1858, before Mr, Justice Woodruff and a jury, when a verdict was ordered in favor of the plaintiffs for $36,541.95.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-9\">The defendant is sued, in this action, as the drawer of two several bills of exchange, for the sum of $10,000 each, one dated the 18th and the other the 28th of August, 1854, each payable three months from its date, at the American Exchange Bank, New York; and as the acceptor of two other bills of exchange, for the sum of $5,000 each, one bearing date September 5th, the other September 23d, and each payable three months from its date, at the same Bank. The plaintiffs sue as indorsees of these four bills.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-10\">The defenses set up in the answer are, that the plaintiffs are not the lawful owners or holders of either of the bills; that they obtained possession of the bills unlawfully, and have no title thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b429-11\">The answer also states, as a separate, and as the fourth defense, that, on the 23d day of November, 1854, these bills were the property of the Bank of Akron, Ohio; that such Bank committed an act of insolvency on that day, and thereupon, by force of its charter, these bills, became the property of the State Bank of Ohio; that, on the 5th of December, 1854, the State Bank of Ohio commenced a suit in Ohio against the parties to this action and others, to collect the said bills; and that such suit was commenced according to the laws of Ohio before this action was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>commenced, and the same is still pending, and the pendency of such suit is set up in bar, or in abatement, of the present action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-5\">The answer also states, as a separate, and as the fifth defense, that these .bills belonged to the said Bank of Akron, and were lodged by it in said American Exchange Bank for collection, and the proceeds thereof were to be credited to the Bank of Akron, which, or the State Bank of Ohio, as' its representative, is now the lawful owner thereof; that while they were so in said American Exchange Bank, the plaintiffs improperly got possession of them, and are now attempting to collect them and apply the proceeds to pay a pretended debt due to the plaintiffs from one J. W. McMillen, the consideration of which grew out of certain Bank notes of the plaintiffs which said McMillen agreed to circulate for the'plaintiffs in the State of Ohio, illegally and contrary to the statutes of the State of Ohio; and that the claims, or pretended claims, of the plaintiffs against McMillen are illegal and void, and are the claims for which the plaintiffs now seek to hold the said bills of exchange or drafts as security. The answer concludes by denying that the defendant is indebted to the plaintiffs on account of said bills; and prays a dismissal of the complaint, with c\u00f3sts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-6\">On the trial, the bills sued on were produced, and after the indorsement of them by the American Exchange Bank, and a delivery of them by that Bank to the plaintiffs, had been proved, they were read in evidence. The drawing, accepting and indorsement of the bills, (except the indorsements so as aforesaid proved,) were admitted by the pleadings.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-7\">Ezra 0. Read, a witness for the plaintiffs, testified that he had been President of the City Bank of New Haven for the then last nine or ten years; that F. Bradley was Cashier until October, 1857 ; that he was introduced, in July, 1851, to John W. McMillen by a letter from the Cashier of the American Exchange Bank, New York, which letter was produced and read in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-8\">That \u201c an application was made for a loan for $50,000 from the City Bank of New Haven to the Bank of Akron; the arrangement was closed in July, 1851; the rate of interest settled upon; an arrangement was made to send the money in installments ; the nature of the securities was arranged-; the money was to be advanced at our convenience in the bills of the City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Bank; the security was to be collateral paper in the American Exchange Bank of this city, or which should be there for collection ; that is, the security was the pledge of the discounted bills of the Bank of Akron which were, or which should be, placed in the American Exchange Bank for collection; Mr. McMillen was to give his notes, indorsed by himself as Cashier of the Bank of Akron. * * Mr. McMillen offered security; he offered the notes of the Bank; I doubted the power or right of the Bank of Akron, whether it was competent for the Bank of Akron, and so stated to Mr. McMillen, to give their paper; I objected to it in that form; Mr. McMillen said he could obviate that objection by giving his own note, and indorsing it as Cashier; he said he had full authority from the Bank for that purpose; this loan was to be made for one year; before the loan was made, I received a written communication in relation to it The following is- the letter:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-6\">\u201c Bank of Akron,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-7\">\u201c Ohio, July 30, 1851.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-8\">E.

The loan made by the City Bank of Hew Haven to the Cashier of the Bank of Akron, was not valid or binding upon the latter Bank. The Cashier of a Bank, as such, has no power to borrow money for the Bank. That is a power intrusted exclusively to the Board of Directors. A Cashier, or any other agent, undertaking to exercise such a power, must produce a special authority from the Board of Directors for that purpose. <em>(Hallowell and Augusta Bank </em>v. Hamlin, 14 Mass., 180; <em>Hartford Bank </em>v. Barry, 17 id., 97.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"137\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-7\">If the money borrowed had been applied to the use of the Bank, and the benefit of the loan thus received and retained, that might have amounted to a ratification of the loan. But it was proved, without contradiction, that the money was in fact borrowed by the Cashier for his own private use, and no part of it was ever applied to the use of the Bank. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"138\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-8\">II. Assuming the loan to have been valid and binding, the Cashier had no power to pledge the property of the Bank as security for its repayment. The fact that the property consisted of negotiable paper is wholly immaterial, the rights of a subsequent <em>bona fide holder not </em>being in question. <em>(Hoyt </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>1 Seld., 320.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"139\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-9\">III. The plaintiffs were not purchasers of the bills sued on for a valuable consideration. The money was all advanced before the bills were received, and no value or right was parted with on the faith of them. It will be contended that the bills were received in pursuance and in execution of a previous contract. But'this does not make the plaintiffs purchasers for value within the meaning of the rule. The contract was not applicable to any particular bills; and it appears that the President of the City Bank selected such as he chose. It is impossible that the mere election of the plaintiffs to take these bills, instead of others, should make them a purchaser for value. <em>(Stalker </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>6 Hill, 93.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"140\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-10\">IT. The contract between the plaintiffs and the Cashier of the Bank of Akron was illegal and void, as being in violation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>law of Ohio, where it was to be performed.

The case of <em>Hyde </em>v. <em>Goodnow, </em>(3 Comst., 269,) is in point to show that our Courts will give the same effect to the laws of Ohio that the Courts of Ohio would do, even as against our own citizens. Much more will they do so in the present case, when a citizen of Connecticut sues a citizen of Ohio, in this State.

It is conclusively proved that the plaintiffs, in February, 1851, at Hew Haven, in Connecticut, agreed to lend to the Bank of Akron $50,000, on the security of a pledge of bills of exchange belonging to the Bank of Akron, and sent to the American Exchange Bank, in Hew York, for collection. That the sum of $50,000 was, pursuant to such agreement, advanced and lent by the plaintiffs to the Bank of Akron, and, by order' or letter addressed to the American Exchange Bank, bills of exchange discounted by and belonging to the Bank of Akron, sent to the American Exchange Bank for collection, to the amount of $60,000, were duly pledged to plaintiffs, to secure the payment of said loan. That in October, 1854, $20,000 of said amount loaned remained due to plaintiffs, and the bills in question, which belonged to the Bank of Akron, and had been sent to the American Exchange Bank for collection, were received by the plaintiffs from the American Exchange Bank under said pledge, and are now sought to be collected by the plaintiffs as such pledgees.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"145\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-9\">III.

There is no proof or ground for pretense that the plaintiffs, in the transaction with the Bank of Akron, intended to violate any law of the State of Ohio, or did any act intentionally to promote or aid any such violation; or even had knowledge that, by any law of the State of Ohio, the circulation of the bills of foreign Banks by the Banks of Ohio was prohibited, and this action would be sustained in Ohio. <em>(Merchants' Bank </em>v. <em>Spalding, </em>5 Seld., 53-63.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"154\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-5\">IX. The Court will not be astute to so construe the law or apply the evidence as to sustain the defense in this action. It is proved, and not denied, that the defendant owes the amount of the bills in \u25a0 suit, and that the plaintiffs hold them for full consideration paid in good faith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"155\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-6\">The defense is, therefore, unjust and inequitable, and, to be successful, must be fully and strictly made out. Every intendment will be against it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"156\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-7\">X. There was no error in any ruling or decision of the Judge presiding at the trial, nor in his direction to the jury to render a verdict for plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"157\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-8\">Judgment should now be rendered for plaintiffs for the amount of the verdict, with interest and costs.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"158\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b447-9\">By the Court\u2014Bosworth, Ch. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJy\">The drawing, accepting and indorsing of the bills, as alleged in the complaint, except the indorsement of them by the American Exchange Bank to the plaintiffs, are admitted by the pleadings. The indorsement to the plaintiffs, by that Bank, was proved at the trial, and thus the apparent legal title in the plaintiffs was established.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">Whether the plaintiffs are the legal owners and holders of the bills, or whether they continue to be the property of the Bank of Akron, depends upon the authority of J. W. McMillen, the Cashier of the Bank of Akron, to transfer them to the plaintiffs as they were transferred, and whether the contract as part of which the transfer was made is valid, or void as being prohibited by any law of Ohio by which the plaintiffs\u2019 title can be affected.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">The defendant has no defense to a suit upon the bills, by and in the name of the lawful owner of them. His defense is based solely on the alleged absence of any lawful title in the plaintiffs, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>and on the allegation that the Bank of Akron is the true and lawful owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">In July, 1851, McMillen, then being Cashier of the Bank of Akron, applied, as such Cashier, to the plaintiffs for the loan of $50,000, of their bills, to the Bank of Akron, for the term of one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The plaintiffs agreed to make the loan to the Bank of Akron,' upon the terms; of interest at the rate of four per cent, payable and to be paid semi-annually at the American Exchange Bank, New York, and of the bills so lent, being redeemed weekly at such Bank by the Bank of Akron, as they should be returned to the plaintiffs, and of $60,000 of the collection paper belonging to the Bank of Akron, and held at any time by the American Exchange Bank, being pledged as collateral security to the' plaintiffs, and that while such loan continued there should be at no time less than $60,000 in amount of such paper held by the American Exchange Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">A paper directed to the Cashier of the American Exchange Bank, and signed by McMillen as Cashier of the Bank of Akron, stating the fact and terms of such pledge, was delivered to the plaintiffs, and notice of it was given to the Cashier of the American Exchange Bank, who assented to it and agreed to hold the paper so pledged, subject to any claims of the Bank, of which he was Cashier.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">The bills to beso loaned were tobe marked in a manner agreed \u2022upon to secure their identification, and were to be furnished to the Bank of Akron, as fast as the convenience of the plaintiffs would allow.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Under this arrangement, the plaintiffs, in August, 1851, commenced sending their bills to the Bank of Akron, and in January, 1852, had -forwarded the whole $50,000. They were forwarded in packages, by express, directed to McMillen, as Cashier of the Bank of Akron, and were received b3r him at that Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-10\">As fast as the bills, after they were put in circulation, were returned to the plaintiffs, they were redeemed at the American Exchange Bank, for the Bank of Akron, and on its account, and out of its funds, and thereupon the amount thus redeemed was again returned to the Bank of Akron by the plaintiffs, in the same manner as those originally loaned had been forwarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>The interest on the $50,000 was regularly paid semi-annually by the American Exchange Bank to the plaintiffs, for and on account of the Bank of Akron, and out of its funds. The loan was continued beyond the time originally agreed upon, and upon the terms on which it was originally made. This course of redeeming the notes, as they came back to the plaintiffs, and of re-issuing and sending to the Bank of Akron the same amount as was from time to time so returned and redeemed, and of paying interest semi-annually on the whole sum loaned, was continued until about the 11th of November, 1854. The American Exchange Bank then declined to redeem notes that had been so returned to the plaintiffs, and thereupon the plaintiffs obtained from that Bank, under the pledge and agreement in relation thereto, a transfer of collection paper held by it belonging to the Bank of Akron, amounting to a little over $59,000, and the paper so transferred included \"the bills on which this action is brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">McMillen, as such Cashier, had authority-to borrow money for the Bank of Akron. To what extent he borrowed for the Bank, the evidence does not disclose. He had, practically, the whole management of the business of that Bank. Its Board of Directors met semi-annually, but according to.the evidence before us, did not, at those meetings, or at other times, inquire as to the details of its business, the mode of its operations, or into the manner in which the Cashier was prosecuting its business.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Under such circumstances, we think the plaintiffs are entitled to have this controversy determined upon the principle, that as between them and the Bank of Akron, the Cashier of the latter was fully authorized to borrow money for it, and in' its name, and that any loan made by the plaintiffs, in good faith, on an application of the Cashier of the Akron Bank, as such Cashier, to borrow for it, is a loan to that Bank, and that such Bank is primarily liable for such loan, as the party borrowing.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">In <em>Beers </em>v. <em>Ph\u0153nix Class </em>Company, (14 Barb. S. C. R., 858-861,) it was held, that in order to make particular transactions of the officers of a corporation binding upon the corporation itself, it is not necessary to prove they were directly authorized. \u201c If the directors of a company, no matter whether through inattention or otherwise, suffer its subordinate officers to pursue a par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>ticular line of conduct for a considerable period, without objection, they are as much bound to those who are not aware of any want of authority, as if the requisite power had been directly conferred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">These transactions extended over a period of three years. The bills originally loaned, and those sent as a substitute for bills returned to the plaintiffs in the ordinary course of circulation for redemption, were sent to the Bank of Akron directed to its Cashier, and were received at that Bank by such Cashier.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The bills loaned, as they came back to the plaintiffs, were redeemed from time to time in the name of the Bank of Akron, by its agent in Hew York, the American Exchange Bank, with the funds of the Bank of Akron; and the American Exchange Bank, as such agent, also paid the semi-annual interest on the sum loaned by the plaintiffs to the Bank of Akron, and out of the funds of the latter Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">All the letters from McMillen to the plaintiffs relating to his transactions with them, (which are of any importance,) are either dated \u201cBank of Akron,\u201d or \u201cState Bank of Ohio,\u201d \u201cBank of Akron, Akron,\u00bb Ohio,\u201d and are signed by him as Cashier.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">These letters are numerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">It was said in <em>The New Hope &amp; Delaware Bridge Company </em>v. <em>Ph\u0153nix </em>Bank, (3 Comst., 166,) that \u201c a letter from the Cashier on the business of his Bank is a letter from the Bank; a letter to the Cashier relating to the business of his Bank is a letter to his Bank; and the Bank is chargeable with knowledge of the contents of such letter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">The American Exchange Bank, as it redeemed' for the Bank of Akron and with its funds, from time to time, the bills returned in the course <em>of </em>circulation to the plaintiffs, and as it also paid' interest for the Bank of Akron out of its funds semi-annually, on the sum loaned, must be presumed to have advised the Bank of' Akron of the fact of such payments. There is no pretense, nor attempt to show that this was not done, nor that the Bank of Akron objected to such acts, or refused to allow such payments, or questioned the power of its Cashier to authorize or direct such payments to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\">We think it, therefore, quite clear, that the Cashier of the Bank of Akron had authority as such to borrow money for that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>Bank. That the sum. loaned by the plaintiffs on the application of such Cashier to borrow for that Bank, was a loan to that Bank, and that such Bank is liable for its repayment as the principal in the transaction, and the party borrowing. And that the bills in question were transferred to the plaintiffs to enable them, by a collection of such bills and out of their proceeds, to obtain payment of a debt due to them from the Bank of Akron, and not, as the answer alleges, to obtain payment of a debt due from McMillen to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">\u25a0 There is no force in the objection that the bills so borrowed of the plaintiffs were not, in fact, used by the Cashier of the Bank of Akron, for its benefit and in prosecuting its business, even if the evidence given, is, for the purposes of this action, to be treated as competent and sufficient to establish, <em>prima </em>fade, that fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The bills were borrowed for the Bank of Akron, and were loaned to it, and on . its credit and on the security of a portion of its assets, and were sent by the plaintiffs to that Bank, and were received at the Bank by its Cashier, and were retained in its banking house until they were paid out at its counter.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">In judgment of law, they came into the possession of the Bank of Akron as absolutely as if they had been delivered to the Board of Directors at a regular and full meeting of its members. What the Cashier or the Directors, or either of them, subsequently did with the bills, cannot impair the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, either at law or in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">There could be no doubt of the validity of the transfer of the bills of exchange in question, if it had been directly authorized by the Board of Directors.. There is nothing in any part of the charter of the Bank, which has been given in evidence, that prohibits the delegation of authority to the Cashier to borrow mofiey upon such terms as the loan in question was made, or to transfer such portion of its discounted bills as may be reasonable in amount, for collection, and to pay its just liabilities out of the proceeds thereof when collected. <em>(The City Bank of Columbus </em>v. <em>Bruce &amp; Fox, </em>17 N. Y. R, 514, 515.)</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">When, as in this case, the Cashier of a Bank has actual authority to borrow money for it, and the whole management of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>business and the mode of conducting its operations are confided by the Directors to him, and so absolutely so, that his operations and mode of doing business are not examined into by them at all for years, a party who deals with and loans money to such Bank, on the faith that, the .acts of such Cashier, in borrowing and securing it, are authorized by his Bank, is as much entitled to protection as if such acts had b\u00e9en directly authorized, when such acts are of a character that it may reasonably be supposed they have been authorized by the Bank, and the business transactions between such party and such Cashier have been done openly and publicly, and in such manner that the Directors, if they had given even ordinary attention to its business, would have been informed of such transactions, and of the particulars thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Especially should it be-so held, when the contract sought to be enforced is one which the Bank was competent to make, and upholding it violates no rule of law or principle of public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">There is no pretense that the nature and extent of the authority of the Cashier of the Bank of Akron have ever been defined by any direct act of the corporation. On the contrary, he has been permitted, as being within the scope and limits of his authority, to exercise a large range of powers, and his own judgment as to the transactions which he deemed to be for the interest of the Bank, and the terms on which he should contract, in \u25a0 making engagements as its agent, which the Bank might lawfully make.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">, Such exclusive control and management for so long a period by the Cashier, with the assent of the Directors, amounts to an authority to him to make contracts, in relation to its business which the bank might lawfully make, and will conclude the Bank as between it and a party who has dealt directly with it through such Cashier, and who, on the faith of his having authority to make such a contract, has loaned money to, or paid it for such Bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">The circumstance, that McMillen gave his own note to the plaintiffs for the sum borrowed, we regard as of no consequence under the particular facts and circumstances of this case. It cannot detract from the force of the fact that the loan was made to the Bank of Akron as the party borrowing, nor impair any obligation which it assumed by the contract made in its behalf and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>in its name by its authorized agent, to repay the sum borrowed, or in relation <em>to </em>the securities promised, and subsequently in execution of such promise actually transferred to the plaintiffs, as the means and for the purpose of obtaining payment of the sum lent.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">If the views already stated are sound, the remaining questions presented by the case can be disposed of briefly.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Such parts of the charter of the Bank of Akron as were given in evidence do not prohibit the Bank of Akron from paying out or putting in circulation any notes issued by any Bank which redeemed its notes in gold and silver, and which the Bank of Akron received at par in payment of debts, if of a denomination not less than $5.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The contract relating to the loan contains no provision conflict, ing with this part of the charter. It \"was no part of the contract that the plaintiffs should furnish, or that the Bank of Akron should receive, from them, as part of the loan, any bill of a denomination less than $5.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">There is no evidence that the plaintiffs knew of the existence of the general statute of the State of Ohio, entitled, \u201c An act to amend the act supplementary to the act to prevent unauthorized banking and the circulation of unauthorized bank paper, passed February 24,1848,\u201d sections 1 and 4 of which are inserted in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">On the 9th of October, 1854, the Cashier of the Bank of Akron returned to the plaintiffs a package of 5s, amounting to $4,600, with notice that the law of Ohio prohibiting the circulation of foreign bills under 10s took effect on the 1st of that month, and <em>\u201c </em>causes them to return so rapidly that we are obliged to return these, asking you to please to substitute 10s in their stead, and also for all others you may redeem hereafter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">There is, therefore, no evidence that the plaintiffs knew, or had reason to suspect, when they agreed to loan the $50,000, or when they furnished the bills to that amount under their agreement to loan, or returned bills which they had redeemed, that the Bank of Akron, or its Cashier in behalf of that Bank, intended to use the bills in a manner or for a purpose prohibited by any statute of the State of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">Whatever the undisclosed purpose or intent of such Cashier may have been, there is no ground for pretending that the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>tiffs stipulated, as a part of their contract, that anything should be done with the bills loaned that would violate any statute of that State.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">' <em>The Merchants' Bank of New York </em>v. Spalding, (5 Seld., 53,) and <em>Tracy </em>v. <em>Talmage, </em>Pres't, (4 Kern., 162,) are decisive of any defense based on the allegation of its being part of the agreement that acts should be done that would violate a known, or, in fact, any statute of the State of Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">The point of the fifth defense is, that \u201c the plaintiffs improperly got possession\u201d of the bills of exchange on which this suit is brought, \u201cand are attempting to collect them of this defendant,\u201d -x- * \u201cand to apply the proceeds thereof to the payment of a pretended debt due from one J. W. McMillen to the plaintiffs, the consideration of which pretended indebtedness arose out of certain Bank notes of \"the plaintiffs, which said McMillen <em>agreed to circulate for the plaintiffs in the State of </em>Ohio, <em>illegally and contrary to the statutes of the State of Ohio.\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">What the terms of these statutes or their titles are, or when they were passed, is not alleged nor intimated. Nor are the terms of the alleged agreement, as to circulating the plaintiffs' bills, stated either in detail or generally. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">No agreement to actually circulate is proved. It was undoubtedly expected that they would be paid out in Ohio, and the circulation obtained that might result from such an act. But there was no agreement in respect to the fact of circulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">No statute is proved, of which the plaintiffs are shown to have had any knowledge or notice, which could have been violated by the circulation of any bills which the plaintiffs agreed to furnish, or, at the time of making the contract, were asked to furnish under it. ,</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">The plaintiffs hold the bills of exchange sued upon as regular indorsees, and are attempting to collect them to obtain payment of a debt justly due to them from the Bank of Akron. They were delivered to the plaintiffs under a written authority and pledge of them, or a pledge which operated upon them from the moment of such delivery, formally executed by the Cashier of that Bank, upon the faith of, and in reliance upon which pledge, the loan has been continued and extended from one year to three years in duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>The plaintiffs, if the views we have expressed are correct, did not \u201cimproperly get possession\u201d of these bills of exchange, but, on the contrary, obtained possession of them lawfully and for a just purpose, and are attempting to collect them to satisfy\" a valid debt owing to them by the Bank of Akron.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">They should not be defeated in their action to recover upon them, upon the evidence given at the trial in support of the issues raised by the defendant\u2019s answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">The motion for a new trial must be denied, and a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs entered on the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Judgment ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
