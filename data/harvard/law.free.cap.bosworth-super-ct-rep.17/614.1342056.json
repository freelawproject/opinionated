C. W. Wedekind. He was so appointed on proceedings supplementary to execution, in an action in which one Benjamin Marsh was plaintiff, and said Wedekind was defendant. Certain promissory notes made by <em>\u201c </em>I. B. Hussey &amp; Co.,\u201d alleged to consist of the defendants, \u201c Isaac B. Hussey and David Clark, had,\u201d by indorsement of the payee thereof, come to the possession of Wedekind, and they were delivered by the latter to the plaintiff as such Receiver.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-11\">In April, 1856, the plaintiff, as such Receiver, sired Isaac B. Hussey and David Clark as the makers of said notes, and also made the first indorsers, parties defendants. The defendant, David Clark, separately answered the complaint, and at the trial obtained a verdict.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b622-12\">The moving affidavit states, <em>winter alia, </em>that the defendant Clark, \u201c on the 30th of October, 1858, recovered a judgment against this deponent, as such Receiver as aforesaid, for $80, costs of said action,\u201d and on the 2d of November, 1858, without any order of the Court, issued an execution, directing the amount of the judgment to be collected from the individual property of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>plaintiff; that the plaintiff, as such Receiver, never had any property or effects, except the notes on which this suit is brought; that before said execution was issued, the defendants\u2019 attorneys demanded of him payment of the judgment, which he refused to pay, and stated, as the ground of such refusal, the facts above recited. Bosworth, Ch. J., before whom the motion to set the said execution aside was made, denied it, and assigned the fob lowing reasons, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-5\">\u201c The plaintiff is not an 1 executor,\u2019 1 administrator,\u2019 <em>\u2018 </em>trustee of an express trust,\u2019 nor 1 a person expressly authorized by the statute \u2019 to bring suits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-6\"><em>\u201c </em>He is not protected by section 317 of the Code from the consequences which section 305 visits upon a plaintiff who brings an action for the recovery of money, (\u00a7 304, sub. 4,) and has a verdict pass against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-7\">\u201c Before the Code, a Receiver, who sued at law without previous leave of the Court, paid costs as a matter of course. Sections 304 (sub. 4) and 305 leave him, in this respect, precisely as the preexisting law did.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b623-8\">From the order denying that motion, the plaintiff appealed to the General Term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b623-9\"><em>A.
