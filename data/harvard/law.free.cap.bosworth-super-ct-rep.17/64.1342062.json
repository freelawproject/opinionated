S. Wilson and Francis Brown.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b72-7\">1. Where, in an action by an indorsee against the makers of a note, the defense is that it was made and delivered to an Insurance Company, at its request, and without consideration, solely by reason of false representations made by the <em>officers </em>of the Company, that the Company fraudulently misappropriated it, and that the plaintiff took it with knowledge of such facts ; and it appears at the trial that the defendants made the note at the solicitation of Rich &amp; Knowlton, who had subscribed \u00a72,500 to \u201c a subscription of \u00a7400,000 in premium notes (to be given to such- Company) to be written against,\u201d and \u201cto be binding when \u00a7300,000 was subscribed\u201d; to enable Rich &amp; Knowlton to give such note to said Company in lieu of their o vvn note for that sum, in payment of a like amount of their said subscription, and that Rich and Knowlton, on soliciting and obtaining such note, stated to the defendants the terms of the \u00a7400,000 subscription, and that in procuring such note they were acting in their own behalf; evidence of the representations made by Rich and Knowlton, to the defendants, as to the condition of the Company, are inadmissible.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b72-8\">2. To make them admissible, under such pleadings, it is necessary to show that Rich <em>&amp; </em>Knowlton were then acting as agents of, or on behalf of said Company, -or that the latter took the note with notice of such representations-</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b72-9\">3. In such an action, the defendants must, at least, show that the condition, on which the subscriptions to the $400,000 subscription were to be binding, had not been complied with by a subscription of \u00a7300,000, assuming that such a defense would be equally open to them as to Rich &amp; Knowlton, on a note given by the latter, in pursuance of their subscription.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b72-10\">4. If a note be voluntarily given in payment of such a subscription before $300,000 is subscribed, and with knowledge of that fact; it cannot be set up as a defense to a suit on the note, that \u00a7300,000 was not in fact subscribed, when such note was made and delivered to the Company.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b72-11\">5. The fact, that such Insurance Company, a few days after the defendants\u2019 note was taken by it, sent to them a written receipt, (in terms like those sent to the actual subscribers,) which receipt stated that such Company had received from the defendants, the note in question \u201cbeing their subscription to the Atlas Mutual Insurance Company, to be held and used by the Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>for the purpose of paying the losses of the Company, or to be used in raising money to be applied to the payment of said losses. Five per cept to be paid by the Company on the payment of said note, according to the terms of the charter,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\u201d is of 'itself no defense to an action by the Company on such note; or by one to whom it has been transferred by order of the Company as security for the payment of money loaned on its credit to the Coinpanyl</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b73-5\">6. When there is no conflict of evidence, the question, whether the facts-' which it tends to establish constitute a- defense, it is for the Court to determine' and not the jury.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b73-6\">7. The fact, that \u00a737,000 in amount, of the $300,000 subscription, was subscribed by other insurance companies, does not tend to show a noncompliance with the condition on which the subscriptions to the \u00a7400,000 subscription were to be binding, it not appearing what the names of those companies are, and that they had not legal capacity to so subscribe.'</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b73-7\">8. The refusal of the judge, at the trial, to adjourn the'cause to a subsequent' day, to enable either party to obtain further testimony, cannot be made the subject of an exception.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b73-8\">(Before Hoffman, Pierrepont and Moncrief, J.

The action was tried on the 8th of April, 1858, before Mr. Justice Bqsworth and a jury, when a verdict was ordered in favor of the plaintiffs for the amount claimed. It' is brought by the plaintiff as indorsee of a note,-of which the de-' fendants are the makers.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-11\">The <em>coinplaint </em>(verified November 26th, 1856,) states' that-the defendants, as partners, composing' the firm of- Wilstiri &amp; Brown, on or about the 8th of November, 1855, made their ribtfeof that date for $500, payable twelve months from its\u2019date, tb'their own order, for value received, and indorsed it in blank, and delivered- it to the Atlas Mutual Insurance Company; that after-wards and before its maturity, the plaintiff became the lawful<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>holder of it for value, and still is; that it is past-due, arid wholly unpaid, and pr\u00e1ys judgment for $500, with interest from No* vember 11th, 1855.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b73-12\">The answer (verified December 26th, <em>1856,) first, </em>denies that on or about the 8th of November, 1856, the defendants made or indorsed the note, or delivered it-to said Insurance Company, or that it was transferred to the plaintiff for value before its maturity, or any time, or that he-became or is the lawful holder of it.\"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number><em>Second. </em>It alleges as a separate and distinct defense, that on or about the 8th of January, 1856, the defendants executed such a note as that described in the complaint; that this was done at the request and solicitation of said Company, and the note, at the like request, was dated the 8th of November, 1855. That it was so made, and indorsed and delivered to said Company, \u201c upon an agreement with said Company, that said note should be held by it, and appropriated in payment of premiums upon insurance, which said Company agreed to make for these defendants, and for which policies were to be issued by said Company, and not be used or applied otherwise: that at the time said note was so made and delivered, the officers of the said Company stated and represented to the defendants that the said Company was in good condition and standing, and was perfectly solvent, and would be able to issue all the policies to which the defendants would be entitled by the payment of premiums to the amount of the said note, and to meet and pay all the liabilities they might thereby incur'; that it was entirely upon the faith of, and in full belief and confidence in the said representations, that these defendants made and delivered the said note, and they received no consideration whatever for the same.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-5\">That the Company was then utterly insolvent, without means to meet any of its engagements; that this was known to its officers when said representations were made; that said representations were false and fraudulent, and that solely by reason thereof the defendants were induced to deliver the note to said Company. That said Company, soon thereafter, and without having issued any policies to these defendants, suspended business, was declared -insolvent, and a receiver of all its effects was appointed. That if the note was ever transferred to the plaintiff, he took it with notice of all these facts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b74-6\"><em>Third. </em>It alleges as a further and distinct defense, that \u201c at or about the time of the'insolvency of the said Company, certain persons who were or had been trustees and officers of the said Company, in violation of law, and in fraud of the rights of the receiver of said Company, and with knowledge of the insolvency of said Company, took possession of certain notes given in advance payment of premiums to said Company, and among others the \u2022 said note of these defendants was transferred by said persons to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>the plaintiff. That the possession of said trustees and transfer to said plaintiff, was fraudulent and without considerationand the defendants aver that the said note is held, and this action prosecuted by the plaintiff, solely for the benefit and advantage of the said trustees.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-5\">At the trial, the plaintiff read the note in evidence and rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-6\">William. S. Wilson, one of the defendants, testified, in substance, that the note, in suit, was signed by his partner Browm on the 8th of January, 1856, and was delivered to Mr. <em>Hinclcley, </em>an officer of the Company, at its office. \u201c When we first saw it it was all filled up, it was banded to me by Mr. <em>Rich,\" </em>of the firm of <em>Rich &amp; Knoiulton, </em>\u201c a firm with which we had business connections.\"</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-7\">\u201cQ. State whether any statements were made to you by any agent or officer of the Company as to the reason for ante-dating the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-8\">A. \u201c When I handed the note in, I said to Mir. Hinckley I thought the notes were made too short; Mr. Rich had stated that it was ante-dated to correspond with other subscriptions; Mr. Hinckley, in answer to my remark to him, said it was made short to facilitate the operations of' the Company; the note was given to be used up in premiums and to be used by the Company, and in consideration of five per cent to be allowed to us as to other parties making subscriptions; there was no other consideration for it; no representations were made to us by any officer of the Company.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-9\">He further testified, that a \u201c few days after we gave the note \u201d a paper was sent to them from the office of said Insurance Company, which reads thus, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-10\">\u201c Office of the Atlas Mutual Insurance Company,)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-11\">New York, Dec. , 1855. f</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-12\">Received of -Messrs. Wilson &amp; Brown their note for five hundred dollars at 12 months, from Nov. 8, 1855, in favor of themselves being their subscription to the Atlas Mutual Insurance Company, to be held and used by the Company for the purpose of paying the losses of the Company, or to be used in raising money to be applied to the payment of said losses. Five pel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>cent, to be paid by the Company on the payment of said note, according to the terms of the charter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-4\">Geo. H Tract, Secretary.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-5\">That not long after the delivery of this note to the Company, the defendants obtained a general policy from it, had four or five risks indorsed on the policy, in all about $200; soon thereafter we heard the Company was insolvent, \u201c and we canceled the risks and. re-insured j\u201d we re-insured in February or March of that year. The defendants then offered to prove the representations made by <em>Mch, </em>relating to the Company, at the time he brought the note to them to be signed. The Court ruled, \u201cthat the witness could not state conversations between him and Rich, unless it were shown that Rich was acting in that matter in behalf of the Company \u201d and excluded the evidence, and the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-6\">Josiah Rich was then sworn, and testified that his partner, Knowlton, was a trustee of the Company; that his firm were original subscribers for stock to the amount of $5,000, which was increased to $10,000, which was put in two notes. Before they fell due the firm subscribed $1,000 to the $40,000 subscription. It was after that \u201cproposed to raise, in subscriptions, $400,000 When, that was to be done, our firm subscribed for $2,500, with the understanding that we might procure other notes than our own to make it up. We got these two notes from Wilson &amp; Brown and put them in under this understanding, that the Company would take them in place of our own notes for $1,000 of \u2022our $2,500 subscription. I communicated to Wilson &amp; Brown the terms of the $400,000 subscription, and the circumstances under which I asked them for their notes. (The defendant offered to prove by.this witness th\u00e9 statements and representations made by Mr. Rich to the defendants, on procuring the notes.) (The Court ruled that the testimony was inadmissible, unless the defendants- should first show that the witness was acting in that matter, on behalf of the Company, and that it could not be admitted upon the evidence then before the Court. To which ruling the defendants excepted.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b76-7\">\u201c Q. When you went to Wilson &amp; Brown to get them to sign these notes, for whom were you acting?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>\u201c A. When I saw Wilson &amp; Brown before they gave the notes I was acting for myself and the firm of Rich and Knowlton, and so told them; I don\u2019t remember precisely how long after this time the Company continued business; I was a trustee some time after transaction.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-5\">George H. Tracy was then called as a witness, and testified that he was Secretary of the Company, from May, 1852, to about February 12, 1856. He produced the book of minutes of the Company, the defendants read therefrom a resolution of the 8th of Hovember, 1855, as follows, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-6\">\u201cWilliam Street, Hew York, Hov. 8, 1855.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-7\">\u201c The trustees of the Atlas Mutual Insurance Company met pursuant to notice. On motion, it was resolved that a subscription of $400,000 in premium notes, to be written against, be obtained, subscription to be binding when $300,000 is subscribed, including the $40,000 already subscribed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-8\">That according to his estimate, $300,000 of the $400,000 subscription was made up. When the Company got notes under it, receipts were given similar to those given to Wilson &amp; Brown. The latter were not subscribers. \u201c Their notes were received on account of the subscription of <em>Rich &amp; Knowlton. </em>The subscription which they signed was produced and marked <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A,\u2019 and is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b77-9\">\u201cWe, the subscribers hereto, agree to give to the Atlas Mutual Insurance Company our notes, in advance of premiums of insurance at six and twelve months, for the sums set over opposite our names respectively, it being understood that in consideration thereof the subscribers are to be allowed, by the Company, at the maturity of their notes, five per cent on the amount thereof.

That the receipt given to Wilson &amp; Browm was not given at its date. That no notes were received until after November 30, 1855. \u201cReceipts of this character were given to some parties who were not subscribers. Wilson &amp; Brown.\u201d The receipts for the $40,000 were different, they were all written out. An injunction was served on the Company March 5, 1856. For a day or two before that, no policies had been issued. The Receiver commenced his duties about the 26th of March, 1856. The resolution of the 30th of October, 1855, was then read from the books of the Company, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-10\">\u201c Tuesday, Oct. 30, 1855.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-11\">At an adjourned meeting of the Trustees of the Atlas Mutual Insurance Company, held at office of E. B. Litchfield, the following'resolution was, on motion, adopted: That any arrangement made by the Finance Committee in paying or arranging for funds to pay the pressing liabilities of the Company, and to sustain the institution till other means can be provided, if tfyey shall make themselves liable or their friends personally liable, the same shall be considered and treated as confidential, in any event equal in all respects to the amount of $40,000 already subscribed by the friends of the Company for its relief.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b78-12\">Of the $40,000 subscription only $36,000 was actually paid. In November, 1855, Mr. Hinckley was President. Mr. Nelson, a partner of the plaintiff, succeeded him on the 29th of Decern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>ber, 1855, and resigned on the 18th. of February, 1856. He did not take risks. Mr. Hinckley did, and so did the witness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-5\">Mr. Nelson attended-the meetings of the trustees, held December 29, 1855, and January 14th and 29th, and the 12th of February, 1856. None of the subscribers who subscribed to the $40,000 subscription were repaid out of the assets of the Company. \u201c The note of Wilson &amp; Brown was delivered to Nelson <em>&amp; </em>Sturges, as special Trustees, for the purpose of paying persons who had made loans to the Company. The trust deed was in writing; it was made under a resolution adopted January 29, amending one adopted January 14, 1856, and reading thus, viz.: \u201c The minutes of the last meeting being read, it was, on motion, resolved to amend by inserting the following resolution:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-6\">\u201cResolved, That the officers of the Company be and are hereby authorized, to arrange with any parties in or out of the Board of Trustees, for the use of their names, either as makers or indorsers of such paper, as it will be necessary for the Company from time to time to have; and they may give any security and make such allowance as they shall think proper for the use of such paper.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-7\">He also testified, that the note in suit \u201c was delivered in pursuance of that resolution.\u201d \u201c Rich and Knowlton paid $1,500 of their subscription.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-8\">The defendants then called the <em>plaintiff </em>as a witness, who testified that he bought the note from Mr. Sturges, and could not tell when he bought it .or how much he gave for it, without referring to his books; that he knew the note was one of those held by Mr. Sturges, under the trust deed and resolutions spoken of by Mr. Tracy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b79-9\">Thomas S. Nelson was next sworn as a witness for the defendants, and testified: \u201cI was elected President of the Atlas Mutual Insurance Company on the 29th December, 1855; * * I so acted until the 14th of February, 1856; * * I acted as trustee, under the appointment of the Company; the trust was in writing; I have not got it-now with me; * * we were authorized to take advances of notes from parties, and take notes from the Company, and use them to secure those parties; Mr. Sturges was associated with me; * * this note was handed to us, with others, to secure us for the money we were raising for the Company; my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>partner, Mr. Holbrook, I presume knew * * that I was acting as special Trustee for those parties\u2014twelve or fifteen\u2014who had advanced money to the Company; the amount to be raised was about $50,000; a number of notes were collected; * * the money advanced to the Company was never repaid; some of it was collected from proceeds of these notes.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-6\">\u2018\u25a0\u2018The defendants applied to the Court for an adjournment, for the purpose of bringing the trust deed spoken of by the witness into court. The motion was denied and they excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-7\">They then put in evidence the proceedings in the Supreme \u25a0Court, by which a receiver was appointed to wind up the affairs of said Company, and rested. (Ko other witnesses were examined, and the foregoing is the substance of all the testimony given or offered at the trial.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-8\">\u201c The Court inquired of defendants\u2019 counsel what questions of fact he desired to have submitted to the jury, and as to which there was, in his opinion, any conflict of evidence making such submission proper? to which he replied that he desired that the following questions should be submitted to the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-9\">\u201c1. Whether the receipt given for the note in suit to the defendants, by the Insurance Company, places these defendants in a situation to take advantage of all the defenses that a subscriber to the $300,000 subscription could interpose ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-10\">\u201c 2. Whether the Company took the note with knowledge of circumstances impeaching its validity ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-11\">\u201c3. Whether the plaintiff did not take it with knowledge of the circumstances under which it originated, and was delivered to the Company ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-12\">\u201c The defendants insisting that the Insurance Company was estopped to deny it was a subscription note under the $300,000 subscription, or that the defendants have not all the legal and equitable defenses of an actual subscriber. The Court stated that the evidence did not require the submission of these questions to the jury,\u201d and thereupon directed a verdict for plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-13\">\u201c The defendants excepted to the ruling and decision of the Court, as last stated, and to every part thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b80-14\">\u201cThe jury, under the direction of the Court, found a verdict for the plaintiff for $546.60, being the amount of the note and interest.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>The Court then ordered that the questions of law arising on the exceptions taken be first heard at the General Term, and that the entry of judgment be in the meantime suspended.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b81-5\">The cause was submitted to the General Term without argument, on a case containing the exceptions, and on printed points. The points were as follows:</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b81-6\"><em>Charles N. Emerson, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-7\">I. The Court erred in instructing the jury that there was nothing for their consideration; that the facts proved did not constitute a defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-8\">It should have been submitted to the jury, upon the evidence, whether the Company did or did not receive the note as a \u201c subscription note,\u201d and whether the defendant did not give the note with the understanding that it was to be used and applied under the terms and stipulations of the receipt which was given to the defendants for it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-9\">II. The Company would have been estopped from saying that the note was <em>not </em>a subscription note, if the action had been in the name of the Company, or in the name of the Trustees of the Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-10\">III. Had the case been submitted to the jury, all the legal and equitable defenses arising out of the illegal subscription of $300,-000, made under the resolution of November 8, 1855, would have been open to their consideration. But the Court, while admitting the defendants to offer the same defenses in this suit as would have been admissible in a suit upon the note by the Company, deprived the defendants of all benefit of this defense, by passing upon the questions of <em>fact, </em>independent of the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-11\">IY. The note in the hands of the Company or their Trustee was void, for non-compliance with the terms of the subscription upon which it was given, and, as the defendant claims, received by the Company through Mr. Rich. <em>[Berry, receiver, v. Yates et al., </em>N. Y. Times, April 25, 1857; <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Hamilton College, </em>2 Denio, 403; <em>E. Anglian R. Co. </em>v. <em>Eastern Co. R. Co., </em>7 Law and Equity R., 505.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b81-12\">Y. The note <em>was </em>given to the Company. Rich &amp; Knowlton had made a subscription to the amount of $2,500. He, Rich, applied to defendants to assume $1,000 of <em>that </em>subscription, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number><em>their </em>notes. It was not a loan of monej to Rich &amp; Knowlton, but an assuming on the part of the defendants of a part of Rich &amp; Knowlton\u2019s liability under that subscription.

The subscription was commenced, and these defendants, through Rich &amp; Knowlton, on the same day, gave, the note in suit. It never became a valid note, from the non-compliance with the condition upon which it was given. $300,000 was not subscribed by persons entitled by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>law to subscribe, and the consideration of the note utterly failed.

The offer was ruled out, unless it was shown that- <em>Rich </em>was acting in that matter on behalf of the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">We think this ruling was correct. The plaintiff was making title througlithe Company. He could not be bound by declarations or statements, not made by them or their authorized agents.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">The like remark applies to the next exception, to the rejection, by the Judge, of questions addressed to the witness <em>Rich, </em>himself, when he was produced as a witness to the same point. Rich is in no way connected with the Company so as to make his statements equivalent to their own.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">To understand the exceptions as to the refusal to submit the specified questions to the jury, some facts should be noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">Rich &amp; Knowlton were original subscribers to the stock of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>the Atlas Mutual Insurance Company. A proposition to increase the stock, having been made among the parties interested, Rich &amp; Knowlton subscribed $2,500, with the understanding that they might procure other notes than their own to make it up. They got two notes from the defendants; one of which is that in suit. The Company agreed to take those notes in place of Rich &amp; Knowlton\u2019s notes for $1,000, part of the $2,500. The defendants knew of these circumstances. Receipts were given to the subscribers, similar to the one in evidence given to the defendants. By the agreement made upon the new subscription, (which was to be for $400,000,) no subscription was to be binding until the sum of $800,000 was subscribed. Testimony was, given as to this subscription being filled up to that amount. All the evidence'was produced by the defendants. The defendants contended that the subscription was not full; that their\u2019s was a subscription note; that the condition had not been complied with; that the Company could not have collected the note; and, as the plaintiff took with knowledge, he was in no better position.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The defendants, then, must be taken to have made out, by their own uncontradicted and unquestioned evidence, the best case they were able to make; and the question, whether they have established a legal defense on that evidence, becomes a question of law. There was nothing of contradictory or discrepant testimony for the jury to weigh.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The effect of the receipt as tending to constitute a defense was of this nature: The inquiry, whether the Company took the note with knowledge of circumstances impeaching its validity, was not a question for the jury. A jury should be asked to pass upon the question of knowledge of particular facts; but whether, if known, they impeach the validity of a note, is for the Court to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The third question was, in point of fact, answered in favor of the defendants, by the admission of the plaintiff and the other testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">None of the exceptions being tenable, the question arises upon the case, whether the judgment on the verdict ought to be for the plaintiff or the defendants. (Code, \u00a7 265.)</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">It has been decided in this Court that, where a note, given on a subscription like the present, had been transferred before matu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>rity to a bank to be discounted, with other notes, for the general purposes of the Company holding it, the bank could recover, unless' chargeable with notice of an intended and actual misappropriation. (Th<em>e Central Bank of Brooklyn </em>v. Lang, 1 Bosw. R., 202.)</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The Company, in the present case, knew that the note was given as part of Rich &amp; Knowlton\u2019s subscription, and the defendants were apprised of the nature and object of this arrangement. Nelson took the note, either as trustee for parties who had previously loaned money to the Company, or to use for the purpose of securing parties who should lend their notes as makers or indorsers, for the benefit of the Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">I shall assume that Nelson stood in no better position than the Company; nor the plaintiff in a better one than Nelson. Then if the Company could not recover upon one of Rich &amp; Knowlton\u2019s notes, given for the remaining $1,500 of the subscription, the plaintiff cannot recover on the present note.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">This brings us to the question: Have the defendants shown that the condition was not fulfilled ? They have given a promissory note; have failed to establish any fraudulent representations, which could defeat the Company\u2019s claim upon it; and if they could avail themselves of an exemption arising from the failure of a condition upon which they alleged the note was given, they must make out that failure fully and explicitly. It is similar to the rule declared in <em>The Bank of the United States </em>v. <em>Davis. </em>(2 Hill, 459.)</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">The defendants have fallen short of doing this. The Secretary of the Company, called by themselves as a witness, states that $300,000 was made up, not including the amount marked in pencil on the subscription books. The previous subscription of $40,000 was included in this estimate. Why it should not be so does not appear. He adds, that of the amount of $300,000, the sum of $37,000 was subscribed by other Insurance Companies; but there is no evidence to show what Companies subscribed, nor that they were prohibited from subscribing, or could not lawfully do so. The witness says, also, that the $40,000 was not all paid in notes or cash; $36,000 only was. He included the $40,000 in his estimate; that it wras payable in four months; $36,000 was paid in notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>This is the whole of the evidence; all supplied by the defendants themselves. They have not proved that the subscription was not filled up to $300,000, as required.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">But again, if this were doubtful, there is another view of the case, which seems decisive against the defendants. Have not the parties waived the objection that the subscription was incomplete by giving their notes ? It may be that had they been sued for the subscription money, the defense would have availed them ; but the delivery of the notes was either a waiver of the condition or an admission that it had been complied with.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">It is sworn to by Rich, that when he got the notes of the defendants, he informed them of the terms of the $400,000 subscription. The note was given and made on the 8th of January, 1856, though dated the 8th of November, 1855, and the receipt was given after the note, though dated in December, 1855. The terms of the resolution of November 8, 1855, were, that the subscription was to be binding when $300,000 was subscribed. There was nothing as to restoring notes or refunding cash if the subscription fell short; and 1 think that the giving of the notes, two months after the resolution, and with a knowledge of its terms, was an implied admission of the defendants being satisfied as to the filling up of the stock.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">The plaintiff must have judgment upon the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
