The defendant, dressed only in underclothes, answered the front door. When notified that the officers were there to execute a warrant for his arrest, he asked if he could get dressed. The officers escorted the defendant to his bedroom. Soon after their arrival, one officer discovered a firearm under the mattress of the defendant\u2019s bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">In allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress, the judge relied on G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 1, second par., inserted by St. 1974, c. 508, stating that the search and seizure of the firearm was improper because the statute limits a search incident to arrest to \u201cevidence of the crime for which the arrest has been made,\u201d and the firearm was not related to the trespass charge for which the defendant was arrested. We conclude the judge misapplied the statute, and for the reasons that follow we reverse the order of suppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\"><em>Analysis. </em>\u201cIn reviewing a ruling on a motion to suppress, we accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings\u201d unless there is clear error, and we independently determine the \u201ccorrectness of the judge\u2019s application of constitutional principles to the facts as found.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>440 Mass. 642, 646 (2004) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">We look to the judge\u2019s detailed findings to determine the actions taken by the police after they accompanied the defendant to his bedroom to get dressed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-8\">\u201cIn the bedroom, the defendant wanted to go to the closet to get his pants, but the officers informed him that, for safety reasons, they would get the clothes out of the closet for him. The officers knew, from their early morning briefing, at which they had reviewed the defendant\u2019s [probation] record, that he had a history of prior arrests for possession and discharge of a firearm. [The] supervisor of the squad[] had had prior experience with the defendant, having either arrested him or having been present when he was arrested on firearms and ammunition charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-9\">\u201cOne of the officers noticed that the defendant sat on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>bed, not close to the closet where his clothes were, but on the far end of the bed, away from the closet. The officer who testified at the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress found it odd that the defendant would sit so far away from the closet where he was headed to get his clothes. At that point, one of the other officers found a knife on the defendant\u2019s dresser. The officers did a protective sweep of the room to make sure that there were no other weapons present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-5\">\u201cAn officer asked the defendant to stand up and get dressed. When the defendant stood up, the officer lifted up the mattress where he had been sitting and found a firearm between the mattress and the box spring. He put the mattress back down and handcuffed the defendant. From his early morning review of the defendant\u2019s record, the officer knew that the defendant could not lawfully possess a firearm, both because of his age, and because of his prior record of firearms offenses. At this point, the officers did not seize the firearm. They froze the apartment and obtained a search warrant pursuant to which they later seized the firearm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Relying on that portion of G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 1, second par., that states that \u201c[a] search conducted incident to an arrest may be made only for the purposes of seizing fruits, instrumentalities, contraband and other evidence of the crime for which the arrest has been made,\u201d the judge concluded that the firearm evidence should be suppressed because the firearm was not related to the charge of trespass and could not be seized.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">We conclude, however, that the facts clearly indicate that the discovery of the firearm was based on other justified conduct of the police under the second part of the sentence of G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 1, second par., which states that a search incident to an arrest may be made for \u201cremoving any weapons that the arrestee might use to resist arrest or effect his escape.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blevines, </em>438 Mass. 604, 607-608 (2003). See also <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California, </em>395 U.S. 752, 762-763 (1969); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>449 Mass. 476, 482 (2007); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dessources, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 232, 235-236 (2009). See generally Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4.96 (3d ed. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>The firearm was not discovered during the protective sweep after the police entered the bedroom.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rather, it was discovered when an officer, suspicious of the defendant\u2019s conduct \u2014 sitting at the end of the bed farthest away from the closet \u2014 found the firearm under the mattress where the defendant had been sitting. While the judge stated that the officer was \u201cacting on a hunch \u2014 an excellent one, but a hunch nevertheless,\u201d the facts instead indicate that the officer\u2019s decision to look under the mattress was objectively reasonable. It is not unreasonable \u201cfor a police officer, as a matter of routine, to monitor the movements of an arrested person, as his judgment dictates, following the arrest. The officer\u2019s need to ensure his own safety \u2014 as well as the integrity of the arrest \u2014 is compelling.\u201d <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Chrisman, </em>455 U.S. 1, 7 (1982). \u201c[A] police officer\u2019s decision how and where to conduct the search is \u2018a quick ad hoc judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elizondo, </em>428 Mass. 322, 324 (1998), quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Queen, </em>847 F.2d 346, 352 (7th Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">We comment briefly on other conduct of the police in this case. In executing the arrest warrant, the police had the power to enter the defendant\u2019s home. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>440 Mass. 772, 776 (2004). They were authorized to accompany him to his room and had the right \u201cto remain ... at [his] elbow at all times,\u201d even in the absence of any indication that he might have a weapon available or might attempt to escape. <em>Washington </em>v. <em>Chrisman, </em>455 U.S. at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">Whether the defendant was seated on the bed or standing next to it, the firearm was within \u201c \u2018the one lunge zone\u2019 of <em>Chimel </em>v. <em>California, </em>395 U.S. 752 (1969).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elizondo, </em>428 Mass, at 324 n.2., quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hyde, </em>574 F.2d 856, 871 (5th Cir. 1978). See Grasso &amp; McEvoy, Suppression Matters Under Massachusetts Law \u00a7 12-3[a][1] (2011-2012). Thus, discovery of the firearm properly constituted a search contemporaneous with the defendant\u2019s arrest.
