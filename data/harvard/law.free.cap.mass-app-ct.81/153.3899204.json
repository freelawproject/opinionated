After a four-day suppression hearing, during which the motion judge reviewed a video <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>recording of the interrogation and heard testimony from five police officers, the judge granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. The Commonwealth filed this interlocutory appeal, arguing that the judge erred as a matter of law. Governed by <em>Michigan </em>v. <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. 96 (1975), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\"><em>Background. </em>\u201cIn reviewing a ruling on a motion to suppress, we accept the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings of fact absent clear error \u2018but conduct an independent review of his ultimate findings and conclusions of law.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>438 Mass. 213, 218 (2002). The judge determines the weight and credibility of the testimony. . . . \u2018[O]ur duty is to make an independent determination of the correctness of the judge\u2019s application of constitutional principles to the facts as found.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>422 Mass. 367, 369 (1996).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scott, </em>440 Mass. 642, 646 (2004).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Here, the motion judge issued a detailed memorandum setting forth his findings and conclusions of law. He found that on April 4, 2008, Joshua Fitzgerald and his brothers allegedly were involved in a brawl with the defendant and others in which Fitzgerald was wounded by knife, resulting in his death. In connection with the police investigation of the incident, the defendant was arrested pursuant to a warrant on April 7, 2008.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He was brought to the booking room of the Fairhaven police station <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>and was advised at the outset (at 12:42 p.m.) by Detective Glen Cudmore of his rights under <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966). The defendant told Cudmore that he did not want to speak to him, invoking his right to silence at 12:44 p.m. With the exception of a few basic booking questions, Cudmore did not ask the defendant any more questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Approximately one-half hour later, State police Trooper Robert Lima and Fairhaven police Detective Jerald Bettencourt entered the room. As the motion judge found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">\u201cAt approximately 1:16 [p.m.], Lima and Bettencourt entered the booking room and immediately spoke with Cudmore. Cudmore advised the officers that Callender had been \u2018Mirandized\u2019 and \u2018said he didn\u2019t want to speak.\u2019 Cud-more added T asked him if he wanted to talk to me and he said no. That\u2019s all he said.\u2019[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">\u201cAt approximately 1:16 [p.m.], Lima and Bettencourt approached Callender, who was chained to the bench. After Lima and Bettencourt introduced themselves, Lima asked Callender \u2018Do you want to talk for a few minutes?\u2019 Cal-lender, unfamiliar with either officer, softly replied \u2018[s]ure, I don\u2019t care.\u2019 Callender\u2019s response to Lima\u2019s inquiry may be characterized as apathetic. Lima now encouraged Cal-lender to talk, stating \u2018Yeah, just get it off your chest and we can talk about why you are here and all that. Okay, good to go?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">\u201cThe officers now spoke about where the interview would occur. Bettencourt suggested to Lima the interview take place in the booking room, \u2018unless you want to get into a comfortable setting.\u2019 Lima agreed that chairs be brought into the booking room and that the interview be conducted in that location in which Callender was seated on a bench with his left hand chained to the bench.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">\u201cAfter Callender had agreed to be interviewed, Lima asked Callender whether he wished to have \u2018a cup of water.\u2019 Another officer volunteered to bring the beverage and Cal-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>lender agreed to the officer\u2019s suggestion of a Pepsi instead of water.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">\u201cAt this time, neither Lima, Bettencourt nor any other officer had administered a fresh set of Miranda warnings to Callender. Nonetheless, Callender was now questioned by Lima with Lima labeling the inquiries \u2018admin things.\u2019 Cal-lender, who had just provided Cudmore with answers to booking questions was now questioned by Lima about his name and residence. After Callender got into the rhythm of answering Lima\u2019s questions, Bettencourt mentioned his belief that Callender had already been notified of his Miranda rights. Condensing the Miranda rights to \u2018the right to remain silent,\u2019 Bettencourt stated that he would \u2018read it off this paper here\u2019 and instructed Callender that you \u2018just have [to] sign it that I gave them to you. And we will talk . . . .\u2019 Without ever having heard a fresh recitation of his Miranda rights, Callender responded \u2018Pm left handed\u2019; Bettencourt replied \u2018that is not a problem,\u2019 presumably referring to Callender\u2019s left hand being chained to the bench.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">\u201cAfter this exchange, Lima against <em>[sic] </em>offered Callender a beverage with Callender responding \u2018[n]o, I\u2019m all right\u2019 and Lima then making sure saying \u2018[y]ou\u2019re all right with soda?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">\u201cBettencourt now rapidly but correctly recited the original Miranda warnings to Callender followed by the inquiry \u2018[d]o you understand these rights as I read them to you.\u2019 Callender responded \u2018[y]a.\u2019 Bettencourt informed Cal-lender that he \u2018c[ould] decide at any time to exercise these rights and not answer any questions or make any statements.\u2019 In response to Bettencourt\u2019s question, \u2018ok,\u2019 Callender acknowledged his understanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">\u201cCallender\u2019s left hand was released in order for him to sign the document. Before Callender signed the Miranda rights document indicating his understanding of his rights, he was never given an adequate opportunity to read the Miranda rights or his waiver of the rights.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">The officers then questioned the defendant about events relat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>ing to the Fitzgerald homicide. The questioning lasted more than three hours. During the interview the defendant made inculpatory statements. The motion judge suppressed his statements and the fruits thereof, concluding that the Commonwealth had failed to carry its burden of demonstrating that the police scrupulously honored Callender\u2019s initial exercise of his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>In <em>Michigan </em>v. Mosley, 423 U.S. 96, 102-103 (1975), the United States Supreme Court held that the <em>\u201cMiranda </em>opinion can[not] sensibly be read to create a <em>per se </em>proscription of indefinite duration upon any further questioning by any police officer on any subject, once the person in custody has indicated a desire to remain silent.\u201d See generally Smith, Criminal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 6.43 (3d ed. 2007). When a suspect invokes his or her right to remain silent under <em>Miranda </em>v. Arizona, 384 U.S. at 444, and is subsequently re-approached for interrogation, the inquiry is \u201cwhether the person\u2019s right to be free from interrogation, once exercised, was \u2018scrupulously honored\u2019 before questioning resumed.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Atkins, </em>386 Mass. 593, 598 (1982), quoting from <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. at 104. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clarke, </em>461 Mass. 336, 343 (2012). See generally Grasso &amp; McEvoy, Suppression Matters Under Massachusetts Law \u00a7 18-5[b][l] (2011-2012 ed.). Among the factors relevant to this analysis, the <em>Mosley </em>Court identified (1) whether a significant amount of time elapsed between the suspect\u2019s invocation of the right to remain silent and further questioning; (2) whether the same officer conducted both the interrogation where the suspect invoked the right and the subsequent interrogation, and whether the venues differed; (3) whether the suspect was given a fresh set of Miranda warnings before the subsequent interrogation; (4) whether the subsequent interrogation concerned the same crime as the interrogation previously cut off by the suspect; and (5) the persistence of the police in wearing down the suspect\u2019s resistance in order to change his mind. <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. at 105-106. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hsu, </em>852 F.2d 407, 410-412 (9th Cir. 1988); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lugo Guerrero, </em>524 F.3d 5, 12 (1st Cir. 2008). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>374 Mass. 426, 433 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>424 Mass. 266, 269 (1997), cert. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>denied, 525 U.S. 934 (1998); <em>Clarke, </em>461 Mass, at 344. No one factor is determinative in the analysis, nor should <em>Mosley </em>be understood as setting forth an exhaustive set of criteria. See <em>Hsu, </em>852 F.2d at 411. \u201cUnlike the clearcut, purely objective test in <em>Miranda </em>\u2014 did the police officers fully inform the suspect of his rights before he confessed? \u2014 the inquiry in <em>Mosley </em>involves a multiple factor review.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Barone, </em>968 F.2d 1378, 1383 (1st Cir. 1992). In that latter analysis, courts look to the totality of the circumstances. See <em>Rivera, </em>424 Mass, at 269; <em>Lugo Guerrero, </em>524 F.3d at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">We turn initially to the application of the <em>Mosley </em>factors. Under the first <em>Mosley </em>prong, the motion judge found that approximately thirty-five minutes<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> elapsed between the defendant invoking his right to remain silent to Cudmore and Lima asking him whether he wished to talk. Although in <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. at 106, the Court determined that two hours constituted a \u201csignificant period of time,\u201d it did not suggest any durational minimum. Massachusetts courts have concluded that the defendant\u2019s Miranda rights were not scrupulously honored where, in addition to the violation of other <em>Mosley </em>factors, the interval was thirty minutes or less. See <em>Taylor, </em>374 Mass, at 434 (five minutes); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>377 Mass. 319, 326 (1979) (thirty minutes); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, </em>381 Mass. 465, 468 (1980) (one minute). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brant, </em>380 Mass. 876, 882-883, cert, denied, 449 U.S. 1004 (1980) (fourteen minutes). Contrast <em>Rivera, </em>424 Mass, at 269 (no <em>Mosley </em>violation where interval was three and one-half hours); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Avellar, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 608, 616 (2007) (suppression not required where interval was approximately two hours).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>The second <em>Mosley </em>factor, focusing on who conducted the subsequent interrogation and its venue, inclines here in part toward the Commonwealth, and in part toward the defendant. In Mosley, the defendant\u2019s \u201c \u2018right to cut off questioning\u2019 was fully respected\u201d where, among other factors, Mosley was questioned by a different police officer when the interrogation resumed. <em>Mosley, </em>423 U.S. at 104, quoting from <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 474. See <em>Rivera, </em>424 Mass, at 269 (no <em>Mosley </em>violation where booking officer, who did not question defendant, was different from officers performing subsequent interrogation). Here, the defendant invoked his right to remain silent before Cud-more, whereas Lima and Bettencourt conducted the subsequent interrogation. On the other hand, in contrast to <em>Mosley </em>where the two interrogations were conducted in different venues, 423 U.S. at 104, here the subsequent interrogation took place in the same booking room where the defendant had invoked his right to remain silent and where the defendant remained handcuffed to a bench throughout the booking and the subsequent interrogation. Contrast <em>Lugo Guerrero, </em>524 F.3d at 12 (subsequent interrogation at different location).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Under the third <em>Mosley </em>prong, we next consider whether fresh Miranda warnings were given before the subsequent interrogation. In this case, upon entering the booking room to initiate the subsequent interrogation, the officers did a number of things before reading the defendant the Miranda rights again. Lima and Bettencourt approached the defendant, and Lima asked him if he wanted to \u201ctalk for a few minutes,\u201d to which the defendant replied, \u201c[S]ure, I don\u2019t care.\u201d Lima encouraged the defendant to \u201cget it off [his] chest.\u201d The officers spoke about where the interview would occur. The officers offered the defendant a beverage. Lima next asked the defendant questions about \u201cadmin things\u201d such as his name and address. The Commonwealth argues that <em>Mosley </em>only requires police to reiterate the Miranda warnings to a suspect prior to interrogation, and that the police complied with that requirement here because nothing prior to the fresh Miranda warnings amounted to \u201cinterrogation.\u201d What the Commonwealth ignores, however, is that in <em>Mosley, </em>in noting that the defendant \u201cwas given full and complete <em>Miranda </em>warnings at the outset of the second interrogation,\u201d 423 U.S. at 104, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>determined that the defendant \u201cwas thus reminded again that he could remain silent and could consult with a lawyer, and was carefully given a full and fair opportunity to exercise these options.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 104-105. Here, however, as the motion judge found, the officers \u201creversed the sequence of the administration of Miranda rights. Instead of reciting a fresh set of warnings and then securing a defendant\u2019s knowing waiver, Lima bypassed the procedure of providing a fresh set of warnings, by directly asking [the defendant] if he wished to speak.\u201d By first getting the defendant in the rhythm of answering questions before providing the fresh Miranda warnings, the officers undermined the spirit of <em>Mosley. </em>See <em>Jackson, </em>377 Mass, at 326 (\u201cWe think the police conduct here was contrary to the letter and the spirit of the <em>Miranda </em>decision\u201d). Moreover, we agree with the motion judge that the manner in which the officers delivered the fresh Miranda warnings created the impression that the defendant had already waived his Miranda rights, further burdening the defendant\u2019s exercise of those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The fourth <em>Mosley </em>factor considers whether the subsequent interrogation concerns the same subject as the initial effort to question the defendant. Here, Cudmore, in the initial encounter with the defendant, did not question the defendant about the homicide that he was suspected of committing and which was the subject of the subsequent interrogation. However, no one has argued or suggested, and the record does not support, that the defendant was charged with any other crime or that he would have any reason to believe that he was invoking his Miranda rights with regard to one charge but later being questioned with regard to another charge. Here the officers\u2019 questioning was focused on the homicide in connection with which the defendant had just been arrested and had, only thirty-five minutes before, invoked his right to silence. This factor weighs against the Commonwealth. See <em>Taylor, </em>374 Mass, at 435 (\u201c[Wjhere the questioning of the defendant was not restricted to an unrelated crime, the police had departed from the procedure approved in Mosley\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The fifth <em>Mosley </em>factor, focusing on the zealousness of the police in reinitiating questioning, inclines toward the defendant. Here, the officers knew of the defendant\u2019s Miranda invocation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>before they attempted to speak with him. Yet, as has been noted, they not only resumed questioning, but did so in a manner that was not respectful of his prior invocation. Compare <em>Jackson, </em>377 Mass, at 326 (\u201c[T]he statements made to [the defendant] by the police officer were . . . designed to undermine [his] decision to remain silent and to persuade him to confess\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">In <em>Mosley, </em>the Court observed that \u201c[t]hrough the exercise of his option to terminate questioning [a suspect] can control the time at which questioning occurs, the subjects discussed, and the duration of the interrogation. The requirement that law enforcement authorities must respect a person\u2019s exercise of that option counteracts the coercive pressures of the custodial setting.\u201d 423 U.S. at 103-104. Here, upon consideration of the totality of the circumstances, we cannot say that the defendant\u2019s right to cut off questioning, once invoked, was \u201cscrupulously honored.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The order allowing the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress is affirmed.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The Commonwealth argues that this court should give deference to findings of fact based on testimony at the evidentiary hearing but need not defer to findings of fact based <em>on </em>the judge\u2019s review of the interrogation video recording (video). This bifurcated approach is not feasible where the motion judge\u2019s findings of fact were \u201c[bjased on a review of the credibility of the aggregated evidence\u201d; there is no delineation that certain findings of fact were based only on the video; and witnesses testified about excerpts from the video. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Novo, </em>442 Mass. 262, 266 &amp; n.3 (2004) (interrogation-related findings not deferred to where \u201cbased almost exclusively\u201d on videotaped confession, \u201ctestimony focused primarily on events leading up to the videotape recorded interview,\u201d and police witness \u201cexplicitly deferred to the videotape\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durand, </em>457 Mass. 574, 596 (2010) (findings \u201cbased almost exclusively\u201d on interrogation videotape not accorded deference).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">In any event, we have viewed the video recording and note that the judge\u2019s factual findings are consistent with what the recording shows.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b200-9\">The defendant was indicted on May 9, 2008, on charges of murder in violation of G.

This case is distinguishable from <em>Hsu </em>because here the officers did not otherwise scrupulously honor the defendant\u2019s rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b207-7\">In this regard, we further note that the motion judge found that the police did not comply with G.
