L. c. 156D, as appearing in St. 2003, c. 127, shareholders have the right to dissent from a proposed merger and demand that the corporation pay \u201cfair value\u201d for their shares if the merger is accomplished. G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 13.02(a). The principal issue presented by this appeal is whether the trial judge correctly applied the appraisal provision of the Act, G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 13.30, in determining the \u201cfair value\u201d of stock owned by a minority shareholder of a close corporation following a cash-out merger.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we hold that the case law governing the determination of \u201cfair value\u201d under the predecessor law to the Act applies to the determination of \u201cfair value\u201d under \u00a7 13.30. We further conclude that the trial judge\u2019s decision to rely on evidence she heard during a jury trial involving other claims between the parties,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> after providing the parties an opportunity to offer new evidence, was in compliance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>with the Act and the constitutional rights of the minority shareholder. Finally, we hold that in the circumstances of this case, the judge\u2019s decision to appraise the value of the minority\u2019s shares as the pro rata percentage of the net selling price of the business was the \u201cfair value\u201d for those shares under the appraisal statute, G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 <em>13.30(d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\"><em>Factual background. </em>Robert Spenlinhauer (Robert), acting as the executor of the estate of Georgia Spenlinhauer (estate), brought the present case against the defendants, Spencer Press, Inc. (Spencer Press), Spencer Acquisition, Inc., and their former majority owners, Stephen Spenlinhauer and John Spenlinhauer (collectively, defendants), based on a dispute regarding the valuation of the estate\u2019s one percent interest in Spencer Press, which Spenlinhauer was forced to sell as a result of the cash-out merger.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Spencer Press was founded in the 1940\u2019s by John E. Spenlinhauer, Jr. (John Jr.), and his wife, Georgia M. Spenlinhauer (Georgia), parents of the three brothers who are parties in this case. John Jr. owned ninety-nine percent of the stock and Georgia owned one percent. After the death of John Jr. in 1972, his three sons each owned thirty-three percent of the shares in Spencer Press, while Georgia retained her one percent share. In 1987, after disputes arose among the brothers, John and Stephen bought out Robert\u2019s stake in the company. Shortly thereafter, Georgia ceased active involvement in the business but remained a shareholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">Georgia\u2019s health deteriorated in the late 1980\u2019s and early 1990\u2019s. Robert began taking care of her and in 1994, Georgia executed a new will, which left substantially all of her assets to Robert, including her share in Spencer Press. Robert was also named as the executor of her will.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">In December of 2004, John and Stephen received from R.R. Donnelly &amp; Sons, Inc. (Donnelly), a competitor, a preliminary offer to purchase Spencer Press. The price was $60 million, minus outstanding debts of around $30 million in addition to other company obligations and escrows. Stephen discussed the offer with Robert.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>On February 4, 2005, Georgia died. John initially wanted to contest Georgia\u2019s will, which he had not previously seen, but Stephen convinced him not to based on Robert\u2019s assurances that he would not obstruct the sale of Spencer Press and that he was satisfied with the estimated $350,000 he would receive as a pro rata share of the purchase price through the estate. However, in July of 2005, after the deadline for contesting Georgia\u2019s will had passed, Robert informed Stephen and John that he would not accept the pro rata share and instead demanded $3 million for the estate\u2019s one percent interest. Stephen was upset by Robert\u2019s actions, but nonetheless continued to negotiate the purchase of the estate\u2019s share. During the course of these negotiations, one of Stephen\u2019s attorneys informed Robert that Spencer Press could perform a cash-out merger under Massachusetts law to obtain the estate\u2019s interest without Robert\u2019s consent. Nevertheless, Stephen first offered Robert $500,000 and then $750,000 in exchange for the one percent share, but Robert rejected both offers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">On October 5, 2005, Stephen and John completed a cash-out merger, whereby Spencer Press was merged into its recently formed parent company, Spencer Acquisition, Inc., which was subsequently renamed Spencer Press, Inc. On October 15, 2005, Robert was notified for the first time of this transaction; that the estate\u2019s share would be converted into $375,000; and of his rights under the Act. In November, 2005, the recently formed Spencer Press signed an agreement to sell its business to Donnelly.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\"><em>Procedural background. </em>On November 30, 2005, Robert brought the instant action, challenging several actions in the cash-out merger and sale. The parties agree that the defendants complied with the statutory requirements contained in G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 11.05, in executing the cash-out merger. As required by G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 13.30(a)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>, upon demand from Robert, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>defendants filed a counterclaim for an equitable appraisal of the estate\u2019s stock and, inter alla, for intentional misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The parties conducted two years of discovery, which ended on December 31, 2007. The trial judge granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all of Robert\u2019s claims except his breach of contract claim. The appraisal claim brought by the defendants was stayed at Robert\u2019s request as executor until after a trial on Robert\u2019s breach of contract claim and the defendants\u2019 misrepresentation claim. A jury returned a verdict for the defendants on Robert\u2019s claim and for Robert on the misrepresentation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">After trial, the judge gave the parties an opportunity to comment on the procedure she should follow in adjudicating the appraisal claim,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and directed them to submit an offer of proof as to new evidence they would like to offer beyond what was presented at trial. In particular, the judge stated to counsel for Robert:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b106-7\">\u201c[I]f it\u2019s Mr. Marshall [plaintiff\u2019s expert] that you would be offering, ... or something else, if there\u2019s some documents or some testimony, or whatever it is you might want to offer, I want to know what it is, and I\u2019d like it in affidavit form or documentary form or some form beyond just a synopsis and a memorandum. The point to focus on I think is what should I do . . . as a procedural matter, other than simply mak[e] findings based on the evidence presented at trial, and why should I ... do something other than just male[e] findings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">The trial judge confirmed this request in an order dated August 7, 2009. The defendants responded by stating that they would rely on the evidence presented at trial. Robert, on the other hand, requested additional discovery without making an offer of proof that there was any new evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The judge indicated that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>had just completed a trial in which there was substantial evidence relating to the value of the stock of Spencer Press and the fairness of the purchase price, and in the absence of an offer of proof of any further evidence there was no reason to believe that the purchase price for the stock was \u201canything other than fair and favorable.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The judge concluded that the fair value of the estate\u2019s interest was one percent of the net sale price of Spencer Press to Donnelly.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Appraisal procedure. </em>Robert claims that the trial judge violated the Act\u2019s appraisal provision, G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 13.30, and deprived him of due process under the State and Federal Constitutions by not allowing an evidentiary hearing on his appraisal claim following the jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">a. <em>Obtaining an appraisal. </em>When a subsidiary corporation is merged with its parent under G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 11.05, a shareholder who is dissatisfied with the amount of the payment under G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 13.26(a), is entitled to an equitable proceeding pursuant to \u00a7 13.30 to determine the \u201cfair value\u201d of his or her shares as defined by \u00a7 13.01. G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 13.02(a). This was the procedure by which Spencer Press was merged with Spencer Acquisition, Inc., and the estate\u2019s appraisal rights were correspondingly triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">b. <em>Appraisal notice and form. </em>When corporate action is taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>that triggers appraisal rights under G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 13.02(a), the corporation must deliver a written appraisal notice and form to all shareholders who meet certain criteria within ten days after the corporate action. G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 13.22(a), <em>(b). </em>In mergers between subsidiaries and parents pursuant to G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 11.05, the parent company must deliver a written appraisal notice and form \u201cto all record shareholders who may be entitled to assert appraisal rights.\u201d G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 13.22(a). Such a notice must contain \u201cthe corporation\u2019s estimate of the fair value of the shares.\u201d G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 13.22(\u00bf&gt;)(2)(iii). Depending on whether a shareholder certifies beneficial ownership of a share, the corporation must either pay shareholders or make an offer of payment. G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7\u00a7 13.23, 13.24, 13.25. A shareholder \u201cwho is dissatisfied with the amount of the payment\u201d may instead demand payment of the shareholder\u2019s own estimate of the fair value of the shares, plus interest. G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 13.26(a).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If such a demand for payment remains unsettled, \u201cthe corporation shall commence an equitable proceeding\u201d and \u201cpetition the court to determine the fair value of the shares and accrued interest.\u201d G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 13.30(a). The parties followed these steps, which culminated in the appraisal proceeding that is the subject of the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">c. <em>Judicial appraisal proceedings. </em>Robert alleges that the judge violated the appraisal provision of the Act, which provides, in part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-6\">\u201cThe court may appoint [one] or more persons as appraisers to receive evidence and recommend a decision on the question of fair value. The appraisers shall have the powers described in the order appointing them, or in any amendment to it. The shareholders demanding appraisal rights are entitled to the same discovery rights as parties in other civil proceedings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 <em>13.30(d)</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The statute does not specify how to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>conduct an appraisal, except that litigants must be afforded \u201cthe same discovery rights as parties in other civil proceedings.\u201d G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 13.30(d). The statute permits, but does not require, the judge to appoint one or more appraisers.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The procedures followed by the trial judge did not violate the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">d. <em>Determining fair value. </em>The \u201cfair value\u201d of the shares being appraised is defined as \u201cthe value of the shares immediately before the effective date of the corporate action to which the shareholder demanding appraisal objects, excluding any element <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>of value arising from the expectation or accomplishment of the proposed corporate action unless exclusion would be inequitable.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 13.01. In keeping with the equitable nature of the proceeding, G. L. c. 156D does not require the judge to follow any specific method for the determination of \u201cfair value.\u201d See G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 13.30(a). This is in accord with the discretion judges have enjoyed under prior Massachusetts law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">In general, in determining \u201cfair value\u201d under G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 <em>13.30(d), </em>the judge \u201cis not to reconstruct an \u2018intrinsic value\u2019 of each share of the enterprise but, rather, to determine what a willing buyer realistically would pay for the enterprise as a whole on the statutory valuation date.\u201d <em>BNE Mass. Corp. </em>v. <em>Sims, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 190, 197 (1992) (citation omitted). \u201c[Tjypically, in an appraisal ... the price the corporation must pay for minority shares is fair value determined, as the judge did here, by finding the value represented by all the shares and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>apportioning pro rata.\u201d <em>Shear </em>v. <em>Gabovitch, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 650, 677 (1997).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> When expert witness testimony is offered by one or more parties, as in this case, the judge may credit the valuation method utilized by an expert witness or reject it and rely on another reasonable method. See <em>Fechtor </em>v. <em>Fechtor, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 859, 863 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">2. <em>Constitutional challenge. </em>The appraisal proceedings also did not violate Robert\u2019s right to due process under art. 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Due process fundamentally requires \u201cnotice and the opportunity to be heard \u2018at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Matter of Angela, </em>445 Mass. 55, 62 (2005), quoting from <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Manzo, </em>380 U.S. 545, 552 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Robert alleges that he was given constitutionally insufficient notice of how the appraisal would proceed. In particular, he argues that the trial judge did not indicate what procedure she would follow or that she would rely on evidence presented at the jury trial. However, the trial judge plainly stated at the motion hearing on August 7, 2009, that she was going to proceed on the basis of evidence presented at trial, unless Robert showed good reason to do otherwise.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Robert\u2019s claim that he was given constitutionally insufficient notice is thus belied by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Robert also asserts'that the appraisal proceeding itself violated his right to due process. \u201cDue process does not require any particular type of hearing, and \u2018many matters can lawfully \u2014 and satisfactorily \u2014 be heard on the papers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Demoulas </em>v. Demoulas, 428 Mass. 555, 589 (1998), quoting from <em>EEOC </em>v. <em>Steamship Clerks Union, Local 1066, </em>48 F.3d 594, 608 (1st Cir.), cert, denied, 516 U.S. 814 (1995).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Much like the plaintiff contended in <em>Demoulas, </em>Robert claims that his due process rights were violated because he did not have the opportunity to conduct additional discovery and present additional evidence on the appraisal claim at an evidentiary hearing. However, both Robert and the defendants presented evidence which pertained to the valuation of the stock at the summary judgment proceedings and at trial. When the trial judge gave Robert the opportunity to submit an offer of proof for the appraisal claim, he failed to identify any evidence that he would present beyond that which was offered at trial.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In addition, Robert did not submit any affidavits or documentary evidence in support of his offer of proof, as the trial judge specifically requested. As in <em>Demoulas, </em>the trial judge acted properly and constitutionally in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>ruling on the appraisal claim without an additional evidentiary hearing where Robert failed to comply meaningfully with the judge\u2019s requests to indicate what new evidence he would present at such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">3. <em>Judge\u2019s decision. </em>Robert argues that the trial judge failed to make required findings of fact and conclusions of law in her summary adjudication of the appraisal claim. Under Mass. R.Civ.R 52(a), as amended by 423 Mass. 1402 (1996), \u201c[i]n all actions tried upon the facts without a jury, the court shall find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon.\u201d This rule \u201cdoes not require extensive detail, but does impose on the judge an independent duty to articulate the essential grounds of [her] decision.\u201d <em>Leader </em>v. <em>Hycor, Inc., </em>395 Mass. 215, 224 (1985), quoting from <em>Schrottman </em>v. <em>Barnicle, </em>386 Mass. 627, 638 (1982). Here, the trial judge stated, on the record, that her decision was based on the evidence presented at the trial of the contract claim; specifically addressed arguments made by Robert; and concluded that the fair value of the estate\u2019s stock was one percent of the net sale price. Accordingly, the trial judge satisfied the requirements of rule 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">4. <em>Determination of \u201cfair value\u201d of stock. </em>Robert also claims that the trial judge erred in determining that the fair value of the estate\u2019s stock was a one percent pro rata share of the net sale price of Spencer Press. See <em>Shear </em>v. <em>Gabovitch, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. at 677. Valuation is a question of fact that is reviewed only for clear error. See <em>Sarrouf </em>v. <em>New England Patriots Football Club, Inc., </em>397 Mass. 542, 550 (1986); <em>Chokel </em>v. <em>First Natl. Supermkts., Inc., </em>421 Mass. 631, 641 (1996); <em>Demoulas </em>v. <em>Demoulas Super Mkts., Inc., </em>424 Mass. 501, 541 n.47 (1997). The judge\u2019s \u201cdecision imports every fact essential to sustain it if there is evidence to support it.\u201d <em>Mailer </em>v. <em>Mailer, </em>390 Mass. 371, 373 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">As noted, G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 <em>13.30(d), </em>does not specify the valuation method that the judge must use and should be interpreted in a manner that is consistent with existing decisional law.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This is in accord with the consensus of courts in other jurisdictions acting under comparable appraisal statutes that the minority shareholder receives its proportionate share of a going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>concern without artificial discounts.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Robert argues that the judge erred because she oversimplified the appraisal determination and undervalued the \u201cfair value\u201d of the minority shareholder\u2019s stock by basing it exclusively on the pro rata share of the net sale price. While it is true that, in a close corporation that is not insolvent, factors other than the net sale price may be significant in assessing its value, in the absence of any credible evidence of such factors offered by the minority shareholder, the pro rata share of the net sale price is \u201cfair value.\u201d See <em>Sarrouf, supra </em>at 544 (the value of a \u201cgoing concern ... is the price a knowledgeable buyer would pay for the entire corporation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">The evidence that was relevant to the factual question of \u201cfair value\u201d presented during the jury trial included a certification filed by Robert with the Probate and Family Court five months after his mother\u2019s death (and while this litigation was pending) in which he declared that the value of his mother\u2019s one percent stockholding was $377,000. At his pretrial deposition, Robert testified that the purchase price paid by Donnelly was \u201ca great price.\u201d Although Robert testified at trial that in his opinion his mother\u2019s stock was worth \u201cat least one million dollars,\u201d none of the evidence presented at trial indicated that the fair value was anything other than one percent of the net sale price. The judge was warranted in concluding that the $60 million sale price paid by Donnelly for Spencer Press as a going concern was arrived at as a result of an arm\u2019s-length transaction. Moreover, the testimony of Philip Taub of Nixon Peabody, LLC, about the adjustments and deductions made from the purchase price established the net value of all the shares as $36 million.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Since the parties in this case were afforded the opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>engage in discovery on all of their claims prior to the stay of the appraisal claim, the judge was warranted in concluding that Robert\u2019s discovery rights under G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 13.30(&lt;\u00bf), had been satisfied, and that \u201cthere is not and will not be anything to indicate that the overall purchase price being paid for all of the stock is anything other than fair and favorable.\u201d Accordingly, the judge was warranted in concluding that the \u201cfair value\u201d of the estate\u2019s one percent stock interest in Spencer Press at the time of the merger was $361,540 and that the estate had already been paid that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">While Robert cites a variety of factors that may be considered in assessing the fair value of shares, with two exceptions, he does not give any reason why the judge should have used them in this case. Robert only substantively asserts that the estate\u2019s one percent interest is worth more than its pro rata share because it would give either Stephen or John a controlling interest in the company; and the purchase of the share was necessary in order to sell one hundred percent of the stock to Donnelly. Both of these arguments pertain to the value of the estate\u2019s stock to Stephen or John, rather than the fair value of the stock as a pro rata share of the net value of the business. Thus, Robert has not shown that the trial judge\u2019s valuation determination was clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">5. <em>Breach of fiduciary duty and conspiracy claims. </em>Robert further claims that the trial judge erred in granting summary judgment on his claims for breach of fiduciary duty and conspiracy. A grant of summary judgment is reviewed de nova, with all facts construed in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Cotter, </em>448 Mass. 671, 676 (2007). Robert, in essence, argues that the fiduciary duties owed to shareholders in a close corporation entitled the estate to notice of the cash-out merger before it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>happened, which is sooner than the estate received notice pursuant to G. L. c. 156D, \u00a7 13.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Stockholders in a close corporation owe each other a duty of utmost good faith and loyalty. <em>Donahue </em>v. <em>Rodd Electrotype Co. of New England, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 578, 593 (1975). Majority shareholders violate this duty when they frustrate the minority\u2019s \u201creasonable expectations of benefit from their ownership of shares.\u201d <em>Brodie </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>447 Mass. 866, 869 (2006) (illustrating so-called \u201cfreeze-out\u201d techniques). Georgia had not participated actively in the management of the corporation or received financial benefit from her ownership of the stock for approximately eighteen years. Thus, she had no reasonable expectation of benefit from ownership of the stock other than its fair value, which the estate received as a result of the cash-out merger. Robert\u2019s personal expectations of benefit are irrelevant, as he controlled the stocks only as fiduciary of the estate. See <em>Lathrop </em>v. <em>Merrill, </em>207 Mass. 6, 10 (1910).

Second, Robert wanted to offer evidence that during negotiations with the defendants, his brother Stephen had offered to pay him $500,000 and then $750,000 for his mother\u2019s stock. However, this evidence also was part of the evidentiary record at trial. Third, Robert wanted to offer evidence from a new expert witness, but only after an opportunity for additional discovery. The judge declined to reopen discovery in circumstances in which there was no indication of what the new expert witness would say. Fourth, Robert wanted to offer the stock purchase agreement between Spencer Press and Donnelly in order to make an argument based on a penalty clause in it.

This made it possible for an arbitrary minority to establish a nuisance value for its shares by refusal to cooperate. To meet the situation, legislatures authorized the making of changes by majority vote. This, however, opened the door to victimization of the minority.
