Thomas Hughes owned the weapon involved, and Glock, Inc. (Glock), was the manufacturer of the weapon. Elizabeth Ryan (plaintiff), the administratrix of the Milot estate,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> filed a complaint in Superior Court asserting claims of negligence and wrongful death against Hughes. The plaintiff also asserted claims of breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, negligence, wrongful death, and unfair and deceptive acts and practices against Glock. The defendants subsequently moved for summary judgment. The plaintiff filed oppositions to the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment and also filed motions to strike portions of the deposition testimony and certain paragraphs from the defendants\u2019 statements of undisputed fact. On October 8, 2009, after a hearing on the motions, the motion judge allowed both defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. This appeal followed. We affirm, and consider issues of negligence, and, in a matter of first impression in Massachusetts, the application of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7901-7903 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\"><em>Background. </em>In November, 2001, Milot was released on probation from the Billerica house of correction after an incarceration of about eighteen months. Hughes testified in his deposition that he helped Milot to get reestablished by lending him a small amount of money and giving him odd jobs to do around his house. Hughes knew Milot through Milot\u2019s sister, Deborah Mc-Conologue, and her husband, whom Hughes had known for twenty years. Hughes was aware of Milot\u2019s history of substance abuse and prior depression, and the loss of Milot\u2019s driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">In his deposition, Hughes testified that he owned several firearms that he stored in a chest in a second-floor bedroom. The bedroom was kept locked and had been outfitted with barred windows. Hughes testified that he kept the keys to this bedroom in a vase on top of the fireplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">One of the firearms that Hughes owned was a Glock pistol. Hughes purchased the Glock pistol and its storage container in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>2000 from the widow of a former Boston police officer. Hughes testified in his deposition that he stored the unloaded pistol as well as its magazine in its storage container in a chest drawer in the same bedroom where his other guns were stored. He further testified that he had never touched, loaded, or fired the weapon after purchasing it.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">In her deposition testimony, McConologue reported that, at a family event held on February 23, 2002, Milot showed her two handguns and two loose cartridges. McConologue could not describe the guns and did not know what the models were. Mc-Conologue testified that when she asked Milot where he had obtained the guns, Milot told her that he got them from Hughes\u2019s house. She further testified that Milot told her that he found the key in Hughes\u2019s house for the locked bedroom door, unlocked the door, and found the guns, ultimately taking them from Hughes\u2019s home. McConologue testified that she advised her brother to call Hughes and return the pistols to him, that Milot did not want to tell Hughes that he had taken the guns, but that Milot agreed to put them back the way he had found them.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">On February 25, 2002, Hughes picked up Milot around 7:00 a.m. and brought Milot to his house. Once they were at Hughes\u2019s house, Hughes showed Milot the front doorbell that he wanted Milot to repair. Hughes then left his house to run some errands, returning to check on Milot\u2019s progress about two hours later. When Hughes returned home, he found Milot\u2019s body covered with blood in the front doorway of his home. The police and an ambulance were called and upon their arrival, Milot was pronounced dead. An autopsy was performed, and it was determined that Milot had suffered a gunshot wound to his left thigh which severed the femoral artery and caused Milot to bleed to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Once they arrived on the scene, police officers followed a trail of blood to a second-floor bedroom. Police found a Clock nine \u2022 millimeter Model 17 handgun in a plastic storage case on the bed. There was a discharged cartridge in the chamber of the pistol, and police found powder bums on the bedspread in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>bedroom as well as pieces of plastic from the storage case on the floor by the bed. Police speculated that \u201c[apparently the victim was attempting to put the gun back in the container when the round was fired, striking the victim in the upper left leg. . . . The victim apparently walked out of the bedroom, down the front stairs, into the living room, used the telephone and walked to the front door where he collapsed and died.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Standard of review. </em>Under the familiar standard, a party is entitled to summary judgment \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories . . . [and] affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Mass.R.Civ.P. 56(c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974). This court reviews a grant of summary judgment de nova and examines \u201cwhether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, all material facts have been established and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>Byron, </em>447 Mass. 322, 325 (2006), quoting from <em>Anderson St. Assocs. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>442 Mass. 812, 816 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">2. <em>Ryan\u2019s claims against Hughes-Ortiz. </em>The plaintiff appeals from the motion judge\u2019s decision granting summary judgment on her negligence and wrongful death<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> claims against Hughes-Ortiz. The motion judge found that \u201cHughes owed Milot no duty of care and, even if he had, any negligence on the part of Hughes did not cause Milot\u2019s death.\u201d We need not reach the issues of duty and causation, however, because we conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s claims against Hughes-Ortiz are barred by Milot\u2019s criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">The facts reveal that Milot, through an affirmative act of theft in violation of G. L. c. 266, \u00a7 30, stole a firearm from the home of Hughes, the owner, who had placed trust in him. We conclude that public policy dictates that Milot\u2019s criminal conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>acts as a bar to recovery. See, e.g., <em>Flanagan </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. 444, 448-449 (1993), quoting from <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Kallash, </em>63 N.Y.2d 19, 25-26 (1984) (\u201cA \u2018burglar who breaks his leg while descending the cellar stairs, due to the failure of the owner to replace a missing step\u2019 . . . could be denied recovery for public policy considerations\u201d); <em>Driscoll </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of Milton Academy, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 285, 291-292 (2007) (student who committed statutory rape violated the law as well as \u201csocial values and customs\u201d and \u201cmay not recover in tort against the school for his own sexual misconduct\u201d). See also <em>Flanagan </em>v. <em>Baker, supra </em>(suggesting that, notwithstanding amendments to the comparative negligence statute, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85, as amended through St. 1973, c. 1123, \u00a7 1, civil actions \u201cby certain lawbreakers\u201d may be \u201cdefeated for public policy reasons\u201d). Compare <em>Jupin </em>v. <em>Kask, </em>447 Mass. 141, 147-148 (2006) (acknowledging there could be a \u201cpublic policy justification\u201d for refusing to impose a duty of care on the defendant homeowner, but declining to apply such an exception where the third-party plaintiff was killed after a household member with free access to the home took a weapon stored in the home).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The comparative negligence statute, G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85, does not require a different result. In providing that \u201c[t]he violation of a criminal statute ... by a plaintiff which contributed to [the plaintiff\u2019s] . . . death . . . shall be considered as evidence of negligence of that plaintiff, but the violation of said statute . . . shall not as a matter of law and for that reason alone, serve to bar a plaintiff from recovery,\u201d \u00a7 85 nevertheless allows for exceptions where, as here, the decision to bar the cause of action is based not only on the plaintiff\u2019s violation of a criminal statute, but also on public policy considerations. See <em>Flanagan </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. at 448. We therefore conclude that the judge did not err in granting summary judgment to Hughes-Ortiz.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Our conclusion is further buttressed by Restatement (Second) of Torts, and Milot\u2019s criminal acts \u2014 stealth of the pistol, and violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2006),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> which bars the pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>session of firearms and ammunition by convicted felons. It is clear that, at a minimum, Milot stole and had possession of a firearm and ammunition after having been convicted of the felony of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Milot\u2019s actions constitute the sort of conduct described in Restatement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>(Second) of Torts \u00a7 889 comment b (1977), whereby a plaintiff is \u201cbarred from recovery for harm caused by violation of [a] statute . . . [where] the harm resulted from a risk of the type against which the statute was intended to give protection.\u201d See \u00a7 889 comment b, <em>supra, </em>illustration 5; <em>Flanagan </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>35 Mass. App. Ct. at 448 &amp; n.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">As has been noted by the United States Supreme Court, in enacting the Gun Control Act of 1968 (which includes 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922[g][l], of which Milot was in violation; see note 7, <em>supra), </em>Congress sought to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">\u201ccurb crime by keeping \u2018firearms out of the hands of those not legally entitled to possess them because of age, criminal background, or incompetency.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-7\">\u201cIn order to accomplish this goal, Congress obviously determined that firearms must be kept away from persons, such as those convicted of serious crimes, who might be expected to misuse them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-8\"><em>Dickerson </em>v. <em>New Banner Inst, Inc., </em>460 U.S. 103, 118-119 (1983), quoting from <em>Huddleston </em>v. <em>United States, </em>415 U.S. 814, 824 (1974). See <em>Small </em>v. <em>United States, </em>544 U.S. 385, 393-394 (2005) (citing cases). See also <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>United States, </em>423 U.S. 212, 218 (1976) (\u201cCongress . . . sought broadly to keep firearms away from the persons Congress classified as potentially irresponsible and dangerous\u201d). See generally <em>District of Columbia </em>v. <em>Heller, </em>554 U.S. 570, 626 (2008) (in determining that a District of Columbia ban on handguns in the home violated the right to keep and bear arms protected by the Second Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>ment to the United States Constitution, the Supreme Court stated that \u201cnothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill\u201d); <em>McDonald </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>130 S. Ct. 3020, 3044 (2010) (\u201cthe Second Amendment protects a personal right to keep and bear arms for <em>lawful </em>purposes\u201d [emphasis supplied]).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Section 889 of the Restatement thus supports the conclusion that, in light of Milot\u2019s theft of the pistol and his violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), the plaintiff\u2019s claims against Hughes-Ortiz are barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">3. <em>Ryan\u2019s claims against Glock. </em>The plaintiff brought claims of breach of the implied warranty of merchantability, negligence, wrongful death, and unfair and deceptive acts and practices against Glock. These claims relate to both the Glock Model 17 pistol (Glock pistol) and the pistol\u2019s storage case (gun case). The judge granted summary judgment on all claims after finding that the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7901-7903 (2006) (PLCAA or Act) barred the plaintiff\u2019s claims against Glock. The plaintiff appeals, arguing that, on the facts in this case, the PLCAA does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The gun case at issue here has a post with a protruding wing or flange in the center. This design means that the Glock pistol\u2019s trigger and trigger safety must be fully rearward in order to fit into the case. When the Glock pistol is cocked and ready to fire, the trigger moves to the forward position with the trigger lock positively protruding. Once cocked, the trigger and trigger safety would need to be moved fully rearward again in order to fit over the post in the gun case. These are the same steps that would need to be taken to fire the Glock pistol.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">An orange sticker inside the gun case reads, \u201cCAUTION: PRIOR TO PLACING PISTOL INTO CONTAINER UNLOAD PISTOL. FOR UNLOADING PROCEDURES PLEASE REFER TO GLOCK INSTRUCTION MANUAL.\u201d In order to unload the Glock pistol, the magazine must be removed, any round in the chamber must be ejected, the chamber should be checked to ensure that no round remains in the chamber, and the pistol should be cocked once more and the trigger depressed while pointing the gun in a safe direction.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">The plaintiff alleges that the Glock pistol and gun case \u201cwere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>defective because the [gun] case caused the loaded Glock . . . pistol ... to discharge through the case and because the pistol was likely to discharge unintendedly\u201d and that \u201cGlock so negligently and carelessly designed the Glock Model 17 pistol and storage case . . . that the pistol discharged into the Decedent\u2019s body mortally wounding the Decedent.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s claims of breach of the implied warranty of merchantability and design defect are thus based on the interaction between the Glock pistol and the gun case. We now consider whether the claims, as formulated by the plaintiff, are barred by the PLCAA.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The PLCAA was enacted on October 26, 2005, and provides immunity to firearms manufacturers and dealers from any lawsuit, pending or otherwise, fitting the Act\u2019s definition of a \u201cqualified civil liability action.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7902-7903 (2006). See <em>Ileto </em>v. <em>Glock, Inc., </em>421 F Supp. 2d 1274, 1283 (C.D. Cal. 2006), aff\u2019d, 565 F.3d 1126 (9th Cir. 2009), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 3320 (2010). The proper analysis for determining the applicability of the PLCAA is two-fold. First, we must determine whether the lawsuit in question is a \u201cqualified civil liability action.\u201d Next, we must determine whether any of the PLCAA\u2019s six exceptions to this definition apply. Should the current suit fail to meet the definition of a \u201cqualified civil liability action\u201d or should any of the six exceptions apply, the plaintiff\u2019s claims against Glock would not automatically be dismissed. See <em>City of New York </em>v. <em>Beretta U.S.A. Corp., </em>524 F.3d 384, 398-399 (2d Cir. 2008), cert. denied, 556 U.S. 1104 (2009); <em>Ileto </em>v. <em>Glock, Inc. supra; City of New York </em>v. A-1 <em>Jewelry &amp; Pawn, Inc., </em>247 F.R.D. 296, 349-353 (E.D.N.Y. 2007); <em>Estate of Chariot </em>v. <em>Bushmaster Firearms, Inc., </em>628 F. Supp. 2d 174, 180 (D.D.C. 2009); <em>Adames </em>v. <em>Sheahan, </em>233 Ill. 2d 276, 308-313, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Adames </em>v. <em>Beretta U.S.A. Corp., </em>130 S. Ct. 1014 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">In pertinent part, as defined by the Act, a \u201cqualified civil liability action\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A). The present suit is a \u201ccivil action or proceeding\u201d brought by a \u201cperson\u201d (Ryan) against a \u201cmanufacturer\u201d (Clock, Inc.) for \u201cdamages.\u201d The parties do not dispute that the Clock pistol is a \u201cfirearm\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and therefore a \u201cqualified product\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> under the PLCAA. On appeal, the plaintiff argues for the first time that the allowance of Clock\u2019s motion for summary judgment should be reversed because the gun case is not a qualified product, and thus the PLCAA does not bar her suit against Clock. As this argument was not made in the trial court in the first instance, the argument is waived. See <em>Carey </em>v. <em>New England Organ Bank, </em>446 Mass. 270, 285 (2006) (\u201cThe plaintiffs never put the judge on notice that they opposed summary judgment on this theory. . . . Thus, we deem the issue waived\u201d). We express no opinion whether the PLCAA would preclude or permit a future plaintiff to bring claims involving the interaction between qualified and nonqualified products.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>\u201cmeans a civil action or proceeding . . . brought by any person against a manufacturer ... of a qualified product, ... for damages, punitive damages, . . . abatement, restitution, fines, or penalties, or other relief, resulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product by the person or a third party . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>The final element of the definition of a \u201cqualified civil liability action\u201d is that the civil action \u201cresult[ed] from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product by the person or a third party.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A). The Act defines \u201cunlawful misuse\u201d to mean \u201cconduct that violates a statute, ordinance, or regulation as it relates to the use of a qualified product.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(9). The plaintiff argues that \u201c[t]he PLCAA is inapplicable because there was no evidence supporting the conclusion that the gun was misused, whether criminally, unlawfully or otherwise.\u201d While it is true that no criminal charges were ever brought against Milot in connection with this incident, compare <em>Adames </em>v. <em>Sheahan, </em>233 Ill. 2d at 309-310 (adjudication of delinquency), the PLCAA does not require a criminal conviction in order for an activity to qualify as \u201ccriminal or unlawful misuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310-311. Here, in violation of 18 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>\u00a7 922(g)(1), Milot possessed a firearm and ammunition after having been convicted of a felony. See notes 7 &amp; 8, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Since the civil action at issue here resulted from Milot\u2019s possession of the Glock pistol, which constituted \u201ccriminal or unlawful misuse\u201d due to Milot\u2019s prior felony conviction, this is a \u201cqualified civil liability action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">The plaintiff argues that even if this is a \u201cqualified civil liability action,\u201d the PLCAA should not operate to foreclose her claims against Glock because her claims fall under the PLCAA\u2019s \u201cDesign Defect Exception.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> See <em>Ileto </em>v. <em>Glock, Inc., </em>421 F. Supp. 2d at 1283-1284 (\u201c[assuming a given action against a firearms manufacturer or dealer falls within one of these exceptions, the action can proceed\u201d). The design defect exception provides that a \u201cqualified civil liability action\u201d does not include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-6\">\u201can action for death, physical injuries or property damage resulting directly from a defect in design or manufacture of the product, when used as intended or in a reasonably foreseeable manner, <em>except that where the discharge of the product was caused by a volitional act that constituted a criminal offense, </em>then such act shall be considered the sole proximate cause of any resulting death, personal injuries or property damage\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(v).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Although, as noted above, Milot was not convicted of a criminal offense in connection with this accident, \u201cthe exception in section 7903(5)(A)(v) does not require a criminal conviction. The statute requires only that the volitional act constitute a criminal offense.\u201d <em>Adames </em>v. <em>Sheahan, </em>233 Ill. 2d at 313. Here, as we have discussed, the relevant volitional act that caused the gun\u2019s discharge was Milot\u2019s unlawful possession of the Glock pistol. Milot\u2019s volitional act constituted a criminal offense and the design defect exception is therefore not applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Thus, for the reasons outlined above we conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s claims against Glock were barred by the PLCAA.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b137-9\">Ryan is the ex-wife of Milot and the mother of the couple\u2019s son, Kyle Thomas Ryan, who is the sole heir of the estate of Charles Milot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b138-8\">On the day of Milot\u2019s death, Hughes signed a statement for the police in which he reported that \u201cthe [Glock pistol] was in it\u2019s [sic] case.

The motion judge did not address the plaintiff\u2019s wrongful death claim against Hughes-Ortiz under the wilful, wanton, or reckless act theory, and the plaintiff does not argue on appeal that such omission was error. We thus consider only the negligence theory of wrongful death in determining whether the judge erred in granting summary judgment to Hughes-Ortiz on the plaintiff\u2019s wrongful death claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b140-7\">In pertinent part, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922 provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">\u201c(g) It shall be unlawful for any person \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-9\">\u201c(1) who has been convicted in any court of[] a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>\u201cto . . . possess . . . any firearm or ammunition . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">Section 921(a)(20) of Title 18 provides, in pertinent part,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">\u201cThe term \u2018crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u2019 does not include \u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-8\">\u201c(B) any State offense classified by the laws of the State as a misdemeanor and punishable by a term of imprisonment of two years or less.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">\u201cWhat constitutes a conviction of such a crime shall be determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b141-10\">We take judicial notice of the fact that Milot had previously been convicted of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon (a meat cleaver), G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 15A. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fallon, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 473, 475 (2001) (court took judicial notice of defendant\u2019s convictions); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 331, 331 n.l (2004) (same). See also <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Longcope, </em>394 Mass. 577, 580 n.2 (1985) (\u201cIt is proper on a motion for summary judgment to recognize those facts of which a judge may take judicial notice, including criminal cases involving a party\u201d). \u201cA court may take judicial notice at any stage of the proceeding, whether requested or not.\u201d Mass.G.Evid. \u00a7 201(c) (2011). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grinkley, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 62, 69 n.9 (1997) (\u201cjudicial notice can be taken by trial and appellate courts\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-11\">Notwithstanding the fact that Milot was tried in the District Court and was sentenced to a term in the house of correction, for all practical purposes he was, nevertheless, convicted of a felony. \u201c[Ajssault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon[] is punishable by up to ten years in the State prison,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>444 Mass. 497, 499-500 (2005), and is deemed a felony. See <em>id. </em>at 498-500 (rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that because he was charged by complaint and sentenced in the District Court to two years in a house of correction, he did not meet the statutory criterion of being convicted of an offense \u201cpunishable by imprisonment in the [Sjtate prison\u201d). See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ware, 15 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 220, 223-224 (2009); <em>id. </em>at 224, quoting from <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sousa, </em>468 F.3d 42, 45 (1st Cir. 2006) (\u201cdefendant\u2019s prior conviction for assault with dangerous weapon was felony, and thus was predicate offense under Federal law prohibiting felon from being in possession of firearm, despite fact that defendant was prosecuted in Municipal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>Court and could not have been sentenced to State prison, as required for crime to be considered felony; crime charged carried potential for State prison term of not more than five years\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b142-10\">At the time he discharged the Glock pistol, Milot was also in violation of G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C. The plaintiff does not dispute that Milot lacked a license to carry or a firearm identification card, as required by \u00a7 129C, but instead argues that these facts are irrelevant because a jury might find that Milot\u2019s \u201chandling of the [pistol was] for a lawful purpose,\u201d which would make Milot exempt from the requirements of \u00a7 129C. See G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C(m). We disagree. No reasonable jury could find that, in returning the gun to its case, Milot was handling the pistol for a \u201clawful purpose,\u201d where he was in possession of the pistol without Hughes\u2019s permission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(3)(A) &amp; (B) <em>(2006), </em>a firearm is defined as \u201cany weapon . . . which will or is designed to or may readily be converted to expel a projectile by the action of an explosive\u201d or \u201cthe frame or receiver of any such weapon.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b145-7\">The PLCAA defines \u201cqualified product\u201d as \u201ca firearm (as defined in subparagraph [A] or [B] of section 921 [a][3] of Title 18), including any antique firearm (as defined in section 921 [a][16] of such title), or ammunition (as defined in section 921[a][17][A] of such title), or a component part of a firearm or ammunition, that has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b146-9\">As noted in note 9, <em>supra, </em>Milot was also in violation of G.

We thus need not examine any of the other exceptions to the PLCAA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"pAgbE\">The plaintiff argues on appeal that the judge abused her discretion in denying the plaintiff\u2019s motions to strike parts of the deposition testimony of Mc-Conologue and Hughes as well as portions of the defendants\u2019 statements of facts. The judge did not state any reason for denying these motions. We discern no abuse of discretion. See <em>Chan </em>v. <em>Chen, </em>70 Mass.
