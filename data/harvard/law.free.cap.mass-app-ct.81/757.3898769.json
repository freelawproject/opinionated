L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14(a), for proceedings to commit a defendant as a sexually dangerous person (SDP). We affirm a Superior Court judge\u2019s determination that the full probationary term be deemed to begin to run upon the defendant\u2019s release from the Massachusetts Treatment Center (treatment center).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\"><em>Background. </em>On November 25, 1992, the defendant pleaded guilty in Superior Court to fourteen counts of sexual offenses against minors, including three counts of rape and abuse of a child under sixteen, four counts of assault with intent to rape a child under sixteen, and seven counts of indecent assault and battery on a person over fourteen. The defendant was sentenced to a term of twelve to fifteen years, with eight years to be served and the remainder of the sentence suspended for ten years, during which time the defendant would be on probation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">The defendant was scheduled for release from prison on June 24, 2000. On June 8, 2000, before the defendant\u2019s committed sentence expired, the Commonwealth filed a petition seeking to commit civilly the defendant as a sexually dangerous person pursuant to G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 12, enacted after the defendant\u2019s guilty pleas and sentencing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant was committed temporarily to the treatment center pending a determination of probable cause. After a hearing on July 24, 2000, a Superior Court judge found probable cause existed to believe that the defendant was an SDP and temporarily committed the defendant to the treatment center for sixty days in accordance with G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 13(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>More than three years after the Commonwealth originally sought to commit civilly the defendant as an SDP, no trial had taken place, and the defendant remained at the treatment center. On October 7, 2003, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the SDP proceedings, arguing that the Commonwealth was late in its filing of the qualified examiners\u2019 reports and in petitioning for trial. On December 22, 2003, a Superior Court judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion, ruling that the examiners\u2019 reports had been timely filed on September 7, 2000, and that the Commonwealth\u2019s oral motion for trial that same day satisfied the requirements of G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14(a). The defendant filed a notice to appeal the dismissal of his motion, but did not pursue it.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Three years later, the defendant was still being held at the treatment center and no trial had yet taken place to determine whether the defendant should be civilly committed as an SDP. In December, 2006, the defendant filed a motion for reconsideration of the court\u2019s previous denial of his motion to dismiss, in light of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>447 Mass. 691 (2006), and a renewed motion to dismiss. A Superior Court judge granted the defendant\u2019s motions, finding that an oral motion for trial was insufficient to satisfy the requirement in G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14(a), that the Commonwealth\u2019s \u201cpetition [be] timely filed.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, the judge stated that the continued detention subjected the defendant to \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d and acknowledged that the denial of his earlier motion for release had been \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d The Commonwealth did not appeal from this decision, and the defendant was released on January 4, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Upon release from the treatment center, the defendant began to serve the term of probation associated with his sentence. On October 30, 2009, the defendant filed a motion for declaration of a probation termination date, contending that his probation should terminate on September 23, 2010, in light of his confinement from September 22, 2000, until January 4, 2007, in violation of G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14(a). A Superior Court judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>disagreed, ruling that the defendant\u2019s probation termination date is January 4, 2017, ten years after his release from the treatment center. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>The issue of the proper treatment of probation after a period of civil confinement later found to be in violation of G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14(a), is one of first impression. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sheridan, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 74, 75-77, 79 (2001) (Sheridan) (where defendant had been lawfully committed as SDP, probationary term began after defendant was released from treatment center due to finding he was no longer sexually dangerous). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>458 Mass. 11, 13 (2010) (Goodwin) (same). Because the motion judge only considered documentary evidence and did not hold an evidentiary hearing, our review is de nova. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fremont Inv. &amp; Loan, </em>452 Mass. 733, 741 (2008), quoting from <em>Packaging Indus. Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cheney, </em>380 Mass. 609, 616 (1980) (\u201c[I]f the order was predicated solely on documentary evidence we may draw our own conclusions from the record\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the motion judge incorrectly interpreted the sentencing judge\u2019s intent when she ruled that the defendant\u2019s probation will not end until 2017 \u2014 ten years after his release from the treatment center. The defendant claims that the sentencing judge intended that his supervision by the Commonwealth be complete after eighteen years absent additional misconduct, meaning that the defendant\u2019s probation should have ended in 2010. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">The sentencing judge died in 2005. \u201cWhen construing a sentencing order we look to the intent of the judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruzzese, 437 </em>Mass. 606, 615 (2002). After reviewing the record, we see no indication that the sentencing judge intended to strictly limit the period the defendant was under Commonwealth supervision to a maximum of eighteen years inclusive of incarceration and probation. The judge did not speak in the sentencing proceeding of a fixed term of \u201cCommonwealth\u2019s control\u201d or of the possibility that the defendant might serve some portion of his probation while confined. Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Juzba, </em>44 Mass. App. Ct. 457, 459-461 &amp; n.3 (1998). Instead, all the evidence available, apart from the sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>itself, indicates that the sentencing judge intended the defendant to serve a ten-year period of probation upon release into the community. At sentencing, the Commonwealth argued that \u201ca very long suspended sentence is necessary to ensure that the defendant is supervised <em>upon his release. </em>Treatment is a very essential component of this supervision. It\u2019s necessary to teach him how to control his behavior, and to some degree to rehabilitate him, if that\u2019s possible, your Honor.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) The sentencing judge appears to have agreed with this assessment by rejecting the defendant\u2019s suggestion of a five-year suspended sentence and instead imposing a ten-year suspended sentence. Moreover, the conditions of probation imposed by the sentencing judge (including no contact with the victims and no unsupervised contact with minors) are further evidence that the judge intended that upon his release into the community, the defendant was to be subject to supervision for the ensuing ten-year period.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">The judge\u2019s intent, manifested in the way the sentences were structured, reflects \u201c[t]he two principal goals of probation,\u201d namely, \u201crehabilitation of the defendant and protection of the public.\u201d <em>Goodwin, </em>458 Mass, at 15. See generally <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Power, </em>420 Mass. 410, 414-415 (1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1042 (1996). \u201cProbation ... is a legal disposition which allows a criminal offender to remain in the community subject to certain conditions and under the supervision of the court.\u201d <em>Sheridan, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. at 76, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Durling, </em>407 Mass. 108, 111 (1990). We are confident that the sentencing judge was aware of these purposes and confident that the intervening civil confinement \u201cdid not change the sentencing judge\u2019s intent to have the defendant supervised upon his release from custody.\u201d <em>Sheridan, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. at <em>11.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Our conclusion is also informed by the sentencing judge\u2019s rejection in 2003 of the defendant\u2019s contentions in a \u201cmotion to enforce plea contract and sentencing,\u201d brought pro se, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>Commonwealth was violating its plea agreement by confining him at the treatment center on an SDP petition, that his \u201cplea contract\u201d with the Commonwealth \u201cprovided that he would be released after eight years of confinement,\u201d and that the judge should order \u201cspecific performance\u201d of that contract by ordering his release. Citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Albert </em>A., 49 Mass. App. Ct. 269, 271 (2000), the sentencing judge ruled that there was no breach of the plea agreement because \u201cpossible commitment as a sexually dangerous person is a civil remedy independent of any criminal proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The defendant next argues that fairness requires that he receive credit for the time that he spent in civil confinement against his probation. We disagree that this is an appropriate remedy for the improper period of civil commitment. Here, crediting the defendant for the time that he was in civil confinement would run counter to the purposes of probation. See <em>Sheridan, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. at 76-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Probation is granted \u201cto enable the person to get on his feet, to become law abiding and to lead a useful and upright life under the fostering influence of the probation officer.\u201d <em>Goodwin, </em>458 Mass, at 15, quoting from <em>Mariano </em>v. <em>Judge of Dist. Court of Cent. Berkshire, </em>243 Mass. 90, 93 (1922). \u201cWhile committed to the treatment center, the defendant was separated from society and in an institutionalized setting that eliminated any need for the supervision of a probation officer. . . . The two goals of probation \u2014\u2022 rehabilitation under the supervision of a probation officer and the protection of society \u2014 are only brought into play when the offender is released into the community.\u201d <em>Sheridan, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. at 77. Here, as in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number><em>Sheridan, </em>the purposes of probation can only be fulfilled once the defendant is out in the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The defendant argues that his case is distinguishable from <em>Sheridan </em>because he was never lawfully adjudicated to be a sexually dangerous person and thus, unlike the defendant in <em>Sheridan, </em>suffered \u201cadverse consequence[s] with respect to his liberty.\u201d Contrast <em>Sheridan, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. at 78. While we agree that the cases are different in this respect, we disagree that this difference entitles the defendant to credit against his probation term for the term of his civil confinement. Decreasing the defendant\u2019s term of probation would frustrate the sentencing judge\u2019s intent that the defendant be supervised for a ten-year period of probation upon release. In addition, a shorter period of probation would jeopardize the goals of rehabilitation and public protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Indeed, in another case we rejected a defendant\u2019s argument</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-7\">\u201cthat once he was found not to be subject to the rehabilitative condition of confinement as a sexually dangerous person, he should not be subject to probation conditions, pursuant to G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 87, tailored to be responsive to his potentially continuing propensities. There is no support for such a position. One may be found not a sexually dangerous person for purposes of civil confinement, but may still pose a sexually dangerous risk to others without some supervision, restriction, or attempted rehabilitation outside of confinement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-8\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 839, 847 (2007). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goodwin, </em>414 Mass. 88, 93-94 (1993) (\u201cit is recognized that recidivism rates among child molesters are particularly high\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lapointe, </em>435 Mass. 455, 460 (2001) (given high recidivism rates, residence restriction to keep offender away from children was permissible probation term).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>The defendant also argues that he is entitled to credit for the years that he spent in civil confinement because his situation is \u201cidentical in every relevant respect to that of a prisoner facing dead time.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To avoid dead time, the time a defendant spends in custody prior to his or her sentence may be credited against the defendant\u2019s term of incarceration. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>366 Mass. 272, 273-274, 276 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 965, 966 (1983). However, the defendant cites no cases, and we are aware of none, where a defendant has received credit against a probationary term for time spent incarcerated or in civil confinement. In the case of a prisoner facing incarceration, a day spent confined awaiting trial is the functional equivalent of a day spent incarcerated. For the reasons described above, however, probation is significantly different from incarceration or civil confinement. A day spent confined or incarcerated is not the functional equivalent of a day spent out in the community under the supervision of a probation officer. Thus, the defendant\u2019s analogy to dead time fails.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The Commonwealth notes the Superior Court judge\u2019s finding that \u201c[djuring the time his SDP petition was pending, [the defendant] was represented by at least six successive attorneys. ... He bears some weight for the time the case took to reach a conclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The judge further commented: \u201cI have examined the docket on the case. It received considerable court attention as the parties prepared to litigate. [The defendant] did not languish, mouldering at the [treatment [c] enter. I infer from the docket entries that he was highly active in his own defense. Neither he nor his attorneys ever sought to advance the matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>for trial.\u201d In any event, we do not condone the fact that the defendant was confined for more than six years in violation of G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14(a). However, decreasing the defendant\u2019s probation is not a proper remedy and would be contrary to the intent of the sentencing judge. Dismissal of the SDP petition was the appropriate remedy for the Commonwealth\u2019s violation of G. L. c. 123A, \u00a7 14(a). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>447 Mass. 691, 693 (2006).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">\n<em>Order declaring probation termination date of January 4, 2017, affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Additional sentences ran concurrently.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b804-8\">General Laws c. 123A, \u00a7 12, was inserted by St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b804-9\">On January 28, 2002, the defendant moved to withdraw his guilty pleas on the grounds that they were not intelligently made, but made no arguments regarding the SDP confinement. The sentencing judge denied the motion. On appeal, five of the original guilty pleas were set aside because of deficiencies in the Commonwealth\u2019s recitation of the evidence and admissions by the defendant that fell short of establishing indecent assault and battery. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howard, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 1122 (2004). The other convictions were not disturbed. Because at least one conviction from each sentencing group was affirmed, the over-all sentencing structure remained intact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b805-7\">General Laws c. 123A, \u00a7 14(a), inserted by St. 1999, c. 74, \u00a7 8, requires that the petition \u201cbe made within 14 days of the filing of the report of the two qualified examiners\u201d; if the petition \u201cis timely filed within the allowed time,\u201d then a trial by jury is to be held \u201cwithin 60 days.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b807-7\">We also reject the defendant\u2019s characterization of the motion judge\u2019s ruling as an extension of the defendant\u2019s probation. Because, as discussed <em>supra, </em>the probationary period presently being served complies with the sentencing judge\u2019s intent that the defendant be supervised upon his release from custody into the community, there was no \u201cextension\u201d of probation by the motion judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b808-7\">See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bruno, </em>432 Mass. 489, 499 (2000) (\u201cThe [SDP] statute is neither punitive in intent or effect, nor does it constitute an ex post facto law\u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shindell, </em>63 Mass.

See generally Smith, Criminal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 23.59 (3d ed. 2007). Cf. Mass.R.Crim.P. 12(c)(3)(B), as appearing in 442 Mass. 1513 (2004) (\u201cThe judge shall inform the defendant on the record, in open court ... of any different or additional punishment based upon subsequent offense or sexually dangerous persons provisions of the General Laws, if applicable . . .\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b809-9\">The defendant objects to the judge\u2019s reference to \u201ca 2006 opinion by Dr. Ira Silverman in which he concludes that Mr. Howard meets the legal criteria for sexually dangerous persons. Dr. Silverman believed in 2006 that Mr. Howard would be highly likely to reoffend sexually if released into the community.\u201d We do not address this objection as that 2006 opinion is not material to our analysis here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b810-6\">\u201c[T]he term \u2018dead time\u2019 [is used] to refer to time spent in confinement under an invalid sentence for which no day-to-day credit is given against any sentence.\u201d <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>67 Mass.

R.Crim.P. 29(a), 378 Mass. 899 (1979), is not available to him because \u201che did not bring a motion within 60 days of sentencing, and the basis for relief is not a defect in the sentence as imposed, but rather the Commonwealth\u2019s conduct years afterward.\u201d While noting that Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(a), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), has no temporal bar and is available to defendants serving probation, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Azar, </em>444 Mass. 72, 76-77 (2005), the defendant states that it is not available to him since it is directed at the legality of the sentence itself, not to postsentencing events. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McGuinness, </em>421 Mass. 472, 475 (1995). We therefore do not consider Mass.R.Crim.P. 29(a) or Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(a) in our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
