L. c. 231, \u00a7 6E<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This pure question of law is one of first impression. After many years of litigation, with the defendants prevailing on all counts, a Superior Court judge determined that \u201csubstantially all, if not all, of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were wholly insubstantial, frivolous, and not advanced in good faith.\u201d The judge concluded that the defendants are entitled to recover post-judgment interest pursuant to G. L. c. 235, \u00a7 8,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> on an award of more than $1.23 million in attorney\u2019s fees and costs made pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6F, from the date the award was entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>on the docket until the date of execution. The plaintiffs appeal. We affirm the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\"><em>Background. </em>Robert Fronk, Jack Saltiel, and Maila L. Walter (plaintiffs) brought a civil action against Jeffrey A. Millman, Robert Lee Wolff, Jr., Maple Leaf Cambridge Corp., and the Cambridge Company, Inc. (defendants), in 2002. They asserted claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and misappropriation of partnership opportunities. After a jury-waived trial in Superior Court, the defendants prevailed on all issues in a judgment issued on June 7, 2006, and subsequently affirmed by this court. <em>Fronk </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 502 (2008) <em>(Frank I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">After the plaintiffs appealed the merits of this decision, the defendants filed a motion in Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 6F seeking fees and costs. The trial judge granted the defendants\u2019 motion after finding that \u201csubstantially all, if not all, of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims were wholly insubstantial, frivolous, and not advanced in good faith.\u201d <em>Fronk </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>456 Mass. 317, 318 (2010) <em>(Frank II) </em>(quoting Superior Court). The judge entered an award for $1.23 million in costs and fees. A single justice of this court vacated that award, but the Supreme Judicial Court ultimately reinstated it. Ibid.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">Following the trial court\u2019s receipt of the rescript, the defendants filed a motion in the Superior Court for the computation of statutory interest on the earlier Superior Court award of fees and costs. A different Superior Court judge ruled that regardless of its descriptive title, a \u00a7 6F award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs \u201cqualifies as a \u2018judgment for the payment of money.\u2019 \u201d The judge allowed the motion and entered an order pursuant to G. L. c. 235, \u00a7 8, for postjudgment interest at the statutory rate of twelve percent per annum from February 26, 2007, the date the \u00a7 6F award had been docketed. The plaintiffs appealed this order to the single justice, who reported the case to a full panel of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\"><em>Discussion. </em>The defendants contend that an award of attor-</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>As both parties agree, \u00a7 6F does not explicitly provide for interest on an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs to defendants who prevail against frivolous claims. The plaintiffs contend, however, that \u00a7 6F evinces an implicit intent to bar interest on the award by allowing enhanced interest in circumstances not present here. The plaintiffs argue that we should apply a principle of statutory construction known as \u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius\u201d (to express one is to exclude others), arguing that the express provision for interest in one set of circumstances establishes the Legislature\u2019s intent to exclude interest in other circumstances. However, that the Legislature excluded <em>enhanced </em>interest on attorney\u2019s fees and costs where a plaintiff asserts frivolous claims does not require a determination that the Legislature intended to exclude <em>any </em>interest on such an award. <em>Protective Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>425 Mass. 615, 620 (1997) (\u201ca maxim of statutory construction is not to be followed \u2018slavishly\u2019 where to do so would undermine the legislative purpose behind a statute\u201d). Moreover, we presume that the Legislature was aware of \u00a7 8 when it enacted \u00a7 6F.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Paquette </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>440 Mass. 121, 130 (2003) (\u201cThe Legislature is presumed to be aware of existing statutes when it amends a statute or enacts a new one\u201d). Where, as here, another statute provided for interest, the Legislature was not required to provide a redundant provision ordering interest in awards under \u00a7 6F. Thus, the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments pursuant to \u00a7 6F fail, and we turn to an analysis under \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Section 8 of G. L. c. 235 states that, \u201c[wjhen judgment is rendered upon ... the finding of a justice, interest shall be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>computed upon the amount of the award . . . from the time when made to the time the judgment is entered.\u201d For the award of interest here to be authorized by \u00a7 8, the relevant \u00a7 6F award below must be considered a \u201cjudgment.\u201d See <em>Osborne </em>v. <em>Biotti, </em>404 Mass. 112, 114 (1989). Without explicitly using the term \u201cjudgment,\u201d \u00a7 6F provides that \u201cthe court shall award to each party against whom . . . claims [found to be insubstantial, frivolous, and not advanced in good faith] were asserted an amount representing the reasonable counsel fees and other costs and expenses incurred in defending such claims.\u201d As discussed in <em>Osborne, supra, </em>\u00a7 8 is silent as to the meaning of the term \u201cjudgment.\u201d The court in <em>Osborne, </em>in analyzing whether an \u201caward of costs was \u2018a judgment for the payment of money\u2019 within the meaning of \u00a7 8,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>determined that \u201can award of costs bears interest from the date of entry to the date of execution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 117. We follow the <em>Osborne </em>court and also hold that a \u201cjudgment\u201d is \u201cthe act of the trial court finally adjudicating the rights of the parties affected by the judgment\u201d and starts the timetable for appellate review. Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(a), 365 Mass. 820 (1974). See <em>Osborne, supra </em>at 114; <em>Ben </em>v. <em>Schultz, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. 808, 811 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Like a formally titled \u201cjudgment,\u201d an award of fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 6F is subject to immediate appeal, starting the \u201ctimetable for appellate review.\u201d G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6G.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Compare Mass.R.A.R 4(a), as amended by 430 Mass. 1603 (1999) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>(appeals may be taken from entry of judgment). Whether a \u00a7 6F award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs is \u201cthe final adjudicating act of the trial court\u201d is a more complicated matter. This court has previously noted that \u201ca motion brought under [\u00a7 6F] is not part of the merits of the underlying action but is collateral to the judgment entered in that action.\u201d <em>Ben, </em>47 Mass. App. Ct. at 813. The collateral nature of \u00a7 6F motions means that \u201cany award granted [pursuant to \u00a7 6F] has no freestanding effect until all appeals of the underlying judgment are completed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 814. In the case at bar, all appeals of the underlying judgment were completed in 2008 when the Supreme Judicial Court denied further appellate review of the decision. See <em>Fronk </em>v. <em>Fowler, </em>451 Mass. 1107 (2008). The order granting the defendants\u2019 motion for interest on the \u00a7 6F award was decided in January, 2011. The plaintiffs\u2019 separate appeal of the \u00a7 6F award was also final at the time that interest was ordered. See <em>Fronk II, </em>456 Mass at 336. At the time that the trial court ordered interest on the attorney\u2019s fees and costs, the \u00a7 6F award in this case was final. We conclude that when interest was ordered on the \u00a7 6F award, this award met the definition of \u201cjudgment\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>As the Supreme Judicial Court has stated, \u201c[a] judgment will be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>treated on the footing of its substance and not of its name.\u201d <em>Shawmut Community Bank, N.A. </em>v. <em>Zagami, </em>419 Mass. 220, 224 (1994) (citation omitted). See <em>Gaulin </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Public Welfare, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 744, 746 &amp; n.6, 748 &amp; n.8, <em>S.C., </em>401 Mass. 1001 (1987) (\u201caward\u201d of attorney\u2019s fees ordered separately from judgment on underlying 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims is like \u201cordinary money judgment^\u201d entitled to postjudgment interest).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Relying on <em>Patry </em>v. <em>Liberty Mobilehome Sales, Inc., </em>394 Mass. 270, 272 (1985), and <em>Osborne, </em>404 Mass, at 116, plaintiffs also argue that awarding interest on attorney\u2019s fees, as opposed to costs,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> is improper.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We disagree. In <em>Patry, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court held that \u201c[n]o interest should have been allowed on the amount of trial court attorney\u2019s fees. Attorney\u2019s fees are not part of the damages suffered in a G. L. c. 93A action.\u201d <em>Patry, </em>394 Mass, at 272. Subsequent cases, however, have clarified that <em>Patry </em>was only commenting on the availability of prejudgment interest on attorney\u2019s fees, not the postjudgment interest on attorney\u2019s fees that are at issue here. See <em>International Totalizing Sys., Inc., </em>v. <em>PepsiCo, Inc., </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 424, 437 (1990); <em>Nardone </em>v. <em>Patrick Motor Sales, Inc., </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. 452, 453 n.3 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Because we rule that this \u00a7 6F award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs was a judgment for the purposes of \u00a7 8, \u201c[t]he addition of postjudgment interest is an automatic ministerial task and a judge need not expressly allow it.\u201d <em>Karellas </em>v. <em>Karellas, </em>54 Mass. App. Ct. 469, 475 (2002), citing <em>Osborne, </em>404 Mass, at 117. The defendants are not precluded, therefore, from interest pursuant to \u00a7 8 on the award because the judge who ordered the original \u00a7 6F award did not mention interest. See <em>Osborne, supra </em>at 117; <em>Karellas, supra </em>at 475.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Finally, we note that Massachusetts courts have ordered post-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>judgment interest on an award of attorney\u2019s fees in a variety of contexts since <em>Osborne </em>and <em>Patry </em>were decided. See, e.g., <em>Haddad </em>v. <em>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>455 Mass. 1024, 1028 (2010) (G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9); <em>International Totalizing Sys., Inc., supra </em>at 436-437 (G. L. c. 93A); <em>Nardone, </em>46 Mass. App. Ct. at 453 (G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 9). Postjudgment interest was appropriately ordered on both costs and attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">We turn to the statutory language in \u00a7 8 to determine when interest on the \u00a7 6F award begins to run. Section 8 provides that \u201c[ejvery judgment for the payment of money shall bear interest from the day of its entry.\u201d Interest on the defendants\u2019 \u00a7 6F award runs from February 26, 2007, the date the award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 6F entered on the docket.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Haddad, </em>455 Mass, at 1028. \u201cGranting a judgment creditor interest on a money judgment from the entry of the judgment to its satisfaction is intended to place the judgment creditor and the judgment debtor in the same position they would have enjoyed had the debtor paid the judgment promptly.\u201d <em>Osborne, supra </em>at 117. \u201c[Considering the time value of the dollar, the only way in which a fee award will retain its stated worth is by adding interest in order to compensate for delay in payment from that point forward.\u201d <em>Onofrio </em>v. <em>Department of Mental Health, </em>411 Mass. 657, 660 n.4 (1992), quoting from <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>948 F.2d 10, 22 (1st Cir. 1991). If the rule were otherwise and \u201cfees awarded as reasonable were paid after delays, net of interest, the effects as a practical matter would be to reduce those fees by indeterminate amounts without an explicable logic.\u201d <em>Gaulin </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. at 750, <em>S.C., </em>401 Mass. 1001 (1987).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b373-5\">General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 6F, as inserted by St. 1976, c. 233, \u00a7 1, states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">\u201cUpon motion of any party in any civil action in which a finding, verdict, decision, award, order or judgment has been made by a judge or justice or by a jury, auditor, master or other finder of fact, the court may determine, after a hearing, as a separate and distinct finding, that all or substantially all of the claims, defenses, setoffs or counterclaims, whether of a factual, legal or mixed nature, made by any party who was represented by counsel during most or all of the proceeding, were wholly insubstantial, frivolous and not advanced in good faith.

Moreover, since <em>Patry </em>refers only to prejudgment interest and <em>Osborne </em>is responding specifically to <em>Patry, </em>any dicta in <em>Osborne </em>regarding interest on attorney\u2019s fees should be read as applying exclusively to prejudgment interest and thus is inapplicable here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b379-7\">Because interest was awarded under \u00a7 8 and not \u00a7 6F, we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the automatic stay provision of \u00a7 6G controls.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b379-8\">Finally, we note that the single justice also certified a question about the appropriate forum for this appeal\u2019s initial presentation.
