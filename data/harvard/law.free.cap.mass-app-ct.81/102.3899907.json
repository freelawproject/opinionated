The judge later found the husband in civil contempt for failure to comply with certain provisions of the divorce judgment. In these consolidated appeals from the divorce judgment, as amended, and the contempt judgment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the husband challenges, among other things, the property division and the alimony award, as well as the judge\u2019s decision to find him in contempt. As we agree with the husband that the judge erred in the valuation of the wife\u2019s business interests, we remand the matter to the Probate and Family Court for further proceedings. In all other respects, we affirm the divorce judgment, as amended. We also affirm the judgment of contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>A. <em>The divorce action. </em>1. <em>Background. </em>The parties were married in June, 1993, and separated in July, 2005. Two children were born of the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">The husband was born in 1960 and is in good health. He is a principal/salesman at New England Technical Sales (NETS) where his base salary is $100,000 per year. The husband owns fifty percent of the shares in NETS; his brother owns the remaining shares. The husband is also an owner (forty percent of the shares) and the vice president of sales and marketing at a corporation known as Online Marketing Solutions, Save Harbor, Inc. (OMS).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He does not currently draw a salary from OMS. The parties stipulated that the fair value of the husband\u2019s interest in NETS is $21,000 and the fair value of his interest in OMS is $71,000. The judge also found that the husband has made loans to NETS and OMS in the amount of $675,000 and that the \u201cloans receivable\u201d from NETS and OMS are assets subject to division.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Although the judge found that the husband\u2019s base salary from NETS is approximately $100,000 per year, she stated that the husband\u2019s \u201ctrue income\u201d is approximately $200,000 per year. The judge noted that the husband\u2019s companies consistently pay for the rental payments on his personal residence, the mortgage payment on property that he owns with his brothers in New Hampshire, and numerous other miscellaneous personal expenses not accounted for as income on his financial statements. Indeed, the judge found that \u201c[throughout the proceedings, the husband has been less than forthcoming with his financial data, less than accurate in his financial disclosures, and consequently, less than credible in his testimony to the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The wife was born in 1962 and is in good health. She holds a master\u2019s degree in science education, and at the time of trial, was employed as a part-time biology teacher earning $8,450 per year. Her employment is not guaranteed.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">The wife has ownership interests (24.75 percent of the nonvoting stock) in three closely held S corporations: Scarfo Construction, Inc. (Scarfo Construction); Liberty Manor, Inc. (LMI); and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>Liberty Homes, Inc. (LHI).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These interests were given to the wife by her father, who gave identical ownership interests to each of the wife\u2019s three sisters.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The wife\u2019s father owns one percent of each of the companies; his shares are the voting stock. The judge adopted the values of the wife\u2019s interests in the companies \u201cas determined by the expert testimony she offered\u201d and \u201cbased on the sound and thorough analysis detailed in the oral and documentary evidence submitted.\u201d More specifically, the judge found that as of December 31, 2008, the wife\u2019s interest in Scarfo Construction was valued at $291,000 and that her interest in LMI and LHI was worth $75,000.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">The judge found that both parties had made significant contributions to the value and appreciation of the total marital estate, which the judge valued at $2,068,049. While the husband was the primary income earner during the marriage, the wife made substantial contributions to the marital estate through the generous and regular financial gifts she received from her parents and the interests she acquired in the family corporations. The wife was also the primary homemaker and caretaker for the parties\u2019 children.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">During the marriage the parties enjoyed a \u201chigh station in life\u201d which included an expensive home, domestic help, luxury cars, country club memberships, and frequent vacations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Since the parties\u2019 separation, however, the wife has been unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>maintain her preseparation lifestyle and has been forced to cut back on many of her expenses. The judge found that the husband\u2019s station had \u201cessentially remained the same post separation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">On these findings and others, the judge determined that each party should receive one-half of the total marital estate, or $1,034,024. Noting that the assets assigned to the husband totaled $1,294,167,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the assets assigned \u201cthus far\u201d to the wife totaled $773,882,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the judge ordered the husband to pay to the wife the sum of $260,142 to achieve an equal division of the marital estate. As we have stated, the judge also ordered the husband to pay the wife child support in the amount of $500 per week and alimony in the amount of $940 per week. In addition, the judge ordered the husband to pay the wife $175,000 for legal fees and costs. The husband\u2019s motion to stay the judgment was denied.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">2. <em>Valuation of wife\u2019s business interests. </em>The husband challenges on numerous grounds the judge\u2019s findings with respect to the values of Scarfo Construction, LMI, and LHI.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">a. <em>Valuation date. </em>Contrary to the husband\u2019s assertion, the judge did not abuse her discretion and commit reversible error by \u201cmisconstru[ing] the decision of the [djiscovery [m]aster and alter[ing] valuation dates in the middle of trial.\u201d In her third supplemental report dated November 7, 2008, the discovery master \u201crecommend[edj\u201d that both parties \u201cshall\u201d use June 30, 2008, as the date for valuation of all businesses which are the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>subject of this litigation. The discovery master afforded each party, however, the opportunity to seek a different valuation date upon submission of an affidavit no later than January 5, 2009, alleging a material change in circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">By affidavit dated January 5, 2009, the wife\u2019s business expert described the changes in the economic climate since June 30, 2008, including the precipitous fall in the real estate market, and the effect of those changes on Scarfo Construction, LMI, and LHI which were \u201cheavily reliant on the current economic climate.\u201d The wife\u2019s expert stated that a valuation date of June 30, 2008, would not be as appropriate as utilizing a date much closer to the scheduled date of trial. The question of the date of the valuation was referred by the master to the judge who, apparently, did not reach the issue prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">At a hearing on a motion in limine, which took place on February 13, 2009 (at the start of the second day of trial), the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">\u201cA couple things have to be noted here \u2014 to decide this motion . . . [I]t\u2019s very true that the discovery master gave each side \u2014\u2022 both sides \u2014 the opportunity to select the date of December 31st instead of June 30th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">\u201cWhoever chooses not to do that, you do so \u2014 I think in this economy \u2014 at your peril because I don\u2019t think you have to be any kind of expert in any of these matters to know that individuals on a common sense basis whether it\u2019s corporations that do what Scarfo Corporation does or Liberty Manor or Liberty Homes, there are very few entities that wouldn\u2019t take a value back in June as opposed to a value of 12/30.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">It is apparent from the foregoing that the judge did not simply alter the valuation dates midtrial, but rather recognized that the husband had followed the protocol set out by the discovery master for establishing a change in the valuation date. Based on the changes in the economic climate, the judge indicated that it was reasonable and proper for the wife to utilize a valuation date of December 31, 2008. To the extent the husband claims that he first received the wife\u2019s business valuations shortly before trial and that he should have known in advance \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>opinions of experts engaged by the opposing party for purposes of preparing cross examination and rebuttal expert testimony,\u201d it is to be noted that the wife\u2019s experts did not testify until the third day of trial on April 1, 2009. The husband had sufficient opportunity to prepare for cross-examination.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">b. <em>The valuation methodologies. </em>The husband argues that the judge erred in her valuation of the wife\u2019s companies \u201c[b]y [utilizing [fjlawed [vjaluation [mjethodologies [tjhat [\u00b6] ailed [t]o [cjomply [wjith [gjoverning [pjrecedents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The judge, as we have indicated, adopted the values of the wife\u2019s interests in Scarfo Construction, LMI, and LHI based upon the testimony of the wife\u2019s experts. In valuing the wife\u2019s 24.75 percent interest in the three companies, the wife\u2019s business expert, Steven B. Boyles, <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> utilized a \u201cfair value standard.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Continuing, Boyles stated that there are three standard approaches to business valuation: the assets approach, the income approach, and the market approach. He determined that the assets approach and, more particularly, a form of that approach called the \u201cadjusted net asset method,\u201d was most appropriate. Boyles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>explained that the adjusted net asset method \u201ctakes the book value of the assets, writes those assets up to market, what they could be sold for in the marketplace \u2014 not liquidated but sold in a reasonable time frame \u2014 and subtracts all liabilities associated with them.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">With respect to Scarfo Construction, Boyles determined that the wife\u2019s 24.75 percent prediscounted interest was valued at $489,386. He then applied a fifteen percent discount for lack of control and a thirty percent discount for lack of marketability which resulted in an after discount fair value of $291,000. With respect to LMI and LHI, Boyles combined the two companies into one entity for valuation purposes, adjusted their assets to fair value based on the real estate appraisals of the wife\u2019s expert and \u201csubtracted out\u201d liabilities. After making certain inter-company adjustments, Boyles determined that the prediscount value of the wife\u2019s 24.75 percent interest in LMI and LHI was $126,599. Applying a fifteen percent discount for lack of control and a thirty percent discount for lack of marketability, Boyles opined that the fair value of the wife\u2019s interest in the two companies was $75,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">In <em>Adams </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>459 Mass. 361, 380-381 (2011) <em>(Adams), </em>the court set out certain of the principles applicable to a judge\u2019s valuation of business interests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-7\">\u201cValuation of a business interest is a question of fact. . . . The standard of review to be applied is whether the judge\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous .... When the opinions of valuation experts diverge, a judge may \u2018accept one reasonable opinion and reject the other.\u2019 . . . The judge may also \u2018reject expert opinion altogether and arrive at a valuation on other evidence.\u2019 . . . The judge \u2018may not, however, reach a valuation that is materially at odds with the totality of the circumstances or, in the case of divorcing spouses, at variance with the requirements of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>equitable distribution statute.\u2019 G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34. <em>Bernier </em>[v. <em>Bernier, </em>449 Mass. 774, 785 (2007) <em>(Bernier)].\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The husband argues that Boyles, and consequently the judge in relying on Boyles\u2019s testimony and documentation, erred in utilizing the \u201casset approach,\u201d rather than an income-based approach, in appraising the three corporations. At the outset, Boyles testified, and his report states, that although he ultimately utilized the adjusted net asset method of valuation, he considered the income approach with respect to each of the companies but determined that that approach did not provide a meaningful result.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> While it has been stated that \u201c[t]he consensus approach to valuation deployed by appraisers and experts in marriage dis-solutions has coalesced around some variation of what is known as the \u2018income approach,\u2019 \u201d <em>id. </em>at 381, we do not think a judge is necessarily precluded from relying on an asset-based valuation. On the evidence presented, and particularly the testimony and report of Boyles describing why the asset approach was preferable to the income approach in the valuation of the wife\u2019s business interests, the judge\u2019s reliance on the asset-based valuation was neither unreasonable nor \u201cmaterially at odds with the totality of the circumstances\u201d and cannot be said to be clearly erroneous. <em>Id. </em>at 380-381. It is to be noted that the husband\u2019s expert, Bernard L. Caniff, Jr., also utilized an asset-based approach in valuing the wife\u2019s interest in the three companies, albeit as a base line valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">The husband challenges, as contrary to the teachings of <em>Bernier, </em>the judge\u2019s adoption of business valuations that contain \u201clack of control\u201d and \u201cmarketability\u201d discounts. In <em>Bernier, </em>the court stated, as a \u201cpreliminary matter,\u201d that \u201cwhere valuation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>assets occurs in the context of divorce, and where one of the parties will maintain, and the other be entirely divested of, ownership of a marital asset after divorce, the judge must take particular care to treat the parties not as arm\u2019s-length hypothetical buyers and sellers in a theoretical open market, but as fiduciaries entitled to equitable distribution of their marital assets.\u201d Bernier, 449 Mass, at 775-776. The court determined that, in the circumstances of that case, the judge erred in adopting the husband\u2019s expert\u2019s \u201cmarketability\u201d discount. <em>Id. </em>at 791-792.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-5\">\u201c[A] marketability discount \u2018adjusts for a lack of liquidity in one\u2019s interest in [a closely-held corporation], on the theory that there is a limited supply of potential buyers for stock in a closely-held corporation.\u2019... As [the husband\u2019s expert] testified, and the judge found, a marketability discount is \u2018the ability to convert the subject company to cash.\u2019 This discount was not warranted in light of the husband\u2019s testimony negating any possibility of a sale. . . . The subject companies will continue as going concerns and are not being converted to cash. \u2018[N]either marketability nor a minority discount should be applied absent extraordinary circumstances. . . . Close corporations by their nature have less value to outsiders, but at the same time their value may be even greater to other share-holders who want to keep the business in the form of a close corporation.\u2019 <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>348 N.J. Super. 466, 474-476 (2002). Applying a marketability discount in light of the husband\u2019s intended, and presumed, acquisition of the Supermarkets unfairly deflated their value.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-6\"><em>Bernier, supra </em>at 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">The husband argues that in the circumstances presented here, and where a sale of Scarfo Construction, LMI, and LHI is not imminent, the judge erred by failing to adhere to the standards articulated in <em>Bernier </em>when it adopted the opinion of Boyles. The wife, while acknowledging that a sale of the businesses is not imminent,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> argues that <em>Bernier </em>is distinguishable in that the wife has no control over the businesses, and practically speaking, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>\u201ccannot sell, transfer or pledge her shares in the businesses\u201d and cannot convert them into cash.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The wife asserts that the judge\u2019s adoption of a discounted value of the wife\u2019s interests was thus warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">While we agree with the wife that there are factual differences between <em>Bernier </em>and the case at bar, the principles espoused in <em>Bernier </em>concerning the valuation of closely held businesses in the divorce context convince us that the judge erred in the instant matter in adopting the discounted values of the wife\u2019s interests. As to the marketability discount, here, as in <em>Bernier, </em>the sale of the businesses (and the wife\u2019s interests therein) is not anticipated at the present time and the companies will not be converted to cash. In the circumstances, liquidity, a hallmark of the marketability discount, is of \u201clittle consequence.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>348 N.J. Super, at 488. To apply the marketability discount in the circumstances presented here would, we think, \u201cunfairly deflated\u201d the value of the companies. <em>Bernier, </em>449 Mass, at 792.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">A \u201cminority\u201d or lack of control discount \u201crecognizes that controlling shares are worth more in the market than are non-controlling shares\u201d and that \u201c[mjarketability problems often affect shares of closely held corporations.\u201d <em>Shear </em>v. <em>Gabovitch, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 650, 678 (1997), quoting from 12B Fletcher, Cyclopedia of Private Corporations \u00a7 5906.120, at 435, 436 (1993).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Although a minority discount was not specifically at issue in <em>Bernier, </em>the court, through dictum, made clear that such a discount \u201cshould not be applied absent extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Bernier, </em>449 Mass, at 792, quoting from <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>348 N.J. Super, at 483. But see <em>Fechtor </em>v. <em>Fechtor, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 859, 862-864 (1989) (a <em>pre-Bernier </em>case). Again, as a sale of the businesses is not presently anticipated, and in the absence of what we would perceive as extraordinary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>circumstances, it was error for the judge to adopt a valuation for the wife\u2019s interest in the businesses which utilizes a lack of control discount.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">There is nothing in the husband\u2019s remaining contentions that would cause us to disturb further the judge\u2019s valuation methodologies with respect to the wife\u2019s interests in Scarfo Construction, LMI, and LHI.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">3. <em>Dissipation. </em>At the time of the parties\u2019 separation in July, 2005, the husband had a Smith Barney checking account (balance of $215,845) into which he deposited his paychecks and from which he paid the mortgage and other marital expenses as well as his own personal expenses (including expenses attributed to his high station lifestyle, and counsel fees).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The husband also maintained a Smith Barney simplified employee pension individual retirement arrangement (SEP IRA) account. The husband acknowledged that by 2008 the monies in his Smith Barney checking account had been generally depleted, and he withdrew $50,000 from the IRA in March, 2008, and $150,000 in August, 2008, and deposited the monies in his Smith Barney checking account.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">The judge denied the wife\u2019s request to credit the husband with an advance of $215,000 for the funds he spent from the Smith Barney checking account, noting that some of the funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>were used to pay the mortgage and other marital expenses. The judge found it reasonable, however, to assess an advance of one-half that sum ($107,500) for funds depleted from the marital estate. The judge treated the withdrawal by the husband of $200,000 from the Smith Barney IRA, without leave of court or consent of the wife, as an advance to the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">In view of the judge\u2019s findings, for example, that the husband used the financial resources of the marital estate to maintain a high lifestyle for himself (while the wife\u2019s standard of living was substantially reduced), we cannot say that the judge erred in concluding that the husband had dissipated the marital estate. To the extent the husband claims that the judge engaged in some form of double dipping vis-\u00e1-vis his checking and IRA accounts, the husband\u2019s own testimony indicates that he depleted the assets in the checking account <em>prior </em>to the funding of that account with money from the IRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">4. <em>Inequitable division of property. </em>The husband takes the position that the judge\u2019s orders for division of property leave the parties \u201cin vastly disparate circumstances,\u201d and, essentially, impoverish him. A primary thrust of the husband\u2019s argument is that notwithstanding the parties\u2019 stipulation that the husband\u2019s ownership interests in OMS and NETS had a combined value of $92,000 (and other testimony with respect to the businesses), the judge rejected his testimony that the loans he made to OMS and NETS in the amount of $675,000 were now worthless. The husband appears to assert that the judge erred in valuing the loans at their full face value when apportioning the loans to him as a portion of his share of the marital assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">The parties stipulated concerning the value of the husband\u2019s business interests on June 11, 2009. On his financial statement filed in February, 2009, the husband listed \u201cNotes Held\u201d with respect to OMS and NETS with a value of zero. The judge found that this representation was \u201cclearly false.\u201d On subsequent financial statements filed on June 3, 2009, and July 28, 2009 (filed after the parties\u2019 stipulation), the husband listed \u201cNotes Held\u201d in the amount of $675,000 reflecting loans he had made to the companies. It is noteworthy that the husband included the full value of the notes in determining the total value of his assets. The judge found that the representations on these financial statements state the accurate amount of the loans due the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Although the husband testified that he did not consider the $675,000 as money OMS and NETS owed him but rather as monies he simply had invested in the businesses,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the judge clearly did not credit that testimony. In view of the foregoing, and the evidence that OMS and NETS had, in recent years, repaid various loans,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> we fail to discern error.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The husband\u2019s terse and conclusory assertions in his principal brief that certain distributions amounting to over $1 million reflected on the Internal Revenue Service schedule K-l (K-l) forms filed by the wife\u2019s S corporations between 1998 and 2008, but which the judge determined the wife did not actually receive,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>had </em>to be treated as loans by the wife to the corporations and recognized as marital assets to be divided equitably<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> does not rise to the level of argument contemplated by Mass. R.A.R 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1925).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Poras </em>v. <em>Pauling, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 535, 546 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">5. <em>Alimony. </em>In her findings in support of the alimony award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>in the amount of $940 per week, the judge stated that the wife had the requisite need and the husband had the requisite ability to pay alimony to approximate the standard of living enjoyed by the parties during the marriage. See generally <em>Grubert </em>v. <em>Grubert, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 811, 819 (1985). The judge further stated that there was no evidence to suggest that the actual amount of distributions made to the wife from the subchapter S corporations bore any resemblance to the amount of K-l income reported by the wife for income tax purposes. Indeed, the judge found that the wife\u2019s annual income is approximately $8,450 from her employment. The judge noted that \u201cthe wife\u2019s 24.75 [percent] interests in each of the family businesses . . . may eventually generate income to [the] Wife to a greater degree than they presently do, and the Husband may, in the event that a material change in circumstances occurs, seek a modification of the current alimony and or child support orders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The husband asserts that although the K-l forms indicate that between 1998 and 2008<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> there were substantial distributions of K-l income to the wife from Scarfo Construction, the judge made no findings as to what happened to the distributions reported or \u201cthe form or \u2018value\u2019 \u201d of their reinvestment in the companies.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> He requests that we remand the matter for further findings and consideration in the light of the \u201cground rules\u201d set out in <em>J.S. </em>v. C.C., 454 Mass. 652, 661-664 (2009) (listing some relevant factors that a judge should weigh in determining what portion, if any, of undistributed corporate earnings may be available to a shareholder for child support obligations). See <em>Halpern </em>v. <em>Rabb, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 331, 335-337 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">It is clear from the findings, viewed in their entirety, that the judge had in mind in fashioning the alimony award the present circumstances of the wife and the businesses and the undisputed evidence that the businesses had been severely affected by the economic downturn. In fact, the certified public accountant who has long done the accounting work for Scarfo Construction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>testified that he anticipated that there would be no distributions for tax purposes for 2009 as the companies collectively operated at a loss. In the circumstances, we decline to disturb the judge\u2019s order for alimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">B. <em>The contempt action. </em>In March, 2010, the wife filed an amended complaint for civil contempt alleging that the husband had failed to comply with various provisions of the divorce judgment, including the orders to pay the wife $175,000 for legal fees and $260,142 to equalize the marital assets. After a hearing,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> the husband was adjudged guilty of contempt for failing to pay the above sums (as well as his failure to transfer the balance of his Smith Barney IRA to the wife). The judge found specifically that the husband had the present ability to pay the amount of $260,142. She ordered that the husband be granted an additional sixty days to pay the legal fees of $175,000. The husband was also assessed $3,350 in additional attorney\u2019s fees. The judge ordered that the husband be committed to jail for ninety days until he purged himself of the contempt by the payment of $263,492. After the husband\u2019s motion for stay was denied, he was incarcerated for ninety days.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">In order to find a defendant in civil contempt there must be a clear and unequivocal command and an equally clear and undoubted disobedience. <em>Larson </em>v. Larson, 28 Mass. App. Ct. 338, 340 (1990). <em>Whelan </em>v. <em>Frisbee, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 76, 82 (1990). <em>Poras </em>v. <em>Pauling, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. at 539-540. \u201cIn addition, the defendant must be found to have the ability to pay at the time the contempt judgment enters.\u201d <em>Larson </em>v. <em>Larson, supra </em>at 340. Furthermore, \u201c[a] person judged in civil contempt may not be sentenced to prison for failure to pay a compensatory sum of money if he shows that he is unable to comply.\u201d <em>Salvesen </em>v. <em>Salvesen, </em>370 Mass. 608, 611 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The husband argues briefly that the judge erred in adjudging him in contempt and confining him to jail for ninety days as the judge failed to find as a fact that he had in excess of $400,000 to comply with the orders. The husband\u2019s argument misses the mark in that the judge, as we have discussed, fixed the purge amount at $263,492 and found expressly that the husband had</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>C. <em>Attorney\u2019s fees. </em>In a two sentence \u201cargument,\u201d the husband asserts that the judge erred in awarding attorney\u2019s fees to the wife. He claims that in light of the need to reconsider \u201cmuch\u201d of the judgment and amended judgment, the fee award should be vacated and revisited during reconsideration of the case. Passing the question whether the husband\u2019s terse assertions rise to the level of reasoned appellate argument, as we are affirming the contempt judgment and vacating the divorce judgment, as amended, in only limited respects, we perceive no reason to disturb the award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">D. <em>Appellate attorney\u2019s fees. </em>The wife <em>and the husband </em>have requested that they be awarded attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to Mass.R.A.P. 25, as appearing in 376 Mass. 949 (1979).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Their requests are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">E. <em>Summary. </em>We vacate so much of the judgment of divorce nisi, as amended, as it values implicitly the wife\u2019s interests in her three family businesses and remand for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion concerning the marketability and minority discounts. The judge may hold such further hearing as she deems necessary and shall enter such further orders, as appropriate. In all other respects, including the orders for alimony and attorney\u2019s fees, the judgment is affirmed. The judgment on the amended complaint for civil contempt is also affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b149-13\">The husband also appealed from an order of the single justice of this court denying his motion for stay.

The judge also assessed as an advance to the husband the sum of $107,500, representing funds \u201cdepleted from the marital estate.\u201d In addition, the judge treated the withdrawal by the husband of $200,000 from a Smith Barney SEP IRA without leave of court or consent of the wife as an advance to the husband.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b152-9\">The major assets assigned to the wife were the former marital home (equity value $282,000); the wife\u2019s interests in Scarfo Construction ($291,000) and LMI and LHI ($75,000); and the entire balance of the husband\u2019s Smith Barney simplified employee pension individual retirement arrangement (SEP IRA) account (approximately $121,000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b152-10\">In February, 2010, the parties filed a stipulation to amend the judgment on grounds not relevant here.

He understood that \u201cterm to represent the value based upon actual facts of the matter and not on a hypothetical buyer and seller as is the case under fair market value.\u201d Compare <em>Bernier </em>v. <em>Bernier, </em>449 Mass. 774, 779 n.8 (2007) <em>(Bernier), </em>quoting from <em>Gross </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Int.

The husband\u2019s business expert, Bernard L. Caniff, Jr., also employed a \u201cfair value\u201d standard which he defined \u201cin simple forms\u201d as fair market value without discounts.

The income approach is based on the earning stream. In the economic climate that we\u2019re in and the industry that they\u2019re in, the earning stream can be projected going forward, but the risk of tainting those earnings is higher now, so it drives the value down below what you could attain from just the assets themselves.\u201d Contrary to the husband\u2019s suggestion, Boyles made clear at trial that his decision to utilize an asset-based approach was not based exclusively on Rev. Ruling 59-60, 1959-9 I.R.B., which makes reference to the valuation of the stock of a closely held investment or real estate holding company.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b157-8\">Both Boyles and Caniff also testified that it was not anticipated that the businesses would be sold at the present time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b158-7\">We note that the stock redemption agreement envisions the possible sale of stock by a shareholder, albeit subject to certain restrictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b158-8\">One court has stated that while a \u201c \u2018marketability discount\u2019 reflects the theoretically limited market for the sale of a privately-held, small business,\u201d a \u201c \u2018minority discount\u2019 reflects a theoretically more limited market for sale of a non-controlling interest in such a business.\u201d <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>348 N.J.

Fisher opined that the estimated market value of the land and real estate improvements (but not offset by debt) was $2.5 million. The husband\u2019s real estate expert, Jerome C. Franklin, who valued the property as of June 30, 2008, and December 31, 2008, opined that the fair market value of the property as of the former date was $3 million and as of the latter date was $2.55 million. Indeed, Franklin testified that his December appraisal and the appraisal of Fisher at approximately the same time were \u201cpretty similar in the methods used.\u201d \u201cI came in at $2,550,000. He came in at $2,500,000.
