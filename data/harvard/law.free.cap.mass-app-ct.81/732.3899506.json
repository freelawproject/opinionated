We conclude that an assistant clerk-magistrate does.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-14\"><em>Facts. </em>Cumberland Farms, Inc. (Cumberland), filed an action in the small claims session of the District Court against Casella Waste Management, Inc. (Casella), after power lines attached to one of Cumberland\u2019s stores were struck and damaged by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>Casella truck three years earlier.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cumberland originally sought damages in the amount of $17,528.12.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Approximately eleven months later, Cumberland discovered additional damages and moved to amend its statement of small claim to add claims pursuant to G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 176D, and to seek damages in the amount of $58,328.12.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">The motion was denied by an assistant clerk-magistrate, who also denied Cumberland\u2019s motion for reconsideration and to transfer the case to the District Court civil trial session. Cumberland then sent a letter to the assistant clerk-magistrate challenging his authority to rule on the contested motions. The assistant clerk-magistrate disagreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">Cumberland petitioned the Superior Court for certiorari, pursuant to G. L. c. 249, \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Casella moved to dismiss, as did the Attorney General, who was acting on behalf of the District Court. A judge in the Superior Court allowed the motions to dismiss, ruling that the assistant clerk-magistrate acted within his authority, and that the complaint thus failed to establish any error of law on the record, a necessary element of certiorari relief.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">On appeal, Cumberland claims its complaint was wrongly dismissed because the assistant clerk-magistrate presiding over the small claims action did not have the authority to rule on contested motions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number><em>Authority of clerk-magistrate. </em>General Laws c. 221, \u00a7 <em>62C(b), </em>inserted by St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 250, provides that District Court clerk-magistrates have the power to \u201chear and rule on any uncontested non-evidentiary motion as may be allowed by rule of court.\u201d Similarly, in <em>Boat Maintenance &amp; Repair Co. </em>v. <em>Lawson, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 329, 332 (2000), this court held that \u201c[w]hile clerk-magistrates are authorized to hear and decide small claims . . . their authority to hear and rule on motions is limited by G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 <em>62C(b). </em>Motions upon which a clerk-magistrate may act must be (1) uncontested, (2) non-evidentiary, and (3) specifically allowed by rule of court.\u201d The opinion specifically noted that there was no District Court rule to the contrary. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Nine months prior to the decision in <em>Boat Maintenance &amp; Repair Co., supra, </em>the Supreme Judicial Court decided <em>Trust Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Bruce at Park Chiropractic Clinic, </em>430 Mass. 607 (2000). In <em>Trust Ins. Co., </em>a contested motion for attorney\u2019s fees in a small claims action was decided by a District Court judge. <em>Id. </em>at 608. In a footnote, the court noted that \u201c[t]he record is silent as to the reason a judge, and not the clerk-magistrate, conducted the hearing on attorney\u2019s fees. There is nothing in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34M, to suggest that a clerk-magistrate could not determine the question of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 608 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">In response to these cases the District Court in 2001 amended, pursuant to G. L. c. 218, \u00a7\u00a7 21-25, its Uniform Small Claims Rules (as further amended October 1, 2009).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Uniform Small <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>Claims Rule 7(f)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> was revised to provide that \u201c[a] small claim action shall generally be tried, and pretrial and post-judgment motions relating to such trials shall generally be determined, by a magistrate.\u201d The comment to the 2001 amendment states that \u201cmagistrates may determine contested motions in small claims actions.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As the District Court statutorily had the power and authority to rewrite the rule, it permissibly did so in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Our conclusion also furthers the legislative purpose of the statute creating the small claims sessions. See <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Municipal Ct. of the Roxbury Dist., </em>308 Mass. 397, 401 (1941) (statute intended to provide \u201c \u2018simple, prompt, and informal means, at small expense, for adjudication of\u2019 small claims\u201d). See also G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 21 (procedure is to be \u201csimple, informal and inexpensive\u201d). Requiring every contested pretrial or post-judgment motion to be referred by a clerk-magistrate to a judge runs contrary to the statute\u2019s rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Lastly, the Uniform Small Claims Rules, which are promulgated by the District Court, are \u201csubject to the approval of the supreme judicial court.\u201d G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 21. If a change in the rule is sought, the better route would be either to the Supreme Judicial Court or to the rules committee. See <em>Gerber </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 811, 812 (1973); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pugh, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 903, 904 (1974).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b779-8\">The accident occurred on November 27, 2006; suit was filed on November 5, 2009.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b779-9\">The small claims damage limitation did not apply as the claim relates to property damage caused by a vehicle.

Cumberland filed its certiorari action on January 18.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b779-11\">Certiorari relief requires four elements: \u201c(1) a judicial or quasi judicial proceeding (2) from which there is no other reasonably adequate remedy (3) to correct substantial error of law apparent on the record (4) that has resulted in manifest injustice to the plaintiff or an adverse impact on the real interests of the general public.\u201d <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>446 Mass. 698, 703-704 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b779-12\">Cumberland also claims that the motion judge wrongfully decided the underlying legal issue in response to a motion to dismiss. The judge acted correctly. See <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Woodward, </em>446 Mass, at 704 (\u201cWhether a complaint adequately alleges a claim for relief in the nature of certiorari may be tested by means of a motion to dismiss\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b780-7\">General Laws c. 218, \u00a7 21, as appearing in St. 1992, c. 379, \u00a7 135, provides that \u201c[t]he Chief Justice for the district court department shall make uniform rules with respect to the procedure applicable to all the courts within said department . . . .\u201d Section 22 of G. L. c. 218 states that \u201c[t]he procedure may include the modification of any or all rules of pleading and practice, anything contained in other chapters, sections or acts notwithstanding ....\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"A7X\">We read the authorization of G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 22, to override the negative inference of G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 62C(b). The latter section, as inserted by St. 1978, c. 478, \u00a7 250, provides, \u201cA magistrate . . . , in addition to his powers and duties as clerk, <em>may </em>...(b) hear and rule on any \u00ab\u00abcontested nonevidentiary motions as may be allowed by rule of court ...\u201d (emphasis added). However, G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 22, permits an override of limitations \u201ccontained in other chapters, sections or acts\u201d by proper District Court rule-making upon \u201cprocedure.\u201d The cited dicta of the Supreme Judicial Court and the statutory purpose of the small claims system reinforce this conclusion. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>also note that G. L. c. 218, \u00a7 21, was amended after the pertinent part of G. L. c. 221, \u00a7 <em>62C(b), </em>was written, thus indicating a more recent expression of the Legislature\u2019s intent. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen. (No. 1), </em>425 Mass. 210, 215-216 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b781-9\">At its inception, rule 7(f) initially appeared as rule 7(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b781-10\">The comment addressed the holding in <em>Boat Maintenance &amp; Repair Co., supra, </em>but pointed out that the opinion failed to acknowledge the earlier Supreme Judicial Court decision of <em>Trust Ins.
