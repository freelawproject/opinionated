L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(10), which (in certain circumstances) permits a workers\u2019 compensation insurer who makes prompt payment of benefits to an injured employee to reduce the amount payable by the amount it statutorily owes to the employee\u2019s attorney. Relying on this provision, AIM applied the reduction to the amount it owed to an injured employee under a settlement agreement. Because the settlement did not fall within the scope of the payment-reduction provision, we conclude that AIM was not entitled to the reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-14\"><em>Background. </em>On November 19, 2007, the parties appeared for a hearing before the Department of Industrial Accidents (DIA) with respect to the employee\u2019s claim for benefits for permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>loss of function under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 36. Instead of pursuing the hearing, however, the employee and AIM settled their differences and entered into a written settlement agreement that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">That agreement was reflected on DIA Form 113, captioned \u201cAgreement to Pay Compensation.\u201d The relevant portion of the form, as filled out by the parties, provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">\u201cTHE PARTIES AGREE TO COMPENSATION IN ACCORDANCE TO THE FOLLOWING SCHEDULE: . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">\u201cG. SPECIFIC PERMANENT INJURIES/SECTION 36. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">\u201cS36(G): S[tate] A[verage] W[eekly] W[age] (884.46) x 39 x .10 = $3,449.39 For right knee. Section 36 r[igh]t shoulder $1,500.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-9\">\u201c3 x S[tate] A[verage] W[eekly] W[age] (884.46) = $2,653.38 For limp.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-10\">\u201cTotal S36 benefit compensation = $7,602.77</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aiq\">\u201cH. Other (specify)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-11\">\u201cAttorney fee $2,500, and reasonable costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">The agreement was signed by the insurer, the employee, and the employee\u2019s attorney. The agreement was also approved and signed by a representative of the DIA, as required by statute. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 19(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">Both the amount of \u00a7 36 compensation to be paid to the employee under the settlement agreement as well as the amount to be paid to the attorney for fees and costs were negotiated figures; in other words, they were less than what the employee originally sought or could potentially recover under the statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(5) ($3,500 attorney\u2019s fee to be paid in cases resolved within five days of hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-14\">The settlement agreement makes no reference to the payment-reduction provision of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(10), nor does the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>agreement state or imply that the amounts due would be subject to that provision. We nonetheless pause here to set out the payment-reduction provision because it is necessary to understand what happened after the parties reached their settlement. General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 13A(10), as appearing in St. 1991, c. 398, \u00a7 35, provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">\u201cIn any instance in which an attorney\u2019s fee under subsection (1) to (6), inclusive, is due as a result of a cash award[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] being made to the employee either voluntarily, or pursuant to an order or decision, the insurer may reduce the amount payable to the employee within the first month from the date of the voluntary payment order or decision,[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] by the amount owed the claimant\u2019s attorney; provided, however, that the amount paid to the employee shall not be reduced to a sum less than seventy-eight percent of what the employee would have received within that month if no attorney\u2019s fee were payable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Relying on this payment reduction provision, AIM sent the employee a check for $5,930.16, rather than for the $7,602.77 specified under the settlement agreement. It arrived at this sum by applying a twenty-two percent reduction to the total \u00a7 36 compensation amount ($7,602.77). In other words, $7,602.77 - ($7,602.77 x .22 [i.e., $1,672.61]) = $5,930.16.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The employee sought relief from an administrative judge, who ordered AIM to reimburse the employee the deducted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>amount. The reviewing board of the DIA reversed, relying on two unpublished memoranda and orders of this court issued pursuant to our rule 1:28, see <em>Vazquez\u2019s Case, </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. 1112 (2010), and <em>Grogan\u2019s Case, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 1132 (2010). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>Section 13A of the workers\u2019 compensation statute, G. L. c. 152, governs the award of attorney\u2019s fees for injured employees. In broad and general terms, the section can be read to reflect two legislative goals: to ensure adequate legal representation of the injured worker or his dependents, and to discourage protracted litigation. See <em>Green\u2019s Case, </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 141, 144 (2001); Nason, Koziol, &amp; Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 24.1, at 266 (3d ed. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">One of the ways by which the statute seeks to accomplish these goals is to establish a graduated fee structure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\">\u201cThe fee structure is linked to the various stages through which a claim or complaint passes as it goes from conciliation to conference, hearing and review in the division of dispute resolution. When the claimant prevails or the insurer accepts a claim or withdraws a complaint, the insurer has to pay a set fee for each step, generally increasing as the case moves forward in the process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-8\"><em>Ibid. </em>See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(l)-(6). Thus, by way of example, if an insurer agrees to pay the claimed compensation prior to conference, it will pay only $700 in attorney\u2019s fees, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(1), whereas if it does not agree to pay until within five days of hearing, it will pay $3,500 in attorney\u2019s fees, <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 13A(5).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">In addition to rewarding insurers who agree to pay an employee\u2019s claim earlier in the process, rather than later, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>statute also creates an incentive for insurers who pay awards quickly. As set out above, \u00a7 13A(10) permits insurers in certain circumstances to reduce the amount awarded to compensate the employee for his or her injury by up to twenty-two percent if the insurer pays the award within one month. For ease, we repeat the operative language in the margin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">In order to qualify for the \u00a7 13A(10) reduction, the insurer must show that there is (a) an attorney\u2019s fee under \u00a7 13A(l)-(6); (b) due as a result of a cash award; (c) being made to the employee either voluntarily, or pursuant to an order or decision; and (d) which the insurer pays within one month. All four conditions must be met in order to qualify for the reduction. We need look no further than the first condition in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The \u00a7 13A(10) reduction applies only to attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 13A(l)-(6), each of which pertains to the fee to be awarded at different stages of the claim process. AIM contends that the $2,500 attorney\u2019s fee set by the settlement agreement falls within \u00a7 13A(5) because the settlement was reached within five days of the scheduled hearing. Timing, however, is only one of the components of \u00a7 13A(5). See <em>Richards\u2019s Case, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 701, 705-706 (2004) (section 13A[5] \u201cplainly and unambiguously\u201d provides for attorney\u2019s fees in two defined circumstances, \u201c \u2018[wjhenever an insurer [a] files a complaint <em>or </em>[b] contests a claim for benefits\u2019 . . . and the employee prevails against the complaint or contest\u201d). As the statute specifies,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">\u201cWhenever an insurer files a complaint or contests a claim for benefits and then either (i) accepts the employee\u2019s claim or withdraws its own complaint within five days of the date set for a hearing pursuant to section eleven; or (ii) the employee prevails at such hearing the insurer shall pay a fee to the employee\u2019s attorney in an amount equal to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>three thousand five hundred dollars plus necessary expenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">We are not here concerned with (ii) because no hearing ever occurred, let alone a hearing at which the employee prevailed. Nor are we concerned with that portion of (i) dealing with an insurer who withdraws its complaint; AIM never filed a complaint in this case. Moreover, AIM did not \u201caccept\u201d the employee\u2019s claim for benefits; the \u00a7 36 compensation amount agreed upon in the settlement was negotiated down from the amount of the employee\u2019s claim.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The settlement amounts were the product of compromise; AIM did not accept the employee\u2019s claim. We note further (and perhaps most fundamentally) that the settlement agreement reflects a negotiated attorney\u2019s fee rather than that set by \u00a7 13A(5) or any other of the subsections (l)-(6). In short, apart from the fact that the settlement was reached within five days of the scheduled hearing, the terms of, and circumstances surrounding, the settlement agreement do not satisfy any of the requirements of \u00a7 13A(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\"><em>Conclusion. </em>There is no dispute in this case that AIM made its reduced payment within thirty days of the order endorsing the settlement. Prompt payment alone, however, without satisfying the other requirements of the statute, is not enough to qualify for the \u00a7 13A(10) reduction. Because AIM did not establish that it met all the requirements of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 13A(10), it was not entitled to apply that section\u2019s reduction to the amount owed to the employee under the settlement agreement. The decision of the reviewing board is reversed, and the matter is remanded for entry of an award in favor of the employee\u2019s estate, including the unpaid amount of the settlement. Additionally, on remand the board shall reach and consider the pretermitted question whether the employee\u2019s estate is entitled to an award of attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 13A(5) for prevailing before the administrative judge on the settlement underpayment claim.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">The employee\u2019s estate has requested appellate attorney\u2019s fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>and costs and, in light of our disposition, is entitled to them pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12A. See <em>Daly\u2019s Case, </em>405 Mass. 33, 42 (1989). Within two weeks of the date of this opinion, the employee\u2019s estate is to submit to the clerk of this court an application for fees and costs that comports with <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>441 Mass. 9, 10-11 (2004). AIM shall file any response within two weeks thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b484-15\">The record does not clearly disclose the full amount of \u00a7 36 benefits originally sought by the employee, but the parties both acknowledged at oral argument that it was more than what he accepted in the settlement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b485-8\"><em>\u201cCash Award </em>as used in [G.

Regs. \u00a7 1.02 (2008). In light of our disposition of this appeal, we need not address, and express no opinion on, the questions whether the payment in this case was a \u201ccash award\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 13A(10) and whether the definition of \u201ccash award\u201d in this regulation is consistent with the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b485-9\"><em>\u201cAmount Payable to the Employee Within the First Month from the Date of the Voluntary Payment, Order or Decision </em>as used in [G.

Section 13A(10) specifies that the amounts in \u00a7 13A(l)-(6) are to be adjusted annually on October 1. Apparently the practice has been to publish these amounts by circular letter or other public means. See Nason, Koziol, &amp; Wall, Workers\u2019 Compensation \u00a7 24.1, at 267.
