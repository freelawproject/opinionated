The controlling statute, G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 27, obliges the mortgagee to pay any surplus, after satisfaction of the debt and the mortgagee\u2019s expenses, to \u201cthe mortgagor.\u201d We are confronted in these cross appeals, however, with an individual who executed a mortgage but had no interest in the property at the time of foreclosure sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-16\"><em>Background. </em>The pertinent facts are largely undisputed. The defendants, Mani George and Susan Mani, are husband and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>wife. They borrowed funds from United Bank (bank) to construct a residence in South Hadley; subsequently the loan was converted to a conventional first mortgage loan executed by both borrowers on October 5, 1999. It appears from the record that the property initially had been conveyed to both husband and wife as joint tenants several months before their mortgage loan application. However, it is undisputed that both the application and the bank\u2019s internal underwriting documents list the wife as sole title holder, which she became by quitclaim deed of the same date the first mortgage was executed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The husband signed the mortgage application as \u201cborrower\u201d and the wife did so in the capacity of \u201cco-borrower.\u201d The latter was the term used in the bank\u2019s underwriting documentation to designate the party \u201ctaking title\u201d to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">The husband, both before and after execution of the mortgage, borrowed additional funds from the bank in three separate transactions related to his commercial ventures, involving him alone. Documentation underlying these loans included standard pledges of the husband\u2019s after-acquired real and personal property as collateral, as well as the bank\u2019s \u201cright of offset against all monies .. . of [the husband] ... in the possession, custody, or control of the [b]ank.\u201d The wife did not guarantee these loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">The mortgage loan went into default; a judgment from the Land Court issued in due course in favor of the bank, pursuant to which a foreclosure sale was conducted in July, 2006.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the time of the foreclosure sale the husband was in default of his commercial loan obligations. In its prompt complaint for inter-pleader and declaratory judgment, the bank asserted a right to apply the surplus proceeds of the foreclosure sale to the outstanding balances of the husband\u2019s commercial loans. The defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>opposed such application and counterclaimed, asserting numerous legal and equitable claims against the bank.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In our consideration of the defendants\u2019 counterclaim in this appeal we are concerned chiefly with their assertion of violations of G. L. c. 93A.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">On cross motions for summary judgment, a judge of the Superior Court awarded half the surplus proceeds to the bank and the remaining half to the wife.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Notwithstanding the Solomonic attraction of this solution, we are brought to a different result for the reasons outlined below.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Surplus foreclosure proceeds. </em>Our inquiry begins with the plain language of G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 27:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">\u201cThe holder of a mortgage of real estate, or his representatives, out of the money arising from a sale under the power of sale shall be entitled to retain all sums then secured by the mortgage, whether then or thereafter payable, including all costs, charges or expenses incurred or sustained by him or them by reason of any default in the performance or observance of the condition of the mortgage or of any prior mortgage, <em>rendering the surplus, if any, to the mortgagor, </em>or his heirs, successors or assigns, unless otherwise stated in the mortgage . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>The bank argues that the statute requires it to pay any surplus to the mortgagor or mortgagors, that the husband \u2014 having executed the mortgage \u2014 is a mortgagor, that all the surplus proceeds are therefore \u201cmonies . . . of [the husband\u2019s]\u201d pledged as collateral for commercial loans and, finally, that because it is in \u201cpossession, custody, or control\u201d of these monies as a result of the foreclosure sale, it has a right of offset pursuant to the commercial loan agreements. Thus, on appeal, the bank claims error in the judge\u2019s award of half the proceeds to the wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The wife points to the anomalous result of sale proceeds paid to a person with no interest in the property that was sold. On ~ appeal she asserts error in the award of half the proceeds to the bank. Notwithstanding her close connection to a person with undisputed outstanding loan obligations to the bank, we are constrained to agree with the wife. The husband is not a mortgagor as that term is used in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The requirement that a mortgagor have an interest in the property that secures the loan is firmly rooted in the common law. \u201cThe substance of the contract of mortgage is, that if the debt is not paid, the mortgagee shall have the interest in the land, <em>which his mortgagor </em>had\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Palmer </em>v. <em>Fowley, </em>5 Gray 545, 547 (1856). \u201cA mortgage of real estate is a conveyance of the title or of some interest therein defeasible upon the payment of money or the performance of some other condition.\u201d <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>330 Mass. 261, 263 (1953). A mortgage is \u201c[a] conveyance of title to property that is given as security for the payment of a debt.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1101 (9th ed. 2009). There is no indication that the drafters of G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 27, intended to depart from the long-understood common meaning of the term \u201cmortgagor\u201d as one holding an equity of redemption and a right of possession of the property. See <em>J &amp; W Wall Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Shawmut First Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>413 Mass. 42, 44 n.3 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">In the case at bar, the record does not support a claim that the husband had any interest in the property at the time of the foreclosure sale. On October 5, 1999, the same day the construction loan mortgage was executed, the husband deeded his entire interest in the property to the wife. Even if we assume that the husband executed the mortgage before that quitclaim deed (see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>note 2, <em>supra) </em>and thus was, however briefly, a mortgagor of the property,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the deed divested him of his equity of redemption (and right of possession). See <em>Fales </em>v. <em>Glass, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 570, 574 (1980), citing <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Hayward, </em>12 Cush. 344, 348-349 (1853) (\u201cIt is settled that a debtor under an express mortgage can convey his equity of redemption by a quitclaim deed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">As such, the bank has not presented a genuine issue of material fact relating to its claim that the husband was a \u201cmortgagor\u201d entitled to the surplus under G. L. c. 183, \u00a7 27. As a matter of law on this record, the wife, as the individual owner with the equity of redemption, was the sole mortgagor and was entitled to the full amount of the undivided surplus.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Spaulding </em>v. <em>Quincy Trust Co., </em>313 Mass. 752, 753 (1943) (\u201cUpon the foreclosure, the surplus stood in the place of the equity of redemption, and belonged to the devisees of [the original mortgagor]\u201d). Accordingly, by collecting a surplus from the sale the bank is not in \u201cpossession, custody, or control\u201d of funds belonging to its debtor, the husband.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> His antecedent agreements to collateralize other obligations to the bank with after-acquired property are not binding on third parties, including the wife. The loan documents between the parties provide no basis to apply proceeds from the sale of the property to obligations other than the mortgage loan on the property itself. The bank was free to include language in the mortgage documents providing that the real property would collateralize all debts incurred by either defendant to the bank, but it did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">2. <em>G. L. c. 93A. </em>We affirm the summary judgment in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>the bank with respect to the defendants\u2019 claims based on G. L. c. 93A and, to the extent applicable, related claims of improper actions by the bank in the conduct of the foreclosure sale. As the judge properly noted, the record is entirely devoid of any basis for the myriad claims first recited, then largely abandoned (see note 5, <em>supra), </em>by these defendants.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\"><em>Conclusion. </em>The judgment is vacated insofar as it awards half the surplus foreclosure proceeds to the bank, and the judgment shall be modified to reflect the wife\u2019s entitlement to all the surplus foreclosure proceeds. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b122-7\">The summary judgment record supports a slight inference that the mortgage was executed before the husband deeded his interest in the property to the wife. Talcing the evidence in the light most favorable to the bank, we shall infer for decisional purposes that the mortgage was executed first. Had the deed been executed first, it would be indisputable that the husband was never a mortgagor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b122-8\">About one year later, the bank made a home equity loan solely to Susan Mani. The bank\u2019s use of foreclosure sale proceeds to satisfy the unpaid balance of this second mortgage loan is not at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b122-9\">The defendants\u2019 Land Court challenge to the foreclosure proceedings was ultimately unsuccessful. <em>Mani </em>v. <em>United Bank, </em>70 Mass. App. Ct. 1115 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"pAZ-\">The defendants asserted that the bank, inter alla, conducted the foreclosure illegally; violated the civil provisions of the Federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1961 et seq.; violated art. 10 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights; committed mail and wire fraud; breached a confidentiality agreement; interfered with contractual relations, breached a fiduciary duty; and, inevitably, violated G. L. c. 93A. The claims other than the c. 93A claims are waived. In her decision below, the judge noted as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-12\">\u201cBoth defendants made oral and written representations that they were no longer pursuing any of the counterclaims except for the counterclaim under G. L. c. 93A. Subsequently, the court ordered the defendants on July 29, 2008, to file either a stipulation of dismissal pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. R 41(a)[, 365 Mass. 803 (1974),] or a motion pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 41(b) seeking leave of court to dismiss. The defendants failed to comply with this order.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b123-13\">After the instant summary judgment disposition, the wife commenced a Superior Court action against the bank and others sounding primarily in fraud, based on the same facts. The trial judge dismissed the latter case on grounds of claim preclusion, and this court affirmed in an unpublished memorandum and order issued pursuant to Rule 1:28. <em>Mani </em>v. <em>United Bank, </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. 1127 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b125-7\">We note that despite the demise of traditional dower and curtesy in the Commonwealth, G. L. c. 189, \u00a7 1, it is not uncommon for lenders and real estate professionals to obtain the signature of a nonowner spouse to an agreement to transfer an interest in real property. See Eno &amp; Hovey, Real Estate Law \u00a7 6.4, at 197 (4th ed. 2004). However, in the present context, the husband\u2019s signature has neither equitable nor legal consequence, and reliance by the bank cannot survive cursory examination. Title searches and title insurance are among the most basic measures of due diligence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Likewise, and as the judge noted, the bank is not entitled to surplus payment as a \u201cmortgagor\u2019s] . . . successor!] or assignee]\u201d under the statute. The bank concedes that it does not have a lien on the property. Contrast <em>First Colonial Bank for Sav. </em>v. <em>Bergeron, </em>38 Mass. App. Ct. 136, 137-138 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b125-9\">There is no assertion by the bank of fraudulent conveyance or any other theory by which it might be entitled to reach the wife\u2019s property to satisfy the husband\u2019s debts, and the bank disavowed any such theory at oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b126-7\">We note specifically that, despite representations by the defendants at oral argument, the record does not support the claim that the bank misrepresented property tax liabilities prior to sale or paid excess tax obligation from the proceeds of the sale.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
