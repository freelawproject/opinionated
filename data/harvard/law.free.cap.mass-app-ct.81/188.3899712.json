Sandman\u2019s claims against Fragomeni, who is not a party to this appeal, remain pending.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b234-13\">Grasso, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApU\">The plaintiff, Elaine F. Sandman, appeals from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>entry of a separate and final judgment in favor of her insurer, Quincy Mutual Fire Insurance Company (Quincy Mutual), following the allowance of its motion to dismiss her amended complaint. The gravamen of Sandman\u2019s complaint alleged that Quincy Mutual was vicariously liable for the harm that she and her daughter sustained as a result of the misrepresentations and malpractice of Frank L. Fragomeni, an attorney who represented Quincy Mutual in a subrogation action against a heating oil delivery company that spilled oil at Sandman\u2019s property. Sandman claimed that Fragomeni told her that Quincy Mutual had hired him to pursue her personal claims as well,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but failed to do so; and by the time Sandman realized that Fragomeni\u2019s representations were not true, the statute of limitations had run on her claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Because Sandman\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim as to which relief could be granted against Quincy Mutual for the misrepresentations and actions of an attorney and independent contractor over which Quincy Mutual had no control in the exercise of his professional responsibilities, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">1. <em>Facts and procedural history. </em>In evaluating Quincy Mutual\u2019s motion to dismiss, we accept the factual allegations in the amended complaint as true, but not the legal conclusions cast in the form of factual allegations. See <em>Leavitt </em>v. <em>Brockton Hosp., Inc., </em>454 Mass. 37, 39 &amp; n.6 (2009). In March, 2004, during a heating oil delivery to Sandman\u2019s residence, a delivery line burst, causing her basement to flood with over 100 gallons of oil. Quincy Mutual agreed to cover the remediation cost of cleaning up the oil spill, which came to over $200,000, but denied coverage for damage to Sandman\u2019s personal property because of a policy exclusion for damage to personal property caused by pollution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Quincy Mutual hired Fragomeni<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to recover its remediation costs in a subrogation action against James Lamparelli, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>doing business as Supreme Fuel and Energy, the party that delivered the oil to Sandman\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Approximately two weeks after the oil spill, as Sandman was looking for an attorney to represent her in her individual claims against the oil delivery company, Fragomeni called Sandman and introduced himself as the attorney hired by Quincy Mutual to pursue her claims for negligence in the heating oil delivery. For the next five years, Fragomeni consistently led Sandman to believe that he represented her interests as well as those of Quincy Mutual and that he was seeking to recover her damages against Lamparelli. Most of those representations were oral, but in a May 5, 2005, letter to Sandman, Fragomeni referred to Sandman as a client and stated that \u201c[o]nce we receive the final figure suit will be entered in the Superior Court against parties responsible for damages to your property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">In 2007, Fragomeni filed suit against Lamparelli on behalf of Quincy Mutual seeking subrogation for its remediation costs. Fragomeni never informed Sandman that he had not filed suit on her behalf as well.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> To the contrary, Fragomeni continued to assure Sandman that he was attempting to collect her full damages. In the course of the subrogation action, Fragomeni assisted Sandman in finalizing and answering interrogatories and represented her at her deposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Quincy Mutual\u2019s subrogation claim against Lamparelli settled in the spring of 2009. When Sandman asked Fragomeni about her recovery, Fragomeni informed her, for the first time, that he was only representing Quincy Mutual, and that he could not assist her in pursuing her claims against Lamparelli because he had a conflict of interest as Quincy Mutual\u2019s attorney. By that time, Sandman\u2019s claims against Lamparelli were barred by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Sandman then filed an action in Superior Court against Fragomeni and Quincy Mutual, claiming misrepresentation, malpractice, negligent infliction of emotional distress, violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and violations of G. L. c. 93A. Quincy Mutual moved to dismiss the amended complaint under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 755 (1974), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted. In its motion to dismiss and supporting memorandum Quincy Mutual argued that the amended complaint failed to allege facts that could establish that Quincy Mutual was vicariously liable to Sandman for the malpractice and misrepresentations of Fragomeni, an independent contractor with nondelegable duties. See <em>Herbert A. Sullivan, Inc. </em>v. <em>Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>439 Mass. 387, 406-409 (2003) <em>(Sullivan). </em>Quincy Mutual argued as well that it could not be vicariously hable for Fragomeni\u2019s representations as to the existence and scope of any authority given to him by Quincy Mutual to act as Sandman\u2019s attorney in her personal claim for damages against Lamparelli.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The motion judge allowed Quincy Mutual\u2019s motion to dismiss \u201cfor reasons set forth on the record.\u201d Sandman\u2019s subsequent motion for reconsideration was denied, as was her motion to further amend the complaint. Separate and final judgment then entered on all claims against Quincy Mutual, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">2. <em>Discussion. </em>We evaluate the adequacy of the amended complaint in accordance with <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. 623, 636 (2008), which requires that the plaintiff set forth factual allegations \u201cplausibly suggesting\u201d an entitlement to relief. \u201cFactual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level . . . [based] on the assumption that all the allegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>Bell Atl. Corp. </em>v. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">As pertinent to the claims against Quincy Mutual, the key factual allegations of Sandman\u2019s complaint are the assertions that (1) Fragomeni told Sandman that he had been hired by Quincy Mutual to pursue her personal claims against Lamparelli; (2) he referred to, and dealt with, her as his client in oral and written communications over the ensuing five years; and (3) Sandman reasonably relied on those assertions. Accepting that Sandman\u2019s allegations suffice to make out a claim that Quincy Mutual hired Fragomeni to represent Sandman in her personal claims against Lamparelli for purposes of rule 12(b)(6) and <em>Iannacchino, supra, </em>a central problem remains with Sandman\u2019s contention that Quincy Mutual can be vicariously liable for the misrepresentations and actions of Fragomeni in failing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>to file an action on behalf of Sandman personally within the statute of limitations. The factual allegations of Sandman\u2019s amended complaint only state a claim that Fragomeni engaged in misrepresentations and legal malpractice while acting as an independent contractor and attorney for Sandman, not as an employee of Quincy Mutual or one subject to its direction and control.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">For present purposes, the allegations that Fragomeni told Sandman that Quincy Mutual \u201chired him\u201d to pursue her negligence claims against Lamparelli and that he would represent her individual interests, and that she relied on those representations, sets forth an attorney-client relationship with Sandman that both defines and limits the parties who are potentially liable to Sandman for misrepresentation and malpractice. See <em>DeVaux </em>v. <em>American Home Assur. Co., </em>387 Mass. 814, 818 (1983) (attorney-client relationship arises when person seeking legal advice or assistance from attorney relies reasonably to her detriment on attorney to provide same, and attorney, aware of such reliance, does nothing to negate it). As matter of law, Quincy Mutual cannot be vicariously liable for the representations and professional negligence of Fragomeni, because as an attorney and an independent professional he has a nondelegable duty of care to Sandman. See <em>Sullivan, </em>439 Mass, at 406 (as matter of law, attorney is independent contractor with separate and distinct obligations to the client, and therefore, any alleged negligence by attorney did not subject insurer who retained him to vicarious liability).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\"><em>Sullivan, supra </em>at 406-410, relied upon by Quincy Mutual in its motion to dismiss and supporting memorandum and by the judge in his initial allowance of the motion to dismiss,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is dis-positive of all of Sandman\u2019s vicarious liability claims against</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Quincy Mutual.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> There, the Supreme Judicial Court considered \u201cwhether an insurer who hires an attorney to defend its insured may be liable for any negligence by that attorney in the representation of the insured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 408. In concluding that the insurer could not be vicariously liable, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-5\">\u201c \u2018Since an insurer is not permitted to practice law, it must rely on independent counsel for conduct of litigation, and in doing so it does not assume a nondelegable duty to present an adequate defense. Since the conduct of the litigation is the responsibility of trial counsel, the insurer is not vicariously liable for the negligence of the attorneys who conduct the defense for the insured.\u2019 <em>1C </em>J.A. Appleman, Insurance Law and Practice \u00a7 4687, at 192-193 (rev. ed. 1979). Rule 5.4(c) of the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct, as appearing in 430 Mass. 1303 (1999), states: \u2018A lawyer shall not permit a person who recommends, employs, or pays the lawyer to render legal services for another to direct or regulate the lawyer\u2019s professional judgment in rendering such legal services.\u2019 As such, a lawyer hired by an insurer to represent an insured owes an unqualified duty of loyalty to the insured and must act at all times to protect the insured\u2019s interests. Cf. <em>McCourt Co. </em>v. <em>FPC Props., Inc., </em>386 Mass. 145, 146 (1982).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 408-409.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The various counts of Sandman\u2019s amended complaint all derive ultimately from the contention that Quincy Mutual is vicariously liable for Fragomeni\u2019s alleged misrepresentations and legal malpractice in asserting that he would pursue her personal claims against Lamparelli, not filing an action within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>the statute of limitations, and then claiming that he never represented her personal interests. Sandman\u2019s amended complaint does not allege that Fragomeni was Quincy Mutual\u2019s employee.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Further, nothing in the amended complaint alleges, even remotely, that Quincy Mutual retained any control over Fragomeni\u2019s performance of his professional duties in the representation of Sandman. See <em>Sullivan, supra </em>at 407 (\u201cGenerally speaking, the employer of an independent contractor is not liable for harm caused to another by the independent contractor\u2019s negligence, except where the employer retained some control over the manner in which the work was performed\u201d). The complaint contains no factual assertions that any employees, adjusters, or other representatives of Quincy Mutual represented to Sandman that Quincy Mutual would provide for her legal representation in the pursuit of her personal claim for damages.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nor does it assert that Quincy Mutual directed, commanded, or knowingly authorized the acts or omissions of Fragomeni. Compare <em>TrauMed of Am., Inc. </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>71 S.W.3d 691, 697 (Tenn. 2002) (insurer can be held vicariously liable for acts or omissions of attorney hired to represent insured when those acts or omissions were, at least in part, directed, commanded, or knowingly authorized by insurer). The amended complaint offers no allegations that Quincy Mutual was negligent in hiring Fragomeni to act as attorney on Sandman\u2019s behalf, or that Quincy Mutual knew or should have known that Fragomeni was not competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">In these circumstances, there is no basis upon which Quincy Mutual may be vicariously liable for Fragomeni\u2019s malpractice because it is Fragomeni who controlled the strategy, conduct, and daily details of representation of Sandman, and his ethical obligations to Sandman prevent the insurer from exercising the degree of control necessary to justify the imposition of vicarious liability. <em>Sullivan, supra </em>at 409. Accordingly, Sandman\u2019s recourse for Fragomeni\u2019s alleged misrepresentations and malpractice is her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>action against him, which remains pending, and not one in vicarious liability against Quincy Mutual.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Quincy Mutual had previously rejected Sandman\u2019s claim for damage to her personal property under the pollution exclusion clause of the governing homeowner\u2019s policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b235-10\">It is undisputed that Sandman was not entitled to personal property coverage because of the pollution exclusion in the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b235-11\">The allegations of the amended complaint assert that Fragomeni is an attorney with a usual place of business in Boston different from that of Quincy Mutual.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Quincy Mutual Fire Insurance Company vs. Lamparelli, Norfolk Superior Court, No. NOCV2007-00334.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b238-6\">Given Fragomeni\u2019s position as an attorney and independent contractor with nondelegable duties to his client Sandman, the motion judge need not have inquired further (as he did in denying Sandman\u2019s motion for reconsideration) whether Fragomeni had actual or apparent authority from Quincy Mutual to represent Sandman, or whether Fragomeni\u2019s assertions to Sandman were within the scope of his authority from Quincy Mutual. The existence of an attorney-independent contractor relationship between Fragomeni and Sandman renders such inquiries irrelevant upon a claim that Quincy Mutual is vicariously liable for Fragomeni\u2019s derelictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b239-8\">The dissent would distinguish <em>Sullivan </em>from the instant case because in <em>Sullivan, </em>\u201c[t]here was no dispute that the attorney represented only the insured, and not the insurer, and that the attorney\u2019s conduct of the litigation was undertaken solely on behalf of the insured.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 197. On the claims before us, the purported distinction is entirely without a difference.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Nothing in <em>Sullivan </em>suggests that dual representation of the insurer and the insured would alter the vicarious liability determination. Indeed, even were Sandman able to establish that Quincy Mutual hired Fragomeni to represent her personally and paid for that representation, Fragomeni was subject to a professional duty to attend to the interests of his client Sandman, and not to allow Quincy Mutual\u2019s underwriting of those expenses to infringe on his duty of competent representation.

Neither the fact that one of \u201cdozens\u201d of letters from her to Fragomeni was found in Quincy Mutual's subrogation file or that Quincy\u2019s subrogation action made reference to Sandman\u2019s individual losses amounts to a factually based assertion that Fragomeni was anything other than an independent contractor in his dealings with both Quincy Mutual and Sandman.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b241-6\">Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIL\">(dissenting). I think the plaintiff prevails under a proper analysis of this matter as framed \u2014 a motion to dismiss a complaint under Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 755 (1974). Unlike the motion judge, I limit my review to the facts alleged in the amended complaint. See, e.g., <em>Romano </em>v. <em>Sacknoff, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 862, 863 (1976). Arguably, there may be material available to the defendant that could support a motion pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 56, 365 Mass. 824 (1978). Any such materials, however, were not before the judge here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The majority focuses primarily on the relationship between Frank L. Fragomeni and Elaine F. Sandman, but in my view, the significance of this action lies in the fact that Fragomeni was the attorney for Quincy Mutual Fire Insurance Company (Quincy Mutual) and, therefore, presumably acted at Quincy Mutual\u2019s behest. It is impossible for me to imagine a scenario where Quincy Mutual had absolutely no knowledge of (or input into) what Fragomeni was doing in the litigation, given that he was conducting and defending against discovery, among other things, including getting Sandman\u2019s cooperation and involvement.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Sandman\u2019s amended complaint alleged that Fragomeni told her he had been hired by Quincy Mutual to pursue her claims for negligence against the oil delivery company, and also alleged that Fragomeni was Quincy Mutual\u2019s attorney in its sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>rogation action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under well-established principles of agency, as applied to the attorney-client relationship between Fragomeni and Quincy Mutual, I view those allegations as plausibly suggesting that Sandman is entitled to relief against Quincy Mutual based on actual authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u201cWhere there is actual authority to transact the very business or to do the very act that causes the harm, the agent acts as the extension of the will of his principal . . . .\u201d <em>Kansallis Fin. Ltd. </em>v. <em>Fern, </em>421 Mass. 659, 665 (1996). Actual authority \u201cis the agent\u2019s power to affect the principal\u2019s relations with third parties as manifested to the agent by the principal.\u201d <em>Theos &amp; Sons, Inc. </em>v. <em>Mack Trucks, Inc., </em>431 Mass. 736, 743-744 (2000), citing Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 7 (1958).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Taking the factual allegations in Sandman\u2019s amended complaint as true, Fragomeni\u2019s statement to Sandman that he had been hired by Quincy Mutual to pursue her negligence claims against Lamparelli was sufficient to make out a claim that he been given actual authority by Quincy Mutual to do just that. Sandman\u2019s claim is not defeated by the conflicting loyalties that such an arrangement would pose for an attorney in Fragomeni\u2019s position, as at the pleading stage, we assume the truth of the allegations, however doubtful. See <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. 623, 636 (2008). See also <em>Jessie </em>v. <em>Boynton, </em>372 Mass. 293, 302-303 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Furthermore, the factual allegation that Fragomeni was Quincy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Mutual\u2019s attorney while dealing with Sandman bolstered Sandman\u2019s claim that Quincy Mutual is liable for Fragomeni\u2019s statements to her. \u201cWhile in a broad sense counsel may be an agent and his client a principal, there is much more involved than mere agency.\u201d <em>Burt </em>v. <em>Gahan, </em>351 Mass. 340, 342 (1966). It has long been held that \u201cthe acts of the attorney in the conduct of litigation are binding upon the client.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See <em>Silva </em>v. <em>Pereira, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 368, 371 (1973); <em>Lechoslaw </em>v. <em>Bank of America, N.A., </em>618 F.3d 49, 57 (1st Cir. 2010). That is because the attorney\u2019s words and conduct, if occurring within the scope of the attorney\u2019s employment, are presumed to be done on the client\u2019s instructions, \u201cdiffering only in weight, but not in competency, from [the client\u2019s] personal words and acts.\u201d <em>James </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry., </em>201 Mass. 263, 266 (1909) (attorney\u2019s letter concerning client\u2019s physical condition before accident for which she sought damages was binding on client). See, e.g., <em>McMahon </em>v. <em>Lynn &amp; Boston R.R., </em>191 Mass. 295, 298-299 (1906); <em>Household Fuel Corp. </em>v. <em>Hamacher, </em>331 Mass. 653, 656-657 (1954) (attorney\u2019s stipulation to undisputed facts was binding on clients); <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Hendrickson, </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 579, 582 (1996) (contents of attorney\u2019s letter to plaintiff\u2019s insurance company was binding on plaintiff in subsequent litigation). Compare <em>Silva </em>v. <em>Pereira, supra </em>(general rule that counsel\u2019s statements are binding on client did not apply to attorney\u2019s opening statement regarding expected proof at trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The case of <em>Herbert A. Sullivan, Inc. </em>v. <em>Utica Mut. Ins. Co., </em>439 Mass. 387, 409 (2003), does not hold otherwise. There, the insurer hired an attorney to represent the insured, pursuant to the insurer\u2019s duty to defend under the policy. There was no dispute that the attorney represented only the insured, and not the insurer, and that the attorney\u2019s conduct of the litigation was undertaken solely on behalf of the insured. \u201cIn these circumstances, the insurer cannot be vicariously liable for the lawyer\u2019s negligence.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">Because the negligent attorney in <em>Herbert A. Sullivan, Inc., supra, </em>did not represent the insurer, the holding does not implicate the line of cases, cited above, that render an attorney\u2019s words and conduct binding on the attorney\u2019s client in certain circumstances. The Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s limiting language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>in <em>Herbert A. Sullivan, Inc., supra, </em>does not preclude the imposition of liability on Quincy Mutual for the harm caused to the insured by Quincy Mutual\u2019s own attorney, while pursuing litigation on Quincy Mutual\u2019s behalf. See, e.g., <em>James </em>v. <em>Boston Elev. Ry., supra </em>(\u201cThe attorney was her agent and representative, acting in her business\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The interplay between agency principles and the presumption that an attorney\u2019s words and conduct are undertaken on the client\u2019s instruction \u2014 here, Quincy Mutual \u2014 deserves consideration on a more complete record than rule 12(b)(6) permits. As to whether Quincy Mutual should be liable for its own attorney\u2019s conduct in these circumstances, I think it preferable that Sandman be permitted \u201cto develop the facts so that the novel theory may be explored and assayed in light of the actual facts rather than a pleader\u2019s suppositions.\u201d <em>Ritchie </em>v. <em>Department of State Police, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 655, 663 n.14 (2004). See, e.g., <em>Kirkland Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>James, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 559, 562-564 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">My conclusion that dismissal was premature is borne out by Sandman\u2019s subsequent motion to amend her complaint. Sandman\u2019s proposed amendment added allegations that Quincy Mutual\u2019s complaint against James Lamparelli included a claim for Sandman\u2019s uninsured damages, specifically identifying Sandman\u2019s losses for damaged contents, loss of use, and depreciation in value. Sandman also alleged that a letter she wrote to Fragomeni, in which she detailed her losses and sought assistance in their recovery, was found in Quincy Mutual\u2019s subrogation file, suggesting that Quincy Mutual knew that Sandman thought Quincy Mutual was involved in the pursuit of her uninsured claims. In addition to lending further support to Sandman\u2019s claim that Fragomeni had actual authority to pursue Sandman\u2019s uninsured damages, these allegations also supported the reasonable inference that Quincy Mutual authorized Fragomeni to do so in order to improve Quincy Mutual\u2019s settlement prospects with Lamparelli on its subrogation claim. See, e.g., <em>Curtis </em>v. <em>Herb Chambers 1-95, Inc., </em>458 Mass. 674, 676 (2011) (every reasonable inference is drawn in the plaintiff\u2019s favor on a motion to dismiss). Given the additional evidence cited by the parties in support of their respective positions, the issues are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>more appropriate for resolution on a motion for summary judgment. See <em>Romano </em>v. <em>Sacknoff, </em>4 Mass. App. Ct. at 863 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">I would reverse the judgment dismissing Sandman\u2019s amended complaint and remand the case to Superior Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-10\">or a succinct discussion regarding the pitfalls associated with rule 12(b)(6), see <em>Kirkland Constr.

App. Ct. 559, 564-565 (1995) (Brown, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b242-7\">In denying Sandman\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the judge reasoned, among other things, that Fragomeni did not have actual or apparent authority from Quincy Mutual to represent to Sandman that he would pursue her claims, and that there was no evidence that Fragomeni\u2019s representations to Sandman were made within the scope of his authority from Quincy Mutual. The judge relied on <em>Rossi </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Everett, </em>354 Mass. 461 (1968), a case decided on agreed facts that established that a city solicitor who was engaged to represent the school committee at a hearing before the Civil Service Commission lacked actual authority to bind the school committee to a settlement of an employee\u2019s claim. Unlike <em>Rossi </em>v. <em>School Comm, of Everett, supra, </em>there was no requirement that Sandman provide evidence of the scope of Fragomeni\u2019s authority beyond her factual allegations that Fragomeni told her he had such authority and that he was Quincy Mutual\u2019s attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b242-8\">By contrast, apparent authority is confirmed by the conduct of the principal that causes a third party reasonably to believe that a particular person has authority to act on the principal\u2019s behalf. <em>Hudson </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Property Ins. Underwriting Assn., </em>386 Mass. 450, 457 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
