McDonough, </em>Assistant District Attorney, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b276-5\">Grainger, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AZX\">The defendant was convicted by a Superior Court jury of two counts of rape of a child with force, one count of the lesser included offense of rape of a child, and one count of indecent assault and battery on a child under the age of fourteen. He contends on appeal that the admission of certain testimony violated the \u201cfirst complaint\u201d doctrine, and that his conviction should be reversed because of the judge\u2019s failure to exclude a juror for cause. The defendant also claims error in the admission of a photograph in evidence as well as certain statements made by the prosecutor during summation. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\"><em>Background. </em>The evidence presented to the jury included the following. The defendant sexually abused a thirteen year old girl, whom we shall call Tina,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> at a time when her sister was the defendant\u2019s girlfriend. In a brief conversation approximately one week later, Tina told a friend that the defendant had caused her to perform oral sex on him. The friend testified as the first complaint witness. A few days after this conversation, Tina and the friend confronted the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To this the defendant replied, \u201cIt can\u2019t leave this house, like nobody else can find out about this. ... I understand that you had to tell [the friend], . . . but nobody else can find out about this.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The defendant also acknowledged his guilt on two other occasions. First, Tina, her father, and her mother confronted the defendant about four years after the event, and each parent testified at trial that the defendant admitted to them on that occasion that he had been \u201cinappropriate\u201d with their daughter and that he apologized to her. The defendant\u2019s girlfriend also testified that the defendant told her that \u201che had really made a mistake,\u201d that Tina had put her hand on his crotch and down his pants, and that she had kissed him first. The defendant\u2019s girlfriend testified further that the defendant asked her whether she would visit him and write to him if he went to jail.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We reserve further details for our discussion of specific issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number><em>First complaint. </em>The defendant does not dispute the admission of the first complaint made to the friend approximately one week after the assault. Rather, he argues that the judge\u2019s allowance of testimony regarding the repetition of those allegations, in several other instances, was violative of the first complaint doctrine. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass. 217, 241-248 (2005), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1216 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">During trial, the prosecutor presented testimony from Tina as well as several other witnesses who testified to multiple conversations about the rape.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Testimony regarding conversations additional to the first complaint, even without the details of the complaint, will be inadmissible when it is \u201cessentially the same as permitting those other witnesses to testify\u201d and therefore admitting \u201cfresh complaint testimony through the back door.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuckich, </em>450 Mass. 449, 457 (2008). See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 413 (2011). However, the first complaint doctrine does not \u201cprohibit the admissibility of evidence that, while barred by that doctrine, is otherwise independently admissible,\u201d so long as the judge carefully balances \u201cthe testimony\u2019s probative . . . value\u201d and its prejudicial effect. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Arana, </em>453 Mass. 214, 220-221, 229 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">In the instant case, the defendant made multiple inculpatory statements in the presence of the friend, Tina\u2019s parents, and his own girlfriend. These conversations<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> therefore were admissible for an independent purpose. <em>Ibid. </em>The Commonwealth argues that the evidence of Tina\u2019s additional conversations with her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>family prior to their various confrontations with the defendant also were admissible in these circumstances to lay the foundation for the defendant\u2019s incriminating statements \u2014 and not simply a repetition of the complaint used to reinforce Tina\u2019s credibility. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kebreau, </em>454 Mass. 287, 300 (2009) (no error where \u201ctestimony was not offered as first complaint testimony, but rather to provide context for the defendant\u2019s admissions\u201d). We are, however, unwilling to approve what this record shows to be an excessive number of conversations<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> providing \u201ccontext,\u201d none of which were necessary to explain the obvious reason why the family and the friend engaged in an accusatory conversation with the defendant, or to address any other relevant issue. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Aviles, </em>461 Mass. 60 (2011), the Supreme Judicial Court considered similar claims of \u201ccontext\u201d and noted that \u201cthe additional portions of the statement must be . . . part of the same conversation . . . and . . . necessary to the understanding of the admitted statement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eugene, </em>438 Mass. 343, 350-351 (2003). A person who confronts a suspect with allegations of misconduct obviously has been told about them previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">The admission in evidence of these additional conversations violated the first complaint doctrine. However, in view of the overwhelming evidence presented by the Commonwealth, including multiple admissions of wrongdoing by the defendant, we conclude that the error created no prejudice.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>-<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As set forth <em>supra, </em>the defendant admitted his wrongdoing on at least four different occasions to an audience consisting variably of Tina, her friend, her father, her mother, and his own girlfriend.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The admission of testimony by Tina that she spoke to someone in the district attorney\u2019s office and to a detective benefits from no claim of context and was also error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number><em>Stuckich, </em>450 Mass, at 457 (2008) (\u201cThe fact that the Commonwealth brought its resources to bear on this incident creates the imprimatur of official belief in the complainant. It is unnecessary and irrelevant to the issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt, and is extremely prejudicial\u201d). Again, we refer to the strength of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence as a whole and note as well that the reference to the two conversations during the prosecutor\u2019s closing was fleeting. Accordingly, the defendant was not prejudiced, as the evidence had \u201cbut very slight effect,\u201d if any. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Peruzzi, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 445 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\"><em>Admission of photograph. </em>At trial, the prosecution introduced a photograph of Tina from the time when the rape occurred, several years before the trial, to which the defendant objected as appealing to the jury\u2019s emotions. This was not error, as demonstrative evidence of Tina\u2019s relative size and immaturity, such as the photograph at issue, was relevant to the element of constructive force, a contested issue in the case, and was not unduly prejudicial. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Armstrong, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 245, 255 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\"><em>Closing argument. </em>The defendant argues on appeal that the prosecutor\u2019s closing improperly referred to Tina\u2019s multiple complaints to bolster her credibility. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel did not object or request a curative instruction. \u201cAlthough not dispositive of the issue, the absence of any such request from experienced counsel is some indication that the tone, manner, and substance of the now challenged aspects of the prosecutor\u2019s argument were not unfairly prejudicial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toro, </em>395 Mass. 354, 360 (1985). We note as well that the references were brief, that they were made largely to refute the defense that Tina fabricated the assault, and that the prosecutor\u2019s closing emphasized the defendant\u2019s multiple admissions. Furthermore, the judge instructed the jury that the closings were not evidence. As noted, <em>supra, </em>the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt was strong and pervasive. Even if error, there was no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\"><em>Jury selection. </em>Finally, the defendant alleges error because the judge did not excuse a juror who disclosed that his son had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>been sexually assaulted twenty years earlier.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In the arena of jury selection, judges are afforded \u201ca large degree of discretion.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vann Long, </em>419 Mass. 798, 803 (1995). In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seabrooks, </em>433 Mass. 439, 443 (2001), the judge did not excuse a juror who had stated that she had an \u201cinitial emotional response\u201d and felt \u201cdifferently about a child being harmed.\u201d The court upheld the decision because the \u201cjudge explored the grounds for any possible claim that [the] juror [could not] be impartial, and . . . determined that [the] juror [stood] indifferent.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Similarly, here, the judge observed the juror\u2019s demeanor and asked the juror if, given his history, he could be impartial. To this, the juror responded that he could be fair and that he would not automatically side with either party. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b276-8\"><em>A </em>pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b276-9\">At trial the friend also confirmed this conversation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b276-10\">In a separate incident, after Tina\u2019s brother confronted him at his apartment, the defendant told his girlfriend that Tina \u201cused to throw herself at him.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b277-7\">In addition to the first complaint testimony involving Tina and the friend, the following conversations were part of the evidence presented to the jury: (1) Tina testified about a conversation in which she discussed the assault with the defendant when the friend was present; (2) Tina testified to a conversation with her sister and brother; (3) Tina testified to a conversation with her mother, father, sister, and brother; (4) Tina testified that immediately after the conversation with her family, she and her parents confronted the defendant about the rape; (5) Tina testified to a preliminary conversation when she first arrived at the police station; and (6) she testified that she was interviewed by a detective.
