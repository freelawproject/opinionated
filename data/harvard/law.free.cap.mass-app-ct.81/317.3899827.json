L. c. 32 \u00a7 10(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number><em>Facts. </em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Megiel-Rollo was a teacher at Bristol County Agricultural High School (Bristol) between 1982 and 2002.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In 1994, she filed a complaint against Bristol with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD) alleging discrimination. In 1997, the MCAD made a finding of probable cause on her claim. Four years later, in October 2001, Bristol and Megiel-Rollo entered into negotiations for a possible settlement to resolve the MCAD claim. Prior to entering settlement negotiations, Megiel-Rollo had never been notified or advised of any possibility or consideration of Bristol terminating her employment, and she had recently received a satisfactory performance evaluation for the 2000-2001 school year.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Early in October, 2001, Megiel-Rollo and Bristol entered into a settlement agreement intended to resolve her discrimination complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The parties agreed that immediately upon execution of the settlement agreement Megiel-Rollo would be placed on a paid leave of absence until June 30, 2002, a period of eight months. During the leave of absence she would continue to receive health insurance benefits, contractually accrued sick leave benefits, and retirement credits.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The settlement agreement provided that Bristol would forward a letter of termination notice to Megiel-Rollo on or about June 30, 2002, effective within five days of its mailing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, Bristol agreed to pay Megiel-Rollo a final cash payment of $54,760.49. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>settlement agreement required that upon its execution Megiel-Rollo would immediately leave the building and grounds of Bristol and never again enter the grounds or building.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">Megiel-Rollo was allowed twenty-one days to consider the settlement agreement and an additional seven days after execution within which to revoke it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The agreement contained a provision that both parties acknowledged that they were entering into the agreement voluntarily. Both parties signed and executed the settlement agreement on October 10, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Megiel-Rollo applied for a termination allowance under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10(2), shortly thereafter. The TRS sent Bristol a letter requesting information about the reason for Megiel-Rollo\u2019s departure and whether she had been terminated. Bristol responded that Megiel-Rollo had been terminated in order to \u201cresolve litigation.\u201d The TRS then denied Megiel-Rollo\u2019s application for a termination allowance under \u00a7 10(2), and she was instead awarded superannuation benefits under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Megiel-Rollo appealed the denial to CRAB, which assigned a Division of Administrative Law Appeals (DALA) magistrate to hold a hearing, after which the denial of \u00a7 10(2) benefits was affirmed. Megiel-Rollo filed an objection with CRAB, which in 2009 affirmed the decision of the DALA magistrate on the basis that Megiel-Rollo\u2019s departure was voluntary. Megiel-Rollo sought judicial review of CRAB\u2019s decision in the Superior Court. A Superior Court judge vacated CRAB\u2019s decision, anchoring his own definition of \u201cdischarge\u201d not on the distinction between \u201cvoluntary\u201d and \u201cinvoluntary\u201d but on what the court referred to as \u201csome action on the part of the employer to terminate the employee[\u2019]s employment.\u201d The judge held that Bristol \u201cterminated Megiel-Rollo\u2019s employment ... by sending her a notice of termination\u201d and that \u201c[s]he was therefore \u2018discharged\u2019 from her employment within the meaning of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10(2).\u201d Judgment was entered in favor of Megiel-Rollo, CRAB\u2019s decision was vacated, and the case was remanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>to CRAB for the entry of an order in favor of Megiel-Rollo. The TRS then filed this appeal seeking reversal of the Superior Court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">We vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and affirm the decision of the Contributory Retirement Appeals Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>We review CRAB\u2019s decision to deny \u00a7 10(2) benefits and award \u00a7 10(1) benefits to determine whether Megiel-Rollo\u2019s rights have been prejudiced under the guidance of G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14(7).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Tabroff </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>69 Mass.

See <em>Bristol County Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., </em>65 Mass. App. Ct. 443, 451 (2006); <em>Olsen </em>v. <em>Teachers\u2019 Retirement Bd., </em>70 Mass.

Bay, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rate Setting Commn., </em>401 Mass. 357, 369 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 10, determines retirement allowances for members of the retirement system who resigned, failed reappointment, or were removed or discharged from service. We consider the textual differences between \u00a7 10(1) (right to a superannuation retirement allowance) and \u00a7 10(2) (right to a termination retirement allowance) in order to determine which paragraph, \u00a7 10(1) or \u00a7 10(2), is implicated by the facts and circumstances here.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Section 10(1), as amended through St. 2000, c. 123, \u00a7 24A, provides, in pertinent part, a retirement allowance for a member of the retirement system who (1) has completed twenty or more years of creditable service and who (2) \u201cresigns or voluntarily terminates his service\u201d or who (3) \u201cfails of reappointment or whose office or position is abolished, or is removed or discharged from his office or position without moral turpitude on his part. . . .<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Section 10(2) provides, in pertinent part, a retirement allowance for a member of the retirement system who (1) \u201chas completed twenty or more years of creditable service\u201d and who (2) \u201cfails of reappointment, or whose office or position is abolished, or is removed or discharged from his office or position without moral turpitude on his part. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">As pertaining here, the single difference between the provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>sions of \u00a7 10(1) and \u00a7 10(2) indicates that a member who has twenty or more years of creditable service and who \u201cresigns or voluntarily terminates his service\u201d can <em>only </em>retire under the provisions of \u00a7 10(1). The remaining qualifications that a member \u201cfails of nomination or re-election, or fails of reappointment, or whose office or position is abolished, or is removed or discharged from his office or position\u201d appear in both \u00a7 10(1) and \u00a7 10(2). This statutory construction indicates that a member, so retiring, can chose to retire under the provisions of <em>either </em>\u00a7 10(1) or \u00a7 10(2), presumably depending on which retirement allowance calculation is more beneficial to their particular circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">CRAB interprets the terms \u201cremoved or discharged\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 10(1) and \u00a7 10(2) eligibility as the <em>involuntary </em>discharge of an employee as distinct from a voluntary termination or resignation of an employee, who, as we discussed above, can only retire under the provisions of \u00a7 10(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The Superior Court judge determined, and Megiel-Rollo now argues, that the basis for eligibility for benefits under \u00a7 10(2) is the presence of \u201csome action on the part of the employer to terminate the employee\u2019s employment,\u201d <em>not </em>whether the termination was involuntary. The trial judge reasoned that because Bristol sent a letter of termination, it discharged Megiel-Rollo for the purposes of \u00a7 10(2) regardless of the section\u2019s larger context and the specific language contained in \u00a7 10(1). We do not agree with this reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">First, this interpretation would render the phrase \u201cvoluntary termination\u201d in \u00a7 10(1) meaningless. In every case a termination will ultimately be effectuated by an action of the employer in the form of a notice of termination and would automatically render the termination \u201cinvoluntary.\u201d The phrase \u201cvoluntary termination\u201d would have no meaning within the statute under that reasoning. We cannot read statutory language to be meaningless or superfluous, particularly where the phrase in question has a clear meaning within the statute\u2019s context. See <em>Wolfe </em>v. <em>Gormally, </em>440 Mass. 699, 704 (2004), quoting from <em>Bankers Life &amp; Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., 427 </em>Mass. 136, 140 (1998) (\u201cbasic tenet of statutory construction requires that a statute \u2018be construed ... so that no part will be inoperative or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>superfluous\u2019 \u201d); <em>Bulger </em>v. <em>Contributory Retirement Appeal Bd., supra </em>at 661, quoting from <em>Commissioner of Rev. </em>v. <em>Cargill, Inc., </em>429 Mass. 79, 82 (1999) (\u201cWhere ... the language of the statute is clear, it is the function of the judiciary to apply it, not amend it\u201d). See also <em>Telesetsky </em>v. <em>Wight, </em>395 Mass. 868, 872 (1985); <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>397 Mass. 837, 839 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">A review of the legislative history of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10, is consistent with this interpretation. When it was enacted in 1945, G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10, allowed employees who resigned a superannuation allowance under \u00a7 10(1), but not a termination allowance under \u00a7 10(2). St. 1945, c. 658, \u00a7 1. The phrase \u201cvoluntary termination\u201d appeared in neither section. In 1950, the Legislature added employees who resigned to those eligible for \u00a7 10(2) benefits but removed that eligibility one year later. St. 1951, c. 784, \u00a7 1. At the same time, the Legislature added the \u201cvoluntary termination\u201d provision to \u00a7 10(1). The Legislature clearly and intentionally added the phrase \u201cvoluntary termination\u201d as a concept related to, but distinguished from, the phrase \u201cresignation.\u201d Cf. <em>Costello </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Chelsea, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 822, 827 (1989) (legislative history of the addition and subtraction of certain terms to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10, \u201cevinces an awareness that there is a difference between a \u2018removal or discharge\u2019 and \u2018failure of reappointment\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">In a similar context, the Supreme Judicial Court has addressed the \u201cvoluntariness\u201d of a resignation in situations implicating the unemployment compensation statute, which, with some exceptions, denies benefits to employees who leave their job voluntarily. See G. L. c. 151A, \u00a7 25(e). See, e.g., <em>Retirement Bd. of Attleboro </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Attleboro, </em>417 Mass. 24, 26 (1994) (considering the meaning of the word \u201cremoval\u201d in G. L. c. 71, \u00a7 43B [1992 ed.], in interpreting the term \u201cremoval\u201d in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 16[2]).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">In <em>Connolly </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Unemployment Assistance, </em>460 Mass. 24, 25 (2011), citing <em>White </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>382 Mass. 596, 598-599 (1981), the Supreme Judicial Court held that \u201ca resignation . . . will be deemed involuntary if the employee reasonably believed that his discharge was imminent.\u201d See <em>State St. Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number><em>Deputy Director of the Div. of Employment &amp; Training, </em>66 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 7-8 (2006). In <em>Connolly, </em>the plaintiff seeking benefits was held to have left voluntarily when \u201cshe was not compelled to apply [for a voluntary termination package], did not believe her job was in jeopardy, and left in part for personal reasons.\u201d <em>Connolly, supra </em>at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">In the case before us, the evidence substantially supported CRAB\u2019s conclusion that Megiel-Rollo could not have reasonably believed that her employment would soon be terminated if she did not sign the settlement agreement. She testified that she had not been told by anyone at Bristol that she was in danger of being terminated from her position, and her evaluation for the school year preceding the settlement negotiations was \u201clargely positive.\u201d Further, a provision of the settlement agreement stated that Bristol \u201cwishe[d] to enter this agreement solely for the purpose of avoiding costs of litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Additionally, we must acknowledge the benefit of the bargain Megiel-Rollo received in the negotiation. While Bristol disposed of the discrimination suit, she received nine months\u2019 paid leave of absence while continuing to receive health insurance benefits and accrue sick time, as well as continuing to accrue retirement credits. At the end of this paid leave, she received a substantial cash award and a letter of termination, which was intended to qualify her for the retirement allowance provided by \u00a7 10(2). The provisions of this agreement do not evidence an \u201cinvoluntary termination.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">There are additional public policy reasons to discourage the grant of a \u00a7 10(2) retirement allowance for terminations negotiated in the context of such a settlement agreement. In future settlement negotiations, or similar situations that arise between employees and their public employers, there is a danger that the parties would add a term to the settlement providing a termination letter, even where the employee had no reasonable expectation of being fired and where termination would not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>otherwise occurred. For the employee, the benefit of such a letter may result in receiving higher retirement benefits than the employee may otherwise have received, and such a letter could be a valuable bargaining chip of no detriment to the employer\u2019s financial bottom line. As the Contributory Retirement Fund in Massachusetts is made up solely of contributions from its members, those members would incur the cost of the higher termination allowance brought about by such a settlement. See, e.g., <em>Hoerner </em>v. <em>Public Sch. Employees\u2019 Retirement Bd., </em>546 Pa. 215, 225 (1996) (holding that the Pennsylvania retirement board, not the language of employee\u2019s negotiated termination agreement, had the power to determine benefits due under that State\u2019s retirement code).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">We conclude that CRAB\u2019s determination, that to qualify for a termination allowance under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10(2), the termination must be involuntary, was not an error of law. Also, there was substantial and sufficient evidence on the record supporting CRAB\u2019s finding that Megiel-Rollo was not \u201cremoved or discharged\u201d under \u00a7 10(2) but rather was \u201cvoluntarily terminated\u201d under \u00a7 10(1), and that, as the DALA magistrate found, by voluntarily signing the settlement agreement Megiel-Rollo \u201cherself chose to leave her position at (Bristol).\u201d We therefore vacate the judgment of the Superior Court and remand for the entry of judgment affirming CRAB\u2019s decision to award the plaintiff a superannuation allowance under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 10(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b364-6\">We take our facts from those found by the Division of Administrative Law Appeals (DALA) and adopted by CRAB. Megiel-Rollo does not dispute any of the facts as found by DALA, although she requested that CRAB add an additional finding that Bristol Agricultural High School insisted that she be terminated as a condition to its agreeing to settle her discrimination complaint. CRAB apparently declined to add the finding and concluded that it would not affect the result in any event.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b364-7\">She became a member of TRS in 1978, being employed at the Essex Agricultural and Technology High School, and she appears to have been a continuous member of TRS from 1978 to 2002, except for a period of time from September, 1990, to June, 1991, during which she was laid off.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b364-8\">The evaluation contained the following observation: \u201cMs. Megiel-Rollo is a teacher with professional status who continues to strive to achieve all standards under ed reform particularly in the accommodations of students\u2019 diverse learning styles employing a myriad of teaching strategies.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b364-9\">The agreement presumably increased her sick leave buy back at the time of her retirement as well as the amount of her retirement allowance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b364-10\">The application for retirement form that retiring teachers must submit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>CRAB states that an applicant must attach a copy of their \u201cnotice of termination\u201d if they choose to apply for a termination allowance under G.
