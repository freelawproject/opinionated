After the accident, Dollar and its excess insurer, United National Insurance Company (United), filed an action against McConnico and Kohlmeyer\u2019s estate (estate) seeking a declaration that McConnico did not have express or implied permission to drive the Dollar automobile at the time of the accident. After a two-day trial, a jury agreed. A judgment containing the resulting declaration then entered, with the consequence that no insurance was available from United to satisfy the judgment against McConnico. The estate appeals, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\"><em>Background. </em>After the accident, the estate filed a wrongful death action against McConnico and Dollar, though for reasons the record does not fully reveal, Dollar was dismissed from that action by stipulation. McConnico was defaulted for failing to appear and the action proceeded to a jury trial on damages. The jury returned a verdict in the amount of $203,357. Claiming that the verdict was inadequate, the estate appealed. We affirmed in an unpublished memorandum and order pursuant to our rule 1:28. See <em>Kohlmeyer </em>v. <em>McConnico, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 1111 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">While the estate\u2019s case was proceeding, United commenced the present action against the estate and McConnico in an effort to obtain a declaration effectively shielding it from liability under an excess liability insurance policy it had issued to Dollar. The policy, which had a per accident limit of $900,000, was in force on the day of McConnico\u2019s accident.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Insofar as is relevant here, the policy provided coverage for liability incurred by Dollar and \u201c[ajnyone . . . using with [Dollar\u2019s] permission\u201d an automobile Dollar owned.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">United\u2019s declaratory judgment action came on for trial after judgment had entered in the estate\u2019s case but before the estate filed its appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The basic facts, as shown by the trial evidence, are straightforward. McConnico was employed by Dollar at one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>of its downtown Boston rental offices. His primary responsibility involved delivering automobiles to various city hotels at the request of potential renters. On the evening of November 12, 1997, the office manager left McConnico in charge of the office with instructions to close it at the proper time and open it the following morning. McConnico had an errand to run that evening and, because his own automobile was unavailable, he took one of Dollar\u2019s vehicles. The following morning, as he was driving the vehicle back to the office, he was involved in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Less clear was whether and to what extent Dollar had authorized or permitted McConnico to drive the vehicle. The evidence presented by Dollar tended to support the proposition that Mc-Connico had no authority or permission whatsoever. That evidence included McConnico\u2019s written acknowledgment at the time he was hired that he was prohibited from using company rental vehicles unless he did so under the direction of a Dollar manager and that unauthorized use of Dollar\u2019s vehicles was grounds for discharge. McConnico testified at trial that he was not driving the automobile for any business purpose at the time of the accident, that he had never before taken a Dollar vehicle home overnight, that he knew of no other Dollar employee who had done so without express permission, and that he had tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with his manager to obtain permission to drive before he took the automobile on the night in question. Other Dollar employees testified about the prohibition on personal use of Dollar vehicles, that McConnico had no permission to drive the vehicle home, and that McConnico had been fired on the morning of the accident for violating the Dollar policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">The estate\u2019s evidence tended to show a much looser arrangement, one in which personal use of Dollar automobiles was commonplace and few employees were reprimanded for doing so. Although written Dollar policies prohibited employees from personal use of Dollar vehicles, the policies were neither enforced nor stressed during the course of training. The working environment was \u201cfast-paced\u201d and employees often took automobiles without asking for permission to do so. The evidence also suggested that when McConnico was placed in charge of the facility with instructions to close and reopen it, he had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>authority to make all decisions regarding the facility\u2019s operation, including decisions about who should be permitted to take automobiles and for what purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The factual questions thus raised were sent to the jury for a special verdict consisting of the answer to a single question. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 49(a), 365 Mass. 812 (1974). The question read, \u201c[d]oes the evidence establish that, more probably than not, McConnico was an unauthorized driver of Dollar Rent-A-Car\u2019s motor vehicle when the accident occurred?\u201d The jury checked the box marked \u201cyes\u201d on the verdict form and orally affirmed the verdict in open court.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">The issue that divides the parties here, as it divided them in the Superior Court, concerns the instructions the judge gave to the jury. In essence, the judge told the jury that United was required to prove that McConnico did not have permission to use the vehicle at the time and place he was using it when the accident occurred.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because no one claimed that anyone had expressly given McConnico permission to use the vehicle, the judge further refined the issue by telling the jury that the issue they were to decide focused on the question of implied consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The estate sought an instruction based on G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85C, to the effect that McConnico was presumed at the time of the accident to be driving the vehicle with Dollar\u2019s express or implied consent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Counsel for the estate reasoned that the presumption would apply if, after obtaining a verdict against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>McConnico, the estate had commenced an action against United to recover under United\u2019s policy and there was no reason that the estate should be deprived of the presumption simply because United struck first. We think that there is less to that dispute than initially meets the eye and that the approach taken by the judge does not amount to reversible error. Indeed, that approach was more favorable to the estate than the approach it sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>The presumption embodied in G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85C, is part of a legislative structure supporting the Commonwealth\u2019s compulsory motor vehicle insurance requirements. Read in the context of the statutes to which \u00a7 85C refers, the support structure operates in this fashion. An insurer\u2019s liability under an automobile policy \u201cinsuring against liability for loss or damage on account of bodily injury or death\u201d becomes absolute when a covered loss occurs and is not conditioned on an insured\u2019s payment of the loss to the injured party. See G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 112, amended by St. 1977, c. 437. If the injured party obtains a judgment against the insured, the injured party is entitled to bring an action against the insurer to reach and apply the insurance proceeds. See G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113; G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 3(9). In an action to reach and apply, the presumption desired by the estate applies but, as \u00a7 85C expressly states, only if the plaintiff is seeking to \u201creach and apply the proceeds of [a] motor vehicle liability policy, as defined in\u201d G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">That limitation provides the first obstacle in the estate\u2019s path on this appeal, for the liability policy defined in G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A, is the compulsory policy required of all vehicles registered in Massachusetts. Applying the presumption to that policy facilitates the public protection that for years has provided the basis for the compulsory requirement itself. See generally <em>Oliveria </em>v. <em>Preferred Acc. Ins. Co., </em>312 Mass. 426, 429 (1942). Cf. <em>Transamerica Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Norfolk &amp; Dedham Mut. Fire Ins. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number><em>Co., </em>361 Mass. 144, 146-147 (1972). But there is no question that United\u2019s policy was an excess policy, with coverage beginning at $100,000, well above the compulsory policy\u2019s $20,000 requirement, and not a compulsory policy defined in \u00a7 34A. See <em>Insurance Rating Bd. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>356 Mass. 184, 189 (1969). See also <em>Blair </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>291 Mass. 432, 435-437 (1935). By its terms, then, \u00a7 85C did not apply to actions involving the United policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">There is, though, a second hurdle. Ordinarily, the insured, or someone standing in the shoes of the insured, is required to prove coverage. See <em>Markline Co. </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>384 Mass. 139, 140 (1981). In seeking recovery under United\u2019s policy, the estate was standing in the shoes of McConnico or Dollar or both. The presumption would have eased the estate\u2019s burden initially, but it was \u201crebuttable, and continue[d] only until evidence [was] introduced which would warrant a finding contrary to the presumed fact.\u201d <em>Scaltreto </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>352 Mass. 62, 64 (1967).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Here, there was such evidence. Had the judge been operating under \u00a7 85C, therefore, he would have been entirely warranted in saying nothing about the presumption.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Lalumiere, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 262, 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Of course, even without the presumption, the statute places the burden of proving lack of consent on the insurer. That is exactly where the judge placed it. That burden never disappeared. Consequently, like any other instruction on the burden of proof, the instruction guided and informed the jury\u2019s deliberations from the moment they retired until the moment they reached a verdict, in the process giving the estate all that it would been entitled to receive had \u00a7 85C applied to this policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Two other issues require less discussion. First, the estate requested an instruction on bailment, which the judge rightly declined to give.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Among other things, the instruction\u2019s definition of bailment was overbroad. See, e.g., <em>King </em>v. <em>Trustees of Boston Univ., </em>420 Mass. 52, 59 (1995). Second, the instruction did not ask the jury to determine whether a bailment existed even though existence of a bailment was a necessary predicate for the liability instruction with which the request closed. Finally, the instruction purported to rest on two cases, see note 10, <em>supra, </em>involving legal principles that arise out of compulsory policies, which United\u2019s policy was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Finally, the estate sought an instruction on agency that the judge also rightly rejected.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> That instruction also rested on cases involving compulsory policies. Moreover, implicit in the request was a finding that McConnico had permission to drive the vehicle. But whether McConnico had permission to drive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>was the very question sent to the jury. If their answer had been \u201cyes,\u201d the estate would have prevailed and the requested instruction would have been unnecessary. If, as happened, their answer was \u201cno,\u201d an essential predicate for the instruction did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b79-8\">To fulfil its liability insurance obligations under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A, Dollar self-insured for the first $100,000 of liability. United\u2019s policy provided insurance for liability in excess of that amount.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b79-9\">An earlier appeal had been filed but was dismissed without prejudice because of deficiencies in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b81-8\">EarIier, the judge denied United\u2019s motion to place on the estate the burden of proving that McConnico had permission to drive the vehicle. The estate claims that the judge said on several occasions that United had the burden of proving that McConnico was \u201can authorized\u201d driver or otherwise misstated the issue. Even if one assumes that the lines of the transcript to which the estate points were not transcription errors, the instructions as a whole clearly conveyed the nature of the estate\u2019s burden, and that clarity was enhanced by the single written question the jury were instructed to answer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b81-9\">General Laws c. 231, \u00a7 85C, amended by St. 1975, c. 377, \u00a7 95, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-10\">\u201cIn any civil action, under [G.

L. c. 231, \u00a7 85A. See <em>Arrigo </em>v. <em>Lindquist, </em>324 Mass. 278, 280 (1949).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b83-7\">Relying on <em>Boudreau </em>v. <em>Maryland Cas. Co., </em>287 Mass. 423 (1934), and <em>O\u2019Roak </em>v. <em>Lloyds Cas. Co., </em>285 Mass. 532 (1934), the estate says that the central issue in this case involves \u201cconsent,\u201d as expansively defined in those cases, not \u201cpermission.\u201d See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 32E. But, even if one puts aside the fact that those cases dealt with a statutory overlay on the scope of compulsory policies, the cases are inapposite, for they dealt with a question that is different from the one that this case presents. It was clear in both cases that the vehicle owner had given another person permission to operate the vehicle, i.e., \u201c \u2018authority to operate\u2019 or \u2018the right to possession\u2019 of an automobile for a specific purpose.\u201d <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Tabor, </em>407 Mass. 354, 360 (1990). The central question the cases presented had to do with whether the operator\u2019s violation of limitations on operation the owner had imposed somehow stripped away insurance coverage that attached when the owner gave possession of the vehicle to the operator. See, e.g., <em>Drescher </em>v. <em>Travelers Ins. Co., </em>359 Mass. 458, 461 (1971); <em>Muzichuk </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 266, 271 (1974). Here, the question, resolved on conflicting evidence, was whether McConnico had been given any operational permission. The answer to that question determined whether coverage ever attached, and the judge\u2019s instructions properly focused the jury on that question. See generally <em>White </em>v. <em>Standard Acc. Ins. Co., </em>302 Mass. 474, 475-476 (1939); <em>Kneeland </em>v. <em>Bernardi </em>317 Mass. 517, 519-520 (1945); <em>Scaltreto </em>v. <em>Shea, </em>352 Mass, at 64-65.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b84-7\">The request stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-8\">\u201cA bailment is a contract whereby one person holds in trust property of another.
