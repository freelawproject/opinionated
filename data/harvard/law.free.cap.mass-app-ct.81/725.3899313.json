Turner, coexecutors of the estate of Helen M. Kendall (collectively, coexecutors), appeal from a decree of the Probate and Family Court disallowing Kendall\u2019s will on the ground that it was not properly executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-15\"><em>Background. </em>The facts are not disputed. On March 18, 2006, Kendall went with the coexecutors to the Citizens Bank in the Davis Square section of Somerville, intending to execute (and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>have notarized) Kendall\u2019s will. When they arrived, Turner approached Deborah Lindstedt, a banker and a notary public employed by Citizens Bank, and asked for assistance. In response, Lindstedt approached Kendall, asked her for identification, and \u201cchatted with [her] for a little bit.\u201d Turner handed the will to Lindstedt and then walked off to the side.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Lindstedt could not recall any of the circumstances surrounding the execution of Kendall\u2019s will. However, Lindstedt testified in detail about the practice that she regularly followed when notarizing a will. The judge credited her testimony and found that she followed her regular procedure in this case. See Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 406(a) (2011). It was Lindstedt\u2019s practice to verify a testatrix\u2019s identity and to have her read aloud the attestation or notarization clause appearing before the signature line.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After reading that clause aloud, the testatrix would sign the will, and Kendall did so. Lindstedt then would sign in the notary block. Afterwards, she would call two additional witnesses, in this case, two bank tellers, Susanna Rosa and Guercy Carrie, one at a time, to come from the teller windows to her desk to witness the will in the testatrix\u2019s presence. At trial, Lindstedt confirmed that her signature and notary seal appeared on the last page of Kendall\u2019s will.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition, her notary log showed that she notarized a last will and testament, along with a power of attorney, for Kendall on March 18, 2006; the log also showed that Kendall provided her Massachusetts identification card to verify her identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Although neither of the two witnesses had a specific memory of the event, each also testified as to his, or her, usual practice. The judge found that, after Kendall signed the will in the presence of Lindstedt, \u201cthe witnesses were . . . called to [her] desk and requested to affix their signatures to the document. The wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>nesses did not have any conversation with Ms. Kendall nor did they see Ms. Kendall sign the will.\u201d In addition, Rosa and Carrie confirmed the appearance of their signatures on the last page of the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Carrie testified that he followed the same practice \u201cregardless of the [type of] document\u201d he witnessed. It was his regular practice to look at the first page to verify that the name of the signatory was the person seated at the banker\u2019s desk; he also would review any form of identification that had been provided. Rosa testified that when she witnessed a document, her regular practice was to look at the form of identification provided by the signatory and confirm that the name was consistent with the signature and \u201cmatched the person sitting at the desk.\u201d She sometimes would engage in conversation with the signatory if she (Rosa) was not busy or rushed.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Kendall died on August 14, 2007, at the age of ninety. The co-executors filed their petition to probate the will on September 12, 2007, and Rita Farrell, Thomas R. Powers, and Diana Powers (collectively, contestants)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> filed an affidavit of objections to the appointment. The judge bifurcated the trial, addressing first the issue whether the will was properly executed; he reserved other issues raised by the objections, including, specifically, undue influence and lack of testamentary capacity. In a decision dated March 19, 2010, the judge found, \u201cWith no conversation having taken place between Ms. Kendall and the witnesses, there was no explicit acknowledgment of the signature as hers nor was there a formal statement that the document was her will.\u201d Recognizing that \u201cthere are cases wherein testators did not specifically acknowledge their previously affixed signatures to after signing witnesses,\u201d the judge distinguished those cases on the ground that \u201cin those cases the implied acknowledgment was the testator\u2019s request that the witness sign the will. Here, Ms. Kendall did not make the request, Ms. Lindstedt did.\u201d The judge concluded that Kendall did not \u201cexplicitly or impliedly acknowledge her signature on the will and that, as a result, the will was not properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>executed.\u201d The coexecutors\u2019 petition to probate the will was dismissed with prejudice, and they filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>The coexecutors do not quarrel with the facts found by the judge; they challenge only his conclusion that the will was not properly executed. \u201cIt is our obligation to review the evidence and reach a decision in accordance with our own reasoning and understanding, giving due weight to the findings of the trial judge, which we will not reverse unless they are plainly wrong, and finding for ourselves any additional facts we believe to be justified by the evidence.\u201d <em>Heinrich </em>v. <em>Silvernail, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 218, 223 (1986), quoting from <em>Olsson </em>v. <em>Waite, </em>373 Mass. 517, 520 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">The governing statute provides, \u201cEvery person eighteen years of age or older and of sound mind may by his last will in writing, signed by him . . . and by his express direction, and attested and subscribed in his presence by two or more competent witnesses, dispose of his property.\u201d G. L. c. 191, \u00a7 1, as amended through St. 1976, c. 515, \u00a7 3.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201cThe burden of proving proper execution rest[s] upon the proponent and require[s] her to prove that all the formal requirements of the statute were met. ... A presumption of proper execution is inferred upon proof of all the signatures . . . even though the living witnesses can recollect nothing of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>Riordan, </em>333 Mass. 317, 318 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-7\">The parties dispute the significance of that presumption; in the coexecutors\u2019 view, the judge failed to explain why the presumption did not apply. The contestants respond that the facts found by the judge rebut the presumption of proper execution. The question for us is whether the procedure followed was sufficient for the proper execution of the will or, more specifically, whether, on these facts, an inference properly can be drawn that Kendall acknowledged, even indirectly, to the witnesses that the signature on the will was hers.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">First, there is no question regarding any of the signatures themselves. The judge accepted Lindstedt\u2019s testimony that Kendall signed the will in her presence after reading aloud the attestation clause. Each of the witnesses, including Lindstedt, confirmed her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>(or his) respective signature; the signatures appeared below the attestation clause on the last page of the will. We note that an attestation clause to which a signature is attached, \u201calthough not required, [is] . . . persuasive evidence of proper execution.\u201d <em>Werber </em>v. <em>Werber, </em>62 Mass. App. Ct. 927, 928 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Second, although the two witnesses did not see Kendall sign the will, it is not necessary that the additional witnesses observe the \u201ctestator sign his name, or in express terms declare the signature to be his.\u201d <em>Ela </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>16 Gray 91, 92 (1860). Kendall\u2019s signature appeared in plain view directly above the place where the witnesses signed on the last page of the will; there is no allegation that any attempt was made to conceal her signature. See <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Henderson, </em>304 Mass. 3, 5 (1939). In <em>Barber, </em>the court stated that \u201cfacts essential to a good attestation were present\u201d and the provisions of the statute are met even if a witness does \u201cnot see the signing of the will by the testatrix.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">The third, and crucial, question is whether Kendall acknowledged, even implicitly, that the signature on the will was hers. The judge\u2019s conclusion that she did not \u201cexplicitly or impliedly acknowledge her signature\u201d is based on his finding that the witnesses did \u201cnot have any conversation with Kendall nor did they see Ms. Kendall sign the will.\u201d For support, he cited <em>Flynn </em>v. <em>Prindeville, </em>327 Mass. 266 (1951). However, the facts in this case are distinguishable from those in <em>Flynn, </em>where counsel\u2019s representations about anticipated testimony were that witnesses had been asked to come to a home and then were taken into a room where they:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-7\">\u201csaw lying in bed a \u2018very old lady who looked very ill\u2019; that \u2018she was lying very quietly with her eyes open but she did nothing and said nothing while [the witnesses] were there. . . . The lawyer . . . produced some papers which he arranged so that the only part of the papers that was open was the space in which he asked [the witnesses] to sign their names. . . . Nothing was said by anyone about whose will it was, and if [the lawyer] also signed the will or paper he did not do so in the presence of the other witnesses.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 269. This case is very different.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Although it is a close question, based on all the circumstances surrounding the execution of the will, we are persuaded that Kendall implicitly acknowledged her desire to execute her will by being present when the will was given to Lindstedt, reciting the attestation clause aloud to her, and then signing the will in her presence. Lindstedt then carried out Kendall\u2019s \u201cdeclaration\u201d to execute her will in accordance with the statute by obtaining two additional witnesses. The fact that it was Lindstedt\u2019s request to the witnesses to attest to Kendall\u2019s signature, rather than Kendall\u2019s, does not obviate Kendall\u2019s implicit acknowledgment. Thereafter, Kendall sufficiently acknowledged her signature by remaining seated at Lindstedt\u2019s desk and watching, without interruption, as each witness came individually to the desk to sign the will. Kendall\u2019s actions, following as they did upon her reading the attestation clause, signing the will, and being present while Lindstedt notarized it, indicate that Kendall was acknowledging the presentment of her will to the witnesses for execution consistent with her original request to Lindstedt. An acknowledgment by the testatrix to witnesses of \u201ca previous signature [is] equivalent to signing the instrument in their presence.\u201d <em>Nunn </em>v. <em>Ehlert, </em>218 Mass. 471, 475 (1914). See <em>Nickerson </em>v. Buck, 12 Cush. 332, 342 (1853) (\u201c[T]he actual signature by the testator may be made known to the witness in other modes than an express declaration to the witness that the will is his. Any act or declaration that carries by implication an averment of such fact is equally effectual\u201d); <em>Ela </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>16 Gray at 92-93 (\u201cThe signature of the testator may be made known to the witnesses in other modes than an express declaration to them by the testator that the signature is his. Any act or declaration that carries by implication an averment of such fact is equally effectual\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">Although our cases previously have not addressed precisely these facts in the context of determining whether a will was properly executed, language in the decisions of other State courts lends support for our conclusion that the testatrix\u2019s implied acknowledgment to the witnesses here was sufficient, and that the judge erred in dismissing the coexecutors\u2019 petition for probate on the ground that the will was not properly executed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>The decree disallowing the will based on improper execution is reversed.
