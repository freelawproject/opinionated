L. c. 265, \u00a7 15B(\u00bf); carrying a firearm without a license, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(a); and possession of ammunition without a firearm identification card (FID card), G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(h). In a second trial, another Superior Court jury convicted him on one count of being an armed career criminal based on three predicate offenses, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G(c), as a sentence enhancement on his conviction under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(h). The defendant appeals. We find no error in his convictions from the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">As to the second trial, the defendant\u2019s appeal raises the issue whether a certified record of conviction constitutes sufficient evidence that the defendant was convicted of a predicate \u201cviolent crime,\u201d see G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121, as appearing in St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 8, for purposes of the armed career criminal sentencing enhancements, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G(a)-(c). We hold that a certified record of conviction is sufficient when the predicate offense is assault and battery on a police officer (ABPO), G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13D (two of the predicate offenses here), but that it is not when the predicate offense is assault and battery, G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A(a), which was one of the predicate offenses here. Accordingly, we reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G(c), as an armed career criminal based on three predicate violent crimes and remand for his resentencing as an armed career criminal based on two predicate violent crimes, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G(\u00bf&gt;).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">1. <em>Background. </em>We recite the trial evidence related to the defendant\u2019s claims of error on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">a. <em>The first trial. </em>In April, 2006, the defendant was tried on three indictments charging assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, carrying a firearm without a license, and possession of ammunition without an FID card. The events giving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>rise to this prosecution occurred early on June 7, 2004. The defendant and two companions were in a black vehicle with tinted windows. The defendant was in the passenger seat. The defendant fired numerous shots at another car with two occupants.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">State troopers responded. They identified the vehicle in which the defendant was riding; stopped it; ordered its occupants, including the defendant, out; and arrested them. At first finding no weapons, the troopers walked along the road on which the vehicle had been stopped and found a firearm and a holster. The two occupants of the other car arrived for a showup and positively identified the defendant and his companions.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">The defendant gave a statement to the State police. In this statement, he asserted that he and his companions had been shot at and that the driver of the car returned fire in self-defense. He confessed to throwing the firearm out the car window when he saw the troopers. Subsequently, he also confessed to being the one who fired at the other car.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Witnesses testified to the above facts at the first trial. The defendant neither testified nor presented evidence. His attorney, in his opening statement, put forth a self-defense theory. On cross-examination defense counsel questioned the driver of the other car, Hugo Paez, about his hobby of working with cars and whether he raced cars. Paez replied, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t race. I have a perfect driving record.\u201d The following day, defense counsel proffered a copy of Paez\u2019s record of driving violations and requested that it be admitted for purposes of impeaching him by contradiction. The judge excluded the driving record as collateral to the issue of self-defense and insufficiently probative of Paez\u2019s credibility or bias.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">After hearing standard instructions, the jury convicted the defendant of all three charges. The defendant noticed his appeal from these convictions in May, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-9\">b. <em>The second trial. </em>In April, 2007, the defendant was tried before a different jury, see G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11 A, on the count of the indictment for carrying a firearm without a license (G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 <em>10[a\\) </em>that sought an enhanced sentence under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G(c), for being an armed career criminal who had committed three prior violent crimes. Several probation department officials testified regarding the defendant\u2019s criminal history, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>including a 2004 conviction of assault and battery and 2001 and 2002 convictions of ABPO. Certified records of these three convictions were admitted as the Commonwealth\u2019s proof of predicate offenses. The certified records identified the convictions only by the terms \u201cassault and battery on a police officer\u201d and \u201cassault and battery,\u201d and no evidence was presented as to whether these convictions resulted from harmful, reckless, or offensive batteries, see part 3, <em>infra, </em>or as to the circumstances of the three predicate convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">The defendant requested that the judge strike his 2004 assault and battery conviction from evidence. He argued that, because the conviction resulted from a guilty plea to a complaint which originally charged him with armed robbery but was subsequently amended to charge assault and battery and attempted larceny<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> separately, he was improperly convicted. The judge rejected the request, and the conviction was admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">The defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty, arguing that the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to introduce any evidence of the circumstances underlying his three convictions meant that there was insufficient evidence to show that he had been convicted of three \u201cviolent crimes.\u201d The judge denied the motion, reasoning that assault and battery always has, as an element, at least minimal physical force, bringing it within the relevant statutory definition of \u201cviolent crime.\u201d The judge also announced his intention to instruct according to this understanding, and the defendant objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The judge instructed, inter alla, that \u201c[a]s a matter of law, the definition of violent crime includes the crimes of assault and battery on a police officer and assault and battery . . . .\u201d The jury found the defendant guilty on the armed career criminal count of the indictment. The defendant noticed his appeal from this conviction on April 27, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">c. <em>Appeal. </em>In this consolidated appeal, the defendant argues (1) insufficient evidence of, and erroneous jury instructions about, statutorily required predicate offenses in the second trial; (2) erroneous admission of one of the defendant\u2019s convictions as evidence at the second trial; and (3) erroneous exclusion of evidence in the first trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>2. <em>The armed career criminal act statutory scheme. </em>Our decision requires some explication of the statutory scheme at issue, so we detour here for a detailed discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">a. <em>The Massachusetts and Federal armed career criminal acts. </em>In order to sustain a conviction under the Massachusetts armed career criminal act (Massachusetts ACCA), G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G(a)-(c), the Commonwealth must prove that the defendant has been previously convicted of at least one \u201cviolent crime.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> For purposes of the Massachusetts ACCA, a \u201cviolent crime\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">\u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year . . . that: (i) has as an element the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force or a deadly weapon against the person of another; (ii) is burglary, extortion, arson or kidnapping; (iii) involves the use of explosives; or (iv) otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious risk of physical injury to another.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121, as appearing in St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 8. See G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G(e). The Massachusetts ACCA therefore has three components: (1) the \u201cphysical force\u201d or \u201cforce\u201d clause; (2) the enumerated crimes provisions; and (3) the residual clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">The Massachusetts ACCA\u2019s language largely replicates the Federal armed career criminal act (Federal ACCA), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) (2006). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>75 Mass. App. Ct. 220, 223 (2009). The Federal ACCA mandates a sentencing enhancement for those previously convicted of three \u201cviolent felon[les]\u201d or serious drug offenses. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (2006). The Federal ACCA further defines a \u201cviolent felony\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) (2006) as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-9\">\u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>ing one year . . . that (i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The term \u201ccrime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d is further defined to include certain State law misdemeanors. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20)(B) (2006); <em>Logan </em>v. <em>United States, </em>552 U.S. 23, 27 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">The Federal ACCA definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is almost identical to the definition of \u201cviolent crime\u201d that the Massachusetts Legislature adopted in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121, and incorporated into the Massachusetts ACCA by G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G(e). The two statutes differ only in four ways. First, the Massachusetts ACCA uses the term \u201cviolent crime\u201d while the Federal ACCA uses the term \u201cviolent felony\u201d; this apparent distinction ultimately collapses because the Federal ACCA encompasses both felonies and misdemeanors as predicate offenses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20)(B) (2006); <em>Logan </em>v. <em>United States, supra. </em>Second, the Massachusetts ACCA adds use of a deadly weapon to its force clause. Third, the Massachusetts ACCA adds kidnapping to its list of enumerated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>crimes. Fourth, the Massachusetts ACCA residual clause refers to \u201cserious risk of physical injury to another,\u201d compared to the Federal ACCA\u2019s residual clause, which refers to \u201cserious <em>potential </em>risk of physical injury to another\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">When a Massachusetts statute \u201ctracks [a] Federal statute, we have looked to the Federal case law for guidance in interpreting\u201d our cognate statute. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>One 1986 Volkswagen GTI Auto., </em>417 Mass. 369, 373 (1994). See <em>Packaging Indus. Group, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cheney, </em>380 Mass. 609, 611 (1980) (citing <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Superior Ct., </em>337 Mass. 522, 527 [1958], and <em>Rollins Environmental Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Superior Ct., </em>368 Mass. 174, 179 [1975]); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>453 Mass. 707, 712 n.8 (2009). Given that G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121, so closely tracks 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) (except as noted above), we consider the Federal courts\u2019 construction of the Federal statute highly persuasive in interpreting the Massachusetts ACCA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">b. <em>Massachusetts ACCA procedure. </em>Although the Massachusetts ACCA largely replicates the Federal ACCA in its language, we pause to note one meaningful practical difference: a defendant facing sentence enhancement under the Massachusetts ACCA is entitled to a jury trial. See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 11 A. In contrast, a defendant facing the Federal ACCA enhancement is not. See <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 25-26 (2005) (plurality opinion).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, substantive similarities between the two statutes notwithstanding, because of the Massachusetts jury trial require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>ment the Commonwealth may establish the applicability of the Massachusetts ACCA by using witness testimony and a wider range of documentary evidence than is available in the Federal courts. Concomitantly, a Massachusetts court deciding the applicability of the Massachusetts ACCA must also ensure the procedural protections that such a trial affords.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">c. <em>The \u201ccategorical approach\u201d and the \u201cmodified categorical approach.\u201d </em>Under the Federal ACCA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 921(20) and 924(e), sentencing judges use the \u201ccategorical approach\u201d to determine whether a prior conviction qualifies as a predicate offense. See, e.g., <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602 (1990). This approach \u201cgenerally requires the trial court to look only to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">The Supreme Judicial Court followed this approach in interpreting similar language in the State pretrial detention statute, G. L. c. 276, \u00a7 58A.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>453 Mass, at 711-716. We conclude that this straightforward categorical approach also applies to Massachusetts ACCA jury trials when the statutory definition of the prior offense unambiguously qualifies that offense as a predicate conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">The <em>Young </em>case, however, involved a statute that defined a predicate offense on the basis of the element or elements of the defense or \u201cthe nature\u201d of the offense, which the court interpreted as \u201c focus [ing] on the elements of the crime rather than the particular facts underlying a complaint or indictment,\u201d and did not consider the application of the categorical approach to offenses that may be based on different elements, that is, whose statutory definitions do not conclusively settle the issue whether the offense qualifies as a predicate offense. See <em>id. </em>at 713-715 &amp; n.9. Absent controlling authority on this question under Massachusetts law, we look to Federal law for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Under Federal law, \u201c[the] categorical approach . . . may permit the sentencing court to go beyond the mere fact of conviction in a narrow range of cases . . . .\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>United States, </em>495 U.S. at 602. Accordingly, in the narrow range of cases where the statutory definition of an offense does not conclusively situate it within the relevant category of predicate offenses, a sentencing Federal judge may look to extrinsic evidence to determine which material elements formed the basis of the defendant\u2019s prior conviction. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>130 S. Ct. 1265, 1273 (2010), citing <em>Nijhawan </em>v. <em>Holder, </em>557 U.S. 29, 41 (2009); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>630 F.3d 252, 256-257 (1st Cir. 2011). This \u201cmodified categorical approach\u201d \u201cpermits a court to determine which statutory phrase was the basis for the conviction by consulting the trial record \u2014 including charging documents, plea agreements, transcripts of plea colloquies, findings of fact and conclusions of law from a bench trial, and jury instructions and verdict forms.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>130 S. Ct. at 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">We find this authority persuasive. We conclude that, for Massachusetts ACCA purposes, in the narrow range of cases where the statutory or common-law definition of a prior offense does not conclusively bring it within the category of \u201cviolent crimes,\u201d the familiar sufficiency of the evidence standard mandates this modified categorical approach. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979). If a certified record of conviction identifies a statutory or common-law term which could refer to multiple crimes with different material elements, then the certified record permits any rational factfinder to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was convicted of a \u201cviolent crime\u201d only if <em>all </em>crimes defined by that statutory or common-law term are \u201cviolent crimes.\u201d See ibid.; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>630 F.3d at 256-257. See also <em>Shepard </em>v. <em>United States, </em>544 U.S. at 15-17, 24-26. If the statutory or common-law crime encompasses several offenses at least one of which is <em>not </em>a \u201cviolent crime,\u201d then a rational factfinder would require some additional evidence<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that the conviction at issue was of one of the offenses included in that term that <em>is </em>a \u201cviolent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>crime\u201d in order to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant was previously convicted of a \u201cviolent crime.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, supra. </em>Accord <em>United States </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>630 F.3d at 259-260.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">3. <em>Assault and battery, ABPO, and the Massachusetts ACCA. </em>We turn now to the defendant\u2019s conviction on the armed career criminal enhancement charge based on three predicate convictions, one of assault and battery and two of ABPO. The defendant argues that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his armed career criminal conviction because the Commonwealth presented no evidence that his prior convictions of assault and battery and ABPO met the statutory definition of \u201cviolent crime.\u201d On the same basis, he argues that the judge erroneously instructed that the statutory definition of \u201cviolent crime\u201d included his prior convictions of assault and battery and ABPO as matter of law. We agree with the defendant as to his assault and battery conviction. We agree with the judge as to the ABPO convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">a. <em>Assault and battery. </em>\u201cAssault and battery is a common law crime now set forth in G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A. . . . Because there are harmful batteries and offensive batteries, there is a bifurcation in the law of battery.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>390 Mass. 480, 482 (1983). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 190, 194-195 (2008) (recognizing as distinct harmful battery, offensive battery, and battery defined as a \u201cwilful, wanton, and reckless act [resulting] in personal injury to another,\u201d i.e., reckless battery). Harmful battery, reckless battery, and offensive battery have different material elements, so a certified record of conviction that refers only to \u201cassault and battery\u201d could refer to any one of these three sets of material elements.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">We conclude that, while harmful battery and reckless battery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>are violent crimes under the Massachusetts ACCA, offensive battery is not.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We explain this result under the three subparts of the definition of \u201cviolent crime\u201d for purposes of the Massachusetts ACCA, see part 2.a, <em>supra: </em>(1) the enumerated crimes; (2) the force clause; and (3) the residual clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">i. <em>The enumerated crimes. </em>The Massachusetts ACCA expressly enumerates, as predicate offenses, \u201cburglary, extortion, arson or kidnapping; ... [or any offense that] involves the use of explosives.\u201d G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121. None of the crimes defined by G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A(a), falls into these classifications, so an assault and battery conviction does not qualify under these subsections of the definition of violent crime in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121, as a Massachusetts ACCA predicate offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">ii. <em>The force clause. A </em>crime qualifies as a predicate offense under the Massachusetts ACCA if it is \u201cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year . . . that: (i) has as an element the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force or a deadly weapon against the person of another.\u201d G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121. We have not previously applied this language to assault and battery, so we look to the Federal interpretation of the nearly identical language in the Federal ACCA for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>130 S. Ct. at 1271, the United States Supreme Court analyzed the similarly bifurcated law of Florida battery. The court held that the \u201celement [of] the use ... of physical force\u201d required to qualify as a predicate offense under the force clause means <em>\u201cviolent </em>force\u201d (emphasis in original), that is, \u201cforce capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">While <em>Johnson </em>interprets the Federal ACCA, we find its reasoning persuasive in interpreting the Massachusetts statute. See part 2.a, <em>supra. </em>We therefore hold that, in order to qualify as a \u201cviolent crime\u201d as defined in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121, the relevant crime must include, as an element, violent or substantial force capable of causing pain or injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-9\">We find <em>Johnson </em>persuasive because of its application of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>long-standing rules of statutory construction. \u201c[W]ords in a statute must be considered in light of the other words surrounding them.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>366 Mass. 423,428 (1974). We therefore interpret the statutory term \u201cphysical force\u201d in the context of the category it helps to define, \u201cviolent crime.\u201d \u201cViolent\u201d means extreme, extensive, or substantial force. See <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>130 S. Ct. at 1271, citing, inter alla, Webster\u2019s New Inti. Dictionary 2846 (2d ed. 1954); 19 Oxford English Dictionary 656 (2d ed. 1989); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1706 (9th ed. 2009). Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Belless, </em>338 F.3d 1063, 1068 (9th Cir. 2003), interpreting \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A) (\u201cAs a matter of law, we hold that the physical force to which the federal statute refers is not de minimis\u201d); <em>Flores </em>v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 666, 672 (7th Cir. 2003), interpreting \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as used in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16[a] (\u201cTo avoid collapsing the distinction between violent and non-violent offenses, we must treat the word \u2018force\u2019 as having a meaning in the legal community that differs from its meaning in the physics community. The way to do this is to insist that the force be violent in nature \u2014 the sort that is intended to cause bodily injury, or at a minimum likely to do so\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The Commonwealth urges that we interpret \u201cphysical force\u201d broadly so as to include any touching, no matter how slight. Even were we persuaded that the Commonwealth\u2019s interpretation is permissible, we would reach the same result. At best, the Commonwealth\u2019s proffered interpretation is just as plausible as the interpretation we adopt here. If two readings of a statute are equally plausible, the statute is ambiguous. It is well-established that \u201cwe cannot interpret an ambiguous statute in a manner that disadvantages a criminal defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hamilton, </em>459 Mass. 422, 436 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that the Legislature, by using \u201cviolent\u201d to describe the predicate offenses necessary for a Massachusetts ACCA enhancement, intended to require the \u201celement [of] the use ... of physical force\u201d necessary for such offenses to include only substantial physical force capable of causing pain or injury. Applying this definition to the crimes punishable by G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13A(o), we conclude that, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>harmful battery and reckless battery do have, as an element, the use of \u201cphysical force\u201d sufficient to implicate the sentencing enhancement, offensive battery does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">Harmful battery is \u201c[a]ny touching \u2018with such violence that bodily harm is likely to result.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>390 Mass, at 482, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Farrell, </em>322 Mass. 606, 620 (1948). Because it has \u201cviolence\u201d as a material element, harmful battery has, as an element, the use of \u201cphysical force\u201d as we interpret it above.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">Reckless battery is a \u201cwilful, wanton, and reckless act [resulting] in personal injury to another.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. at 194-195, quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 271, 274-275 (1983). Because it has not just violence but injury as a material element, reckless battery has \u201cphysical force\u201d as we interpret it above as an element.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">But offensive battery, defined as \u201can offensive touching\u201d which is an \u201caffront to the victim\u2019s personal integrity,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>390 Mass, at 483, does not have, as an element, the use of \u201cphysical force\u201d as we have defined it.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In order to establish offensive battery, the Commonwealth need only prove \u201cthat the defendant, without justification or excuse, intentionally touched the victim, and that the touching, <em>however slight, </em>occurred without the victim\u2019s consent\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hartnett, </em>72 Mass. App. Ct. 467, 476 (2008). Such de minimis touchings include tickling, <em>ibid., </em>and spitting, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cohen, </em>55 Mass. App. Ct. 358, 359-360 (2002). While unconsented-to tickling and spitting may be deserving of criminal opprobrium, it strains credulity to consider them \u201cviolent\u201d or involving \u201cphysical force.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>that a conviction of offensive battery based on such a slight touching does not require substantial physical force capable of causing pain or injury and, accordingly, that \u201cphysical force\u201d is not an element.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">iii. <em>The residual clause.</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> A </em>crime qualifies as a predicate offense under the Massachusetts ACCA if it \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious risk of physical injury to another.\u201d G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121. Again, we have not previously applied this language to assault and battery, so we look to the Federal interpretation of the similar language (\u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d) in the Federal ACCA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The Federal courts have applied this language to a wide variety of crimes. See, e.g., <em>James </em>v. <em>United States, </em>550 U.S. 192 (2007) (Florida attempted burglary); <em>Begay </em>v. <em>United States, </em>553 U.S. 137 (2008) (New Mexico driving under influence); <em>Sykes </em>v. <em>United States, </em>131 S. Ct. 2267, 2271-2275 (2011) (Indiana conviction of vehicle flight from law enforcement officer); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dancy, </em>640 F.3d 455, 465-470 (1st Cir. 2011) (Massachusetts ABPO); <em>Miller </em>v. <em>United States, </em>792 F. Supp. 2d 104, 106-107 (D. Mass. 2011) (same). As demanded by the statutory language, the residual clause inquiry is driven by the level of risk.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Sykes </em>v. <em>United States, </em>131 S. Ct. at 2273-2275.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The enumerated crimes provide guidance as to the level of risk required in order to constitute a predicate offense. <em>Id. </em>at 2273, 2276. \u201c[T]he proper inquiry is whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordinary case, presents a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>serious potential risk of injury to another.\u201d <em>James </em>v. <em>United States, </em>550 U.S. at 208. The offenses \u201ctypically involve[] purposeful, \u2018violent,\u2019 and \u2018aggressive\u2019 conduct,\u201d <em>Begay </em>v. <em>United States, </em>553 U.S. at 144-145, but need not, <em>Sykes </em>v. <em>United States, supra </em>at 2275-2276.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Offensive battery<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> does not, in the ordinary case, involve conduct with the requisite risk. Typically, offensive battery involves a slight touching, which may be \u201cinsignificant in character.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCan, </em>277 Mass. 199, 203 (1931). While this conduct may be \u201cpurposeful,\u201d even \u201caggressive,\u201d <em>Begay </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>we similarly find it implausible to call it \u201cviolent\u201d in the ordinary case. See <em>id. </em>at 144-145. We conclude that conduct that is \u201cinsignificant in character,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCan, supra, </em>does not, in the ordinary case, \u201cpresent[] a serious risk of physical injury to another,\u201d G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, we conclude that offensive battery does not qualify as a \u201cviolent crime\u201d under the residual clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">b. <em>ABPO. </em>In addition to the elements required for assault and battery, conviction of ABPO requires proof \u201cthat the offense be committed on a \u2018public employee who was engaged in the performance of his duty at the time\u2019 of the assault and battery.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Correia, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 455, 457 (2000), quoting from G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13D, as amended by St. 1990, c. 498. The Commonwealth must also prove that the defendant knew his victim was a police officer. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deschaine, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 506, 514-515 (2010) (interpreting assault and battery on correction officer, G. L. c. 127, \u00a7 38B). Thus, the Commonwealth may meet its burden by proving harmful battery, reckless battery, or offensive battery, plus the additional elements. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Correia, supra. </em>We con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>elude that ABPO, even when based on offensive battery, qualifies as a \u201cviolent crime\u201d under the residual clause.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The residual clause, as discussed above, qualifies an offense as a \u201cviolent crime\u201d for purposes of the Massachusetts ACCA if the offense \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious risk of physical injury to another.\u201d G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121. We again focus on the ordinary case of ABPO. To be convicted of ABPO, the perpetrator must know that his victim was a law enforcement officer, and the officer must be on duty. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Correia, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. at 457. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Deschaine, 11 </em>Mass. App. Ct. at 515. Even in the case of a slight touching, \u201cinsignificant in character,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCan, </em>277 Mass, at 203, the assault and battery is committed on a peace officer while he or she is engaged in performing a vital public function. Because the involvement in even a minor dispute with a civilian distracts from the officer\u2019s duties, the offense creates a public risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">We find persuasive the reasoning of the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Dancy, </em>640 F.3d at 469: \u201cABPO arises only in a narrow set of circumstances: an interaction between an individual and police officers in which the individual knows that he or she confronts an officer and that the officer is discharging his or her law enforcement duties at the time of the confrontation.\u201d A confrontation with an individual who usually carries a lethal weapon, for whom it may be necessary at times to carry out his or her responsibilities with decisive force, is bound to risk physical injury; \u201c[i]n addition to risk to the officers and to the assailant, the confrontation between the officer and the assailant may put bystanders at risk of injury as well.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Moreover, we agree with the <em>Dancy </em>court\u2019s conclusion that \u201cin the ABPO context purposeful conduct is the norm, and . . . the crime of ABPO \u2018nearly always involves the intentional striking of a police officer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469, quoting from <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number><em>States </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>121 F.3d <em>777, </em>780 (1st Cir. 1997). As a result, ABPO fits with <em>Begay\u2019s </em>guidance that crimes falling within the residual clause \u201ctypically involve purposeful, \u2018violent,\u2019 and \u2018aggressive\u2019 conduct.\u201d See <em>Begay </em>v. <em>United States, </em>553 U.S. at 144-145.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the additional elements of ABPO, in the ordinary case, present a sufficient additional risk of serious physical injury to bring the offense within the meaning of a \u201cviolent crime\u201d as defined by the residual clause. We therefore conclude that ABPO qualifies as a Massachusetts ACCA predicate offense as matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">c. <em>The Commonwealth\u2019s proof. </em>Given our interpretation of the Massachusetts ACCA as applied to assault and battery and ABPO, the Commonwealth was required to demonstrate that the defendant\u2019s assault and battery conviction resulted from a harmful or reckless battery, not from offensive battery, in order to show that the assault and battery conviction was a \u201cviolent crime.\u201d The Commonwealth could rely solely on a certified record of conviction to demonstrate that ABPO was \u201cviolent crime\u201d for purposes of the Massachusetts ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Here, the Commonwealth offered only certified records of conviction identifying the defendant\u2019s predicate offenses as assault and battery and ABPO. The Commonwealth presented no extrinsic evidence to indicate whether the convictions were based on harmful, reckless, or offensive battery. Nor did the Commonwealth present evidence of the underlying facts of the defendant\u2019s convictions from these matters. Given our interpretation of the definition of \u201cviolent crime\u201d in G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121, for purposes of the Massachusetts ACCA, the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, viewed under the standard of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass, at 676-677, was insufficient to sustain the armed career criminal conviction based on three predicate offenses because there was insufficient proof that the defendant\u2019s assault and battery conviction was based on harmful or reckless battery.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This evidence, however, was sufficient to establish the defendant\u2019s guilt on the lesser included offense of armed career <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>criminal status based on two predicate offenses, namely, the ABPO convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Therefore, on the count of the indictment for sentence enhancement under G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G(c), we reverse the judgment, set aside the verdict, and remand for resentencing under the armed career criminal enhancement provision based on two predicate \u201cviolent crimes,\u201d G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G(\u00bf). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kastner, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 131, 141 (2010); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montalvo, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 319, 331-332 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">4. <em>Other claims. </em>We briefly address the defendant\u2019s two other claims of error. Neither has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">a. <em>Evidence of improper conviction. </em>The defendant argues that the judge erroneously denied his request to strike his 2003 assault and battery conviction from evidence because it resulted from a guilty plea to a procedurally defective amended complaint. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">The defendant, having never challenged that conviction on direct appeal or pursuant to Mass.R.Crim.P. 30(b), as appearing in 435 Mass. 1501 (2001), may not now collaterally attack this final judgment in these proceedings. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>426 Mass. 657, 662-663 (1998). This judgment, entitled to the presumption of regularity, see <em>id. </em>at 664, was properly admitted evidence. Moreover, the Commonwealth correctly notes that the defendant, through counsel, requested the amendment to the original complaint and pleaded guilty to the assault and battery count of the amended complaint knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">b. <em>Evidentiary ruling. </em>The defendant argues that the judge\u2019s decision to exclude the certified driving record of the driver of the other car, Paez, from evidence impermissibly intruded on his right to cross-examine Paez to demonstrate lack of credibility and bias. The defendant has the burden to demonstrate that the judge abused his discretion in restricting the defendant\u2019s right to cross-examination. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Avalos, </em>454 Mass. 1, 7 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">The defendant has not met this burden. We conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>judge\u2019s ruling that Paez\u2019s driving record was collateral to the issue of self-defense at trial was correct. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sperrazza, </em>379 Mass. 166, 169 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>439 Mass. 47, 55 (2003); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Avalos, </em>454 Mass, at 8-9; Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 611(b) (2011). The driving record was only marginally relevant to Paez\u2019s credibility or bias. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jordan, </em>439 Mass, at 55; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>456 Mass. 198, 202-204 (2010); Mass. G. Evid. \u00a7 403 and \u00a7 611(b) &amp; comment. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">5. <em>Conclusion. </em>On the count of the indictment for armed career criminal enhancement of the sentence based on three predicate violent crimes, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G(c), the judgment is reversed, the verdict is set aside insofar as it finds the defendant had committed three prior violent crimes, and the matter is remanded for resentencing on the lesser included offense of an armed career criminal enhancement based on two predicate violent crimes, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G(Z?). The remaining judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b57-11\">The Commonwealth voluntarily dismissed the attempted larceny charge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b58-10\">As relevant to this prosecution, the Massachusetts ACCA, G.

The provisions for sentence enhancement based on one predicate offense, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 lOG(a), and two predicate offenses, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G(6), also refer, respectively, to a predicate \u201cviolent crime\u201d or \u201cviolent crimes.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Other Federal statutes define predicate offenses using language similar to the \u201chas, as an element, the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\u201d language of the Federal ACCA. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a) (2006) (defining \u201ccrime of violence\u201d); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(33) (2006) (defining \u201cmisdemeanor crime of domestic violence\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b59-8\">The Commonwealth argues that the Legislature\u2019s decision to deviate from the language of the Federal ACCA by using \u201cviolent crime\u201d in place of \u201cviolent felony\u201d alters the analysis of qualifying predicate offenses. Compare 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) with G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10G. We are not persuaded. Like the Massachusetts ACCA, the Federal ACCA is not limited to crimes formally defined as felonies; Congress chose to define \u201cviolent felony\u201d to include State law misdemeanors punishable by more than two years\u2019 imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20)(B) (2006) (defining \u201ccrime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d as used in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924[e][2][B]). See <em>Logan </em>v. <em>United. States, </em>552 U.S. at 27.

We conclude that the Legislature merely intended to use one statutory provision, G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121, to include certain misdemeanors as ACCA predicate offenses where Congress used two separate statutory provisions, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20)(B) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The Commonwealth urges that we consider only Federal authority as it existed at the time of the enactment of the Massachusetts ACCA.

Ct. 2858, 2860 (2011) (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Because we conclude that harmful battery and reckless battery qualify as \u201cviolent crimes\u201d under the force clause, we need not consider whether they qualify under the residual clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Of course, \u201c[o]ne can always hypothesize unusual cases in which\u201d an ordinarily nonviolent crime does pose a serious risk of injury. See <em>James </em>v. <em>United States, </em>550 U.S. at 207. A spitter, for example, could have a lethal infectious disease, thereby committing an offensive battery which does pose a sufficiently serious risk. But this hypothetical scenario does not mean that offensive battery is a categorically violent crime; the proper inquiry focuses on the ordinary case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b69-8\">A conviction of ABPO based on an offensive battery (or an assault based on a threat or offer to commit an offensive battery) would not qualify under the <em>force </em>clause. See part 2.a.ii, <em>supra. </em>Again, the Commonwealth did not argue, at the second trial or in this appeal, that the defendant\u2019s convictions qualified as predicate offenses under the residual clause. See note 13, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b70-8\">SimiIarly, the judge\u2019s instruction that assault and battery is, as matter of law, a \u201cviolent crime\u201d was erroneous and prejudiced the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Flebotte, </em>417 Mass. 348, 353 (1994). We note that <em>Johnson </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number><em>United. States, supra, </em>which instructed our analysis here, was not available to assist the judge and counsel at trial in 2007.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
