Towers at the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination (MCAD).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Like the motion judge, we conclude that Towers alleged claims within the coverage of Norfolk\u2019s policy. However, unlike the motion judge, we conclude that an exclusion relied upon by Norfolk did not relieve Norfolk of its duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\"><em>The policy. </em>During the period from November 9, 2005, to November 9, 2007, the Cleary defendants were named insureds under a special business owners policy issued to them by Norfolk. At issue here is the personal and advertising injury coverage of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">The relevant policy terms are as follows. The insuring agreement for \u201cSECTION II \u2014 LIABILITY\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-9\">\u201cWe will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u2018bodily injury\u2019, \u2018property damage\u2019 or \u2018personal and advertising injury\u2019 to which this insurance applies. We will have the right and duty to defend the insured against any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking those damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-10\">\u201cThis insurance applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-11\">\u201c(2) To \u2018personal and advertising injury\u2019 caused by an offense arising out of your business, but only if the offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>was committed in the \u2018coverage territory\u2019 during the policy period.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-5\">\u201cPersonal and advertising injury\u201d is defined as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-6\">\u201cinjury, including consequential \u2018bodily injury\u2019 arising out of one or more of the following offenses:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-7\">\u201cd. Oral or written publication, in any manner, of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person\u2019s or organization\u2019s goods, products or services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-8\">\u201ce. Oral or written publication, in any manner, of material that violates a person\u2019s right of privacy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-9\">\u201cSuit\u201d is defined as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-10\">\u201ca civil proceeding in which damages because of . . . \u2018personal and advertising injury\u2019 to which this insurance applies are alleged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-11\">Exclusion p provides in relevant part that there will be no coverage for claims of personal and advertising injury:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-12\">\u201c(1) Caused by or at the direction of the insured with the knowledge that the act would violate the rights of another and would inflict \u2018personal and advertising injury\u2019; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b88-13\">\u201c(2) Arising out of oral or written publication of material, if done by or at the direction of the insured with knowledge of its falsity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-14\"><em>Towers\u2019s original complaint. </em>On December 31, 2007, Towers, who had been employed as a recruiter by Cleary Consultants, Inc., during the period May 16, 2006, to March 9, 2007, filed a charge of discrimination at the MCAD, naming the Cleary defendants and Towers\u2019s immediate supervisor, Jonah D. Adelman, as respondents. In pertinent part, the allegations of the Towers complaint may be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b88-15\">From the start of and throughout her employment, Adelman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>made sexually explicit, inappropriate, and unwelcome comments to Towers, over her protestations. Adelman inquired about her divorce and expressed amazement that her ex-husband would have let \u201csuch a beautiful girl\u201d go. Adelman told her about his sex life and asked about hers; and he bmshed off her expressed desire not to discuss her personal life with him by saying that if she stayed close to him, he would make sure she was a success and would be able to take care of her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">During coffee breaks that Adelman insisted Towers take with him outside the office, he asked her whether she kept \u201cgoing down\u201d on her husband at the end of her marriage, stating that it was something that he could not live without. In July, 2006, having become aware that Towers was in a relationship, Adelman stated, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you have a boyfriend. I hope you aren\u2019t f***ing this guy. That wouldn\u2019t be good for your kids.\u201d Thereafter, on numerous occasions, Adelman would refer to the fact that Towers\u2019s boyfriend was a nurse and \u201cattempt to embarrass\u201d Towers by stating things like, \u201cHow does a male nurse get to have that?\u201d \u201cWhy would you be with a fag?\u201d and \u201cYou must be crazy after the divorce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Towers and at least one other employee observed Adelman viewing pornography on his work computer. Starting in August, 2006, Adelman required Towers to check his electronic mail messages (e-mail) when he was absent from the office. Because the company\u2019s e-mail program was configured to display the content of the message even before it was opened, checking Adelman\u2019s e-mail resulted in Towers being exposed to sexually explicit material, including Adelman\u2019s solicitation of a prostitute and a picture of a penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Towers complained to Cleary about Adelman\u2019s behavior. Towers\u2019s first complaint was made after one week or so of employment, during the final week of May, 2006. Towers told Cleary that Adelman made her feel uncomfortable and described the inappropriate comments made by him. Cleary\u2019s response was to laugh and to instmct Towers to ignore Adelman\u2019s behavior, stating that he made Cleary money, and that was why she kept him. She also stated that Towers was \u201ca very attractive girl and, in this business, [she] should use that to [her] advantage.\u201d Later, in June, 2006, Towers asked if she could work from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>home in order \u201cto avoid the discomfort caused by [Adelman\u2019s] inappropriate conduct.\u201d Cleary denied her request, saying in so many words, \u201cJonah may be rough around the edges, but he\u2019s harmless. He will teach you a lot. Just try to ignore the other stuff.\u201d When Towers again complained in September, 2006 \u2014 this time stating that she was being exposed to pornographic material \u2014 Cleary downplayed Adelman\u2019s conduct as simply being \u201cimmature\u201d and emphasized his skills as a recruiter.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">During a four-day period in the beginning of March, 2007, when her daughter was ill, Towers worked at home, communicating with Adelman periodically by telephone. After a conversation in which he told her that she would need to repay at least one commission on placements that had fallen through, Towers complained to Adelman that his inappropriate conduct had caused her significant distress. Adelman then informed her that it was apparent that she could not give one hundred percent to the job because she was a single parent, and told her not to bother coming back. Towers considered herself terminated and did not return to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Towers further alleged that Adelman\u2019s inappropriate conduct was unwelcome, offensive, severe, and pervasive to the point that it created an abusive work environment, and that it caused her financial loss and \u201csignificant emotional distress, including humiliation and loss of self-esteem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\"><em>Claim for coverage and Norfolk\u2019s response. </em>Norfolk was notified of the Towers case in March, 2008. In a letter dated May 30, 2008, Norfolk disclaimed coverage, stating that none of the damages alleged by Towers constituted \u201cbodily injury,\u201d \u201cproperty damage,\u201d or \u201cpersonal and advertising injury,\u201d and that even if there were any bodily injury, an exclusion for bodily injury to an employee would apply. On these grounds, Norfolk declined to defend and to indemnify the Cleary defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">Counsel for the Cleary defendants immediately requested that Norfolk revisit its position, contending that the Towers complaint included allegations of invasion of privacy, a designated offense included in the personal and advertising injury coverage, which was not subject to the employee exclusion on which Norfolk relied. Counsel also directed Norfolk to a rebuttal filed by Towers at the MCAD, which included a supporting affidavit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>from a former coworker of Towers, David Schlemann. The Schlemann affidavit, which counsel forwarded to Norfolk, averred, among other things, that Schlemann had witnessed Adelman harassing Towers \u201con many occasions.\u201d Schlemann cited \u201c[ejxamples of such harassment,\u201d including \u201copenly commenting on [Towers\u2019s] appearance\u201d and \u201cinquiring to Ms. Towers about her personal life.\u201d Schlemann also averred that he witnessed Adelman make inappropriate and offensive comments about Towers, including, \u201cShe\u2019s f***ing hot ... I\u2019d like to bang her,\u201d or words to that effect. In addition, Schlemann averred that Towers \u201cexpressed her embarrassment to [Schlemann] in relation to Mr. Adelman\u2019s comments on several occasions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">After receiving the Schlemann affidavit, Norfolk referred the matter to outside coverage counsel. In a letter dated July 16, 2008, Norfolk\u2019s coverage counsel indicated to counsel for the Cleary defendants that Norfolk again took the position that the policy did not cover the Towers claims. According to Norfolk, the complaint stated a claim for discrimination and could not reasonably be construed to \u201cadumbrate\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a claim for invasion of privacy because it contained no allegation that Adelman had published his offensive comments about Towers to others, as required under the terms of the personal and advertising injury coverage of the policy. Norfolk acknowledged that the Schlemann affidavit averred that Schlemann had been present when Adelman made offensive comments to Towers; however, Norfolk took the position that the comments cited by Schlemann as having been heard by him did not support a claim for invasion of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Norfolk nevertheless agreed to provide a defense to the Cleary defendants under a reservation of rights, and assigned the defense to a firm of Norfolk\u2019s choice. The Cleary defendants responded by insisting upon exercising their right to select independent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>counsel at Norfolk\u2019s expense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Norfolk acquiesced, but declined to pay counsel\u2019s full hourly rate of $385. Instead, after pointing out that the Cleary defendants had another potentially applicable insurance policy issued by a different insurer that also was defending under a reservation of rights, Norfolk stated that it would pay one-half of the legal fees incurred by the Cleary defendants at an hourly rate of $150, without prejudice to either party seeking a judicial determination whether additional payment was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">On October 31, 2008, Norfolk filed the instant declaratory judgment action, naming the Cleary defendants, Adelman, and Towers as defendants.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After receiving the complaint, the Cleary defendants sent Norfolk a demand letter asserting that Norfolk had failed to satisfy its contractual and statutory obligations and, in answering the complaint, asserted counterclaims for breach of contract and violations of G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 176D.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\"><em>Towers\u2019s amended complaint. </em>On March 13, 2009, Towers filed an amended complaint at the MCAD. The amended complaint was identical to the original complaint except that it contained a few additional allegations: Adelman \u201cspeculated about [her] sex life, which was witnessed and overheard by [her] co-workers\u201d; \u201cAdelman\u2019s inappropriate conduct deeply embarrassed [her]\u201d; Adelman \u201cinvaded [her] right to privacy and slandered [her] reputation by circulating his humiliating, vulgar, false, and demeaning statements among co-workers\u201d; and Adelman\u2019s conduct caused and continues to cause her \u201csignificant emotional distress, including humiliation, embarrassment, loss of privacy, damage to [her] reputation, and loss of self-esteem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\"><em>Summary judgment decision. </em>On cross motions for summary judgment, the judge allowed Norfolk\u2019s motion and denied that of the Cleary defendants. The judge concluded that the facts alleged by Towers were sufficient to put Norfolk on notice that she was claiming damages for invasion of privacy and defama<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>tian as described in the personal and advertising injury coverage of the policy. However, the judge also concluded that the actions of the Cleary defendants fell within two sections of exclusion p because Towers\u2019s claims were for injury \u201ccaused by or at the direction of the insured with the knowledge that the act would violate the rights of another and would inflict \u2018personal and advertising injury,\u2019 \u201d and injury \u201carising out of oral or written publication of material, if done by or at the direction of the insured with knowledge of its falsity.\u201d The judge reasoned that these exclusionary provisions came into play because Cleary had been informed about Adelman\u2019s conduct and comments, and a reasonable person in her position would have known that Adelman was violating Towers\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\"><em>Discussion, </em>a. <em>Duty to defend. </em>We review the judge\u2019s summary judgment rulings de nova, applying the well-established standard for determining an insurer\u2019s duty to defend. See note 3, <em>supra. </em>See also <em>Billings </em>v. <em>Commerce Ins. Co., </em>458 Mass. 194, 200-201 (2010), and cases cited. Placed in terms of the liability coverage insuring agreement and the definition of \u201cpersonal and advertising injury,\u201d the question of Norfolk\u2019s duty to defend requires us to consider whether the Towers complaint states or roughly sketches a claim for \u201cdamages because of\u201d an \u201cinjury . . . arising out of\u201d either \u201coral or written publication, in any manner, of material that slanders\u201d Towers, or \u201coral or written publication, in any manner, of material that violates [her] right of privacy.\u201d If so, we then must consider whether exclusion p applies to negate coverage. Before focusing our attention on these inquiries, however, we make a few preliminary comments addressed to the general thrust of Norfolk\u2019s position that the Towers action is simply a discrimination claim, and not within the intended scope of the policy in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">First, it makes no difference to the analysis of Norfolk\u2019s duty to defend that Towers\u2019s allegations were made in a discrimination charge brought at the MCAD. Under the terms of the policy, Norfolk had the \u201cright and duty to defend the insured against any \u2018suit\u2019 seeking . . . damages [because of, e.g.,] personal and advertising injury.\u201d The term \u201csuit\u201d is broadly defined as \u201ca civil proceeding in which damages because [of, e.g.,] \u2018personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>and advertising injury\u2019 to which this insurance applies are alleged.\u201d In other words, the policy does not limit its coverage to cases filed in court, and Norfolk does not so argue.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">Second, it makes no difference to the analysis that discrimination in the form of sexual harassment is the essential legal theory underpinning the Towers complaint. The legal theory of the case is not determinative of the duty to defend. See <em>id. </em>at 201. What matters is whether the allegations made by Towers are reasonably susceptible of the interpretation that they state or roughly sketch a claim for damages because of injury <em>arising out of </em>one or more of the offenses specified as within the personal and advertising injury coverage, i.e., \u201c[ojral or written publication, in any manner, of material that slanders or libels a person or organization or disparages a person\u2019s or organization\u2019s goods, products or services\u201d; or \u201c[ojral or written publication, in any manner, of material that violates a person\u2019s right of privacy.\u201d It is of no significance that other factors may have contributed to those damages apart from conduct covered by the policy. The phrase \u201carising out of\u201d must be read expansively and has a broad meaning analogous to \u201cbut for\u201d causation. See <em>American Home Assur. Co. </em>v. <em>First Specialty Ins. Corp., </em>73 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 5 (2008), citing <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Monticello Ins. Co., </em>430 Mass. 454, 457 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Third, it makes no difference to the analysis that the MCAD does not have jurisdiction to adjudicate either a common-law claim of slander or a common-law or statutory claim of invasion of privacy. Reasonably understood, neither the original nor the amended complaint seeks such an adjudication; rather, each seeks damages for injuries caused by behavior in the nature of slander and invasion of privacy that were part of a campaign of sexual harassment. Furthermore, the alleged injuries \u2014 humiliation, embarrassment, loss of privacy, damage to reputation, and loss of self-esteem \u2014 are not alien to MCAD proceedings. They are the types of injuries that are compensable in that forum through the medium of an award for emotional distress. See, e.g., <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination </em>v. <em>Franzaroli, </em>357 Mass. 112, 115-116 (1970); <em>College-Town, Div. of Interco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>400 Mass. 156, 162 &amp; 169 (1987); <em>Stonehill College </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number><em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>441 Mass. 549, 573-574 (2004). In any event, even if the Towers complaint could be viewed as a misguided effort to adjudicate claims of slander and invasion of privacy in an improper forum, that would not affect Norfolk\u2019s duty to defend. An insurer\u2019s obligation to defend is not limited to valid claims; it extends even to claims potentially dismissible for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. See generally Windt, Insurance Claims &amp; Disputes \u00a7 4:1 (5th ed. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Finally, we note that unlike other commercial liability insurance policies, this policy made no attempt to exclude personal and advertising injury associated with discrimination against or harassment of an employee. See, e.g., <em>New England Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>40 Mass. App. Ct. 722, 723 (1996) (applying exclusion for personal injury arising out of unlawful discrimination). See also <em>Parish of Christ Church </em>v. <em>Church Ins. Co., </em>166 F.3d 419, 421 (1st Cir. 1999) (applying exclusion for personal injury sustained as result of offense directly or indirectly related to employment of injured person by named insured); <em>Peterborough Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Great Am. Ins. Co., </em>397 F. Supp. 2d 230, 239-240 (D. Mass. 2005) (discussing exclusion for employment-related acts and omissions, but not applying it to claim by former employee for malicious prosecution); <em>Erie Ins. Property &amp; Cas. Co. </em>v. <em>Edmond, </em>785 F. Supp. 2d 561, 572-573 (N.D. W.Va. 2011) (discussing exclusion for employment-related practices, policies, acts, or omissions including discrimination and harassment).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">We turn now to the nub of the matter, beginning with whether the conduct alleged to have injured Towers constitutes \u201c[ojral or written publication, in any manner, of material that slander [ed]\u201d Towers, or \u201c[o]rai or written publication, in any manner, of material that violate[d] [her] right of privacy.\u201d Obviously, the amended complaint explicitly alleges that Adelman \u201cinvaded [Towers\u2019s] right to privacy and slandered [her] reputation by circulating his humiliating, vulgar, false, and demeaning statements among co-workers.\u201d However, especially because these allegations were added only after the declaratory judgment complaint was filed, Norfolk urges us to disregard the references to invasion of privacy and slander as simply an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>attempt to \u201cre-brand\u201d Towers\u2019s claim to invoke coverage where it otherwise would not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">We do not disagree that the underlying factual allegations of a complaint are a better gouge for assessing potential coverage than conclusory theoretical labels squarely at odds with those facts. See <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Monticello Ins. Co., </em>430 Mass, at 458, citing <em>First Wyo. Bank </em>v. <em>Continental Ins. Co., </em>860 P.2d 1094, 1099 (Wyo. 1993). See also <em>Terrio </em>v. <em>McDonough, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 163, 168-169 (1983). Here, however, the labels are not at odds with Towers\u2019s factual allegations. Indeed, even Towers\u2019s original complaint, especially when considered in light of the averments contained in the Schlemann affidavit,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> alleged facts consistent with and sufficient to state or roughly sketch a claim for damages arising out of conduct constituting \u201c[o]rai . . . publication, in any manner, of material that violate[d] [Towers\u2019s] right of privacy.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">In a previous case concerning the scope of liability insurance providing coverage for the violation of an individual\u2019s right to privacy, we looked to the Massachusetts invasion of privacy statute, G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1B, for guidance. See <em>Transamerica Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>KMS Patriots, L.P., </em>52 Mass. App. Ct. 189, 195-196 (2001). We observed that in order to establish invasion of privacy under the statute, a person must allege an unreasonable, substantial, and serious interference with his or her privacy, <em>id. </em>at 196. In <em>Transamerica, id. </em>at 195, the allegations pertaining to invasion of privacy were that during the tort plaintiff\u2019s initial employment interview, her potential supervisor asked her whether she was married, whether she had a boyfriend, how long she had dated, and whether her boyfriend was going to marry her. There also were allegations that, during her employment, her supervisor \u201cfrequently took an interest in the status of her relationship with [her] boyfriend, including asking her if her boyfriend was going to marry her.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Because the complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>did not allege that the comments were an unreasonable, substantial, or serious interference with the tort plaintiff\u2019s privacy, and because there was nothing in the comments that reasonably could be susceptible of such an interpretation, we held that the insurer\u2019s duty to defend was not triggered. <em>Id. </em>at 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Here, however, the comments alleged in the Towers complaint are palpably different, as they are of an overtly sexual nature. From the inception of the case, Towers alleged that Adelman repeatedly made offensive sexual comments about her appearance and her relationships. He questioned her about her sex life during her marriage and after her divorce, and ridiculed her choice of boyfriend by using an offensive, derogatory term to question the boyfriend\u2019s sexuality and Towers\u2019s attraction to him. These allegations should have been understood by Norfolk as raising a claim for invasion of privacy. See <em>Melnychenko </em>v. <em>84 Lumber Co., </em>424 Mass. 285, 290-291 (1997) (offensive sexual comments publicly made by supervisor about employee and his girlfriend supported finding of violation of employee\u2019s right of privacy under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1B).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">We reject any suggestion that, for the most part, Adelman\u2019s comments were not published to others, as required for coverage to attach, and that any remaining comments were too benign to form a basis for a claim of invasion of privacy. The amended complaint specifically alleges that Adelman\u2019s speculations about Towers\u2019s sex life were witnessed and overheard by her co workers, and that he circulated humiliating, vulgar, false, and demeaning statements among her co workers. Indeed, even prior to amendment, Towers\u2019s allegations created the distinct possibility that her claims involved <em>public </em>humiliation, and any conceivable doubt on that score soon was dispelled by the Schlemann affidavit. Schlemann averred that he had witnessed Adelman harassing Towers \u201con many occasions,\u201d and then gave \u201c[e]xamples,\u201d which, by definition, should have been understood by Norfolk to be illustrative and not exclusive. Schlemann also stated that he had witnessed Adelman make inappropriate and offensive comments about Towers, including, \u201cShe\u2019s f***ing hot ... I\u2019d like to bang her,\u201d or words to that effect. By the time of the Schlemann affidavit, if not earlier, Norfolk was on notice that the Towers claims concerned crude, sexually-charged comments published to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Having determined that the Towers complaint alleges damages because of injury arising out of invasion of the right of privacy as specified in the personal and advertising injury coverage, we next consider the validity of Norfolk\u2019s contention that exclusion p eliminates coverage for Cleary and, by imputation, for Cleary Consultants, Inc. We view this question in light of well-settled principles. It is the insurer who bears the burden of proving the applicability of an exclusion. See, e.g., <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Talhouni, </em>413 Mass. 781, 785 (1992). In order for an exclusion to negate an insurer\u2019s duty to defend ab initia, the facts alleged in the third-party complaint must establish that the exclusion applies to all potential liability as matter of law. See <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cas. Co., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 316, 321-323 (1983) (insurer had duty to defend where factual allegations were \u201cample enough to harbor\u201d ground for liability falling outside exclusion). If the claimant\u2019s factual allegations are susceptible of an interpretation that leaves room for coverage, or are insufficiently developed, the insurer must defend unless and until it \u201cdemonstrates with conclusive effect on the third party [i.e., the claimant] that as matter of fact \u2014 as distinguished from the appearances of the complaint and policy \u2014 the third party cannot establish a claim within the insurance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Turning to exclusion p, we focus upon subpart (1), which removes from coverage \u201cpersonal and advertising injury\u201d (in this case, injury arising out of publication of material that violated Towers\u2019s right of privacy) that is \u201c[c]aused by or at the direction of the insured with the knowledge that the act would violate the rights of another and would inflict \u2018personal and advertising injury.\u2019 \u201d Because of its reference to <em>\u201cthe </em>insured,\u201d the exclusion must be applied individually to each insured for whom coverage is sought, looking at both the causation and knowledge components of the exclusion in relation to that insured.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See Windt, Insurance Claims &amp; Disputes \u00a7 11:8 &amp; n.5 (5th ed. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Towers alleges that she notified Cleary on three different occasions of offensive behavior by Adelman: towards the end of May, 2006, after Towers had been employed for one week or so and already had been subjected to inappropriate comments; in June, 2006, when she asked if she could work from home in order to avoid the \u201cdiscomfort\u201d caused by Adelman\u2019s conduct; and in September, 2006, when she told Cleary that she (Towers) was being exposed to pornographic material. Towers also alleges, in substance, that Cleary consistently made light of her complaints and spoke of Adelman\u2019s value to the company and skill as a recruiter. Towers does not allege that Cleary, personally, made or published any of the statements that invaded Towers\u2019s right of privacy; nor does she allege that Cleary directed them to be made. Thus, to the extent that the complaint may be read as alleging that Cleary \u201ccaused\u201d Towers\u2019s injuries, it is on the basis of Cleary\u2019s failure to protect Towers from Adelman\u2019s behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">We will assume, without deciding, that a failure of this nature can supply the causal connection required by the exclusion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Even so, however, the exclusion does not relieve Norfolk of its duty to defend. As other courts have concluded, this exclusion must be understood as applying only to the intentional and knowing infliction of injury, and not to injury resulting from reckless or negligent behavior. See, e.g., <em>Creative Hospitality Ventures, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States Liab. Ins. Co., </em>655 F. Supp. 2d 1316, 1337-1338 (S.D. Fla. 2009); <em>Valley Forge Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Swiderski Electronics, Inc., </em>359 Ill. App. 3d 872, 888 (2005); <em>Kubit </em>v. <em>MAG Mut. Ins. Co., </em>708 S.E.2d 138, 149-150 (N.C. App. 2011). Here, Towers\u2019s allegations concerning Cleary fall well within the range of reckless misconduct. See <em>Worcester Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Fells Acres Day Sch., Inc., </em>408 Mass. 393, 411 (1990) (knowledge of abusive activities of others, coupled with failure to protect, constitutes reckless, not intentional conduct). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>Because Towers\u2019s allegations leave it possible for Cleary to be found liable based on something less than intentional and knowing infliction of injury upon Towers, the exclusion does not negate Norfolk\u2019s duty to defend Cleary.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Finally, even if we were to accept Norfolk\u2019s position that, on the facts alleged by Towers, Cleary should be charged with knowing to a substantial certainty that her failure to police Adelman was resulting in the violation of Towers\u2019s rights and the invasion of her privacy, Norfolk still would have a duty to defend Cleary Consultants, Inc. \u201cWe disregard the corporate fiction and impute to the corporation the intentions of its principals only in \u2018rare particular situations in order to prevent gross inequity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 407-408 (citation omitted). In the insurance context, \u201c[t]he inquiry is factually based, and may have to be conducted as to each injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 409. Considerations include whether the wrongful acts of the corporate principal were performed on behalf of the corporation such that the corporation may be viewed as financially implicated in the activity, or whether the wrongful acts were so routine as to constitute a general practice or policy of the corporation. <em>Id. </em>at 408-409.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The allegations of the Towers complaint are insufficient to establish as matter of law that Cleary\u2019s state of mind should be attributed to Cleary Consultants, Inc. See <em>ibid, </em>(state of mind of officers and shareholders who intentionally committed inherently injurious acts would not be imputed to corporation absent fully developed record). Accordingly, even if the exclusion were applicable to Cleary, it would not negate Norfolk\u2019s duty to defend Cleary Consultants, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">b. <em>Cleary defendants\u2019 counterclaims. </em>The Cleary defendants claim that they are entitled to summary judgment on their counterclaims. We disagree. Their counterclaim for breach of contract for failure to pay reasonable defense costs requires further fact finding, see <em>Northern Security Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>R.H. Realty Trust, </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. 691, 694-695 (2011), and their counterclaims under G. L. c. 93A and G. L. c. 176D raise factual questions, such as whether Norfolk acted in good faith in advancing its coverage positions, which cannot be decided as matter of law on the summary judgment record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number><em>Conclusion. </em>Norfolk\u2019s motion for summary judgment should not have been allowed. The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded for entry of a new judgment declaring that Norfolk had a duty to defend the Cleary defendants in the Towers case, and for further proceedings with respect to the Cleary defendants\u2019 counterclaims.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b87-12\">The judgment also declared that Norfolk had no duty to indemnify the Cleary defendants. As a result of later developments, the duty to indemnify is not involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Norfoik\u2019s use of the word \u201cadumbrate\u201d is consistent with the <em>Sterilite </em>standard for determining an insurer\u2019s duty to defend: \u201c[I]f the allegations of the complaint [against the insured] are \u2018reasonably susceptible\u2019 of an interpretation that they state or adumbrate a claim covered by the policy terms, the insurer must undertake the defense.\u201d <em>Sterilite Corp. </em>v. <em>Continental Cos. Co., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 316, 318 (1983). Recently, the Supreme Judicial Court has rephrased the standard by replacing \u201cadumbrate\u201d with the equivalent, but more commonly understood words, \u201croughly sketch.\u201d <em>Billings </em>v. <em>Commerce Ins. Co., </em>458 Mass. 194, 200 n.6 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b92-8\">See <em>Magoun </em>v. <em>Liberty Mut. Ins.

App. Ct. 691, 694-695 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b92-9\">In its complaint, Norfolk relied for the first time upon exclusion p as an alternative ground for denying coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b96-7\">\u201cThe duty to defend is determined based on the facts alleged in the complaint, and on facts known or readily knowable by the insurer that may aid in its interpretation of the allegations in the complaint.\u201d <em>Billings </em>v. <em>Commerce Ins. Co., </em>458 Mass, at 200.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b96-8\">In view of this conclusion, we need not consider whether Towers\u2019s factual allegations also suffice to fall within the personal and advertising injury coverage for slander.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Because we have not reached the question of coverage for slander, we do not comment upon subpart (2) of the exclusion, which eliminates coverage for personal and advertising injury \u201c[ajrising out of oral or written publication of material, if done by or at the direction of the insured with knowledge of its falsity.\u201d In any event, subpart (2) cannot apply here because there are no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>allegations that any publication of comments concerning Towers was \u201cdone by or at the direction\u201d of Cleary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b99-8\">There are no Massachusetts cases construing this exclusion, and we are unaware of any case decided elsewhere where the exclusion has been applied to an insured who was not a participant in the offense but who is alleged to have brought about the claimant\u2019s injury by failing to prevent or stop the actions of someone else.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The Cleary defendants are entitled to an award of reasonable appellate attorney\u2019s fees to the extent those fees related to the duty to defend issue. See <em>Rubenstein </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co. of America, </em>429 Mass. 355, 358 (1999); <em>Hanover Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Golden, </em>51 Mass. App. Ct. 465, 468 (2001), <em>S.C., </em>436 Mass. 584 (2002). In accordance with the procedure set forth in <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>441 Mass. 9, 10-11 (2004), the Cleary defendants may file an application for such fees and costs, together with supporting materials, within fourteen days of the date of the rescript. Norfolk will have fourteen days thereafter to respond.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
