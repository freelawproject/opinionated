On MHD\u2019s complaints to vacate the arbitrators\u2019 awards in the Superior Court and the cross motions of the Massachusetts Organization of State Engineers and Scientists (MOSES) for judgments on the pleadings and to confirm the awards, a judge vacated both awards, ruling that the arbitrators had exceeded their authority by ignoring provisions in the agreement that contained deadlines for filing grievances. MOSES, the exclusive bargaining agent for MHD engineers, appeals, claiming that the judge\u2019s rulings invaded an area reserved for the arbitrators. We agree and reverse the Superior Court judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><em>Background. </em>Several provisions of the collective bargaining agreement lie at the heart of the present controversy, so our narrative begins there. Under Section 16.2, MOSES members who performed \u201cout-of-title\u201d work, i.e., work the agreement assigned to employees employed at a higher pay grade, were entitled to compensation at the higher level.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Disputes over entitlement to higher compensation, like \u201cany dispute concerning the application or interpretation of the terms of\u201d the agreement, were subject to a four-step grievance procedure. Step one involved an immediate supervisor; step two, an agency head designated by MHD; step three, the Commonwealth\u2019s Human Resources Department (HRD); and step four, arbitration. Each step had deadlines for filing the grievance or the appeal, and the first three had deadlines for decisions. Failure to render a decision by the applicable deadline gave the grievant or MOSES the right to move to the next step.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The steps and deadlines just described could be \u201cwaived by mutual agreement of the parties in writing.\u201d Finally,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">\u201c[t]he arbitrator [had] no power to add to, subtract from, or modify any provision of [the] Agreement or to issue any decision or award inconsistent with applicable law. The decision or award of the arbitrator [was] final and binding in accordance with [G. L. c.] 150C.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">The central issues in this case involve application of those provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">Insofar as Paul Kelly is concerned, the provisions came into play in the following fashion. MHD hired Kelly in 1988 as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Civil Engineer I (CE-I). In April, 1998, he was promoted to CE-II and, in April, 2005, to CE-III, the highest civil engineer level. In October, 1995, however, MOSES filed a grievance on Kelly\u2019s behalf alleging that he \u201cha[d] been performing the duties of Civil Engineer III since April 27, 1991 while being compensated as a Civil Engineer I in violation of Article 16.\u201d As a remedy, MOSES sought payment to Kelly of the difference between the amount he had been paid and the amount he would have been paid had he been compensated at the higher levels applicable to work he had actually performed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">At steps one and two, MHD denied the grievance. MOSES filed a third-step appeal with HRD on February 18, 1997. At that point, everything stopped for approximately nine years until HRD filed a summary denial of the grievance on June 15, 2006. In response, MOSES claimed arbitration. Hearings began on January 23, 2007, on the following agreed-upon issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">\u201cDid the Massachusetts Highway Department violate Article 16 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement with regard to Paul Kelly? If so, what shall be the remedy?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">During arbitration, MOSES argued, as it had throughout the grievance process, that Kelly\u2019s grievance was \u201cof a continuing nature,\u201d and presented evidence regarding multiple instances of Kelly\u2019s out-of-title work during the fourteen years from April, 1991, through April, 2005. In response, MHD claimed for the first time since the process began that there was no continuing grievance. Instead, MHD asserted, the deadlines for filing grievances contained in the agreement meant that Kelly\u2019s grievance was restricted to the period from the time the grievance was filed until the time the arbitrator found that Kelly first returned to performing work within his pay grade. At that point, MHD\u2019s argument continued, the grievance clock was reset and claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>arising out of any further out-of-title work had to be the subject of a separate grievance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The arbitrator rejected some of Kelly\u2019s out-of-title claims but did find that he worked in a higher classification on numerous occasions during the period between 1991 and 2005. The arbitrator also rejected MHD\u2019s claim that the grievance period ended as soon as Kelly resumed performance of work the agreement assigned to employees at his pay level. As a result, the arbitrator awarded Kelly compensation at the higher levels for each of the occasions on which he worked out of grade, less the amount he had actually been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">MED moved to vacate the award in the Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11, arguing that the arbitrator\u2019s award exceeded his authority because it ignored the agreement\u2019s deadline for filing separate grievances and appeals. MOSES moved to confirm the award. After a hearing, a Superior Court judge agreed with MED and ruled that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by finding that \u201cthe separate and distinct filing of a grievance for each period of time was not necessary.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge vacated the arbitrator\u2019s award except for the period between October 2, 1995, and April 15, 1997, during which MED conceded that Kelly had been working out-of-title and for which his grievance was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The case involving Winters followed a similar path. Be, too, began employment as a CE-I. MOSES filed a grievance on his behalf on September 12, 1997, alleging that he had been working as a CE-II since August, 1995.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Again MOSES lost at the first two steps and appealed to ERD on September 23, 1998. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>HRD never responded. On March 7, 2006, eight years after taking the appeal to HRD, MOSES filed for arbitration. Arbitration proceedings commenced on June 20, 2006, after the parties agreed that the arbitrator would answer the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-4\">\u201cDid the Grievant work out of classification for the grievance period May 12, 1997 to April 2, 2004? If so, what shall be the remedy?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">The arbitrator found that Winters \u201cworked out of classification for the periods April 16 to August 15, 2001 and April 29, 2002 to April 2, 2004,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and ordered MHD to pay him accordingly.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> At that point, MHD moved to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award in the Superior Court, claiming, as it had during the arbitration proceedings, that the arbitrator had ignored filing deadlines the agreement contained. In the Superior Court, the case came before the same judge who decided Kelly\u2019s case. He ruled that, in making the award to Winters, the arbitrator impermissibly \u201cmodified the plain language\u201d of the agreement insofar as filing deadlines were concerned and, in the process, \u201cwent beyond what [G. L. c.] 150C and Article 23A ever contemplated, namely the filing of a grievance some three and one-half years before a violation which is the subject of the grievance.\u201d Accordingly, the judge vacated the award in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>In their briefs and arguments, the parties have focused, as they did during the arbitration proceedings and in Superior Court, on the contractual language governing deadlines for filing grievances and on whether the arbitrators\u2019 application of that language was a permissible exercise of their extensive powers. Those powers are broad indeed. \u201cWhen parties agree to arbitrate a dispute, courts accord their election great weight. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>The strong public policy favoring arbitration requires us to uphold an arbitrator\u2019s decision even where it is wrong on the facts or the law, and whether it is wise or foolish, clear or ambiguous.\u201d <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Assn., </em>443 Mass. 813, 818 (2005). See <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Salaried Employees of N. Am., Local 9158, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 785, 788 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Though broad, the powers are not boundless. An award may be vacated if the arbitrator \u201cexceeds his authority by granting relief beyond the scope of the agreement, ... by awarding relief beyond that to which the parties bound themselves, . . . or by awarding relief prohibited by law.\u201d <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass. 1006, 1007 (1990). See G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11(a)(3). However, as long as the award does not cross those boundaries and is not the product of the arbitrator\u2019s own \u201cidiosyncratic brand of workplace justice,\u201d the award will be upheld for, in the end, it is \u201cthe arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the bargained-for language that the [parties] . . . agreed to accept, not the interpretation by a court acting upon a subsequent application under G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11.\u201d <em>Sheriff of Suffolk County </em>v. <em>AFSCME Council 93, Local 419, </em>68 Mass. App. Ct. 222, 226-227 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">In pressing their different views of how the underlying principles apply to these appeals, the parties have downplayed a consideration we think is entitled to greater emphasis. In evaluating the propriety of an arbitrator\u2019s award, the court is required to consider not only the language of the agreement but also the question the parties tendered to the arbitrator for resolution, for that question plays a critical role in determining the scope of the arbitrator\u2019s authority. See <em>Reading </em>v. <em>Reading Patrolmen\u2019s Assn., Local 191, </em>50 Mass. App. Ct. 468, 470 (2000), quoting from <em>School Comm. of Waltham </em>v. <em>Waltham Educators Assn., </em>398 Mass. 703, 705-706 (1986) (\u201cAbsent fraud, illegality in the award, or procedural defect ... a \u2018court\u2019s inquiry is confined to the question whether the arbitrator exceeded the scope of [his] reference or awarded relief in excess of [his] authority\u2019 \u201d); <em>Duxbury </em>v. <em>Rossi, </em>69 Mass. App. Ct. 59, 62 (2007) (\u201cIn the present case, ... the parties clearly authorized the arbitrator to rule on whether the town \u2018properly [denied a police officer] . . . benefits,\u2019 and to determine a remedy in the event he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>concluded that such benefits had been unlawfully withheld. The applicable [collective bargaining agreement] provided for arbitration of a dispute of this nature, and the parties submitted the question to the arbitrator for resolution\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Here, the questions submitted to the arbitrators were clear and unencumbered. In Kelly\u2019s case, the arbitrator was asked to determine whether the \u201cMassachusetts Highway Department violate[d] Article 16 of the Collective Bargaining Agreement with regard to Paul Kelly?\u201d With respect to Winters, the question was \u201c[d]id the Grievant work out of classification for the grievance period May 12, 1997 to April 2, 2004?\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Both questions involved \u201cdispute[s] concerning the application or interpretation of the terms of\u201d the agreement and, thus, fell squarely within the scope of the agreement\u2019s grievance provisions. Beyond the grievance period specified in the question presented in Winters\u2019s case, neither submission compartmentalized work periods or mentioned filing deadlines. On the contrary, the broad form the parties gave those questions did not address issues about time limits or other procedural constraints and focused instead on the merits of the parties\u2019 pay disputes.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Moreover, those questions were consistent with the form the disputes had taken from the outset. From the beginning, both grievances were open-ended. Kelly alleged that he had been \u201cperforming the duties of Civil Engineer III since April 27, 1991 while being compensated as a Civil Engineer I in violation of Article 16.\u201d As a remedy, he sought \u201cthe difference in salary between Civil Engineer I and Civil Engineer III for the period commencing April 27, 1991 and ending upon the resumption of the duties of a Civil Engineer I. All lesser included remedies are incorporated herein.\u201d Winters\u2019s initial grievance and his appeals took a similar open-ended form. Indeed, even if</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>At the very least, then, those submissions, when considered in the context in which the arbitration proceedings began, provided a foundation for the arbitrators to conclude, as they did, that otherwise applicable time limits did not prevent them from reaching the merits of the continuing violation claims Kelly and Winters tendered. The demands for arbitration came years after the initial grievances were filed. From the very beginning, the disputes focused on continuing, or at least repeated, practices. Not once during all of the years before arbitration that grievances were pending had the MED asserted or suggested that the disputes were not continuing in nature. \u201cQuestions concerning the procedural prerequisites to arbitration do not arise in a vacuum,\u201d <em>Massachusetts Hy. Dept. </em>v. <em>Perini Corp., </em>444 Mass. 366, 377 (2005), quoting from <em>John Wiley &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>376 U.S. 543, 556-557 (1964), and it is the arbitrator\u2019s function to decide those questions. <em>Id. </em>at 375-376. Nothing in the contract or in any applicable statute prohibited the parties from submitting to arbitration a question that took account of events that had occurred during the many years since the initial grievances were filed. Given the context in which the disputes reached them and the scope of the arbitration on which the parties agreed, the arbitrators\u2019 awards did not exceed their powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The judgments of the Superior Court are vacated, and the cases are remanded to that court for entry of new judgments confirming the arbitrators\u2019 awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b382-7\">MOSES phrased the desired remedy as follows: \u201cCompensate grievant for the difference in salary between Civil Engineer I and Civil Engineer III for the period commencing April 27, 1991 and ending upon the resumption of the duties of a Civil Engineer I. All lesser included remedies are incorporated herein.\u201d It used the same language to describe the desired remedy at steps two and three.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b383-8\">MHD also argued that the deadlines for filing separate grievances had expired by the time arbitration proceedings began and, therefore, no additional claims by Kelly were possible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b383-9\">The judge also concluded that the arbitrator committed an error of law because the record did not support his finding that the parties had agreed to treat the dispute as one of a continuing nature. Error of law, however, is not a ground on which a court may vacate an arbitration award. See <em>School Comm. of Pittsfield </em>v. <em>United Educators of Pittsfield, </em>438 Mass. 753, 758 (2003); <em>Boston Hous. Authy. </em>v. <em>National Conference of Firemen &amp; Oilers, Local 3, </em>458 Mass. 155, 161 (2010); <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Salaried Employees of N. Am., Local 9158, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 785, 788 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b383-11\">The grievance stated that Winters \u201chas been performing the duties and responsibilities of a Civil Engineer II since August 1995 without appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>compensation in violation of the collective bargaining agreement.\u201d The desired remedy sought compensation \u201cfor the difference in salary between a Civil Engineer II and a Civil Engineer I commencing August 1995 until he resumes performing the duties and responsibilities of a Civil Engineer I. All lesser included remedies are incorporated herein.\u201d The same language was used at steps two and three.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b384-12\">Winters resigned from MHD in April, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b384-13\">The order for back pay was somewhat more complex than the order entered in Kelly\u2019s case, but the complexities play no role in this appeal, and as a consequence, we need not describe them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b386-7\">MHD argues that the question required a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\" answer and did not permit the arbitrator to make an award for various components of that seven-year period. The record does not suggest that that claim was made below, and thus, it has been waived. See <em>Carey </em>v. <em>New England Organ Bank, </em>446 Mass. 270, 285 (2006). Were we to consider it substantively, though, we think that the arbitrator was not required to adopt such a crabbed view of the question\u2019s scope. Among other things, MHD\u2019s approach would mean that the arbitrator would have had to deny Winters\u2019s claim if he found that Winters worked as a CE-I for only one day out of the seven years. No reasonable interpretation of the question would produce that kind of result. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>one could somehow find ambiguity in the scope of the submission in Kelly\u2019s case, the submission in Winters\u2019s removed that ambiguity by expressly defining the \u201cgrievance period\u201d as spanning the seven years from 1997 to 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
