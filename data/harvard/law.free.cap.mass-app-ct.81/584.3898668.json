Fitness International, LLC (L.A. Fitness), appeals from summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff, Superior Mechanical Plumbing and Heating, Inc. (Superior), on Superior\u2019s claim to enforce a mechanic\u2019s lien pursuant to G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 4. Superior performed plumbing work under a subcontract with PinnCon LLC (PinnCon), the general contractor for the construction of an L.A. Fitness sports facility in Saugus (project). The issue on appeal is whether amounts were due or to become due to PinnCon on the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>L.A. Fitness received notice of Superior\u2019s lien. Based upon the terms of the general contract and the undisputed facts, PinnCon\u2019s failure to provide proof to L.A. Fitness that it had paid its subcontractors, a condition precedent to subsequent payments under the general contract, we conclude that no further payments were due or to become due, and the grant of summary judgment was improper. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\"><em>Facts. </em>The undisputed facts are taken from the summary judgment record. On November 29, 2007, L.A. Fitness and PinnCon entered into a written contract (general contract), whereby PinnCon would serve as the general contractor for the project. The general contract consisted of the American Institute of Architects\u2019 abbreviated standard form of agreement,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> along with exhibits. Attached as exhibit C was a rider, the terms of which controlled in the event of a conflict between the rider and the abbreviated form of agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Relevant for our purposes, the rider included provisions requiring that PinnCon pay its subcontractors promptly upon receipt of payments from L.A. Fitness, and that, as a condition precedent to further payments, PinnCon provide proof that it paid its construction obligations from the previous payment from L.A. Fitness. On December 4, 2007, PinnCon entered into a written subcontract with Superior.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Over the next few months, PinnCon submitted four applications for payment to L.A. Fitness. L.A. Fitness approved PinnCon\u2019s first application for payment, and made a payment to PinnCon in January, 2008, in the amount of $173,025. L.A. Fitness also approved PinnCon\u2019s second application for payment, and made a second payment to PinnCon on March 4, 2008, in the amount of $690,996.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">On March 25, 2008, L.A. Fitness learned that PinnCon had absconded with the March 4, 2008, payment of $690,996, had paid none of its subcontractors from those funds, and was closing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>its business. By letter dated March 28, 2008, L.A. Fitness terminated the general contract due to PinnCon\u2019s material breaches, including, among others, its failure to pay its subcontractors. L.A. Fitness made no further payments to PinnCon.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Prior to PinnCon\u2019s termination, Superior performed subcontract work valued at $105,740. Superior submitted four requisitions for payment to PinnCon for work performed through March 18, 2008, but PinnCon never paid them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On March 20, 2008, Superior recorded a notice of contract pursuant to G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 4, in the Essex South District registry of deeds and in the Essex South Registry District of the Land Court. L.A. Fitness received actual notice of the lien filing on March 24, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">After PinnCon\u2019s termination, L.A. Fitness hired Konover Construction (Konover) as general contractor to complete the project. Personnel from L.A. Fitness and Konover met with the project subcontractors and asked that they sign agreements to complete their work. In May and June, 2008, L.A. Fitness paid the subcontractors for work submitted in PinnCon\u2019s third and fourth applications for payment, totaling approximately $1.36 million. On May 29, 2009, Superior entered into a ratification agreement with Konover, providing that Superior would complete its subcontract and would also receive $50,166, representing payment for its third and fourth requisitions to PinnCon, plus retainage. Superior was not paid for its first and second requisitions, totaling $55,574, but preserved its rights to pursue payment in its ratification agreement with Konover. On June 25, 2008, L.A. Fitness recorded a bond, naming Insurance Company as surety, securing payment of Superior\u2019s lien, as permitted under G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 14.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The project was eventually completed. L.A. Fitness calculated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>that the cost to complete exceeded the original general contract price by $237,140.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">Superior commenced this action in Superior Court against PinnCon for breach of contract and recovery in quantum meruit, and against Insurance Company to enforce the lien. Final judgment was entered against PinnCon on March 30, 2009, pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(b), 365 Mass. 820 (1974). Insurance Company moved for summary judgment, asserting that no funds were due or to become due from L.A. Fitness to PinnCon, because of PinnCon\u2019s default on the general contract at the time L.A. Fitness received notice of Superior\u2019s lien. Superior filed a cross motion for summary judgment, asserting that at the time L.A. Fitness was notified of the lien, money was still due to PinnCon for work performed under the general contract, regardless of PinnCon\u2019s default. The Superior Court judge granted summary judgment for Superior, ruling that \u201cPinnCon was owed monies by the contract owner, L.A. Fitness in at least enough of an [amount] to satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d Insurance Company appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>We review the grant of summary judgment de nova. See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Cotter, </em>448 Mass. 671, 676 (2007). General Laws c. 254, \u00a7 4, permits a subcontractor to file a notice of contract in the appropriate registry of deeds at any time after the execution of a written contract with the general contractor to perform labor or furnish materials. See <em>BloomSouth Flooring Corp. </em>v. <em>Boys\u2019 &amp; Girls\u2019 Club of Taunton Inc., </em>440 Mass. 618, 622 (2003) (subcontractor \u201ccould have protected itself from general contractor\u2019s default by filing its notice of subcontract prior to starting [the] work\u201d). Section 4 provides, in relevant part, that, upon filing and giving actual notice to the property owner, the subcontractor shall have a lien on the property, but that \u201c[s]uch lien shall not exceed the amount due or to become due under the original contract as of the date notice of the filing of the subcontract is given by the subcontractor to the owner.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 4, as amended through St. 1996, c. 364, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The statute is strictly construed against the party claiming the lien, and that includes establishing that money is due or to become due. <em>National Lumber Co. </em>v. Inman, 77 Mass. App. Ct. 916, 918 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">It is undisputed that L.A. Fitness received actual notice of Superior\u2019s filing of the notice of contract on March 24, 2008. Superior argues that since the date of PinnCon\u2019s formal termination was not until March 28, 2008, amounts were still due or to become due under the general contract when L.A. Fitness received notice of Superior\u2019s lien on March 24, 2008. However, this court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Maverick Constr. Mgmt. Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. of Md., </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 264, 269 (2011), rejected \u201ca rule that every subcontractor\u2019s lien assertion preceding a formal termination of the general contractor assures full protection of the lien.\u201d Rather, we look to whether the general contractor was entitled to payment under the terms of the general contract, and not solely to when formal termination occurred, in determining whether additional payments were due the general contractor at the time the owner received notice of the lien. <em>Id. </em>at 269-270.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">We think the same reasoning applies here. Given the undisputed fact that PinnCon absconded with the March 4, 2008, payment, our analysis under c. 254, \u00a7 4, requires more than mere reliance on the formal termination letter of March 28, 2008. \u201cEvents such as certification of substantial completion, notice of abandonment, and notice of termination may be probative of, but not necessarily conclusive of, binding duties of payment and payment amounts owed by the owner to the general contractor.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In light of the circumstances leading up to PinnCon\u2019s termination, we do not consider the March 28, 2008, formal termination letter dispositive of whether payments were due or to become due to PinnCon on March 24, 2008, the date L.A. Fitness received notice of Superior\u2019s lien.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>The question, then, is whether amounts were due or to become due from L.A. Fitness to PinnCon as of March 24, 2008, under the terms of the general contract. On our review of the record, it becomes apparent that once PinnCon absconded with the $690,996 payment made on March 4, 2008, without paying the construction obligations for which that payment was intended, the terms of the general contract established that PinnCon failed to comply with a condition precedent to receiving any further payments from L.A. Fitness.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">Article 4 of the rider expressly provided, in relevant part, that proof of payment of PinnCon\u2019s construction obligations was a condition precedent to further payments under the contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">\u201cCommencing with the second and each subsequent Application for Payment, Contractor shall furnish proof of payment of construction obligations for all prior payments received by Contractor including but not limited to the partial or final releases and waivers of lien from all Lien Claimants or potential lien claimants. The furnishing of proof of payment and releases of lien as set forth herein shall be a condition precedent to Contractor\u2019s entitlement to receive such pending payment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">It is well established that \u201c[a] condition precedent is an act which must occur before performance by the other party is due.\u201d <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Roy Lapidus, Inc., </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 761, 763 n.5 (1980), citing <em>Malden Knitting Mills </em>v. <em>United States Rubber Co., </em>301 Mass. 229, 233 (1938). \u201cIf the condition is not fulfilled, the contract, or the obligations attached to the condition, may not be enforced.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Danvers, </em>411 Mass. 39, 45 (1991). Under the plain language of article 4 of the rider, once PinnCon received the second payment of $690,996, any further payments from L.A. Fitness were conditioned on PinnCon\u2019s furnishing proof that it had used the second payment to pay its construction obligations. Compare <em>Jeremiah Sullivan &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>Kay-Locke, Inc., </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 997, 998 (1984) (where subcontract\u2019s language is not sufficiently clear to establish that payment to the subcontractor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>is directly contingent on receipt by the general contractor of payment from the owner, it should not be viewed as creating a condition precedent to payment).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The importance attached to PinnCon\u2019s payment of its construction obligations, including its subcontractors, was emphasized in article 4 of the rider, which states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-6\">\u201cNotwithstanding any other provisions of the Agreement, Owner shall not be obligated to make any payment to Contractor if, and as long as, any one or more of the following conditions exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">\u201c(2) Contractor has failed to furnish to Owner satisfactory proof of payment to its subcontractors and suppliers and/or lien waivers and releases in the form and manner required hereunder[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">Those two provisions make abundantly clear that PinnCon\u2019s failure to pay its subcontractors and to provide L.A. Fitness with proof thereof relieved L.A. Fitness of its obligation to make any further payments. It is undisputed that when L.A. Fitness paid PinnCon $690,996 on March 4, 2008, PinnCon absconded with the money. It therefore could not provide satisfactory proof to L.A. Fitness that it paid its subcontractors from that payment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Indeed, we may infer that PinnCon, having informed L.A. Fitness that the second payment was gone, that it</p>\n<p id=\"Ai0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>had paid none of the subcontractors from that payment, and that it was closing its business, would never provide such proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">As observed in <em>Maverick Constr. Mgmt. Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. of Md., </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. at 268, we may consider subsequent events \u201cto cast a backlight\u201d showing the point at which no further payments were due or to become due under the original contract. In <em>Maverick, </em>on the question whether retainage was due or would become due to the general contractor on the date of the subcontractor\u2019s hen, we identified the date the defective athletic complex was delivered to the owner, almost five months before the hen was filed, as the point at which no amounts were due or to become due. Despite the general contractor\u2019s initial proposal to return and correct the problems, in the end, the contractor performed no further work after delivery. Based on an arbitration judgment establishing that the cost of correcting the defects far exceeded the retainage, we determined that, as of the date of dehvery, no further payments were due or to become due to the general contractor. <em>Id. </em>at 268-270.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Here, subsequent events revealed that after making the March 4, 2008, payment, L.A. Fitness had no obligation under the general contract to make further payments to PinnCon. And, pursuant to article 4 of the rider, that was true notwithstanding any other provision of the general contract. As such, by the time L.A. Fitness received notice of Superior\u2019s lien on March 24, 2008, no amounts were due or to become due to PinnCon.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Our determination that no amounts were due or to become due to PinnCon after the March 4, 2008, payment, disposes of Superior\u2019s remaining arguments in its favor.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> First, Superior argues that the payments L.A. Fitness made to the subcontractors in May and June, 2008, for work they performed prior to PinnCon\u2019s termination constituted amounts due under the general contract. Superior relies on the fact that the subcontractors were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>paid in amounts consistent with PinnCon\u2019s third and fourth applications for payment, which were submitted prior to PinnCon\u2019s termination. However, as we observed in <em>Maverick, </em>the statute speaks to amounts due or to become due to the general contractor. The test is whether \u201cas a matter of entitlement and sufficient amount, payment was \u2018due or to become due\u2019 from the owner <em>to the general contractor </em>under <em>their </em>contract\u201d (emphasis added). <em>Id. </em>at 269, quoting from G. L. c. 254, \u00a7 4. Based on article 4 of the rider, as detailed above, the approximately $1.36 million L.A. Fitness paid to the subcontractors after PinnCon\u2019s termination was not money to which PinnCon, itself, was entitled, once it absconded with the March 4, 2008, payment. And that was true regardless of when the work was performed. See, e.g., <em>BloomSouth Flooring Corp. </em>v. <em>Boys\u2019 &amp; Girls Club of Taunton Inc., </em>440 Mass, at 623-624 (upon the general contractor\u2019s wilful default, retainage was not due or to become due as of the lien\u2019s filing date, even though services in exchange for retainage were already performed, because the general contract provided for retainage to be paid only on substantial completion).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Superior also argues that amounts were due or to become due to PinnCon once the project was completed, pursuant to provisions in the general contract that entitled PinnCon to any excess amounts remaining upon completion, even in certain instances of default.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> While the materials supporting summary judgment indicate that L.A. Fitness expended $237,140 over the original contract price to complete the project, Superior maintains that the calculation should not have included payments to subcontractors who had not filed liens for work performed prior to PinnCon\u2019s termination. According to Superior, L.A. Fitness\u2019s payments to those subcontractors, in the amount of $786,158.10, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>were not authorized by the general contract, and so should not be included in determining the cost to complete the contract.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Based on Superior\u2019s argument, the cost to complete PinnCon\u2019s work would have been approximately $549,000 less than the general contract balance, leaving sufficient amounts due to PinnCon to pay Superior\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">Even assuming, without in any way deciding, that L.A. Fitness\u2019s broad authority under the general contract to pay subcontractors, and to complete the work by whatever means it deemed expedient,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> did not extend to paying subcontractors that had not filed liens, PinnCon still was not entitled to the excess funds at completion. In accordance with article 4 of the rider, L.A. Fitness was not obligated to make any payments to PinnCon so long as PinnCon failed to provide proof that PinnCon had paid its subcontractors from the March 4, 2008, payment. And that was true notwithstanding any other provisions of the general contract \u2014 including the provisions pertaining to excess funds at completion.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the plain language of the general contract and the undisputed facts indicate that no \u2022 amounts were due or to become due to PinnCon at the time L.A. Fitness received notice of Superior\u2019s lien. As such, Insurance Company is entitled to summary judgment as matter of law. Summary judgment for Superior is reversed. The matter is remanded to Superior Court where a new order is to be entered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>denying the motion and dismissing Superior\u2019s claim to enforce the bond against Insurance Company.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The full title of the general contract is \u201cAbbreviated Standard Form of Agreement Between Owner and Contractor for Construction Projects of Limited Scope.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Article 6.1.1 of the rider provided, in relevant part, as follows: \u201cIn the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Rider and the Abbreviated Form of Agreement (of which the Abbreviated General Conditions are an integral part), the terms and provisions of this Rider shall prevail and be controlling.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Superior\u2019s four requisitions for payment were for the following amounts: (1) $27,000, (2) $42,975, (3) $38,700, and (4) $11,466.

Rev. 167 (1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Further, there is no evidence in the record that Superior filed a notice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>identification, as permitted by \u00a7 4. Nor has Superior argued that the claim is one for labor, cognizable under G.

Fitness issued the second check to PinnCon. The record discloses that in PinnCon\u2019s second application and certification for payment, it indeed certified that it had made all payments for work for which the previous certificate of payment from L.A. Fitness was issued. According to the affidavit of Superior\u2019s president, Mark Giacchetto, Superior provided a partial lien waiver for $27,000 at PinnCon\u2019s request, even though Superior had not received payment from PinnCon, upon PinnCon\u2019s assurance that payment would immediately follow. In any event, article 20.10 of the rider provided, in relevant part, that \u201c[n]o consent or waiver, express or implied, by either party to or of any breach or default by the other party in the performance of any obligations hereunder shall be deemed or construed to be consent or waiver to or of any other breach of [iic] default by such party.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Moreover, based on our conclusion, we do not reach Insurance Company\u2019s alternative argument that PinnCon defaulted on the general contract for its failure to promptly pay its subcontractors as required by \u00a7 14.3.1 of the abbreviated form of agreement. We do note that the subcontract between PinnCon and Superior, which in \u00a7 47 required payment within fifteen days of PinnCon\u2019s receipt of payment from L.A.
