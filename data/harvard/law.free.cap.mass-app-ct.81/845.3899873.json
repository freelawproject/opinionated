Regs. \u00a7 3.07(3) (2010). The judge, therefore, found in favor of the plaintiffs (who live nearby) and ordered that the billboard not be illuminated at night and that it be removed within ninety days.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\"><em>Background. </em>We summarize the trial judge\u2019s extensive and detailed findings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In 2009, the defendant Michael Rodrigues, upon whose property in Westport a billboard had stood for about forty years, agreed to partner with the defendant Outcepts Management &amp; Consulting, LLC (Outcepts), to replace an existing billboard. The new billboard, like the previous one, was to face Route 195. The side of Route 195 on which the billboard was to be erected is predominantly residential. The opposite side of Route 195 is undeveloped land. Within a 500-foot radius of the billboard there are seven homes, a large tract of undeveloped residential/agricultural land, and two garages used for commercial storage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Within a 1,000-foot radius, there are twenty homes. The plaintiff Albert Piva owns and lives at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>property directly abutting the location of the billboard.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Plamondon plaintiffs live within 500 feet of the billboard.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The entire area at issue is zoned residential.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Because the new billboard would be different from the old one,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> it had no grandfather status<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and was required to meet all of the requirements for new billboards as contained in G. L. c. 93 and 711 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.00 et seq. (2010). To that end, in 2010 Outcepts filed two written applications with the Massachusetts Office of Outdoor Advertising (MOOA), formerly known as the Outdoor Advertising Board (OAB).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Before November, 2009, the OAB customarily had held public hearings to review permit applications. However, as part of c. 25 of the Acts of 2009, \u201cAn Act Modernizing the Transporta<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>tian Systems of the Commonwealth,\u201d the OAB was in essence dismantled. As a result, permitting decisions that had previously been made by the OAB after a process that included a public hearing were, as of 2010, made solely by the MOOA\u2019s director, Edward Farley. The MOOA\u2019s process includes no mechanism for notice to, or hearing from, abutters or other interested parties before the issuance of a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Farley did not visit the site before acting on the applications here, and he approved them without public comment or discussion. He indicated his decision by checking \u201cApplication Approved\u201d on the permit application forms, which he then signed and dated. The forms required an explanation only in the event of a denial, and so Farley\u2019s reasons for approving the permits do not appear in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">In acting on applications to approve billboards, Farley relies on information provided by the applicant, as well as the information from the MOOA\u2019s field inspectors. In this case, Marc Plante, a field inspector for MOOA, visited the location for the proposed billboard and reported that there were two businesses (i.e., the storage garages referenced above) within 500 feet and that the area was not residential in character.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> For purposes of making this assessment, he defined and considered the \u201carea\u201d as only the land encompassing the billboard and the two storage garages (the two structures closest to the billboard).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Plante did not consider the remainder of the neighborhood, including the remainder of the 500-foot radius around the billboard, even though Farley testified that the MOOA uses a 500-foot radius to determine whether an area is of a business character.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">Farley also relied on information provided in the permit applications, specifically in the sections certified by Ralph G. Souza, the Westport building inspector.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Souza certified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>(1) the proposed billboard was grandfathered under the West-port zoning by-law (a statement the parties agree is incorrect) (see note 9, supra),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and (2) the billboard would be located in an area zoned \u201cresidential/replacing existing billboard on property commercially used as preexisting nonconforming use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">Farley approved the applications on March 11, 2010. In the last week of March, plaintiff Theresa R. Plamondon (Plamondon), unaware that the old billboard had been taken down, saw a flatbed trailer carrying steel tubes down the street and realized that a new billboard was being constructed. She complained to Souza, who, after a site visit, saw that the new sign exceeded the specified height and delivered a stop work order. That order was lifted after Souza received revised documentation of the sign height.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Plamondon next sought relief from Farley, director of MOOA, on the ground that the requirements of 711 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 3.00 et seq. had not been met. Specifically, she stated that the billboard violated 711 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.07(3)(b) because it was placed in a residential area. Farley responded that the municipality, and not the MOOA, determines whether the area is residential and that the MOOA would take no further action in response to Plamondon\u2019s request for relief. Plamondon wrote back, saying that \u201cthe issue is not the town zoning laws, it is . . . that the applicant didn\u2019t . . . and cannot meet the requirements of 711 CMR, 3.00 et seq.,\u201d which the MOOA has the authority to enforce. It appears that Farley did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Plamondon also sought relief from the town. On April 26, 2010, Souza advised her in writing that \u201cthe new sign structure is not a nonconforming structure as to zoning and that. . . [it] does not expand the nonconforming commercial use of the Property so as to require zoning relief.\u201d Souza also informed her that she could appeal his \u201czoning determinations\u201d to the Westport board of appeals, and his \u201cdetermination under the State Building Code\u201d to the State Building Code Appeals Board. She pursued neither avenue of relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>Instead, the plaintiffs filed this action in Superior Court, seeking injunctive relief pursuant to G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>We begin by describing the relevant statutory and regulatory landscape. Article 50 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (ratified and adopted in 1918) confers plenary power on the Legislature to regulate and restrict outdoor advertising. <em>General Outdoor Advertising Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Works, </em>289 Mass. 149, 158 (1935). That power is delegable, <em>Milton </em>v. <em>Donnelly, </em>306 Mass. 451, 455 (1940), and pursuant to G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 29, the Legislature has delegated to the OAB<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the power to make rules and regulations governing billboards. \u201cSuch rules and regulations may require that said billboards ... be located in business, commercial, industrial, marketing or mercantile areas.\u201d G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 29, amended by St. 1955, c. 584, \u00a7 4. No billboard may be erected or maintained unless it conforms to the rules and regulations established under G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 29. See 711 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.02(2)(a) (2010). Those rules and regulations are contained in 711 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 3.00 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">At issue in this case is 711 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.07, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-7\">\u201c(3) No permit shall be granted or renewed for a sign that is not located in an area of a business character. An area shall be deemed to be of business character only if, <em>when viewed from the principal highway </em>upon which the sign is to face, <em>both </em>of the following requirements are met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-8\">\u201c(a) At least two separate business, industrial or commercial activities are being conducted within a distance of 500 feet from the proposed location of the sign, measuring from such proposed location to the buildings or parking lots or other places of actual business, industrial or commercial activity. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-9\">\u201c(b) The area in which the sign is to be located is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>not predominantly residential, agricultural or open space or natural area.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">The Legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cboth\u201d plainly signifies that the conditions of subsections (a) and (b) are separate and conjunctive; they must each be satisfied in order for a permit to issue. Moreover, the fact that subsection (b) (which requires that the area not be predominantly residential) must be satisfied in addition to subsection (a) (which requires that two businesses be located within 500 feet) indicates that subsection (b) requires proof of something in addition to what is required to satisfy subsection (a). Put another way, there would be no need for subsection (b) if all that were required to obtain a permit was the presence of two businesses within 500 feet. Since we do not interpret statutes in such a way as to render any provision inoperative, or surplusage, see <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>456 Mass. 594, 601 (2010), subsection (b) necessarily requires some evidence that the neighborhood is of a business character in addition to the presence of two businesses within 500 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">In addition to enabling the promulgation of rules and regulations, c. 93 also creates two avenues of relief for those seeking to challenge the erection or maintenance of a billboard. The first of these allows applicants, and cities and towns in which the proposed billboard is to be located, to appeal adverse permitting decisions to the OAB. G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 29A.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> This section does not create an administrative remedy for others (such as abutters) who may have an interest in, or be aggrieved by, a permitting decision. Instead, such persons must follow the avenue provided in G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 31, amended by St. 1955, c. 584, \u00a7 7:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-7\">\u201cThe supreme judicial and superior courts shall have jurisdiction in equity upon petition of the attorney general, of any city or town or any officer thereof, <em>or of any interested party, </em>to restrain the erection or maintenance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>any billboard, sign or other device erected or maintained in violation of any rule, or regulation, adopted by the [OAB] under section twenty-nine, and to order the removal or abatement of such billboard, sign or device as a nuisance\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">This is the section the plaintiffs invoked when bringing this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">We now turn to the specific issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\"><em>Exhaustion. </em>The defendants argue, as a threshold matter, that the Superior Court lacked jurisdiction because the plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. We consider this issue to be controlled in all material respects by <em>General Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Maurice Callahan &amp; Sons, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 124, ISO-131 (1974). As we have set out above, there was no administrative route of relief available to the plaintiffs under c. 93 and, therefore, there was no administrative remedy they failed to exhaust. <em>Ibid. </em>Neither the statutory nor the regulatory scheme requires notice to abutters or other interested parties, nor are such persons given a right or opportunity to be heard in the administrative process. Indeed, when Plamondon asked the MOOA to review its permitting decision, she was informed that it would take no further action. The plaintiffs\u2019 only available mechanism for challenging the MOOA\u2019s decision was to bring an equitable action under G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\"><em>Indispensable party. </em>Also as a threshold matter, the defendants argue that the MOOA is an indispensable party, Mass. R.Civ.P. 19(a), 365 Mass. 765 (1974), and its absence deprived the Superior Court of jurisdiction. This argument disregards the proceedings below. The MOOA was named as a defendant in the amended complaint. The MOOA then moved to be dismissed on the ground that it was immune from suit under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10(e),<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> a proposition with which the judge agreed. The defendants did not oppose that motion, nor did they at any point below contend that the MOOA was an indispensable party. The issue is accordingly waived. See <em>Seekonk </em>v. <em>John J. McHale &amp; </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number><em>Sons, </em>325 Mass. 271, 274 (1950); <em>Amrhein </em>v. <em>Amrhein, </em>29 Mass. App. Ct. 336, 339 (1990) (absence of indispensable party is nonjurisdictional and may be waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\"><em>Merits. </em>The judge, after a trial that included a view, found that the area around the billboard was predominantly residential as viewed from the highway. 711 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.07(3). The judge correctly determined that the regulation requires an evaluation of the area as it is viewed from the highway, and that neither Farley nor the MOOA field inspectors had observed or considered the area from that perspective. The crux of the defendants\u2019 appeal is their contention that there was an insufficient evidentiary basis for the judge\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">Although this is not an appeal from an administrative decision pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, but rather an independent equitable action, the judge employed the highly deferential c. 30A standard of review. The judge reasoned that to do otherwise would result in differing standards of review depending solely on whether review was being sought by cities, towns, or applicants under G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 29A, or other interested persons under G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 31.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> However, G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 31, neither states nor suggests that equitable actions brought pursuant to its terms are subject to the provisions of c. 30A. And we note that G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 31, is not, strictly speaking, a mechanism by which to review agency decisions. It creates instead an equitable cause of action for interested persons, such as abutters, who are not statutorily entitled to notice of, or participation in, the agency process. Equitable relief under the statute is limited to removal or abatement in instances where a billboard has been erected or maintained in violation of any rule or regulation adopted under G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">We leave to another day the determination of the correct standard to be employed in actions brought pursuant to G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 31. Here, the undisputed record showed that the new billboard, as a matter of law, in two respects did not satisfy the requirements of 711 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.07. First, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>judge found, the MOOA did not consider the characteristics of the neighborhood as viewed from the highway. Second, the MOOA ignored the word \u201cboth\u201d in \u00a7 3.07, and thereby gave no independent meaning to \u00a7 3.07(b). Here, the presence of two businesses within 500 feet satisfied subsection (a) but there was nothing more to satisfy the independent requirements of subsection (b). We do not mean to suggest that the presence of two businesses could not be considered by the MOOA in determining whether the neighborhood was primarily residential. However, it could not rely solely on the two businesses without considering the entire composition and character of the relevant area.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">Finally, we note that the evidence before the judge \u2014 supplemented by his firsthand observation of the area \u2014 amply supported his conclusion that the area around the billboard is not primarily of a business character as viewed from the highway and that the requirements of 711 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.07 were not satisfied. He was accordingly well within his discretion, as well as within the parameters of G. L. c. 93, \u00a7 31, in ordering the removal of the billboard.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">For these reasons, the judgment of the Superior Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b892-6\">The judgment was stayed pending this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b892-7\">The judge\u2019s findings are amply supported by the record. Indeed, the defendants challenge only certain findings relating to nighttime illumination of the sign. However, no aspect of our decision or analysis turns on those findings, and we therefore need not, and do not, address the defendants\u2019 argument in that regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b892-8\">Both garage properties are limited by variances, and one of them is also limited by a Land Court order. Pursuant to a 1984 variance, the first property (26 Cleveland Street) may be used only for \u201cthe storage of carpeting and tiles.\u201d The only activities permitted at 26 Cleveland Street are storage and the occasional use of small trucks to pick up and drop off materials for storage. Pursuant to a 1991 variance, the second property (42 Cleveland Street) may be used only for storage of one owner-operated tractor trailer, two owner-operated trailers, and one owner-operated service truck. The owner of 42 Cleveland Street received multiple cease and desist orders between October, 2009, and March 16, 2010. The March 16, 2010, order states that \u201cthis is a residential area and <em>NO COMMERICAL USE IS ALLOWED. </em>Any commercial activity must go before the Board of Appeals\u201d (emphasis in original). After being denied a permit by the board of appeals, the owner of 42 Cleveland Street and the town of Westport executed an agreement for judgment and permanent injunction with the Land Court. That agreement stated that the owner shall \u201c[i]mmediately and permanently <em>CEASE </em>the commercial excavating business at 42 Cleveland Street\u201d <em>and </em>\u201cpermanently <em>REMOVE </em>all commercial vehicles and equipment,\u201d and that the owner may only \u201c[k]eep one tractor truck, two trailers and one service truck . . . owned and operated by the [property] owner\u201d (emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b893-7\">Piva\u2019s residence is most directly affected by the new, higher billboard, particularly when it is lit at night, which he described as being like a \u201ctelevision in the sky.\u201d It is visible from most of his home, including the back yard and pool area. The judge credited Piva\u2019s testimony that the old sign was hardly visible from his property, while the new sign is much more obtrusive and has diminished his enjoyment of his property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b893-8\">The new billboard is visible from the Plamondons\u2019 residence, including their kitchen, living room, bathroom and certain bedrooms, their front yard, north side yard, and portions of their back yard. However, because the billboard is approximately 600 feet away, it does not loom particularly large. The judge credited Theresa Plamondon\u2019s testimony that, while the old billboard was not visible from her house, the new billboard is clearly visible from her home and property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b893-9\">The new billboard differs in five significant ways. First, it is about thirty feet taller. Second, it is a \u201cV\u201d shaped board, providing greater visibility from the highway than a back-to-back or single-face board. Third, it has less surface area; where the prior billboard was fifteen by fifty feet, the new billboard is fourteen feet by forty-eight feet. Fourth, it is a \u201cchanging face\u201d billboard, capable of displaying three advertisements per face. Fifth, it is lit with light-emitting diode (LED) lamps hidden and mounted at the bottom of the billboard\u2019s catwalk, as opposed to the prior sign\u2019s floodlights. The judge credited the defendants\u2019 evidence that the new design provided several benefits: its greater height means less tree trimming to maintain the sign\u2019s visibility; the \u201cV\u201d shape exposes less of the sign\u2019s face to the neighborhood; and the LED lighting minimizes \u201cbackwash lighting,\u201d or \u201clight trespass.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b893-10\">There is no dispute that the new billboard was not grandfathered under the old permit. The judge found that the building inspector\u2019s indication on the permit application to the contrary was a mistake, and no party challenges this finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b893-11\">Two applications were required because, according to Edward Farley, director of MOOA, a separate application is required for each face of a two-sided billboard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b894-8\">This latter characterization was consistent with previous MOOA annual field inspections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b894-9\">Plante, together with another field inspector, walked around the storage garages, observed them from the exterior, and inferred that they were businesses. They did not enter the structures or make inquiry to confirm whether the properties were in fact operated as businesses. Farley characterized this process as an observation, and not an investigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b894-10\">Peter McClary, who was the president of Outcepts, completed the forms, and Souza signed them thereafter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b895-7\">There are no provisions of the Westport zoning by-law conferring protected status for billboards.
