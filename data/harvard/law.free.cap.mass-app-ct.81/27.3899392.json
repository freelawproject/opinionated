L. c. 152, \u00a7 12, against John Kardas (a former employee), seeking to enforce what it deems a recoupment order issued by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>an administrative judge of the Department of Industrial Accidents (DIA). A Superior Court judge granted judgment on the pleadings in favor of Home Depot, Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(c), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), and Kardas now appeals. We conclude that there was no recoupment order issued by the DIA that could be enforced by way of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12, and, accordingly, reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\u201cThe effect of a motion for judgment on the pleadings is \u2018to challenge the legal sufficiency of the complaint.\u2019 <em>Burlington </em>v. <em>District Attorney for the N. Dist., </em>381 Mass. 717, 717-718 (1980). . . . \u2018For purposes of the court\u2019s consideration of the [rule 12(c)] motion, all of the well pleaded factual allegations in the adversary\u2019s pleading are assumed to be true and all contravening assertions in the movant\u2019s pleadings are taken to be false.\u2019 5 C.A. Wright &amp; A.R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1368, at 691 (1969).\u201d <em>Minaya </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Credit Union Share Ins. Corp., </em>392 Mass. 904, 905 (1984). The court can also consider \u201cfacts of which judicial notice may be taken.\u201d <em>Jarosz </em>v. Palmer, 49 Mass. App. Ct. 834, 835 (2000), <em>S.C., </em>436 Mass. 526 (2002). Although we may take judicial notice of the docket entries and papers filed in separate cases, we may not take judicial notice of facts or evidence brought out in those separate actions. See <em>Howe </em>v. Prokop, 21 Mass. App. Ct. 919, 920 (1985). Using these principles, we summarize the admitted factual allegations of the complaint, together with those aspects of the administrative record of which we may take judicial notice. We do not \u2022\u2014 nor can we \u2022\u2014 look outside the pleadings,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> despite Home Depot\u2019s argument below and here to the contrary. Contrast Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(c).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Kardas was employed by Home Depot when he injured his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>left knee by slipping and twisting his leg as he descended a ladder while at work. He filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim with the DIA, which Home Depot contested. On December 28, 2005, an administrative judge issued a conference order requiring Home Depot<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to pay a closed period of total disability benefits, followed by ongoing partial disability benefits. Both parties appealed, and the matter was heard de nova by the same administrative judge. As a result of the second hearing, as well as additional medical and salary information that was brought forth, the administrative judge issued a new order (second order) that reduced both the amount and the duration of Kardas\u2019s benefits. Because the second order was issued on February 6, 2007, but terminated benefits as of October 24, 2005 (whereas the conference order had conferred ongoing benefits), the practical consequence was that Kardas had already received more than he was due.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because it is relevant to our discussion below, we set out the second order in the margin.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Neither party appealed the second order.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">Contending that the second order was an order of recoupment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>that could be enforced through G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Home Depot brought an enforcement action against Kardas in the Superior Court. It then moved for judgment on the pleadings, which the judge allowed in an order dated October 15, 2009. We review that order de nova. <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Insurers Insolvency Fund, </em>456 Mass. 594, 600 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\"><em>Discussion. </em>The workers\u2019 compensation statute provides defined mechanisms by which an insurer can recoup excess payments. Where, as here, the employee no longer works for the employer, an insurer has two alternate ways of obtaining an order of recoupment. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11D(3).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> First, the insurer can file a complaint with the DIA, pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11D(3). Alternatively, the insurer can file a recoupment action in the Superior Court. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">It is undisputed that Home Depot never filed a recoupment complaint with the DIA under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 10. Recoupment was never sought from, considered by, or decided by the DIA. There was, therefore, no recoupment order by the DIA. The fact that the practical consequence of the second order was that Kardas had received excess payments does not itself mean that the second order was an order of recoupment. Nor does a finding that an employee has received excess payments, standing alone, represent a recoupment order. The recoupment of excess payments is \u201ca matter of discretion . . . unless the employee is currently receiving benefits.\u201d <em>Murphy\u2019s Case, </em>53 Mass. App. Ct. 424, 430 (2001). And the exercise of such discretion \u201crequires fact finding,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>which did not occur here. In short, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>was no recoupment order by the DIA that Home Depot was entitled to enforce through an enforcement action under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Although, as noted above, Home Depot was entitled under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11D, to bring an action directly in the Superior Court to obtain an order of recoupment, it did not pursue that avenue of relief in this case. Instead, it brought an enforcement action under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12. Moreover, even had Home Depot invoked G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 11D, in its complaint, the allegations of the complaint were insufficient to allow judgment on the pleadings and to order recoupment. The complaint alleged only that Kardas had received excess payments; it did not contain allegations sufficient to determine whether recoupment would be appropriate or, if so, in what amount or on what schedule of repayment. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Highland House Apartments, </em>12 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 322, 326 (1998) <em>{Brown) </em>(\u201ca judge may order none, some, or all of the overpayments as appropriate\u201d); <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Sciaba Constr., </em>12 Mass. Workers\u2019 Comp. Rep. 427, 429 (1998), quoting from <em>Brown, supra </em>at 326 &amp; n.7 (\u201cjudge should apply a test of \u2018fundamental fairness\u2019 \u201d balancing \u201cseveral equitable considerations including the degree of culpability of the worker, the employer\u2019s negligence, the worker\u2019s ability to repay, the hardship the worker would suffer, and the amount of the overpayment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">In light of the above, Kardas is also correct that Home Depot was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to G. L. c. 152, \u00a7\u00a7 12(3) and 12A. By contrast, Kardas is entitled, under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 12A, to his reasonable appellate attorney\u2019s fees and other necessary expenses. <em>Daly\u2019s Case, </em>405 Mass. 33, 42 (1989). Within two weeks of the date on which this opinion is issued, Kardas is to submit a fee application that comports with <em>Fabre </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>441 Mass. 9, 10-11 (2004). Home Depot shall file any response within two weeks thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">For the reasons set out above, Home Depot\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b74-7\">For purposes of the rules of civil procedure, a \u201cpleading\u201d is defined by Mass.R.Civ.P. 7(a), as amended, 385 Mass. 1215 (1982), as a complaint, an answer, a reply to counterclaim, an answer to cross-claim, a third-party complaint, and a third-party answer. \u201cNo other pleading shall be allowed, except that the court may order a reply to an answer or a third-party answer.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Rule 12(c) provides that a motion for judgment on the pleadings shall be converted \u2014 after notice \u2014 to a motion for summary judgment pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 56, 365 Mass. 824 (1974), if matters outside the pleadings are considered. Here, neither party requested that the motion be converted to one for summary judgment, nor did the judge give any indication that he intended to convert the motion. Furthermore, the judge\u2019s order on Home Depot\u2019s motion gives no indication that the motion was converted to one for summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>judgment. In these circumstances, there was no basis for the judge below to consider matters outside the pleadings, nor is there any basis now for us to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Home Depot is self-insured.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b75-10\">There is no allegation of wrongdoing by Kardas.
