See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178H. On appeal, he argues that the admission of records kept by the Sex Offender Registry Board (SORB), in the absence of a SORB witness, violated his right under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution to confront the witnesses against him. See <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 51-68 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">The test for whether admission of these SORB records, in the absence of testimony from a SORB witness, was permissible under the Sixth Amendment is the now familiar one of whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>the documents are \u201ctestimonial\u201d in nature. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Parenteau, 460 Mass. 1, 6-10 (2011). In <em>Crawford, supra </em>at 56, the Supreme Court indicated that, as a general matter, business records are not testimonial. The Court expanded upon this in its decision in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>557 U.S. 305, 324 (2009), where it said that \u201c[bjusiness and public records are generally admissible absent confrontation not because they qualify under an exception to the hearsay rules, but because \u2014 having been created for the administration of an entity\u2019s affairs and not for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at trial \u2014 they are not testimonial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The defendant concedes that the documents put in evidence here are kept in the ordinary course of SORB\u2019s affairs. There is no dispute that these documents, which identify the defendant as a level two sex offender, were prepared and maintained by public officials pursuant to duties imposed by G. L. c. 6, \u00a7\u00a7 178C-178Q.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The Supreme Judicial Court has recently stated that a copy of a \u201cnotice of the defendant\u2019s license revocation . . . created and kept in the ordinary course\u201d of the registry of motor vehicles\u2019 affairs is not testimonial. <em>Parenteau, supra </em>at 10. Similarly, we recently determined in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Shangkuan, </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. 827, 833-834 (2011), that a return of service filed with the court by a law enforcement officer, which demonstrated that a defendant had been served with a G. L. c. 209A order, was not testimonial. Likewise, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weeks, </em>77 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 5-8 (2010), we held that certified records of convictions were not testimonial. In each case, we concluded that the documents were created \u201cfor the administration of an entity\u2019s affairs\u201d rather than \u201cfor the purpose of establishing or proving some fact at trial.\u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">The same is true of the SORB documents at issue here. The documents were not created for the \u201cpurpose of establishing an essential fact at trial.\u201d See <em>Parenteau, supra. </em>These records are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>maintained for administrative purposes, such as keeping an updated registry of biographical data regarding sex offenders, including their names, photographs, fingerprints, and addresses, so that the public may obtain information about dangerous sex offenders who live or work in each community, and so that law enforcement can access and distribute information about sex offenders to prevent further victimization. See G. L. c. 6, \u00a7 178D. Nor is \u201cthe regularly conducted business activity\u201d of SORB for which these documents were created \u201cthe production of evidence for use at trial.\u201d <em>Melendez-Diaz, supra </em>at 321. While the documents at issue here may contain evidence that in some cases will be necessary to sustain a criminal conviction, the same could be said of the documents described in <em>Parenteau, Weeks, </em>and <em>Shangkuan. </em>The introduction of the SORB records at issue here in the absence of a SORB witness did not violate the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b291-8\">The documents include a card displaying the defendant\u2019s fingerprints; copies of letters sent to the defendant stating his classification level (i.e., level two), explaining his rights, and detailing his responsibilities, including his responsibility to register; as well as registration information that is available to law enforcement and to others upon proper request, as authorized by law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
