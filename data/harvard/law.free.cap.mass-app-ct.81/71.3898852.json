The defendant argues that the trial judge erred in declining to give the <em>DiGiambattista</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>instruction related to unrecorded police interrogations, in interrupting defense counsel\u2019s closing, and in admitting certain testimony. For the reasons detailed below, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-14\"><em>Background. </em>We recite the facts as the jury could have found them during the trial. An investigation of a gun-related incident, conducted by the Attleboro police department in conjunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>with the Boston police department, led authorities to an apartment in the Hyde Park section of Boston. The police obtained a search warrant for the defendant\u2019s apartment, and executed a search during which they found a .22 caliber pistol and a nine millimeter pistol located next to each other under a sofa cushion. The defendant was charged with possession of a firearm, the nine millimeter pistol, without a firearm identification (FID) card, as well as possession of ammunition without an FID card. See G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10(h); G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 129C. The defendant was not charged with possession of the .22 caliber pistol as it lacked a firing pin, and therefore did not meet the statutory definition of a \u201cfirearm.\u201d G. L. c. 140, \u00a7 121, as appearing in St. 1998, c. 180, \u00a7 8 (defining firearm as \u201ca pistol, revolver or other weapon of any description, loaded or unloaded, from which a shot or bullet can be discharged . . .\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Following the defendant\u2019s arrest, and after obtaining a waiver of Miranda rights, the police interrogated the defendant. The interrogation was not recorded; two of the police officers testified at trial that the defendant declined to have a recording made. During the interrogation, the defendant stated that he lived at the apartment in question and admitted ownership of the .22 caliber pistol. He denied ownership of the nine millimeter pistol, stating that it belonged to one J.P. Robinson, who also lived in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">At trial, the defendant repeatedly requested an instruction, as mandated by the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGiambattista, </em>442 Mass. 423, 447-449 (2004), relating to the lack of a recording of the interrogation. The judge declined to give the instruction, basing his reasoning on the evidence that the defendant refused to have a recording made.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">During the trial, the jury submitted a question to the judge asking whether the police made a\u00f1y attempts to verify the defendant\u2019s statement that the nine millimeter pistol belonged to Robinson. The judge allowed the testifying officer to state that he spoke to Robinson. The judge did not allow the witness to elucidate what Robinson told him, as it would be hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number><em>Discussion. </em>The Supreme Judicial Court has held that \u201ca defendant whose interrogation has not been reliably preserved by means of a complete electronic recording should be entitled, on request, to a cautionary instruction concerning the use of such evidence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGiambattista, supra </em>at 447. The trial judge should instruct the jury that \u201cthe State\u2019s highest court has expressed a preference that such interrogations be recorded whenever practicable, and . . . because of the absence of any recording of the interrogation in the case before them, they should weigh evidence of the defendant\u2019s alleged statement with great caution and care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447-448. Where an audio recording was not made, \u201cthe instruction is mandatory.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barbosa, </em>457 Mass. 773, 801 (2010), cert, denied, 131 S. Ct. 2441 (2011).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">In the instant case, it is undisputed that the defendant was subject to a custodial interrogation that was not recorded. While evidence suggested that the defendant refused to have a recording made, this does not vitiate the need for the <em>DiGiambattista </em>instruction. The Commonwealth points to no case law to support this contention; the fact that no evidence of any refusal to be recorded was present in <em>DiGiambattista </em>itself does not make the <em>DiGiambattista </em>rule inapplicable here.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As the court there stated, \u201c[i]t is of course permissible for the prosecution to address any reasons or justifications that would explain why no recording was made, leaving it to the jury to assess what weight they should give to the lack of a recording. The mere presence of such reasons or justifications, however, does not obviate the need for the cautionary instruction.\u201d <em>DiGiambattista, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number><em>supra </em>at 448-449.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Consequently, it was error for the judge to decline the defendant\u2019s request for an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">Based on the evidence in the case, we cannot fairly or reasonably conclude that the error did not prejudice the defendant. The Commonwealth\u2019s theory of possession depended on the defendant\u2019s admission, during interrogation, that he owned the .22 caliber pistol that was found under a sofa cushion and in immediate proximity to the nine millimeter pistol that formed the basis of the charge. Had the instruction been given, it would have provided the jury with a basis to discount or disregard the admission, in which case the Commonwealth\u2019s case would have been materially weaker.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On this record we cannot say \u201cthat the error did not influence the jury, or had but very slight effect.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>79 Mass. App. Ct. 670, 680 (2011), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>431 Mass. 282, 288, cert, denied, 531 U.S. 1020 (2000).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">\n<em>Judgments reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">\n<em>Verdicts set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b117-15\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiGiambattista, </em>442 Mass. 423 (2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b118-8\">The judge did, however, give a humane practice instruction. But during the defendant\u2019s closing argument, when counsel referred to the police officers\u2019 failure to record the interview, the judge admonished, \u201cCounsel, just stick to facts, if you would, please.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b119-6\">As has recently been made explicit, \u201crecorded interviews are designed to enhance the evidentiary accuracy of what was said by all participants in the interview, thereby safeguarding in equal measure the interests of the defendant, the prosecution, and the society at large.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>78 Mass. App. Ct. 714, 716 n.2 (2011).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b119-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drummond, </em>76 Mass. App. Ct. 625 (2010), decided after the present case was tried, this court reviewed a case involving a closely related problem. There, the trial judge instructed the jury that \u201cthey only needed to consider the [DiGiambattista] instruction if they found that the defendant \u2018was not advised of a right to have this statement recorded and that he did not decline the recording.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 628. We determined that this was error, although neither preserved nor giving rise to a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice on the facts of that case. <em>Id. </em>at 630.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b120-8\">Because the required instruction will likely be given after the close of the evidence and, moreover, after closing arguments, we consider it axiomatic that the \u201creasons or justifications\u201d contemplated by <em>DiGiambattista </em>can be provided as part of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b120-9\">The remaining evidence, in its entirety, was that two firearms, one of them inoperable, were found in the apartment; that there were multiple people in addition to the defendant in the apartment when the police conducted the raid; that another person was in the living room with the defendant when police burst in; and that the defendant was seen fleeing the room where the firearms were found when police breached the door.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b120-10\">We do not address the defendant\u2019s argument regarding the judge\u2019s interruption during closing remarks when trial counsel was referring to the lack of a recording, or regarding the admission of certain testimony in response to a question posed by the jury, as we do not anticipate a recurrence if the case is retried.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
