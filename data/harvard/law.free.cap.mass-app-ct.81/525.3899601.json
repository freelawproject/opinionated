The trial judge denied the motion and the defendant appealed. We consolidated his appeal from the denial of that motion with his direct appeal, in which the defendant presents the additional claims that (1) his two convictions of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon were duplicative of his two mayhem convictions, (2) the victim was not properly qualified to testify about her medical condition, and (3) the jury instructions were flawed.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">We summarize the facts the jury could have found, leaving certain details for discussion with the relevant issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-11\">At about 6:00 p.m. on February 20, 2006, the defendant entered his cousin\u2019s apartment, where he had been staying for several days. In addition to his cousin, Brenda DeJesus, her four year old son and her boyfriend, Justin Ferrier, lived in the apartment. Ferrier testified that shortly thereafter, he came out of the bedroom to light a cigarette, and the defendant asked for help getting something he had dropped under the bathroom sink. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Perrier bent down, the defendant grabbed his forehead and tried to slice his throat with a six-inch steak knife. Perrier got his fingers between the blade and his neck, and the defendant sliced his fingers and gouged his forearm. The defendant accused Perrier of robbing him. After cutting his fingers, the defendant started stabbing Perrier in the head, neck, and face, while telling Perrier he was a gangster. At one point when the defendant stabbed Perrier in the temple, the blade snapped off the handle and fell to the floor. The defendant and Perrier then struggled to get the blade. The defendant got it and continued to stab Perrier.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">From the bedroom, DeJesus heard a scuffle. She later realized it was coming from the bathroom. There, she saw the defendant standing over Perrier, punching him, as Perrier was on the floor trying to cover his head with his arms. It was only when she got closer, and tried to push the defendant away, that he turned on her and she could see he was holding a knife. The defendant tried to cut her throat and then stabbed her head, the back of her neck, and her fingers. The more she fought the angrier the defendant became, until finally she was on the floor. He told her he \u201cwould get [her] where it would hurt [her]\u201d and sliced her face.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Dejesus\u2019s four year old son, who was watching, screamed and yelled for the defendant to stop. The defendant stopped for a minute, and DeJesus played dead; she then crawled to her son, grabbed him, and fled the apartment. She went to a neighbor\u2019s apartment on the second floor. The defendant and Perrier fought for a few more seconds, before the defendant stopped and ran out of the bathroom. Femer followed and asked him where DeJesus was. The defendant said, \u201cFuck her. She\u2019s dead.\u201d Perrier followed the blood trail to the second-floor apartment. There, he saw DeJesus with her son. Perrier estimated the defendant had stabbed him more than fifteen times.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The police were dispatched to the scene at about 7:00 p.m. and arrived before the ambulance. They saw bloody footprints all over the floor. The most blood was in the bathroom, all over the room and on the door. The knife handle was stuck on the shower curtain in a pool of blood. Officer Vardaro began to administer first aid to DeJesus, who was covered in blood and appeared to be losing consciousness. Officer Czarnowski at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>tended to Ferrier, who was in the kitchen. Vardaro saw blood coming out of Dejesus\u2019s back and put pressure on those wounds. When Vardaro tried to replace the small washcloth on Dejesus\u2019s face because blood was pouring out of it, \u201cher cheek had stuck to that towel and pulled away and [Vardaro] could see right into her teeth through the side.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">DeJesus and Ferrier were initially taken to Brockton Hospital, but they were quickly transferred to Boston hospitals. DeJesus went to Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, where she remained for five days. Ferrier was admitted to Beth Israel Hospital, where he was also treated for approximately five days.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The defense called no witnesses but played for the jury a video recording of the defendant\u2019s interview with the police.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In his statement, the defendant claimed that shortly after he entered the apartment, Ferrier asked to talk to him in the bathroom. When he went into the bathroom, Ferrier was bending down and accused the defendant of taking Perrier\u2019s Oxycontin pills. According to the defendant, Ferrier lunged at him and was trying to stab him with a knife. DeJesus joined the fray and jumped on his back. The defendant described \u201cthese two people jumping on me. One is choking me and the other is trying to stab me. So I snapped the knife . . . .\u201d Then he \u201cblacked out.\u201d The defendant said both Ferrier and DeJesus were \u201call fucked up [on Oxycontin]\u201d and that he was afraid they were \u201cgoing to kill me.\u201d The next thing he remembered was seeing a lot of blood. He told the police that he \u201cwould never hurt his cousin.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\"><em>Discussion. </em>1. <em>Duplicative convictions. </em>The defendant argues that his conviction of assault and battery by means of dangerous weapon on DeJesus is duplicative of the mayhem conviction related to DeJesus. He repeats the claim with respect to the same charges involving Ferrier. Because this issue was not raised below, the defendant must show that the error, if any, created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass. 217, 225 (2005), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1216 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Assault and battery committed by means of a dangerous weapon is a lesser included offense of second-branch mayhem,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as charged here. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>425 Mass. 718, 721-723 (1997). Convictions of both the greater and lesser offenses are permitted as long as they \u201crest on separate and distinct acts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>445 Mass, at 225. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berrios, </em>71 Mass. App. Ct. 750, 753 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">Here, although the better practice would have been for the judge to instruct the jury specifically that the convictions had to be based on separate acts, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>429 Mass. 502, 509 (1999), the jury nonetheless received substantial guidance as to how they should view the evidence. We thus discern no reversible error (if error at all) in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">With respect to Dejesus, it was clear at trial that the mayhem charge was based on the vicious attack to her face. Only after Dejesus had succumbed to multiple stab wounds and had fallen to the floor did the defendant tell her that he \u201cwould get [her] where it would hurt [her]\u201d and drive the knife into her face hard enough to separate a portion of her cheek from her head. This blow stood in stark contrast to the other wounds he inflicted, not merely because of the accompanying statement and the wound\u2019s severity, but because the wound was to her face, an area of the body for which a disfiguring injury is particularly egregious. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, 61 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 261, 262 (2006) (undisputed that damage to victim\u2019s face, caused by contact with heater, was of type contemplated by mayhem statute); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McPherson, </em>74 Mass. App. Ct. 125, 128-129 (2009) (targeting of face with baseball bat).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">The prosecutor emphasized in his closing argument what was obvious from the evidence, that with respect to the mayhem charge, the defendant\u2019s statement when \u201che slice[d] her face open\u201d was instructive. We note that when defense counsel moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>for a required finding of not guilty, he impliedly recognized that the defendant\u2019s statement combined with the injury to Dejesus\u2019s face was the basis for the mayhem charge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">With respect to Ferrier, the evidence may have been less dramatic, but it was no less clear. During the opening struggle, the defendant sliced Perrier\u2019s fingers and arm, leaving a disfiguring injury. The rest of the defendant\u2019s blows were directed primarily to Perrier\u2019s head, neck, and back. The prosecutor drew the jury\u2019s attention to these two separate and distinct series of blows in his closing argument when he stated that the defendant \u201cslashe[d] at the hand so much that it injure[d] the hand. And there is a photograph. It shows the gouge in Mr. Perrier\u2019s forearm that resulted from that. And then he continue [d] to stab him. Multiple stab wounds to the shoulder, to the chest, to the temple.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The likelihood that the jury would have differentiated the separate and distinct acts that maimed DeJesus and Ferrier from the multiple additional stab wounds inflicted upon them by the defendant is bolstered by the judge\u2019s instruction on the elements of both offenses. With respect to mayhem, the judge used the term \u201cmaim\u201d or \u201cdisfigure\u201d no fewer than eighteen times to describe the crime and specifically instructed no fewer than six times that the offense requires proof of an injury that \u201cdisfigures, cripples, or inflicts serious or permanent physical injury.\u201d In contrast, the judge instructed the jury that the crime of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon requires a \u201ctouching\u201d of the victim, \u201chowever slight,\u201d and that the touching must be committed by means of a dangerous weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>In sum, the presentation of the evidence that elucidated a series of separate and distinct acts, combined with the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument and the judge\u2019s instructions that clearly differentiated the two offenses, leads us to conclude there was no substantial risk of the convictions of mayhem being based on the same acts as were the convictions of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>67 Mass. App. Ct. at 265; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>80 Mass. App. Ct. 528, 530 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">2. <em>Medical testimony. </em>DeJesus testified without objection that in the two years that followed, a knife wound she had suffered to her throat during the incident, which had \u201ccut into [her] main artery,\u201d led to further tearing of the artery and caused her \u201cto have a stroke and have to have reconstructive surgery on [her] main artery.\u201d The defendant argues that only a properly qualified expert is competent to give such testimony and that its erroneous admission created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. We disagree, as the evidence was unrelated to any live issue at trial. Even if we assume that the testimony should have been excluded, the defendant has not articulated how the evidence influenced the result, nor do we discern any such effect from the record.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">On the appeal from the denial of his motion for new trial, the defendant\u2019s argument pressed under the rubric of ineffective assistance fares no better. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balliro, </em>437 Mass. 163, 170 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">3. <em>Jury instructions. </em>The defendant argues that the judge gave improper instructions in the following four instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">a. <em>Self-defense. </em>The defendant argues on appeal, as he did at the conclusion of the judge\u2019s final instructions to the jury, that the judge should have included additional language specifically elucidating factors relevant to the third element of self-defense \u2014 the so-called proportionality element \u2014 in conformity with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>the teaching of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em>351 Mass. 203, 212 (1966).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The third element of self-defense, as correctly explained by the judge, is that the defendant \u201cmust have used no more force than was reasonably necessary in the circumstances to defend himself.\u201d See <em>id. </em>at 211. While it would have been advisable to accede to the defendant\u2019s request, we discern no reversible error in the circumstances of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The judge repeatedly instructed the jury on all three elements of self-defense,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> including the above definition of the third element, and the defendant does not contend otherwise. The defendant has not shown that more was required here.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caramanica, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 376, 378 (2000), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Berrio, </em>43 Mass. App. Ct. 836, 838 (1997) (\u201cA trial judge is not constrained to put the instructions into any particular words; \u2018rather, [the judge] is required only to provide a full and accurate explanation of the governing law applicable to a particular case\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">b. <em>Witness\u2019s prior statements. </em>Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention on appeal, the judge\u2019s instruction to the jury regarding the permitted use of prior inconsistent statements did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>limit their consideration of the defendant\u2019s video-recorded statement. The judge gave the following explanation to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">\u201c[I]f a person comes into court and makes a statement on a particular topic, and had previously given a statement on the same topic,. . . and the two statements are inconsistent with each other, then we will allow into evidence the statement that was given before the trial on the issue of whether you wish to believe the trial testimony of that witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The jury would not have applied this instruction to the defendant\u2019s recorded statement where he clearly did not testify at trial. Moreover, the judge explicitly informed the jury that the evidence in the case consisted of \u201cthe testimony of the witnesses\u201d and \u201cforty-one exhibits.\u201d The defendant\u2019s recorded statement was among the forty-one exhibits; it was not introduced as a prior inconsistent statement. The prosecutor began his closing argument with the observation that the defendant\u2019s \u201cstatement is in evidence. And that evidence can be evaluated by you when you think about this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">c. <em>Disbelief of a witness. </em>The defendant concedes, as he must, that the judge correctly instructed the jury in accordance with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiRusso, </em>60 Mass. App. Ct. 235, 241 (2003), that \u201cdisbelief of a witness\u2019s testimony does not constitute evidence of the contrary proposition.\u201d The defendant argues however, somewhat confusingly, that this instruction prevented the jury from considering their disbelief of Dejesus\u2019s and Perrier\u2019s testimony as proof that their version did not happen and, therefore, prevented the jury from considering their statements as evidence of consciousness of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">As already mentioned, disbelief of any statement \u2014 including, in this case, disbelief of the victims\u2019 testimony that they were injured during an entirely unprovoked attack \u2014 does not alone establish the opposite conclusion. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Michaud, </em>389 Mass. 491, 498 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Camerano, </em>42 Mass. App. Ct. 363, 367 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">To the extent the defendant claims the instruction prevented the jury from using the victims\u2019 purportedly false statements as consciousness of guilt evidence, the claim misses the mark. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Consciousness of guilt evidence,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> by definition, is only relevant where it permits an inference of <em>a defendant\u2019s guilt </em>of the crime charged. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stuckich, </em>450 Mass. 449, 453 (2008), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Toney, 385 Mass. 575, 584 &amp; n.4 (1982). Consciousness of guilt evaporates as an evidentiary tool in the absence of a charged crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">d. <em>First aggressor instruction. </em>The judge instructed the jury in accordance with <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adjutant, </em>443 Mass. 649, 664 (2005), that they could properly consider Perrier\u2019s past behavior in determining who was the first aggressor. The defendant contends that drawing and using the knife is an act that is additional to being the \u201cfirst aggressor\u201d and that absent an explanation that being the first aggressor <em>may include drawing </em>and using the knife, the instruction is unduly narrow. The defendant parses the language too finely. The instruction and the term \u201cfirst aggressor\u201d include within it the notion of an individual being the first one to draw and use the weapon without a separate explanation to that effect. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Niemic, </em>427 Mass. 718, 720 (1998), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>390 Mass. 308, 313 (1983) (we do not parse language of judge\u2019s final instructions and \u201cscrutiniz[e] bits and pieces removed from their context\u201d). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">4. <em>Motion for new trial. </em>The defendant argues that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for new trial grounded on the following claims of ineffective assistance.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">a. <em>Cross-examination and impeachment. </em>The defendant told police that he had moved in with his cousin a few days earlier and was able to protect her from her boyfriend when he tried to hit her. Discovery revealed, however, that Perrier had reported to the police that the defendant was living there because his mother had thrown him out of her house several days earlier. The defendant argues on appeal, therefore, that counsel was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>ineffective when he asked DeJesus whether she had invited the defendant to stay with her and she responded, \u201cHe came to me and asked if he could stay with me. My aunt, his mother, threw him out of the house.\u201d The defendant also argues that counsel exacerbated the problem by then asking, \u201cYou didn\u2019t ask [the defendant] to come stay with you because you were having problems with [Perrier]?\u201d to which she responded, \u201cNo, I did not. He came and asked me if he could stay. He had nowhere to go.\u201d Even if we assume counsel should not have tried to confirm the defendant\u2019s version of events, the defendant has not shown how this information, unrelated to any live issue at trial, deprived him of \u201can otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). Counsel even had some success in bolstering the defendant\u2019s account when he elicited from Perrier that in the two days preceding this incident, he (Perrier) and DeJesus had been fighting and Perrier had not slept there for a couple of nights.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Nor was counsel ineffective for failing to call the defendant\u2019s mother as a witness, to impeach DeJesus on the basis that his mother did not throw him out. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>433 Mass. 340, 357 (2001) (\u201cGenerally, failure to impeach a witness does not amount to ineffective assistance of counsel\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">b. <em>Failure to prepare. </em>The defendant\u2019s summary claim that errors outlined above occurred because of counsel\u2019s lack of preparation fails for the reasons already noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">\n<em>Order denying motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b572-12\">An indictment for armed assault in a dwelling was dismissed because there was no evidence of an illegal entry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b574-8\">DeJesus testified to the serious extent of her injuries, and her medical records and photographs of her appearance after the attack were put in evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b574-9\">The recording was admitted in evidence, but not played, during the Commonwealth\u2019s case.

L. c. 265, \u00a7 14, . . . applies to \u2018whoever, with intent to maim or disfigure, assaults another person with a dangerous weapon, substance or chemical, and by such assault disfigures, cripples or inflicts serious or permanent physical injury upon such person.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, 61 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 261, 262 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b576-7\">In his argument on the motion, defense counsel plainly acknowledged that the evidence of a specific intent to maim DeJesus was sufficient to go to the jury, and he instead focused on the purported lack of evidence to prove a specific intent to maim Ferrier.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b576-11\">Although the photographic trial exhibits showing Perrier\u2019s injury have not been made part of the record on appeal, it is clear from the trial transcript that they depict significant scarring on his hand. In addition to the prosecutor\u2019s statement recited above, which notably drew no objection, the prosecutor relied on the photographs during the bench conference addressing the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty. The prosecutor argued that \u201cthe pictures show that [Ferrier] received grievous injuries to the fingers, [and] to the forearm.\u201d The defendant did not dispute the point; rather, he argued the evidence of intent to cause those injuries was lacking.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b577-9\">Other than the single statement by the victim, this testimony was not mentioned again during the trial, and the prosecutor omitted any reference to the injury during his closing argument.
