On April 28, 2010, the school committee (collectively, defendants) held a live broadcast meeting in which the plaintiff\u2019s contract extension, among other matters, was to be discussed. Concerned about time, the defendants announced their intention to revisit the plaintiff\u2019s contract on April 30, 2010, at 6:00 p.m. In addition to the oral announcement, the school committee posted a notice on its bulletin board at the high school; the upcoming meeting was also acknowledged on the front page of a local newspaper.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 30, by a vote of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>four to two, the plaintiff\u2019s contract was extended and signed by all parties present, with the exception of the two dissenting school committee members.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">On May 6, 2010, following a town election, a new school committee was formed. On May 18, 2010, an assistant district attorney for the Cape and Islands district issued a letter stating that the April 30 meeting violated the Commonwealth\u2019s open meeting law. The letter stated that all matters undertaken at the meeting were null and void. Several days later, the school committee\u2019s counsel \u201cendorsed\u201d the opinion expressed in the district attorney\u2019s letter. No complaint, however, was ever filed in court to invalidate any actions taken at the April 30 meeting. Rather, in an attempt to cure the deficiencies, the defendants held a subsequent meeting on June 16, 2010. At that meeting, the defendants elected not to renew the plaintiff\u2019s employment and specifically refused to acknowledge the previous extension of her contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\">The plaintiff commenced a civil action seeking specific performance of the employment contract, declaratory relief, relief in the nature of mandamus, and damages on theories of breach of contract and intentional interference with contractual relations. The defendants brought a motion to dismiss pursuant to Mass.R. Civ.R 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 754 (1974), which the judge allowed. We conclude it was error to allow the defendants\u2019 motion, as the plaintiff made sufficient allegations within her verified complaint to overcome that motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Iannacchino </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co., </em>451 Mass. 623, 635-636 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">General Laws c. 39, \u00a7 23B, requires that all meetings of governmental bodies be open to the public and that adequate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>notice be given unless an exception applies. If a violation occurs, the statute authorizes specific individuals to rectify noncompliance by filing a complaint with the Supreme Judicial Court or the Superior Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">The judge went beyond the pleadings to conclude that the public did not have sufficient knowledge of the April 30 meeting, and that in general, high school bulletin boards are of \u201cuncertain accessibility,\u201d and notices thereon, as well as newspaper stories about upcoming public meetings, are inadequate.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As the case was decided on a rule 12(b)(6) motion, the judge could not look beyond the allegations set out in the complaint and the exhibits attached thereto. See <em>Schaer </em>v. <em>Brandeis Univ., </em>432 Mass. 474, 477 (2000). The judge\u2019s findings were premature and limited the plaintiff\u2019s ability to argue both the propriety of the notices and, if they were in fact inadequate, whether the violations were de minimis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">The plaintiff argues that even if the April 30 actions violated the open meeting law, the violation did not operate automatically to invalidate the actions. Instead, the plaintiff contends, judicial intervention was necessary to invalidate her contract extension. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-7\">Statutory text is the \u201cprincipal source of insight into the legislative purpose.\u201d <em>Hoffman </em>v. <em>Howmedica, Inc., </em>373 Mass. 32, 37 (1977). Courts must follow unambiguous statutory language \u201cunless \u2018following the Legislature\u2019s literal command would lead to an absurd result, or one contrary to the Legislature\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>manifest intention.\u2019 \u201d <em>Providence &amp; Worcester R.R. </em>v. <em>Energy Facilities Siting Bd., </em>453 Mass. 135, 142 (2009), quoting from <em>White </em>v. Boston, 428 Mass. 250, 253 (1998). The open meeting law states, in \u00a7 23B, tenth par., that the district attorney \u201cshall enforce the provisions of this section\u201d but then immediately acknowledges, in \u00a7 23B, eleventh and twelfth pars., the court\u2019s authority to invalidate actions taken in an unlawful meeting upon proof of a violation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The normal protocol to invalidate actions is to file a complaint. See and compare <em>District Attorney for the N. Dist. </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Wayland, </em>455 Mass. 561, 562 (2009); <em>Puglisi </em>v. <em>School Comm, of Whitman, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 142, 143 (1981); <em>District Attorney for the N.W. Dist. </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Sunderland, </em>11 Mass. App. Ct. 663, 663 (1981). See also <em>Bartell </em>v. <em>Wellesley Hous. Authy., </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 306, 309-310 (1990) (statute authorizes courts to order actions taken in violation of the open meeting law to be invalidated; the particular remedy for a violation is a matter for the exercise of sound judicial discretion).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Such complaints must be filed timely. In <em>Benevolent &amp; Protective Order of Elks, Lodge No. 65 </em>v. <em>City Council of Lawrence, </em>403 Mass. 563, 565-566 (1988), the Supreme Judicial Court opined that the city council\u2019s actions in violation of the open meeting law would not be invalidated because the complaint was untimely and beyond the twenty-one day time frame. See <em>id. </em>at 565 (\u201cSection 23B provides a strict statute of limitations for complaints seeking to invalidate actions taken at meetings which violate its provisions. The statute allows a court to invalidate any action taken at any meeting at which any provision of [\u00a7 23B] has been violated, provided that such complaint is filed within twenty-one days of the date when such action is made public\u201d [quotation omitted]). See also <em>McCrea </em>v. <em>Flaherty, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>71 Mass. App. Ct. 637, 638 n.3 (2008) (Superior Court judge refused to invalidate a city council vote because the plaintiffs did not file their action within twenty-one days).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">To collaterally attack a defect for the purpose of invalidating actions, only three parties can bring an action. See note 4, <em>supra. </em>As previously noted, no such complaint to invalidate the April 30 meeting was filed within the twenty-one-day window. The district attorney\u2019s office was put on notice of the violation and had the opportunity to file a complaint to invalidate the contract. Instead, it offered an opinion letter with no legal effect. The judgment therefore must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">Deciding as we do, there is no need to discuss the correctness of the denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion to amend, see <em>Vakil </em>v. <em>Vakil, </em>450 Mass. 411, 417 (2008), or to comment on the plaintiff\u2019s allegations relating to the tort of intentional interference with contractual relations. See <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>NetCentric Corp., </em>433 Mass. 465, 476 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b858-17\">The plaintiff does not allege that, as required by the open meeting law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>notice of the critical meeting was \u201cpublicly posted in the office of [the town] clerk or on the principal official bulletin board of such . . . town\u201d \u201cat least forty-eight hours\u201d before the meeting. See G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B, sixth par., inserted by St. 1975, c. 303, \u00a7 3. We note that G. L. c. 39, \u00a7\u00a7 23A-23C (statute), has since been repealed. See St. 2009, c. 28, \u00a7 20, effective July 1, 2010. The present matter is governed by the statute as in effect before July 1, 2010.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b859-10\">When the opportunity arises, rather than moving to dismiss, parties ought to include affidavits or depositions to elevate the case to the summary judgment stage. See <em>Kirkland Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>James, </em>39 Mass. App. Ct. 559, 564-565 (1995) (Brown, J., concurring). Here, the plaintiff\u2019s verified complaint could have been treated as a step toward that result.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b860-8\">A complaint may be brought by \u201cthree or more registered voters, by the attorney general, or by the district attorney of the county in which the city or town is located.\u201d G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B, eleventh par., as amended by St. 1976, c. 397, \u00a7 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b860-10\">These findings were made without any information on the record describing the normal protocol the defendants engaged in when publishing notices about future meetings. See <em>Freedman </em>v. <em>Freedman, </em>49 Mass. App. Ct. 519, 521 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b860-12\">The defendants do not suggest that the notice of the April 28, 2010, meeting was inadequate. As to the April 30 meeting, the judge observed that because the meeting recessed on April 28, 2010, at 9:42 p.m. and reconvened on April 30, 2010, at 6:00 p.m., any public notice posted after 6:00 p.m. on April 28 failed to give the forty-eight hours\u2019 notice required by the statute. See G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B, sixth par. But see <em>Tebo </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Shrewsbury, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 618, 623 (1986), <em>S.C. </em>sub nom. <em>Worcester Sand &amp; Gravel Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Fire Prevention Regulations, </em>400 Mass. 464 (1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The statute provides that, \u201c[u]pan proof of failure by any governmental body or by any member or officer thereof\" to comply with the provisions of the open meeting law, the courts \u201cshall issue an appropriate order requiring such governmental body or member or officer thereof to carry out such provisions at future meetings . . . .\u201d G. L. c. 39, \u00a7 23B, eleventh par. Section 23B continues, \u201cSuch order may invalidate any action taken at any meeting at which any provision of this section has been violated, provided that such complaint is filed within twenty-one days of the date when such action is made public.\u201d G.
