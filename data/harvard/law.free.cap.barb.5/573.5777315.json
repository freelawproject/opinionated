The cause was tried on the merits, and judgment was rendered for the plaintiff, for $60 damages and $5 costs. The defendant has demurred to the declaration, assigning for cause, that as the plaintiff before the justice claimed damages for one hundred dollars <em>and over, </em>the justice had no jurisdiction to try the cause; and that of course the judgment is void. If the plaintiff before the justice had claimed one hundred and fifty dollars, or <em>any </em>other sum, more than one hundred, the justice would have been ousted of jurisdiction, according to the decisions in <em>Yager </em>v. <em>Hannah, </em>(6 <em>Hill, </em>631;) <em>Bowditch </em>v. <em>Salisbury, </em>(9 <em>John. </em>366.) In the latter case it was held that although the notes declared on exceeded a justice\u2019s jurisdiction, yet as the, plaintiff only claimed damages to the amount of his jurisdiction, it was well enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">This case is different from the foregoing, and all the cases which have, been cited.. In my judgment the declaration only claims damages to one hundred dollars. The words \u201c <em>and over,\u201d </em>are void for uncertainty. They express nothing. They would not be sufficient to authorize a plaintiff, in this court, to take a judgment on a verdict beyond the sum expressed; and the plaintiff would be required to remit the excess if the verdict was for more. They have no greater effect than if an. <em>\u201c </em>&amp;c.\u201d were added to the declaration. When taken all together the pleading amounts to this ; that the plaintiff has sustained, damages to the amount of over one hundred dollars, but nevertheless is willing to take judgment for one hundred dollars.. This is clearly good, within <em>Salisbury </em>v. <em>Bowditch, </em>(9 <em>John. </em>366,) which is in point.'</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">I think the plaintiff is entitled to judgment on the demurrer, With leave to the defendant to plead on payment of costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
