Griffin marketed a Vehicle Protection Plan (\"VPP\") through direct mail solicitation to Ohio residents. The VPP is a contract between a car owner and Griffin which covers the service needed due to a mechanical breakdown of specified parts of the car. An investigation was conducted and subsequently, ODI held a hearing to determine whether the VPP sold to Ohio consumers by appellant was, in fact, a contract of insurance and subject to ODI's regulations. Griffin is not licensed in Ohio for the purpose of selling insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-29\">After the hearing, the hearing officer issued his report and recommendation and determined that the VPP was a contract of insurance, that appellant was in violation of R.C. 3905.42, and that the sale and solicitation of the VPP constituted unfair, deceptive and misleading acts in violation of R.C. 3901.20 and 3901.21. In adopting the hearing officer'sreport and recommendation, ODI issued a cease and desist order to Griffin, pursuant to R.C. 3901.22(B). Thereafter, appellee appealed ODI's order to the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas pursuant to R.C. 119.12. The matter was submitted to the trial court on the briefs and the trial court concluded that, as a matter of law, appellee was a warrantor and not an insurer. Thus, the trial court reversed ODI's January 20,1988 order and thereafter, ODI filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-30\">ODI assertsthe following three assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>\"I.

THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN IGNORING THE STANDARD OF REVIEW UNDER R.C. 119.12 BY FAILING TO CONSIDER THE ENTIRE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">\"III. THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN IGNORING THE STANDARD OF REVIEW UNDER R.C. 119.12 BY SUBSTITUTING ITS JUDGMENT FOR THAT OF THE AGENCY IN RESOLVING DIVERGENT EVIDENCE.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">In its first assignment of error, appellant asserts that the trial court erred in its interpretation of R.C. 3905.42 when it determined that, as a matter of law, appellee was a warrantor rather than an insurer. In order to determine whether appellee is subject to R.C. 3905.42, this court must determine whether the trial court properly found that appellee is a warrantor as described in <em>State, ex rel. Herbert, </em>v. <em>Std. Oil Co. </em>(1941), 138 Ohio St. 376, and not an insurer, as ODI had concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"An8\">R.C. 3905.42 provides as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">\u00a73905.42 Insurancebusinessmustbe authorized.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-9\"><em>\"No company, </em>corporation, or association, whether organized in this state or elsewhere, <em>shall engage </em>either directly or indirectly in this state <em>in the business of insurance, or enter into any contracts substantially amounting to insurance, or in any manner aid therein, or engage in the business of guaranteeing against liability, loss, or damage, </em>including guaranteeing the fidelity of persons holding places of public or private trust, who are required to, or in their trust capacity do, receive, hold, control, or disburse public or private property, or transacting the business of guaranteeing the performance of contracts other than insurance policies, or of executing or guaranteeing bonds or undertakings required or permitted in actions or proceedings, or allowed by law, <em>unless it is expressly authorized by the laws of this state, and the laws regulating it and applicable thereto, haoe been complied with.\" </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">The pertinent language of appellant's Vehicle Protection Plan states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-11\">\"VEHICLE PROTECTION PLAN</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0i\">\"Your Safeguard Against Costly Mechanical Breakdown</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-12\">\"Please read this entire agreement to understand the terms, limitations and exclusions, and special provisions which apply to your Vehicle Protection Plan.

Respondents agreed to repair or replace those parts of the resident's motor vehicle listed in the Plan, subject to a deductible provision.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-15\">It should be noted that the appellee, Griffin Systems Inc, is neither the manufacturer nor the seller of the goods in question. Therefore, it is incumbent upon this court to determine whether the VPP offered to the consumer, possesses the distinguishing characteristics of a warranty as excepted by the Supreme Court in <em>Herbert, supra, </em>or, is in fact, insurance as contemplated by R.C. 3905.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-16\">In State, ex rel. Duffy, Atty. Genl., v. <em>Western Auto Supply Co. </em>(1938), 134 Ohio St. 163, the Supreme Court of Ohio held in paragraph four of the syllabus that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-17\">\"A contract whereby the vendor of automobile tires undertakes to guarantee the tires sold against defects in material or workmanship without limit as to time, mileage or service, and further expressly guarantees them for a specified period against 'blowouts, cuts, bruises, rim-cuts, under-inflation, wheels out of alignment, faulty brakes or other road hazards that may render the tire unfit for further service (except fire or theft),' or contracts to indemnify the purchaser 'should the tire fail within the replacement period' specified, without limitation as to cause of such 'failure,' is a contract 'substantially amounting to insurance' within the provisions of Section 665, General Code, which requires such guarantor or insurer to comply with the laws of the state authorizing and regulating the business of insurance.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-18\">The <em>Duffy </em>case was quickly followed by <em>Herbert supra, </em>in which the Supreme Court followed paragraph four of the syllabus in <em>Duffy </em>but in paragraph five of the syllabus in <em>Herbert, </em>it held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-19\">\"A written warranty delivered to a purchaser, representing that the articles sold are so well and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>carefully manufactured that they will give satisfactory service under ordinary usage for a specified length of time, and providing for an adjustment in the event of failure from faulty constructionor materials, but expressly excluding happenings not connected with imperfections in the articles themselves, is not a contract substantially amounting to insurance within the meaning of Section 665, General Code.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In <em>Duffy, </em>the Supreme Court stated at page 167-170 that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">it* * * it is essential that the distinction between warranty and insurance be clearly stated. Section 8392, [R.C. 1302.26] General Code, defines an express warranty as follows: 'Any affirmation of fact or any promise by the seller relating to the goods is an express warranty if the natural tendency of such affirmation or promise is to induce the buyer to purchase the goods, and if the buyer purchases the goods relying thereon.' A warranty promises indemnity against defects in the article sold, while insurance indemnifies against loss or damage resulting from perils outside of and unrelated defects in the article itself.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">Thereafter, in <em>Herbert, supra, </em>the Supreme Court discussed the concept of \"warranty\" at page 381 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">\"With these observations as a background, we turn to a discussion of what is a warranty and what is a contract possessing features of insurance. Relating to the sale of commodities, a warranty has been defined as a statement or representation having to do with the kind, quality, variety or title of the goods sold. * * *\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">At page 383, the court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-10\">\"Certainly, Section 665, General Code, was not designed to apply to purely commercial transactions connected with which warranties are made for the purpose of inducing sales and creating good will * * *.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">The Franklin Country Court of Appeals in the case of <em>Denna </em>v. <em>Chrysler Corp. </em>(1964), 1 Ohio App. 2d 582, held that \"* * * a warranty is an affirmation of fact or a promise relating to goods made to induce a purchase. See <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Toni Home Permanent Co. </em>(1958), 167 Ohio St. 244. * * *\" <em>Id. </em>at 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">Therefore, without considering whether the VPP insures against defects other than those which occur because of outside or through intervening circumstances, it is apparent that the VPP plan is not a warranty proposed by a manufacturer or seller used for the purpose of inducing or increasing sales of the product in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">The principle difference in the contract proposed by the appellee and the warranty offered by Standard Oil in the <em>Herbert </em>court case, is that the appellee is not the warrantor of a product manufactured or sold by the appellee but is warranting or guaranteeing a product manufactured and sold by a third-party. The <em>Herbert </em>case did not exclude all warranties or guaranties from the control of Section 665, General Code (R.C. 3905.42), only those warranties guaranteeing \"satisfactory service under ordinary usage\" of products being sold to a purchaser by the manufacturer or seller of that product. Therefore, Griffin Systems Inc., the appellee herein, is subject to the dictates of R.C. 3905.42. The first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-14\">Appellant's second and third assignments of error are interrelated and will be discussed together. In its second and third assignments of error, appellant asserts that the trial court did not apply the prescribed standard of review pursuant to R.C. 119.12 since it failed to consider the entire administrative record and substituted its judgment for that of appellant's. The pertinent sections of R.C. 119.12 provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-17\">\"Within thirty days after receipt of notice of appeal from an order in any case in which a hearing is required by sections 119.01 to 119.13 of the Revised Code, the agency shall prepare certify to the court a complete record of the proceedings in the casa * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-18\">\"Unless otherwise provided by law, in the hearing of the appeal, the court is confined to the record as certified to it by the agency. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-19\">\"The court may affirm the order of the agency complained of in the appeal if it finds, upon consideration of the entire record and such additional evidence as the court has admitted, that the order is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with law. In the absence of such a finding, it may reverse, vacate, or modify the order or make such other ruling as is supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and is in accordance with law. The court shall award compensation for fees in accordance with section 2335.39 of the Revised Code to a prevailing party, other than an agency, in an appeal filed pursuant to this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-20\">\"The judgment of the corut shall be final and conclusive unless reversed, vacated, or modified on appeal. Such appeals may be taken either by the party or the agency, shall proceed as in the case of appeals in civil actions, and shall be pursuant to the Rules of Appellate Procedure and, to the extent not in conflict with those rules, Chapter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>2505. of the Revised Code. Such appeal by the agency shall be taken on questions of law relating to the constitutionality construction,or interpretation of statutes and rules of the agency, and in such appeal the court may also review and determine the correctness of the judgment of the court of common pleas that the order of the agency is not supported by any reliable, probative, and substantial evidence in the entire record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">\"The court shall certify its judgment to such agency or take such other action necessary to give its judgment effect.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">As required by R.C. 119.12, a complete administrative record was before the trial court. Absent substantial evidence to the contrary, this court must assume the propriety of the proceedings in the trial court. See <em>Knapp </em>v. <em>Edward Laboratories </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St. 2d 197. There is no evidence in the record before this court which would indicate that the trial court deliberately excluded the consideration of the testimony of appellant's witnesses or disregarded any of the other evidence presented by appellant. The trial court'sdecision turned on a question of law and the most significant piece of evidence was the language contained in the VPP plan offered to consumers by appellee. Although this court has determined that the trial court reached the incorrect legal conclusion, that is not to say that the trial court did not conduct a proper review pursuant to R.C. 119.12. Accordingly, appellant's second and third assignments of error are not well-taken and are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Appellee has filed a motion to dismiss and has asserted that appellant could not file this appeal since the superintendent of the Department of Insurance has a limited right to appeal only upon \"* * * questions of law relating to the constitutionality, construction, or interpretation of statutes and rules of the agency. * * *\" See R.C. 119.12. Appellee asserts that the determination of the trial court was a factual determination as to whether or not an extended service warranty constitutes insurance. Appellee's motion to dismiss must be denied since the issue before the trial court and this court is whether, as a matter of law, the VPP plan offered to consumers by Griffin constitutes insurance and thus, is within the regulatory purview ofR.C. 3905.42. Clearly, the issuebefore the trial court and this court presented a question of law regarding the interpretation of R.C. 3905.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Based on the foregoing, appellant's first assignment of error is well-taken and is sustained. Appellant's second and third assignments of error are not well-taken and are overruled. Appellee's motion to dismiss is denied and the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">\n<em>Motion to dismiss denied.
