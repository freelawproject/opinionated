The trial court found Vanderwyst guilty and sentenced her. Vanderwyst appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-21\">The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial court abused its discretion in ordering incarceration of Vanderwyst as part of the imposition of sentence Sentencing is within the sound discretion of the trial court and is generally not disturbed upon review where the sentence is within the confines of the valid statute. <em>Toledo </em>v. <em>Reasonover </em>(1965), 5 Ohio St. 2d 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-22\">Vanderwyst was convicted of violating R.C. 2903.07, vehicular homicide, a misdemeanor of the first degree. R.C. 2929.21 provides that a misdemeanor of the first degree is punishable by a term of imprisonment of not more than six months and/or a fine of not more than $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-23\">R.C. 2929.22, imposing sentence for misdemeanor, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-24\">\"(A) In determining whether to impose imprisonment or a fine, or both, for misdemean- or, and in determining the term of imprisonment and the amount and method of payment of a fine, the court shall consider the risk that the offender will commit another offense and the need for protecting the public therefrom, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history, character, and condition of the offender and his need for correctional or rehabilitative treatment, and the ability and resources of the offender and the nature of the burden that payment of a fine will impose on him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-25\">\"(B) The following do not control the court's discretion, but shall be considered in favor of imposing imprisonment for misdemeanor:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-26\">\"(1) The offender is a repeat or dangerous offender;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-27\">\"(2) Regardless of whether or not the offender knew the age of the victim, the victim of the offense was sixty-five years of age or older or permanently and totally disabled at the time of the commission of the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-28\">\"(C) The criteria listed in section 2929.12 of the Revised Code, favoring shorter terms of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>imprisonment for felony, do not control the court'sdiscretion,butshallbe considered against imposing imprisonment for misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-5\">\"(D) The criteria listed in divisions (B) and (C) of this section shall not be construed to limit the matters which may be considered in determining whether to impose imprisonment for misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">It* 5fS * 11</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">In addition, R.C. 2929.12(C) [as referenced in R.C. 2929.22(C)] requires the following criteria to be considered by the trial court against imposing imprisonment for a misdemeanor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">\"(1) The offense neither caused nor threatened serious physical harm to persons or property, or the offender did not contemplate that it would do so;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-9\">\"(2) The offense was the result of circumstances unlikely to recur;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-10\">\"(3) The victim of the offense induced or facilitated it;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-11\">\"(4) There are substantial grounds tending to excuse or justify the offense, though failing to establish a defense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-12\">\"(5) The offender acted under strong provocation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-13\">\"(6) The offender has no history of prior delinquency or criminal activity, or has led a law-abiding life for a substantial time before commission of the present offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-14\">\"(7) The offender is likely to respond quickly to correctional or rehabilitative treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-15\">It* sfc \u00bfis \u2022\u2022</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-16\">None of these criteria controls the court's discretion and the court may consider additional relevant factors. <em>Columbus </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1987), 39 Ohio App. 3d 87, 88-89. Here, the trial court stated it considered all of the criteria set forth in R.C. 2951.02 for and against probation or suspension of sentence R.C. 2951.02 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-17\">\"(A) In determining whether to suspend sentence of imprisonment and place an offender on probation or to otherwise suspend an offender's sentence of imprisonment pursuant to division (D) (2) or (4) of section 2929.51 of the Revised Code, the court shall consider the risk that the offender will commit another offense and the need for protecting the public from the risk, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the history, character, and condition of the offender.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-18\">\"(B) The following do not control the court's discretion, but

id=\"b463-34\">\"(3) The offender is in need of correctional or rehabilitative treatment that can best be provided by his commitment to a penal or reformatory institution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-35\">\"(4) Regardless of whether the offender knew the age of the victim, the victim of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>offense was sixty-five years of age or older or permanently and totally disabled at the time of the commission of the offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-5\">\"(E) The criteria listed in divisions (B) and (D) of this section shall not be construed to limit the matters that may be considered in determining whether to suspend sentence of imprisonment and place an offender on probation or to otherwise suspend

id=\"b464-7\">In addition, the trial court considered R.C. 2929.51(D) which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">\"(D) At the time of sentencing and after sentencing, when imprisonment for misdemeanor is imposed, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-9\">\"(1) Suspend the sentence and place the offender on probation pursuant to section 2951.02 of the Revised Code;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-10\">\"(2) Suspend the sentence pursuant to section 2951.02 of the Revised Code upon any terms that the court considers appropriate;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-11\">\"(3) Permit the offender to serve his sentence in intermittent confinement, overnight, or on weekends, or both, or at any other time or times that will allow him to continue at his occupation or care for his family;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-12\">\"(4) Require the offender to serve a portion of his sentence; which may be served in intermittent confinement, and suspend the balance of the sentence pursuant to section 2951.02 of the Revised Code upon any terms that the court considers appropriate or suspend the balance of the sentence; and place the offender on probation pursuant to section 2951.02 of the Revised Code.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-13\">In this case, the court sentenced Vanderwyst to serve a period of six months in the Medina County Jail, to pay a fine of $1,000 and all court costa Additionally, Vanderwyst's operator's license was suspended for one year with no occupational privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-14\">Pursuant to R.C. 2151.02, five months of the jail term and $800 of the fine were suspended and Vanderwyst was placed on probation upon the following terms:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-15\">ii* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-16\">\"1) Defendant shall serve 30 days in the Medina County Jail beginning 12-18-1989;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-17\">\"2) Defendant shall pay the fine and costs within 60 days;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-18\">\"3) Defendant shall perform 200 Hours of community service;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-19\">\"4) Defendant shall obey all other conditions which may be set by the Probation Department of this Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-20\">*\u00ab* * * \u00ab</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-21\">Vanderwyst contends that the trial court abused its discretion when it ignored Dr. Ross Santamaria's opinion. Dr. Santamar\u00eda is the Director of the Department of Diversion and Forensic Services of Medina County. Dr. Santamariamet with Vanderwyst and concluded that, in his opinion, jail time would not serve a rehabilitative purpose. Multiple mitigating factors require less than the maximum jail sentence. <em>Columbus </em>v. <em>Jones, supra </em>at 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-22\">This court finds that there was not a clear abuse of discretion. The trial court apparently considered the mitigating factors since it reduced the sentence Vanderwyst's assignment of error is overruled and the judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-23\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b464-24\">QUILLIN, J., and CIRIGLIANO, J., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
