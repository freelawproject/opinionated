Under their summary-judgment motion, the appellees sought a declaration in the court below that mechanics' lien claims asserted by the named defendants were invalid, an order discharging surety bonds that had been executed as security for the liens pursuant to R.C. 1311.11, and judgment in their favor on the various counterclaims asserted by the defendants. The appellants' respective appeals were consolidated, and their briefs attack the granting of the summary-judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-22\">Upon review of the record before us, we conclude that summary judgment was improvidently granted. We hold that in order for the trial court to have reached its ultimate decision, it must have weighed the evidence. It is not the province of the trial court in ruling on a motion for summary judgment to weigh evidence, assess its probative value, decide factual issues, or choose among reasonable inferences. <em>Dupler v. Mansfield Journal Co. </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St. 2d 116, 121, 413 N.E.2d 1187, 1192, certiorari denied (1981), 452 U.S. 962, 101 S. Ct. 3111; see, also, <em>McPherson v. Rankin </em>(C.A. 5, 1984), 736 F.2d 175. Accordingly, resolution of this matter by summary judgment was inappropriate, and appellants' respective assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-23\">The judgment of the trial court is reversed and this cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-24\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b125-25\">SHANNON, P.J., HILDBRANDT and GORMAN, JJ.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
