Thus, movants met their initial burden of establishing that the Bronx County venue chosen by plaintiffs is improper (CPLR 503 [a]; 510 [1]; <em>Hernandez v Seminatore, </em>48 AD3d 260 [2008]), and since plaintiffs forfeited their right to select the venue by choosing an improper venue in the first instance, venue is properly placed in Westchester County, where most of the parties reside <em>(Weiss v Wal-Mart Stores E., L.P., </em>83 AD3d 461 [2011]).
