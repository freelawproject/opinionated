It appears from the pleadings that at and before the time of making the alleged contract a dispute existed between the parties as to whether or not the plaintiff owed the defendant the sum of $364.50, and that on September 23, 1916, the plaintiff and defendant had negotiations in which it was agreed that the defendant should give the plaintiff credit for that sum and that the defendant would sell to the plaintiff 500 tons of steel scrap at $17.75 a ton, it being the intention of the parties that the contract should be put in writing. The defendant thereupon sent to the plaintiff a written proposal for the sale of this scrap, which he asked the plaintiff to please sign and return. In reply to this communication the plaintiff company returned the order to the defendant, having struck out the name of the Kennedy-Stroh Corporation and inserted in its place the name of the Edgewater Steel Company and having added the stipu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>lation \u201cBuyers\u2019 weights to govern settlement,\u201d the accompanying letter noting the change thus made in the proposed contract and expressing the hope that it' would be satisfactory. No mention was made in this letter of the proposal to cancel the defendant\u2019s claim against plaintiff for $364.50. To this letter the defendant made no reply and no further communication appears to have taken place between the parties until in December, when the plaintiff demanded the delivery of the scrap iron and upon defendant\u2019s refusal this action was brought to recover the difference between the market value of the scrap at that time and the amount provided in the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-2\">We are unable to see how, under this state of facts, the plaintiff can recover, having received a written proposal for a contract and having altered it in a material respect and returned it. The plaintiff was in itself in the position of making a proposal and admittedly it never received any assent to that proposal, and without an assent either expressed or implied by circumstances, of course, there was no contract. The contention of the plaintiff, as we understand it, is that under the circumstances the defendant was bound to make some answer to their communication and that a failure to do so amounted to an assent. We are clearly of opinion that the defendant was not under any duty to make an answer to the communication and that he was not estopped by his silence. The rule is therefore discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-3\">The court directed a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the sum of $397.29 and entered judgment thereon. Plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b419-4\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the decree of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b419-5\"><em>Malcolm Goldsmith, </em>and with him <em>A.
