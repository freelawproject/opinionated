Before Cohen, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-6\">From the record it appeared that Samuel J. Wainwright, Jr., claiming to be the surviving and liquidating partner of the former firm of Walker &amp; Wainwright, brought an action against the Marine National Bank of Pittsburgh upon a check for the full amount of the deposit which stood in that bank in the joint names of both partners. In his statement 'of claim the plaintiff alleged that he was the surviving partner of the firm named and as such was entitled to receive ail the assets of the former partnership. He further alleged that the moneys on deposit in the Marine National Bank were partnership funds and that he had drawn a check for the full amount of the deposit to his own order, presented the same for payment and payment had been refused. The Marine National Bank, defendant, filed an affidavit of defense in which it was alleged that the deposit had been made by Charles P. Walker and Samuel J. Wainwright, Jr., in their joint names and that when such deposit was made it was agreed that checks drawn against said fund should be signed by both Charles P. Walker and Samuel J. Wainwright, Jr., and that since the check which was presented was signed by only one of the parties it was the bank\u2019s duty to refuse payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>At the trial of the case, counsel for the Colonial Trust Company, administrator of C. P. Walker, deceased, appeared on behalf of the said administrator, and formally withdrew all claim to said fund, and made a statement to the court that the administrator was convinced that the funds on deposit were in reality partnership funds. Whereupon counsel for defendant admitted that the actual amount on deposit was due and agreed that a verdict might be entered in this case for the same. The plaintiff having claimed interest on said deposit the case proceeded to trial to determine what amount of interest, if any, was due on said deposit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-3\">The court directed a verdict in favor of the plaintiff in the sum of $12,990.90 as principal and $747.50 as interest and judgment was entered thereon.

This appeared from the form of the deposit and the oral testimony introduced. There was no evidence to the contrary. By the death of Charles P. Walker, one of the partners, the right and duty to take possession of the partnership property and settle the business of the firm was cast on the surviving partner. He became the agent of the firm for that purpose, and the title to the assets vested in him. The administrator of Walker was not authorized to withdraw any part of the fund or to interfere with its custody by Wainwright: Collins v. Young, 1 McQueens\u2019 Appeal Cases, House of Lords <em>385; </em>Wallace v. Fitzsimmons, 1 Dal. 248; Shipe\u2019s Appeal, 114 Pa. 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The memorandum made by the bank of an oral understanding that the deposit should only be checked out on the joint names of the members of the firm, had relation to the conduct of the business while the partnership existed. There is nothing in the case which intimates that it was intended to affect the settlement of the accounts of the firm in the event of the death of one of the partners. It cannot therefore be held that the general rule relating to the settlement of a partnership dissolved by the death of one of the members was intended in any way to be set aside and a different method of liquidation established. The appellee was in the exercise of his strict legal right, therefore, in demanding the fund from the bank. The appellant had notice of the death of Walker and Is charged with knowledge that as a result of Ms death the firm was dissolved, and that the surviving partner became the liquidating agent of the late firm. The notice of the administrator of Walker that the money should not be paid over until the administrator had received proof that the decedent had no interest in the fund was not a demand for the deposit or any part of it, and did not relieve the bank from its legal responsibility to the plaintiff. If, however, the notice amounted to a demand, as against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>respective claims, <em>the </em>bank had a remedy by an application for an interpleader. In the absence of a counter demand the liability of the bank to pay is clear. The acceptance of the deposit carried with it an implied obligation to return it on demand, and the refusal so to do was a breach of this obligation out of Avhich liability for interest arose. The bank could not justify the retention of the fund against the lawful owner, and is therefore chargeable with interest from the time plaintiff\u2019s check was refused. When a definite time is fixed for the payment of money, an obligation to pay damages in the form of interest at the lawful rate arises for a detention of the money after a breach of the contract for its payment: Mining Co. v. Jones, 108 Pa. 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\">The action of the court on the rule for judgment non obstante veredicto accords with the law applicable to the facts established at the trial. The assignments are overruled and the judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
