P. Allegheny Co., April T., 1917, No. 770, on verdict for plaintiffs in case of F. W. Meysenburg and Howard B. Payne, Partners, Trading as Front Construction Company, v. J. B. Speer and A. M.

Before Reid, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-10\">The facts appear by the opinion of the court below discharging rule for judgment n. o. v.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b402-11\">This is a motion ex parte defendants for judgment non obstante veredicto. A motion for a new trial had also been made by defendants, but on argument, as appeared by endorsement thereon, it was withdrawn, counsel stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>ing that they would rely entirely upon the motion for judgment n. o. v.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-3\">Plaintiffs were contractors and builders and defendants are the executors of Ellen C. Speer, deceased, who was the owner of the building upon which the work was done by the plaintiffs\u2019 firm, out of which the controversy between the parties arose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-4\">It being desired to make alterations and repairs to one of the decedent\u2019s buildings, plaintiffs aver that they were solicited by the owner\u2019s agent to bid upon the placing therein of a store front and that the parties entered into a verbal agreement by which such front was to be installed for which plaintiffs were to be paid the net sum of $414. They also aver that they did certain extra work and furnished extra materials (on a time and material basis) not included in any other contract, for which they, claim a total of $72.11, thus making plaintiffs\u2019 entire claim for which suit was brought $486.11.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-5\">Defendants deny that there was a separate contract entered into for the store front, but do not deny, however,that extra work and material to the amount of $72.11 was done and furnished. They, however, averred that the work and materials entering into the plaintiffs\u2019 demand for the store front was included in another contract by which plaintiffs undertook upon the basis of time and material plus ten per cent for their services to make general repairs to the store building in question, the cost of which, as indicated by the bills and statements in evidence, aggregated $2,813.37. Defendants also maintained that on June 28, 1916, they paid the plaintiffs, and plaintiffs received in full of all claims, the sum of $600.25, which was intended to, 'and did, include the extras above specified as well as all claims for work and materials entering into the installation of the store front above referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b403-6\">A voucher, Exhibit A, dated June 28,1916, was offered in evidence as indicating this final settlement. It is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AOQU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>\u201cSpeer Bros., Agents, To Front Construction Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-3\">\u201c1916</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-4\">\u201cJune 28 Received from Speer Bros., Agents, for account of Mrs. Ellen C. Speer, six hundred and 25/100 dollars, being in full of account and covering all claims for work done and materials furnished on property of owner at 948 Liberty Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as per sundry receipts and memorandum previously given and also hereto attached, $600.25.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-5\">\u201cPittsburgh, Pa., June 28, 1916,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-6\">\u201cReceived from Speer Bros., Agents, in full of the above account, $600.25.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-7\">\u201c(Signed) Front Construction Co.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-8\">\u201cF. W. M.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-9\">Attached to, and forming a part of, above voucher was an itemized statement of the plaintiffs\u2019 account showing numerous items charged for labor as well as items for materials furnished by plaintiffs and which went into the building. These items defendants maintain included all the work done by the plaintiffs and material furnished by them for which the defendants are liable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-10\">Aside from the position that as a matter of law this voucher was final and conclusive and necessarily included all of the plaintiffs\u2019 demands of every kind, defendants offered testimony to the effect that at the time of the delivery of the voucher and the payment of the money mentioned in it plaintiffs\u2019 representative was asked whether the amount included all of the plaintiffs\u2019 demands and replied that it did. This, however, was denied by the plaintiffs\u2019 representative, who testified that not only did he not make such statement but that was not intended to include in the voucher the bill for the storefront or the extras because all the items entering into those charges were not at that time available, and for the further reason that he had been requested by Mr. Mitchell, defendants\u2019 agent, to withhold for the time being the bill for the store front. Mr. Mitchell corroborates plaintiffs\u2019 representative in saying that the bill for the store <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>front was not specifically mentioned at the time of the preparation and delivery of the voucher, exhibit A. This voucher refers to, and make a part of it, \u201cthe receipt and memorandum previously given and also hereto attached.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-3\">Plaintiffs were permitted to show that the items appearing in their account thus appended to the voucher, did not comprise any of those for work and material entering into the store front, which they contend was entirely a separate matter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-4\">That they were not thus included, appears from exhibit No. 1 (Plaintiffs\u2019 book of accounts) and exhibit No. 2, being a list of items taken from exhibit No. 1. This book bears evidence of genuineness, being the current book of accounts kept by plaintiffs for all their similar transactions at the time; and it shows among other things that the plaintiffs did keep in it separate accounts \u2014 one for the \u201cTime and Material\u201d going into the general contract for repairs, and the other for \u201cStore Front\u201d by which the items for each were indicated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-5\">The court refused to charge, as requested by the defendants, that the voucher, exhibit A, was conclusive evidence of a final settlement, accord and satisfaction which prevented the plaintiffs from recovering, but left it to the jury to determine whether, under all the facts, the parties did finally settle all their differences and the plaintiffs did intend such settlement to be in full and lead the defendants to believe that no further claims or demands then existed against the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-6\">Upon examination of the evidence submitted, including all of the accounts referred to and the testimony of the witnesses, we are convinced that the voucher was not conclusive of the rights of the parties and that the evidence was properly admitted as to the actual state of those accounts and as to the facts and purposes which the parties had in view when the transaction of June 28, 1916, was closed. There was, in consequence, a question of fact for the jury\u2019s determination; and by its verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>for the full amount of plaintiffs\u2019 claim, it found that the bill for the store front and the'extras in question were not included in the settlement.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Avf\">July 17, 1919:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-3\">That the issue in the case was one of fact with reference to the transaction occurring at the time of the alleged settlement, is evidenced from the manner in which defendants assumed the burden of endeavoring to prove not only the execution and delivery of exhibit \u201cA\u201d but all the facts connected with it, including the declarations alleged to have been made by the plaintiffs\u2019 representative showing his purpose to effect a final settlement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-4\">In view of the fact that defendants withdrew their motion for a new trial, we have no discretion to consider anything except the merits for the motion for judgment n. o. v.; and as above indicated, as there was clearly a question of fact necessarily to be submitted to the jury, we must overrule defendants\u2019 motion and refuse the judgment moved for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-5\">Verdict for plaintiffs for $549.30 and judgment thereon. Defendants appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-6\"><em>Error assigned, </em>among others, was the refusal of defendants\u2019 motion for judgment n. o. v.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-7\"><em>W. D. N. Rogers, </em>of <em>Richardson &amp; Rogers, </em>and with him <em>E. E. Fulmer, </em>for appellants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWJ\">The settlement between the parties included both contracts and was final: Rhodes\u2019s Est., 189 Pa. 460; Crawford v. Oil City, 189 Pa. 415; Daly v. Dallmyer, 20 Pa. Superior Ct. 368; Flynn v. Hurlock, 194 Pa. 462; Harlow v. Wilkinsburg, 189 Pa. 443; McDonald v. Piper, 193 Pa. 312; Benseman v. Insurance Co., 13 Pa.

It is there pointed out that because of the language of the receipt and the incorporation into it of the various bills and memoranda referred to, parol evidence became both competent and necessary in order to determine the true subject of the settlement between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\">Being of opinion the view taken by the learned trial judge was the correct one, we can do no better than adopt the opinion referred to and affirm the judgment for the reason therein stated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
