Where there was a question to be submitted to a jury, a court cannot change the verdict by adding to such verdict its own determination of the legal questions as to whether, under the facts of the case, only a limited sum could be recovered. If there was error in the presentation of the case, the proper procedure was to award a new trial.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b534-7\"><em>Practice, Superior Court </em>\u2014 Appeals\u2014Reversal <em>of judgment non obstante veredicto </em>\u2014 Subsequent <em>appeal by losing party.</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b534-8\">Where the Superior Court reverses a judgment entered non obstante veredicto opportunity for a subsequent appeal will be allowed the losing party if he desires to have reviewed exceptions taken by him at the trial.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b534-9\">Argued April 22, 1919.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AbqS\">Appeal, No. 142, April T., 1919, by plaintiff, from judgment of C.

Before Reppert, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-3\">From the record it appeared that the plaintiff was the beneficiary in a policy of insurance which contained the following clause:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-4\">\u201c(1) Written notice must be given to the Company at Saginaw, Michigan, within ten days from the happening of any accident or beginning of any illness by reason of which claim is to be made, giving full name and address of the assured. Notice to any agent shall not constitute notice to the company. Failure to comply strictly with said notice requirement shall limit the liability of the company to one-tenth of the amount that would otherwise be payable.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-5\">The insured sustained an accident on January 15, 1916, which later resulted in his death. He never gave the company any notice of the accident in accordance with the terms of the policy and received no benefits thereunder. The beneficiary, however, within ten days of the death of the insured gave notice to the defendant, which declined to recognize its liability on the policy on the ground that the death of the insured had not resulted from the accident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-6\">At the trial the jury rendered a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for $600.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b535-7\">The defendant submitted, inter alia, two points, one that in accordance with the terms of the policy, as recited, there could not be a verdict for more than $80, and one, that under all the evidence, the verdict must be for the defendant, both of which were refused. Thereafter the defendant moved for judgment non obstante veredicto on the whole record. Upon argument of this motion the court directed that judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiff for $69.07, being $60 or ten per cent of the amount of the policy, as provided for in the policy, in the event of failure to give notice, and $9.07 interest.

The fact that the jury decided that question in favor of the plaintiff did not alter or enlarge the powers of the court under the Act of April 22, 1905, P. L. 286, authorizing the entry of judgment non obstante veredicto upon the whole record.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">In the case of Dalmas v. Kemble, 215 Pa. 410, Mr. Chief Justice Mitchell gave a luminous exposition of the effect and operation of the act: \u201cHe is \u2018to enter such judgment as should have been entered upon that evidence\u2019 or in other words to treat the motion for judgment as- if it was a motion for binding directions at the trial and to enter judgment as if such direction had been given and a verdict rendered in accordance. What the judge may do is still the same in substance, but the time when he may do it is enlarged so as to allow deliberate review and consideration of the facts and the law upon the whole evidence. If upon such consideration it shall appear that a binding direction for either party would have been proper at the close of the trial the court may enter judgment later with the same effect. But on the other hand, if it should appear that there was conflict of evidence on a material fact, or any reason why there could not have been a binding direction, then there can be no judgment against the verdict now.\u201d Or as stated briefly in later decisions, a judgment non obstante may be entered only in cases where binding direction to the jury would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>been proper at the trial: Hardoncourt v. N. Penn Iron Co., 225 Pa. 379; Bond v. Penna. R. R. Co., 218 Pa. 34; Shannon v. McHenry, 219 Pa. 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\">As the trial judge could not have given binding direction to the jury in favor of the plaintiff for $60 and interest at the trial, the court below could not on a motion for judgment non obstante enter judgment for that amount; it could not tack the finding of the jury as to the cause of the insured\u2019s death to its own determination of the legal question as to whether under the facts in the case, the failure to give written notice to the company within ten days from the happening of the accident limited the liability of the company to one-tenth of the amount that would otherwise be payable. If it concluded that error had been committed on the trial it should have ordered a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The assignments of error are sustained. Inasmuch, however, as the defendant may desire a review of the rulings of the court on the legal questions raised at the trial to which it took exception, an opportunity will be allowed for it to secure the same by appeal: Jaras v. Wright, 263 Pa. 486; Casey v. Canning, 39 Pa. Superior Ct. 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The judgment of the court below is reversed and the record is remitted with directions to enter judgment on the verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
