Appellee company, the Standard Soap Company, sought to register a trademark to be used on toilet soap; consisting of the word \u201cMammoth,\u201d associated with a picture of the head and shoulders of the prehistoric animal, the mammoth. Appellant company, the Summit City Soap Works, in its notice of opposition, describes its mark as \u201cthe picture of two elephants in the attitude of a mother washing her child. This was commonly used in connection with the inscription, \u2018Rub-No-More Soap.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">The material allegations as to the identity of the marks are stated in the notice of opposition as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">\u201cJ. That the alleged trademark to which the above-mentioned application relates has such a near resemblance to the opponent\u2019s trademark, as to be certain to be mistaken therefor by the public, and cause the applicant\u2019s goods to be substituted as and for the opponent\u2019s goods, to the damage of the opponent and the deception of the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">\u201c8. That the picture is the most prominent feature of both marks, and, in general appearance, the animals illustrated in the two pictures are substantially identical, and both marks ar.e appropriated to goods of the same descriptive properties. If the applicant is allowed to register or use the said alleged trademark, the trade and the public will be deceived, and the opponent injured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">Appellee, the applicant, contends that its mark is not so sim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>ilar to appellant\u2019s mark, though, concededly used upon the same class of merchandise, as to be likely to create confusion in trade. Appellant\u2019s mark was registered February 6, 1900. The appellee took no testimony, and established no date, of adoption and use. The whole case turns, therefore, upon the similarity of the marks, and the probability of their concurrent, use creating confusion in trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The Examiner of Interferences sustained the opposition, and refused the registration of appellee\u2019s mark. This ruling was. reversed by the Commissioner of Patents, from whose decision this appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">The Commissioner turned the case upon the recent decision of this court in <em>Nestle &amp; A. Condensed Milk Co. </em>v. <em>Walter Baker &amp; Co. </em>37 App. D. C. 148. In that case the marks were used on cocoa, chocolate, broma, and cocoa preparations. The mark of the appellant consisted of the picture of a milkmaid in Swiss costume, carrying a milk pail in her right hand and another on her head, with the words \u201cMilkmaid Brand;\u201d while the mark of appellee consisted of the picture of a waitress in Puritan or Quaker costume, carrying a tray supporting cups.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">It was there held that the words \u201cMilkmaid Brand,\u201d used in connection with the picture, was a distinguishing feature of the mark. Here the word \u201cMammoth\u201d and the words \u201cHub-No-More Soap,\u201d appearing as parts of the respective marks, may be held to be distinguishing features. Their tendency, we think, is not to attach to the products bearing these marks the tradename \u201cElephant Brand.\u201d The word \u201cMammoth\u201d instantly attracts attention to the distinction plainly apparent between the pictures, which are the dominating features of the marks. The slight tendency there would be to confusion from the similarity of the pictures is removed by the suggestion on the label itself of the distinction, which in fact plainly exists. The inclusion of the name of the animal illustrated on appellee\u2019s mark so distinguishes it from appellant\u2019s mark as to remove the probability of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">This court has adopted a strict rule in refusing registration in all cases where the apparent similarity would probably lead <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>to confusion in trade, holding that the field of selection for marks is so broad that no necessity exists for the invasion of one trader upon even the apparent rights of another, and that the broadest protection will be afforded the purchasing, consuming public by the courts. In this case, however, there is-no such similarity as would impel us to hold that the mark sought to be registered by appellee invades the rights of appellant, or tends to create confusion in trade.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">The decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed, and. the clerk is directed to certify these proceedings as by law required. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
