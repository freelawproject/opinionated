The Examiner said: \u201cThe word \u2018Sag\u2019 is defined as follows: \u2018To droop, especially in the middle; settle or sink through weakness or lack of support. * * * A bending or drooping.\u2019 (Century Dictionary <em>et al.)</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-16\">\u201cThis mark, which is made up of two words, \u2018no\u2019 and \u2018sag,\u2019\u2019 as applied to a handbag, indicates that it will not droop, settle, or sink between the points at which the handle is attached; or it may mean that other parts of the bag will not sag or bend. It is well known that it is desirable to have a hand bag that will not lose its shape, for if it sags or bends, it has an inartistic and old appearance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>We concur in the view that the mark is a combination of' two words that indicate, and are intended to indicate, that the bags will not lose their shape through sagging for which reason they are descriptive of the character or quality of the goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The word is within the rule laid down in the following cases <em>Re Central Consumers\u2019 Co. </em>32 App. D. C. 523 (denying registration of \u201cNext-to-Beer,\u201d as a trademark for nonalcoholic drinks) ; <em>Charles Dennehy &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Robertson, </em>32 App. D. C. 355 (\u201cMountain Dew,\u201d for whisky) ; <em>Re South Brewery &amp; Ice Co. </em>32 App. D. C. 591 (\u201cCrystal,\u201d for beer) ; <em>Re </em>Anti-Cori<em>zine Chemical Co. </em>31 App. D. C. 191 (\u201cGetwell\u201d for medicines) ; <em>Re Seamless Rubber Co. </em>31 App. D. C. 357 (\u201cKantleek,\u201d for rubber goods). See also <em>Florence Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Dowd, </em>101 C. C. A. 565, 178 Fed. 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The decision will be affirmed, and this decision certified to-the Commissioner of Patents. <em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
