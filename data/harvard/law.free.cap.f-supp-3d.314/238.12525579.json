USCIS objects to that request, arguing that the May 2018 Guidance is not admissible because it is outside the scope of the administrative record, and that the May 2018 Guidance contains sensitive and privileged information that should not be disclosed to Plaintiffs or their counsel.

At a subsequent hearing on May 31, 2018, Defendants asserted that such an email communication would be redundant and unnecessary, because USCIS had recently circulated further guidance (the May 2018 Guidance) to USCIS Field Offices.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   7/13/2018 Resp. to Order of the Ct., ECF No. 166-1.

Further, given that the July 2017 Guidance\n   already is part of the record, reviewing the May 2018 Guidance will allow Plaintiffs and the Court to ascertain whether the more recent Guidance modifies or provides further details regarding the processing and adjudication requirements applicable to MAVNI naturalization applications or supersedes the July 2017 Guidance in any respect.

The disputed text describes aspects of the naturalization adjudication process including law enforcement techniques and processes such as: the types of information revealed through certain security checks; the external databases that are searched as part of the background screening process; questions USCIS employees may ask applicants in order to detect fraud and evaluate applicants' eligibility for immigration benefits; and information about the techniques and procedures USCIS uses to perform security checks while processing naturalization applications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   July 2018 Renaud Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-11. As USCIS notes, disclosing such information \"will risk circumvention or evasion of the law,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7, and could \"provide an applicant for an immigration benefit a roadmap to evade such processes and procedures and conceal information that would otherwise make the applicant ineligible for the immigration benefit sought.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Given that Plaintiffs have pending naturalization applications, disclosing that information to them carries some of the same risks as disclosing information about pending investigations to the defendant in a criminal case, which would implicate concerns like those at issue in the fifth and sixth\n   <em>\n    Sealed Case\n   </em>\n   factors.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sealed Case\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527282,3459213\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/856/268/\">\n    856 F.2d at 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the other hand, Plaintiffs have brought a \"non-frivolous action\" in good faith, the case is likely to be resolved on dispositive motions without discovery, and, to advance their APA unreasonable delay claim, Plaintiffs need to know information about the USCIS process for investigating, evaluating,\n   and adjudicating MAVNI naturalization applications.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527282,3459213\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/856/268/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (recommending that courts consider such issues under factors eight through ten).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Having weighed the relevant factors, the Court concludes that the law enforcement privilege protects all information that would identify the document path or link to the internal USCIS network location at which the May 2018 Guidance resides. USCIS has asserted that privilege to justify withholding the single line of text that appears at the bottom of each page of the May 2018 Guidance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Privilege Log (submitted\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   ). Disclosing these internal network links risks compromising USCIS's systems, and Plaintiffs have no cognizable interest in receiving that information. Therefore, the balance clearly favors nondisclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Evaluating the privilege claim for the remaining proposed redactions of information that is relevant to Plaintiffs' claims requires a page-by-page assessment of the respective interests of Plaintiffs and Defendants. The chart below reflects the conclusions the Court has drawn after conducting that analysis. Each finding that the law enforcement privilege applies is based on a determination that disclosing the relevant text would risk harm to USCIS and its law enforcement partners that outweighs Plaintiffs' need to receive the withheld information. Given that the May 2018 Guidance is a non-public document that describes internal agency procedures for evaluating and adjudicating naturalization applications, the Court will designate the entire document as \"Protected Material\" and subject to the limitations on the use and distribution of \"Protected Material\" that are set forth in the Protective Order governing this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Granting Mot. for Protective Order, ECF No. 123.

Pls.' Resp. at 11. The law enforcement privilege can be waived through \"voluntary disclosure of a significant portion of the information claimed to be privileged.\" 26A CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT ET AL. , FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE \u00a7 5692 (1st ed.) ;\n   <em>\n    Dellwood Farms, Inc. v. Cargill, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"977972\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/128/1122/#p1126\">\n    128 F.3d 1122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1126 (7th Cir. 1997) (\"We may assume that like other privileges the [law enforcement] privilege can be 'waived' \" through \"a voluntary surrender.\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peck v.

However, Defendants' prior descriptions of the May 2018 Guidance do not disclose the contents of the text that fall within the scope of the law enforcement privilege. Nor did USCIS's submission of the July 2017 Guidance disclose the substance of the privileged material in the May 2018 Guidance. Finally, the May 2018 Guidance is an internal agency document, and nothing in the record suggests that USCIS has disclosed the otherwise privileged information on its website or through other public means. Therefore, USCIS has not waived the law enforcement privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, USCIS proposes to redact portions of the May 2018 Guidance that are not relevant to Plaintiffs' claims. This information includes text on pages 2, 5, 9, 10, 17-19, and 22-25 of the May 2018 Guidance. The text USCIS seeks to redact addresses\n   topics wholly unrelated to the processing and adjudication of MAVNI naturalization applications. Those redactions are proper because Plaintiffs have no right to review internal USCIS documents that have no bearing on their APA and constitutional claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, and as set forth in the Order accompanying this Memorandum Opinion, the Court concludes that the May 2018 Guidance is admissible and shall be designated as \"Protected Material\" and subject to the limitations on the use and distribution of \"Protected Material\" that are set forth in the Protective Order governing this case, and that USCIS therefore must produce to Plaintiffs a copy of the May 2018 Guidance that has been redacted in a manner consistent with the foregoing analysis.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    USCIS has advised the Court that the May 2018 Guidance has been updated; the Court's references to the May 2018 Guidance in this opinion pertain to the most recent version of that guidance.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Portions of the \"to\" and \"from\" lines of the emails forwarding and distributing the guidance were redacted.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    Plaintiffs requested permission to file a response to the July 2018 Renaud Declaration, given that Defendants' initial filing did not indicate with specificity to what extent, and on what basis, USCIS asserted the law enforcement privilege. However, the undersigned declined to permit Plaintiffs to file an additional brief because the Court's\n    <em>\n     in camera\n    </em>\n    review of the relevant documents provided adequate information to evaluate USCIS's assertion of the law enforcement privilege.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    USCIS also asserts that the law enforcement privilege provides an alternative basis for redacting portions of this text. The Court need not evaluate that claim of privilege, because the text is properly redacted in its entirety due to its lack of relevance to Plaintiffs' claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
