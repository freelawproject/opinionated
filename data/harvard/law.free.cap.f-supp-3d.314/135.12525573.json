The Fourth Amendment, which states that it is \"[e]ffective July 1, 2002, or such other effective date as may be provided in a provision below,\" explains that its purpose is \"to reflect certain provisions of ... [the] EGTRRA,\" and that it \"is intended as good faith compliance with the requirements of [the] EGTRRA and is to be construed in accordance with [the] EGTRRA and guidance issued thereunder.\" AR 244. To that end, the Fourth Amendment adds the following paragraph to the Plan:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   The Earnings taken into account in determining benefit accruals of an Employee in any Plan Year beginning after June 30, 2002 shall not exceed $200,000 ....

Bankruptcy Proceedings and Letter of Agreement # 51\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In September 2005, Delta filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the \"Bankruptcy Court\"). AR 6. Thereafter, the Corporation determined that the Plan had insufficient assets to cover its guaranteed benefit liabilities as of the proposed date of the Plan's termination. AR 7. In the course of the bankruptcy proceedings, Delta negotiated with the ALPA regarding the Plan's termination and the benefits that non-retired Delta pilots (the \"Active Pilots\") would receive, which resulted in the execution of Letter of Agreement # 51.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 932. Upon approval by the Bankruptcy Court, Letter of Agreement # 51 would\n   modify the PWA by requiring Delta to issue $650 million in senior unsecured notes to the ALPA (the \"ALPA Notes\"), \"[i]n the event the ... Plan is terminated,\" AR 968, for the ALPA's distribution among its members,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 971 (noting that \"[d]istribution mechanics, eligibility and allocation [of the ALPA Notes] among such pilots or pilot accounts [would] be determined by [the] ALPA\"). Letter of Agreement # 51 also provided the ALPA with a \"general non-priority unsecured claim ... in the amount of $2.1 billion (the 'ALPA Claim'),\" AR 967, to be allocated among the Active Pilots by the ALPA's Delta Master Executive Council,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 966-67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Corporation objected to Delta's motion for the Bankruptcy Court to authorize the execution of Letter of Agreement # 51 on the grounds that the agreement would violate the ERISA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1050. The Corporation's objections were based on its position that the ALPA Notes and the ALPA Claim (collectively, the \"ALPA Payments\") were intended \"to replace unfunded benefits under the Pilots Plan by using the proceeds to fund follow-on retirement plans and other payments or distributions to pilots.\" AR 1049. The Corporation argued that the ALPA Notes were intended to serve as replacement payments for Plan benefits because Letter of Agreement # 51 \"provides to the [A]ctive [P]ilots $650 million in notes\n   <em>\n    if and only if\n   </em>\n   the Pilots Plan terminates,\" AR 1064, and \"the ALPA claim is clearly intended to make up for some portion of the [A]ctive [P]ilots' pension benefits lost as a result of the Pilots Plan termination\" because Letter of Agreement # 51 permits the proceeds of the ALPA Claim (as well as the ALPA Notes) to be received \"as retirement benefits-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , on a pre-tax and tax-deferred basis,\" AR 1068.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Corporation objected to the execution of Letter of Agreement # 51 because the ALPA Payments would violate the \"ERISA's explicit statutory provision assigning the claim for a pension plan's\n   <em>\n    total\n   </em>\n   underfunding exclusively to [the] PBGC, and ... [would] establish[ ] a follow-on arrangement to replace benefits under the Pilots Plan that may be abusive of the pension insurance system.\" AR 1049-50. The Corporation explained in its objections that the total amount of unfunded guaranteed benefits that it can pay to beneficiaries \"depends on the amount [it] recovers for unfunded benefit liabilities from the plan sponsor and its controlled group.\" AR 1053. And, if Letter of Agreement # 51 were executed, the Active Pilots \"would recover [u]nfunded [n]onguaranteed [b]enefits from both the employer,\" in the form of the ALPA Payments, and from the Corporation once it became Plan trustee upon the Plan's termination, which would constitute an improper double recovery that \"would be distributed contrary to the [ERISA] statutory scheme.\" AR 1064.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court overruled the Corporation's objections to Letter of Agreement # 51, finding no \"sufficient basis ... to reach the conclusion that [Letter of Agreement # 51] infringes any provision of law or any legal ruling by a Court,\" AR 453, and authorized Delta and the ALPA to execute Letter of Agreement # 51,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 1091, 1093. The Corporation initially noted an appeal of the Bankruptcy Court's ruling,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 1099-1102, but subsequently dismissed that appeal, AR 1153, after entering into a settlement agreement with Delta, AR 1105. In that settlement agreement, the Corporation received a \"prepetition, general, non-priority unsecured claim against Delta ... in the amount of $2.2 billion.\" AR 1105;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 1126, 1130.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    4. The Corporation's Allocations and Benefit Determinations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In December 2006, Delta and the Corporation executed an agreement appointing\n   the Corporation as the Plan trustee and terminating the Plan as of September 2, 2006.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 5436-38. The Corporation valued the Plan's assets at approximately $1.984 billion and its liabilities at approximately $4.552 billion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 848, 877. The Corporation also allocated the \"plan liabilities by priority category\" pursuant to the ERISA's statutory scheme.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 877;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201344\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The Corporation's allocations and benefit determinations that are the subject of the plaintiffs' claims in this case are explained in further detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The Increased Compensation Limit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Corporation determined that the increased compensation limit established by the EGTRRA in 2001, which was incorporated into the Plan through the PWA in 2001 and the Fourth Amendment in 2003,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 15, did not apply to its calculations of the plaintiffs' PC3 benefits because the increased compensation limit did not go into effect until the plan year beginning on July 1, 2002,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 13-14 (\"Since the plan year for the Pilots Plan began on July 1 and ended on June 30, [the] $200,000 limit went into effect on July 1, 2002 (i.e., the first day of the plan year beginning after December 31, 2001).\"), and the Plan terminated less than five years later, on September 2, 2006,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 2. Accordingly, because the ERISA requires a benefit to be in effect for five years prior to the date of the plan's termination in order to qualify as a PC3 benefit,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201344\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3), the Corporation determined that the increased compensation limit did not apply to its calculations of the plaintiffs' PC3 benefits,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 16 (\"[T]he benefit amount in PC3 is based on the plan provisions 'in effect' during the five years before the plan's termination date 'under which such benefit would be the least.' \" (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201344\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) ) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    b. The Increased Qualified Benefit Limit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Corporation also determined that although the PWA incorporated the EGTRRA's increased qualified benefit limit into the Plan on July 1, 2001, more than five years prior to the Plan's termination, the PWA did so only for pilots who were active at that time,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , pilots \"who had not retired or separated from service prior to ... July 1, 2001.\" AR 22. However, for participants who retired before July 1, 2001, the Plan was not amended to incorporate the qualified benefit limit increase until the adoption of the Fourth Amendment in June 2003, which was less than five years prior to the Plan's termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 29-30. As a result, the Corporation applied the increased qualified benefit limit only for its calculations of the Active Pilots' PC3 benefits, and not for the plaintiffs' PC3 benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    c. The Recovery Benefits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The \"PBGC determined that the total value of its recoveries [from Delta] under the settlement was $1,279,506,423 as of May 3, 2007 (approximately [eight] months after [the Plan's termination] ).\" AR 42. But, \"[t]o reflect interest, [the] PBGC discounted th[at] value ... by $50,501,683, resulting in a ... recovery value of $1,229,004,740.\" AR 43. The Corporation allocated $240,263,310 to the Plan's assets, which \"significantly increased the funded PC3 benefits that [the] PBGC pa[id] to PC3-eligible participants and beneficiaries ..., which include[d] the [plaintiffs],\" and allocated $988,741,430 to its unfunded benefit liabilities funds. AR 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   For the unfunded benefit liabilities funds, the Corporation calculated the recovery ratio, i.e., \"the percentage of the [P]lan's otherwise unfunded benefits that bec[a]me funded due to [the] [unfunded benefit liabilities] recovery,\" which was 38.51%. AR 47. The Corporation then multiplied\n   the value of the Plan's unfunded benefit liabilities, as of the date of the Plan's termination, by the recovery ratio to arrive at a total figure of $681,259,882, which was used \"to pay otherwise unfunded nonguaranteed benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 47. That amount funded the remainder of the Plan's PC3 benefit liabilities,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 49 n.137, and almost 52% of the PC5(a) benefit liabilities,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 50. \"[T]here were no remaining funds to allocate to [ ] PC5(b).\" AR 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Corporation determined that the increased compensation and qualified benefit limits, which it had already determined could not be applied to the plaintiffs' PC3 benefits, belonged in the PC5(b) category because those increases were not \"in effect\" for the full five-year period prior to the Plan's termination, as required for inclusion in PC5(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 48. Consequently, because there were no remaining funds to allocate to PC5(b), the Corporation was unable to pay these increases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    5. The Appeals Board's Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   After the Corporation issued final benefit determinations for the Plan's participants and beneficiaries,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 2, the plaintiffs filed a consolidated appeal with the PBGC Appeals Board raising thirteen issues,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 1, 3. On September 27, 2013, the Appeals Board issued its final agency decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 1. The Appeals Board's conclusions that are relevant to the plaintiffs' claims in this case are set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The ALPA Payments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The plaintiffs argued before the Appeals Board that the Corporation should have taken into account the ALPA Payments that the Active Pilots received pursuant to Letter of Agreement # 51 by construing those payments as received pension benefits under the Plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 35-36, 40-41. The Appeals Board disagreed, reasoning that \"[t]he ALPA Payments were not made from Plan assets and, thus, they were never funds that '[left] the Plan just before [the] PBGC assumed its role as statutory trustee.' \" AR 36 (second alteration in original) (citation omitted). Therefore, the Appeals Board concluded that the \"PBGC [wa]s not required to take the ALPA Payments into account in allocating the Plan's assets and [the] PBGC's recoveries.\" AR 36. As justification for its position, the Appeals Board explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   [The] ERISA does not require [the] PBGC to account for the ALPA Payments for purposes of allocating the Pilots Plan's assets and [the] PBGC's recoveries to the Plan's benefit liabilities.

The Increased Compensation Limit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The plaintiffs argued before the Appeals Board that the Corporation should have applied the increased compensation limit in its calculations of their PC3 benefits because it \"was incorporated into the Pilots Plan's provisions more than [five] years before the Pilots Plan terminated (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , before September 2, 2001).\" AR 12-13.

Therefore, the Appeals Board explained, \"a benefit increase cannot be 'in effect' for purposes of PC3 before the date on which the increase becomes operative[,] ... even if the plan provision that provided for the increase has an earlier 'stated' effective date.\" AR 16. \"Thus, if a benefit increase does not go into effect (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , is not payable) until after [five years before the plan's termination] and if a participant's payable PC3 benefit amount would be lower based on the plan provisions that were in effect before the increase, then the increase is not included in the participant's PC3 benefit.\" AR 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Appeals Board concluded that the Corporation correctly applied its regulation to the Plan as follows: (1) the adoption date of the Plan provision incorporating the increased compensation limit was June 21, 2001, the date the PWA was signed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 245;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 3412, 3697; (2) the PWA's stated effective date for the increased compensation limit was September 1, 2001,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 3695, 3697; and (3) the increased compensation limit became payable on July 1, 2002, because the Plan incorporated the $200,000 limit \"for purposes of 'determining benefit accruals of an [e]mployee in any [p]lan [y]ear beginning after June 30, 2002,' \" AR 17 (quoting AR 245). Therefore, the Appeals Board affirmed that the increased compensation limit was \"in effect\" on July 1, 2002, because that was the date when any increase in benefits would become payable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 17.

The Increased Qualified Benefit Limit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The plaintiffs further argued before the Appeals Board that, although the Corporation \"correctly determined\" that the PWA constituted a Plan amendment that was adopted and effective five years prior to the Plan's termination, the Corporation erred in concluding \"that the increased [qualified benefit] limit under the PWA applied 'only for those pilots who were active at the time the [ ] PWA was\n   signed.' \" AR 28 (citation omitted). The Appeals Board disagreed, stating that \"based on [the] ERISA, [the] PBGC regulations, and the Pilots Plan's provisions, [ ] [the] PBGC applied the appropriate [qualified benefit] limits when it determined PC3 benefits for the [plaintiffs] and for the [A]ctive [P]ilots.\" AR 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Appeals Board reasoned that the PWA did not amend the Plan for retired pilots because the PWA: (1) is defined as \"the basic collective bargaining agreement between Delta Air Lines, Inc. and the air line pilots in the service of Delta Air Lines, Inc.[,] as represented by the Air Lines Pilots Association International,\" AR 28; (2) \"states that it 'cover[s] the pilots in the employ of the Company,' \" AR 28 (alteration in original); and (3) \"defines 'Pilot' as 'an employee of Delta Air Lines, Inc. whose name appears on the Delta Air Lines Pilots' System Seniority List,' \" AR 28. The Appeals Board noted that \"the law does not presume that a collective bargaining agreement covers retired employees,\" AR 29 (\"To the contrary, the Supreme Court has found that, '[s]ince retirees are not members of the bargaining unit, the bargaining agent is under no statutory duty to represent them in negotiations with the employer.\" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Allied Chem. &amp; Alkali Workers of Am. v.

It concluded that, under the Fourth Amendment, the qualified benefit limit increases were effective for Active Pilots as of July 1, 2001, but were not effective for retired pilots until July 1, 2002,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 25, because \"the Fourth Amendment provides that benefit increases resulting from [the] EGTRRA's amendment of the [qualified benefit] limit are effective on different dates depending on the employee's Annuity Starting Date ('ASD'),\" AR 25 n.69. The Plan defines an employee's ASD as \"the first day of the first period for which a retirement benefit is paid as an annuity,\" and therefore, according to the Appeals Board, \"a pilot's ASD is on or after his or her retirement date.\" AR 25 n.69. Because the Fourth Amendment provides that the qualified benefit limit increases \"were effective July 1, 2001 for employees with ASDs 'on or after July 1, 2001,' \"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , for Active Pilots, \"and were effective on July 1, 2002 for employees with ASDs 'before July 1, 2001,' \"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , for retired pilots, AR 25 n.69, the Appeals Board found that \"the Fourth Amendment's establishment of different effective dates for the two groups of participants is significant with respect to the Board's resolution of [PC3 benefits],\" AR 25-26. As the Appeals Board recognized, \"[t]he Fourth Amendment explicitly provides for different effective dates for the [qualified benefit] limit increase depending upon the ASD,\" and therefore, \"is wholly consistent with the PWA only if ... the PWA does not amend the [qualified] benefit limit for retired pilots,\" because \"[o]therwise, there would be a clear conflict between the 'earliest effective date' language in the PWA and the delayed effective date for the retired pilots in the Fourth Amendment.\" AR 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Based on these reasons, the Appeals Board concluded that the \"PBGC correctly determined that the retired pilots are not entitled to have their PC3 benefits computed based on the [increased qualified benefit] limit under [the] EGTRRA\" because the \"Fourth Amendment, which provided the [qualified benefit] limit increase to the retired pilots, was adopted on June 27,\n   2003,\" and provided that \"the retired pilots could not receive payments based on the increased [qualified benefit] limit ... until July 1, 2002.\" AR 30. Due to the fact that both of these dates were less than five years before the Plan's termination, AR 30, the Appeals Board found that, \"[f]or the retired pilots, the plan provision that provides the lowest annuity benefit payable during the five-year period before [the Plan's termination],\" as required by Corporation regulation, \"is the benefit provision in effect between September 1, 2001[,] and June 30, 2002.\" AR 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    d.

The Appeals Board found no error, explaining that the Corporation properly discounted the value of its recovery as of May 3, 2007, which was $1,279,506,423, by $50,501,683, to reflect the value of its recovery as of the date of the Plan's termination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The plaintiffs also argued that the Corporation incorrectly allocated the compensation and qualified benefit limit increases to PC5(a) instead of to PC5(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 42;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR 48 (\"The [plaintiffs' a]ppeal contends that [the] PBGC's [ \u00a7 1322(c) ] allocation was improper because it did not accord priority within PC5 to [the compensation] and [qualified benefit] limit increases.\"). The Appeals Board disagreed, concluding \"that the same rules governing when a plan provision or amendment is 'in effect' for purposes of determining the PC3 benefit and applying the phase-in limit should be applied in assigning benefits to the PC5 subcategories.\" AR 51.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Second, the Corporation opinion letter in that case was a two-page letter, written by the Acting Director of the Corporation's Legal Department more than thirty years before the\n   <em>\n    GCIU\n   </em>\n   decision was issued, responding to a \"request for the PBGC's opinion concerning [a provision] of [the] ERISA.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Arbitration Record at 626-27,\n   <em>\n    GCIU-Emp'r Ret.

To the extent that the plaintiffs argue that the Corporation's reliance on the initial evaluation was arbitrary and capricious, the Court rejects that argument because the plaintiffs have not suffered any prejudice as a result of that reliance because the re-evaluation has since been completed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Olson v.

If the Court interpreted the Fourth Amendment language regarding retired employees to allow the increased compensation limit to apply to Plan years prior to July 1, 2002, as the plaintiffs argue, that interpretation would not only negate the first clause, which provides that the increased compensation limit applies\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   for Plan years beginning on and after July 1, 2002,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"295\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20C.B.%20277\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"295\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20C.B.%20277\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   but it would also contradict the EGTRRA itself, which provides that the increased compensation limit applies to plan years beginning after December 31, 2001,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pub.

Certainly, neither the IRS notice nor the terms of the Plan (either the PWA or the Fourth Amendment) can be construed in contravention of the statute itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 244 (stating that the Fourth Amendment \"is intended as good faith compliance with the requirements of [the] EGTRRA and is to be construed in accordance with [the] EGTRRA and guidance issued thereunder\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4235591,3718407\" index=\"296\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/1161/\">\n    734 F.3d at 1168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting the argument that the benefit was \"in effect\" as of the plan's stated effective date).

The parties agree that the PWA incorporating the increased qualified benefit limit was in effect five years prior to the Plan's termination, but disagree as to whether that provision covers all pilots or only pilots active when the PWA was signed in 2001.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. at 32-33; Def.'s Mem. at 33. The plaintiffs argue that the Corporation's determination that the PWA provision applied only to active, and not retired, pilots was erroneous because the PWA \"does not state that the '[q]ualified [p]lan [l]imits' will be different for Plan participants depending upon their retirement status.\" Pls.'

Reply at 32 (same).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   The Corporation responds that the Fourth Amendment provides that the qualified benefit limit was increased for Active Pilots as of July 1, 2001, while the increase did not go into effect for retired pilots until July 1, 2002.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 34;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 36. According to the Corporation, if the PWA provision were read to cover pilots who were retired when the PWA was adopted, such a reading \"would conflict with the Fourth Amendment, which does not make the [qualified] benefit[ ]limit increase effective until July 1, 2002, for this group.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36. Furthermore, the Corporation argues that the PWA provision only covered Active Pilots because (1) \"the PWA was an agreement between Delta and its actively employed pilots,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 35, and (2) \"there is no presumption that a collective bargaining agent represents retirees in negotiations or that a collective bargaining agreement covers them with respect to retirement benefits,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 36;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply at 20-21. The Corporation notes that the plaintiffs' argument \"that [the] ALPA represented the retirees' interests is especially odd here, given the[ir] contention in Claim Two that [the] ALPA represented the interests of [A]ctive [P]ilots to the disadvantage of the [plaintiffs] when negotiating [Letter of Agreement] # 51.\" Def.'s Mem. at 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Upon review of both the PWA and the Fourth Amendment, the Court concludes that the Corporation's interpretation is reasonable, and therefore not arbitrary and capricious. The PWA provision incorporating the increased qualified benefit limit does not explicitly state whether it applies only to Active Pilots.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 3697 (stating that if the qualified benefit limit is increased, that increase is effective as of the earliest date it could have become legally effective in the absence of a collective bargaining agreement). The Fourth Amendment, on the other hand, explicitly distinguishes between employees' \"annuity starting dates,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , their dates of retirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 248. Specifically, the Fourth Amendment states that the increased qualified benefit limit \"shall be effective beginning with the [plan] year starting on July 1, 2001[,] for those Employees whose Annuity Starting Date is on or after July 1, 2001,\" but \"[w]ith respect to Participants whose Annuity Starting Date was before July 1, 2001, the increased [qualified benefit] limit ... shall be effective for annuity payments made on or after July 1, 2002.\" AR 248. Because the Corporation reviewed\n   both provisions, and declined to interpret the PWA provision as covering pilots who retired before July 1, 2001, as doing so would directly conflict with the Fourth Amendment, the Court is satisfied that the agency \"examine[d] the relevant data and articulate[d] a satisfactory explanation for its action including a 'rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.' \"\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    463 U.S. at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Burlington Truck Lines\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"451399\" index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/156/#p168\">\n    371 U.S. at 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"451399\" index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/156/#p168\">\n    83 S.Ct. 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Although the plaintiffs are correct that the statutory provisions in \u00a7 1344(a)(3) and \u00a7 1344(b)(4)(A) are not identical, it still remains that Congress chose not to define the words \"in effect\" under either provision, and it used the same five-year period under both provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"334\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201344\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3), (b)(4)(A).
