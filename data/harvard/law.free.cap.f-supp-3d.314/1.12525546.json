The Petition satisfies all three requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   First, the record indicates that Dr. Cullen, from whom the Petitioners seek documents and testimony, resides or may be found in the District of Columbia. Public real estate records from the District of Columbia list Dr. Cullen's residence as an address in Northwest Washington, D.C.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Steinberg Decl. \u00b6 19;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Supp. at 5. Dr. Cullen neither opposed the Petition nor disputed Petitioners' representations regarding his residence. Thus, although Dr. Cullen maintains an office in Bethesda, Maryland, his status as a D.C. resident brings him within the Court's authority under Section 1782.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Leret\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755432\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/51/66/#p70\">\n    51 F.Supp.3d at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding the condition met where individual's residence was uncontested).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Second, the record clearly indicates that Petitioners intend to use the requested discovery in a foreign tribunal. Petitioners seek records and testimony from Dr. Cullen in connection with a Quebec Superior Court action challenging the validity of Rita DiGiulian's 2015 Canadian will.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Supp. at 5; Steinberg Decl. \u00b6 14.

The Court's Exercise of its Discretion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Having concluded that the Court has the authority to grant Petitioners' request, the Court next must decide whether to exercise its discretion to do so. The Supreme Court has outlined four factors which may \"bear consideration\" as part of this analysis: (1) whether \"the person from whom discovery is sought is a participant in the foreign proceeding ... [if so] the need for \u00a7 1782(a) aid generally is not as apparent as it ordinarily is when evidence is sought from a nonparticipant in the matter arising abroad\"; (2) \"the nature of the foreign tribunal, the character of the proceedings underway abroad, and the receptivity of the ... court ... abroad to U.S. federal-court judicial assistance\"; (3) \"whether the \u00a7 1782(a) request conceals an attempt to circumvent foreign proof-gathering restrictions or other policies of a foreign country or the United States\"; and (4) whether the request is \"unduly intrusive or burdensome.\"\n   <em>\n    Intel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861465\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/241/#p264\">\n    542 U.S. at 264-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861465\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/241/#p264\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Although Dr. Cullen has provided some records to Petitioners voluntarily, Petitioners and the Canadian court lack the \"legal authority to command [Dr. Cullen's] attendance[,] his production of documents,\" or his testimony.

The proceedings are before the Quebec Superior Court, which is the proper forum in which to \"challenge the validity of a will based upon capacity and undue influence.\" Steinberg Decl. \u00b6 14.

Here, nothing in the record suggests that the Canadian court would reject evidence obtained through this request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Supp. at 7. To the contrary, Mr. Steinberg asserts, based on his years of experience practicing in that jurisdiction, that \"the Quebec Superior Court would accept Dr. Cullen's records and testimony ... so long the rules of evidence and civil procedure are followed.\" Steinberg Decl. \u00b6 21.

As discussed above, given Dr. Cullen's status as a non-resident and non-citizen of Canada, the Quebec Superior Court lacks the authority to compel Dr. Cullen to testify\n   or produce records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Steinberg Decl. \u00b6 22;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mem. in Supp. at 8. Nothing in the record indicates that the rules and procedures governing Quebec Superior Court proceedings would preclude parties from obtaining such evidence from individuals who are subject to that court's jurisdiction.

Petitioners have explained that the medical records from this time period are relevant to establishing Rita DiGiulian's medical and mental state at three significant moments: (1) when she testified at a deposition on June 5, 2015 deposition; (2) when she executed a will on April 29, 2015 will; and (3) when she executed a will on March 21, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl.

The fact that Dr. Cullen has voluntarily provided some of the information Petitioners seek, and has not objected to the Petition, indicates that the request is not unduly burdensome. Therefore, this factor weighs in favor of granting the Petition.
