MORENO, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case stems from a fatal auto accident involving a rental car being driven by someone other than the person who rented the vehicle. The question is whether the renter's auto policy extends coverage for the accident. In cases involving rental cars the policy extends coverage to policyholders. The policy at issue does not actually use the term policyholder, but instead categorizes people as \"listed drivers\" and \"named insureds.\" The driver of the rental car is a \"listed driver\" under this policy and not a \"named insured.\" Allstate argues that \"named insured\" is synonymous with policyholder, thereby excluding the accident from coverage. Defendant argues that the policy is ambiguous and the driver of the rental car, as a \"listed driver,\" should be considered a policyholder. The Court agrees with Allstate and grants summary judgment in its favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This case arises out of a tragic automobile accident that occurred on January 20, 2016, resulting in the death of Tatiana Sanchez and injuries to Jose E. Gomez. Earlier that evening, Ms. Sanchez's automobile was struck by another vehicle owned by Mr. Gomez, a passenger in that vehicle. Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Gomez exited their respective vehicles after the accident to inspect the damage, at which point Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Gomez were struck by Defendant Steven Bruce Waldman. Mr. Waldman was driving a 2016 Hyundai Sante Fe that had been rented by Defendant Marlene D. Harmon. Ms. Harmon had rented the Hyundai from Enterprise Leasing Company of Florida, LLC and allegedly permitted Mr. Waldman to drive it. Ms. Harmon and Mr. Waldman are not related and, at the time of the accident, were not married.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Ms. Sanchez's estate subsequently filed a wrongful death lawsuit against, amongst others, Defendants Waldman and Harmon in the Circuit Court in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida (Case No. 2017-009968-CA-01), seeking damages. Allstate is defending Mr. Waldman in that lawsuit pursuant to a reservation of rights. Ms. Harmon has not yet been served, but Allstate anticipates that she will be. Likewise, Mr. Gomez has not yet filed a related\n   personal injury claim, but has notified Allstate that he intends to do so. As such, to avoid incurring unnecessary litigation costs, Allstate seeks a declaration from this Court as to whether liability coverage exists for the wrongful death and personal injury claims arising from the underlying accident. This Court declares that it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Summary judgment is authorized where there is no genuine issue of material fact.

Allstate contends that it does not, and that the Policy Declarations clearly indicate that Marlene D. Harmon is the sole policyholder, excluding Mr. Waldman and the underlying accident from coverage. Ms. Sanchez's estate argues that because the term \"policyholder\" is not explicitly used, and because Steven Waldman is listed as a driver on the policy on the declarations page, it was the intent to include him as an insured and an ambiguity exists that should be resolved in favor of finding that Mr. Waldman is a policyholder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   1.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     \"Policyholder listed on the Policy Declarations\"\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Under Florida law, an insurance policy is treated and construed like a contract.\n   <em>\n    Reuter v.

It is undisputed that Mr. Waldman was neither married to, nor a relative of Ms. Harmon at the time of the accident. Because both elements of the exclusion are established, there is no coverage for the subject accident and Allstate has no duty to defend or indemnify Marlene D. Harmon or Steven Bruce Waldman in the underlying litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Having found that the insurance policy is unambiguous and that it does not extend coverage to the underlying accident, the Court grants summary judgment in favor of Plaintiff Allstate Insurance Company and accordingly denies Defendant Anabel Alberni's cross-motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at Miami, Florida, this\n   <em>\n    21st\n   </em>\n   of March 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The nature of their relationship is unclear based on both the pleadings in this case and in the underlying case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    In its Motion for Summary Judgment, Allstate references other related policy documents, such as the renewal letter and Automobile Insurance Identification Card, in support of its argument that Marlene D. Harmon is the sole policyholder. However, the consideration of parole evidence is only appropriate when there is an ambiguity. Because the Court finds here that the policy is unambiguous, it does not need to consider extraneous documents.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    Other courts in this district have also recognized that this exclusion clearly and unambiguously applies to bar coverage for accidents involving a rental car being operated by someone other than the named insured or resident relative.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Allstate Fire and Cas.
