BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Andrea Johnson is a former employee of Defendant Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, which, she charitably alleges, operates the \"always dependable transit service in the Washington metropolitan area.\" Amend. Compl., \u00b6 4. Her suit, however, does not depend on the punctuality of Metro; it instead alleges that WMATA unlawfully discriminated against her on the basis of race and sex when it demoted her from a supervisory role in January 2015. Now seeking summary judgment, WMATA contends that no reasonable jury could find that its proffered non-discriminatory reasons for Plaintiff's demotion were pretextual. Agreeing, the Court will grant the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As an initial matter, Defendant points out that Plaintiff has not fully complied with Local Civil Rule 7(h)(1) in her Statement of Disputed Genuine Issues of Material Fact by failing at times to reference the relevant part of the record that supports certain factual assertions, submitting legal conclusions, and not appropriately responding to Defendant's specific assertions. As a result, it asks that its own facts be deemed admitted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 23 (Reply) at 2. Although Johnson has been somewhat loose in her Statement, her errors are not so egregious that the entirety of Defendant's Statement of Material Facts should simply be admitted. The Court will not, however, accept facts that do not cite support from the record or conclusions masquerading as facts. With this in mind, the Court sets out the facts in the light most favorable to Johnson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff, who is a black woman, started work at WMATA in October 2008.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amend. Compl., \u00b6 3; ECF No. 16-2 (Def. SMF), \u00b6 1. Johnson became a Supervisor of Recruitment Operations in the Department of Human Resources/Talent Acquisition\n   in 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. SMF, \u00b6 2. In 2014, she made \"salary errors in offering and hiring two employees\" within WMATA and oversaw three more salary errors for hired employees from WMATA's elevator/escalator apprenticeship program, which together resulted in five employees receiving incorrect salaries.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, 36. Additionally, Johnson's clients-internal WMATA departments such as access services and those responsible for escalator/elevator hiring-complained of her \"lack of responsiveness and failures to promptly communicate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 12, 18; ECF No. 20 (Deposition of Ethel Roy) at 20:15-18, 21:3-6. Johnson and her supervisor, Rod Dones, had meetings and exchanged emails about Johnson's job performance in which Dones outlined his concerns regarding these communication issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. SMF, \u00b6\u00b6 13-16, 18; MSJ, Exhs. L, M, N. Johnson was similarly informed of these concerns by the Director of Talent Acquisition, Ethel Roy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 17. In January 2015, WMATA demoted Johnson from her supervisory role to Senior Sourcing Specialist, citing \"very serious concerns in [her] ability as a Supervisor ... to lead/manage [her] staff and provide quality services to [her] customers.\" MSJ, Exh. T (Demotion Memorandum) at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Johnson subsequently filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and received a right-to-sue notice in February 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice (attached to Complaint). She then brought this suit against WMATA on May 19 of that year and filed an Amended Complaint on September 5.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 1, 8. Johnson's one count alleges that WMATA, in its \"discriminatory demotion,\" engaged in unlawful disparate treatment on the basis of race and sex in violation of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amend.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   WMATA moves for summary judgment on the ground that it demoted Johnson for \"nondiscriminatory reason[s]\"-namely, for failing to properly communicate with employees and clients and for salary-code errors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ at 2, 5-6; Def. SMF, \u00b6\u00b6 10-18. After articulating this \"[l]egitimate, [n]ondiscriminatory [r]eason\" for demoting her, Defendant argues that \"Plaintiff cannot produce sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that WMATA's asserted nondiscriminatory reason for Plaintiff's demotion was not the actual reason,\" and that the real reason was sex or race discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MSJ at 5, 9. Johnson counters that there is still a jury question as to whether WMATA's stated reasons for her demotion are pretext for discrimination, alleging that Defendant deviated from its internal policies and treated similarly situated employees of different classes more favorably.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Title VII makes it unlawful for an employer to \"discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). The Supreme Court established the three-part burden-shifting framework that governs claims of employment discrimination in\n   <em>\n    McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.

Under this framework, the plaintiff carries the initial burden of establishing a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of discrimination. When a plaintiff \"meets this burden, '[t]he burden then must shift to the employer to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason' for its action.

As Johnson does not contend that WMATA failed to follow the other procedural requirements of a disciplinary demotion-including securing the approval of relevant WMATA authorities,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-any lack of formal disciplinary warnings does not constitute a policy violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Performance Improvement Plan\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff next asserts that WMATA departed from ordinary policy by not placing her on a \"Performance Improvement Plan.\" Opp. at 1-2. Such a position finds no footing in WMATA's relevant guidelines either.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   While Defendant's annual performance reviews require that a \"performance plan\" or \"Corrective Action Plan\" be developed in response to an unsatisfactory evaluation,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   MSJ, Exh.

Q (Performance Review 2010-11) at 13, its disciplinary policy makes no reference to any such performance plan with regard to demotions. Aside from generally outlining that its disciplinary guidelines, \"when appropriate,\" serve to \"provide [an employee] with an opportunity to improve [her] less than fully satisfactory job performance,\" WMATA Disc. Actions at 1, Defendant's internal policy requires neither the offer nor the completion of a \"Performance Improvement Plan\" as a precondition to demotion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Last, Plaintiff makes additional reference to a \"disputed memorandum,\" Opp. at 7, which her Statement of Disputed Facts,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7, and her affidavit clarify refers to her allegation that she received only the first page of her disciplinary memo at the time of demotion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 18-4 (Affidavit of Andrea Johnson), \u00b6 7. Even assuming the failure to provide her the full memo constitutes a violation of internal policy, such a trivial irregularity does not amount to a deviation \"too obvious to be unintentional,\" and, more broadly, an employer's \"failure to follow its own regulation and procedures, alone, may not be sufficient to support the conclusion that its explanation for the challenged employment action is pretextual.\"\n   <em>\n    Fischbach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694065,452891\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/86/1180/\">\n    86 F.3d at 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
