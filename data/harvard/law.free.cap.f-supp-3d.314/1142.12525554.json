Browning, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on the Defendant's Motion to Dismiss State Law Claims, filed March 17, 2017 (Doc. 14)(\"Motion\"). The Court held hearings on June 12, 2017 and January 19, 2018. The primary issues are: (i) whether the federal enclave doctrine applies to state-law employment discrimination claims if the employer makes allegedly discriminatory decisions off the enclave; (ii) whether the federal enclave doctrine bars Plaintiffs Lisa A. Kennicott's, Lisa A. Garcia's, and Sue Phelps' claims against Defendant Sandia Corporation (\"Sandia Labs\") under the New Mexico Human Rights Act, N.M. Stat. Ann \u00a7 28-1-7(A) (\"NMHRA\"), and the New Mexico Fair Pay for Women Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2028-23-3\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 28-23-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A) (\"NMFPWA\"); and (iii) whether Sandia Labs made the employment decisions underlying those claims on the Kirtland Air Force Base. The Court concludes that: (i) the federal enclave doctrine applies to state employment discrimination claims when a plaintiff works on a federal enclave, no matter where the employer makes the decisions underlying those claims; (ii) the federal enclave doctrine bars the Plaintiffs' NMHRA and NMFPWA claims, because the Plaintiffs worked on the Kirtland Air Force Base, and those state statutes do not apply in that federal enclave;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (iii) Sandia Labs has not established that it made the employment decisions underlying the Plaintiffs' claims on Kirtland Air Force Base, so if the Court were to decide-which it does not-that the federal enclave doctrine applies only when the challenged employment decisions are made on an enclave, then the Plaintiffs' NMHRA and NMFPWA would survive the Motion. Accordingly, the Court grants the Motion and dismisses the Plaintiffs' NMHRA and NMFPWA claims with prejudice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In the Motion, Sandia Labs moves the Court to dismiss the Plaintiffs' NMHRA and NMFPWA claims for \"failure to state\n   a claim upon which relief can be granted.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). When deciding rule 12(b)(6) motions, the Court generally may not consider \"matters outside the pleadings.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d). The parties have also done some discovery, however, and the parties have consented to the Court converting the Motion into one for summary judgment under rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Thus, the Court will give two factual sections. First, it will explain what the Complaint alleges as relevant background of the case. Second, it will set out the undisputed facts to help it determine whether there is a genuine dispute as to a material fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The Complaint's Facts\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Sandia Labs is a \"federally-funded research and development contractor operating under contract for the Department of Energy.\" Class Action Complaint \u00b6 2, at 1-2, filed February 7, 2017 (Doc. 1)(\"Complaint\").

The Court stated that it would have imagined that the standard\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   would be where the damage [or] injury occurred, and where the employees worked, in an employment case. So it would be much like analogizing it to a choice of law, in that you don't look to necessarily where the decision was made; you would look at where the injury occurred. And so, particularly in New Mexico, being a Restatement 1 situation, you would look at where the injury occurred. And it seemed to me in an employment case it would be where the employee is housed. And so that would be what would govern is where does the employee work? Where did the injury occur?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   2018 Tr. at 4:7-20 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Sandia Labs began arguing for its Motion, stating that there are three reasons why the federal enclave doctrine \"applies here to preempt the state law claims.\" 2018 Tr. at 6:21-23 (Gordon). The first reason that Sandia Labs asserted is that the three named Plaintiffs worked on the Kirtland Air Force Base, and they challenge decisions made on the Kirtland Air Force Base.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2018 Tr. at 6:24-7:2 (Gordon). Second, Sandia Labs asserted that its promotion, compensation, and evaluation policies \"originated from inside Kirtland Air Force Base.\" 2018 Tr. at 7:7:9-14 (Gordon). Sandia Labs contends that \"either way you look at it, the locus of the decisionmaking is inside Kirtland Air Force Base, and it's the locus of decisionmaking that matters.\" 2018 Tr. at 7:15-17 (Gordon). Sandia Labs explained that it agreed with the\n   <em>\n    Camargo\n   </em>\n   standard, because Sandia Labs wished to find common ground with the Plaintiffs and, under\n   <em>\n    Camargo\n   </em>\n   , the facts supported Sandia's position.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2018 Tr. at 8:3-7 (Gordon). Sandia Labs asserted that its human resources' Vice President approves the challenged policies and that the vice-president, during the relevant time period, worked \"inside Tech Area 1 inside Kirtland Air Force Base.\" 2018 Tr. at 8:8-14 (Gordon). Sandia Labs recognized that there are human resources employees who work off of Kirtland Air Force Base, but they are not \"the decisionmakers either with respect to the three named plaintiffs or with respect to issuing the policies that are at issue.\" 2018 Tr. at 8:15-21 (Gordon). Sandia Labs illustrated its argument with an example:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   You could be a mid-level manager in human resources and draft a policy in an airplane flying over Kansas, or [drafting a policy] on the back of a napkin at the Frontier on Central.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   That Policy isn't issued or finally approved until it comes inside Kirtland Air Force Base, and goes to the desk of the vice-president of human resources, and gets vetted and reviewed and revised, and then it's approved. And there is no question here that these policies they're trying to challenge were finally approved by the vice-president of human resources from inside Kirtland Air Force Base.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   2018 Tr. at 8:22-9:5 (Gordon). Sandia Labs argued that, even if the challenged policies are enforced outside of Kirtland Air Force Base, \"the people who apply ... or administer these policies [are not] decisionmakers, nor does it change the locus of the decisionmaking.\" 2018 Tr. at 9:10-19 (Gordon).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court asked why it should look to federal common law in interpreting whether the federal enclave doctrine applies to state claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2018 Tr. at 11:24-12:2 (Court). Sandia Labs replied that the federal enclave doctrine is \"procedural law that says: if the state cause of action-whatever it is, statutory [or] common law-if it was created after the federal enclave was created, then the federal enclave doctrine preempts them.\" 2018 Tr. at 12:3-13 (Gordon).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Plaintiffs argued that, on a rule 12 motion, the Court must view all facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and, in this case, they have alleged facts that \"the locus of the relevant decisionmaking off base [sufficient] to survive a motion to dismiss.\" 2018 Tr. at 16:9-15 (Shaver). The Plaintiffs contended that there is a factual dispute where the Vice President of human resources worked, because a chart provided by Sandia leaves blank an entry describing where the vice-president of human resources worked in 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2018 Tr. at 16:16-17:3 (Shaver). Moreover, the Plaintiffs contended that there is \"no dispute\" that the human resources and communications division is listed as being not on the Kirtland Air Force Base. 2018 Tr. at 17:4-11 (Shaver).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court asked the Plaintiffs if they would consent to the Court converting the motion to a motion for summary judgment, if the Court ultimately decides doing so is necessary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2018 Tr. at 20:8-11 (Court). The Plaintiffs said that they would consent to the Court converting the motion to one for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2018 Tr. at 20:12-16 (Court, Shaver). Sandia Labs also said that it would consent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2018 Tr. at 22:16-17 (Sandia).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    9.\n    <em>\n     Post-Hearing Supplemental Brief\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Sandia Labs submitted Sandia's Supplemental Post-Hearing Brief in Support of Sandia's Motion to Dismiss State Law Claims, filed January 31, 2018 (Doc. 83)(\"Post-Hearing Brief\"). Sandia Labs states that the Post-Hearing Brief \"clarifies Sandia's position regarding how the federal enclave doctrine should be applied in this case.\" Post-Hearing Brief at 1. Sandia Labs asserts that it \"continues to maintain that the determining factor for applying the federal enclave doctrine is the place where a plaintiff worked because that is the place where the alleged injury occurred.\" Post-Hearing Brief at 2. According to Sandia Labs, its arguments relating to\n   <em>\n    Camargo\n   </em>\n   \"were simply intended to convey that even if\n   <em>\n    Camargo\n   </em>\n   set forth the applicable standard, dismissal is still appropriate because all relevant decisions occurred on [the Kirtland Air Force Base].\" Post-Hearing Brief at 2.

The Court, therefore, agrees with its fellow District of New Mexico judges in adopting the Ninth Circuit's approach to apply the federal enclave doctrine when the employee works on a federal enclave no matter where the employer made a discriminatory decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The Plaintiffs contend that the Court should apply the federal enclave doctrine only when an employer makes a discriminatory decision while on the federal enclave.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Post-Hearing Response at 2. The Plaintiffs contend that looking to where the decision was made is the correct approach, because, according to the Plaintiffs, (i) the Court should apply the federal enclave doctrine to state employment discrimination claims when the state claim originates on the federal enclave; and (ii) New Mexico courts would consider a discrimination claim to originate where a discriminatory decision is made.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Post-Hearing Response at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The Court declines to adopt the Plaintiffs' suggested approach for two reasons. First, the Constitution of the United States of America grants Congress the power \"[t]o exercise exclusive legislation\" in federal enclaves, so it would not make sense for state choice-of-law rules to determine the scope of that power. U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8. Applying the federal enclave doctrine only when state law would conclude that a claim arose on the federal enclave would subordinate a power that the Constitution grants to Congress.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S. Const. art. VI (\"This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof ... shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding.\"). When Congress exercises exclusive jurisdiction over federal enclaves, it \" 'acts as a state government with total legislative, executive, and judicial power.' \"\n   <em>\n    Allison v.

Under the federal enclave doctrine, only state laws in effect when the federal enclave was established may be enforced; there are a few exceptions to this general rule, but they underscore only the principle\n   that state laws only apply on federal enclaves when Congress expressly says they do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Allison v.

The Plaintiffs contend that, although New Mexico courts have not determined where an employment discrimination claim originates, New Mexico courts look to Title VII for guidance when interpreting the NMHRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Post-Hearing Response at 2 (citing\n   <em>\n    Garcia v.

Although no New Mexico court has determined whether an employment discrimination claim arises where the allegedly discriminatory employment decision is made, the Court sees no sound reason to treat the NMHRA and the NMFPWA differently than any other tort under New Mexico law. New Mexico precedent and the Restatement (First) of Conflicts of Law indicate that, if the Plaintiffs suffered harm in New Mexico, then New Mexico would apply its own laws. Otherwise, New Mexico would not apply its own law. There is, therefore, no need to look to Title VII for guidance in interpreting NMHRA on this issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Here, the Plaintiffs were largely, if not entirely, working on Kirtland Air Force Base. It is not a big leap to say that the harm occurred on Kirtland Air Force Base and that the Court should focus on the harm's locus.

Although the Court does not conclude that the Restatement (First) for the Conflicts of Laws governs the federal enclave doctrine analysis, its principles provide useful guidance for determining whether the federal enclave doctrine applies to the Plaintiffs' employment discrimination claims. The Restatement (First) rules are clear and easy to apply. Focusing on the place of the harm is the most pragmatic metric so that the federal enclave doctrine applies to claims for employment discrimination that employees who work on federal enclaves bring. The silliness and burden of deciding where decisions were made, when all the harm occurs on the federal enclave, is not the best use of courts' or the parties' time. The place of decision is an arbitrary benchmark, and there is not much justice to be gained by ferreting out where a decisionmaker happened to be standing when making a certain decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The decision only matters insofar as it affects the worker's employment experience.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     THE FEDERAL ENCLAVE DOCTRINE BARS THE PLAINTIFFS' STATE-LAW CLAIMS\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Under the federal enclave doctrine, the general rule is that \"state law\n   that is adopted after the creation of the enclave generally does not apply on the enclave.\"\n   <em>\n    Allison v.

The Plaintiffs also argue that Sandia Labs' policies have had an \"unlawful disparate impact on women\" in violation of the NMHRA. Complaint \u00b6 104, at 22. As for the NMFPWA, the Plaintiffs allege that \"Sandia has discriminated against employees on the basis of sex by paying wages to female employees at a rate less than the rate paid to male employees for work of equal skill, effort, and responsibility.\" Complaint \u00b6 108, at 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   According to the Plaintiffs, Sandia Labs conducts an annual performance evaluation process in which employees are \"organized into peer groups to be rated against one another in so-called 'Centers,' which are collections of several managers' employees. Supervisors attend these meetings and present the merits of their own employees as compared to the other supervisors' employees.\" Complaint \u00b6 28, at 6-7. The \"supervisors to rank employees from worst to best using a performance rating from 1 through 5, with 1 being worst, and 5 being best\" and \"[o]nly a certain percentage of employees in a defined peer group may be assigned certain ranks-for example, only a certain percentage of employees may receive a 5.\" Complaint \u00b6 25, at 6. The Plaintiffs identify a few flaws to this system. One, because the rankings are curved, the process \"forces a distribution of performance ratings outcomes .. regardless of whether there are meaningful performance differences between individual employees with in a particular peer group.\" Complaint \u00b6 26, at 6. Second, because these evaluation process are done in group \"Centers,\" which are \"collections of several managers' employees,\" an employee \"could end up with a poor rating ... regardless of her actual performance record and the rank her supervisor originally recommended.\" Complaint \u00b6 28, at 7. Third, the managers evaluate employees in part \"based on four 'personality' or 'behavior' factors: Strategic Thinking, Adapting to Meet Demands, Teaming with Others, and Modelling Personal Accountability,\" which, according to the Plaintiffs, are \"invalid and unreliable\" factors. Complaint \u00b6 27, at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   According to the Plaintiffs, this system disadvantages women, because it \"create[s] inaccurate and biased outcomes, especially when they operate within a culture of bias towards women, as is true in Sandia.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Complaint \u00b6 31, at 7. For instance, the Plaintiffs contend that \"female employees are particularly adversely impacted by 'Center' meetings, where the vast majority of attending managers are men [and the]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   proportion of men in management roles only increases at higher levels of the organization.\" Complaint \u00b6 30, at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   As for individualized decisions, the named Plaintiffs allege many specific discriminatory decisions.

Kennicott also alleges that, after she made a gender discrimination complaint to superiors, male managers retaliated against her by not hiring her to another position, \"expressing concerns about unspecific negative 'behaviors,' \" and not reducing her workload while she underwent cancer treatment, rating her as a 3 after years of receiving 4 ratings.

Kennicott also alleges that managers made \"gender-based critiques of her communication and teamwork skills.\" Complaint \u00b6 58, at 12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Garcia alleges that her reviews \"have not fully recognized her contributions\" and that she is paid less than men with \"significantly less seniority and experience.\" Complaint \u00b6 66-67, at 15. She contends that \"[c]omments within her reviews have revealed a culture of sexism at Sandia.\" Complaint \u00b6 68, at 15. She asserts that \"[g]ender-based stereotypes about at Sandia\" such that she is not offered projects involving travel, and employees presume that she does not know how to operate power tools. Complaint \u00b6 69, at 15-17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Phelps alleges that \"less qualified and less experienced male colleagues rose through the ranks must faster than she did. They were offered greater leadership opportunities, and in approximately 2009, one of the peers Ms. Phelps mentored was promoted over her. In the years that followed, male colleagues and supervisors excluded Ms. Phelps from meetings, and supervisors specifically asked her to perform, in their words, 'low visibility' work.\" Complaint \u00b6 73, at 16-17. Phelps also contends that she has been paid less than similarly situated colleagues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint \u00b6 74, at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

When it comes to decisions to fire or not hire, the decisionmaking's locus is a fairly straightforward inquiry. When the allegedly discriminatory decision relates to a policy, however, the locus is harder to pin down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The Court does not believe that the locus of decision in this case for the Plaintiffs' state-law claims would be where Sandia Labs' employees created the performance evaluation policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Writing a performance evaluation policy harms no one if it is not approved and implemented. Likewise, the Court does not believe that the locus of decision in this case is necessarily where a policy is approved. Sandia Labs asserts that the place of decision is where the Vice President of HR &amp; Communications officially approved the performance evaluation policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supp. Response\n   at 6; Tr. at 8:25-9:9 (Gordon). The Vice President can stamp \"APPROVED\" over a printed-out copy of a proposed performance evaluation process all he or she likes; the officially approved process is still several steps away from affecting anyone. Although the Vice President may be the ultimate authority for how Sandia Labs will evaluate its employees, that Vice President may, for example, change his or her mind before moving forward with the plan. In that case, there is no harm to anyone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   The next question is whether the adverse employment decision is the one that a manager makes when rating an employee pursuant to Sandia Labs' performance evaluation policy, or whether the adverse employment decision is when compensation and promotions decisions are made pursuant to those ratings. The Court concludes that a discriminatory employee performance rating system harms an employee only when the employer uses the rating's results to determine compensation and promotion. The NMHRA states that is unlawful to \"refuse to hire, to discharge, to promote or demote or to discriminate in matters of compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employment against any person otherwise qualified because of ... [a person's] sex.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"272\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2028-1-7\">\n    N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 28-1-7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Those rules implicate discriminatory personnel decisions and not necessarily discriminatory evaluations. Just as officially approving a policy does not, at that moment, affect employees, rating employees based on that policy does not affect those employees until the employer uses the results to make decisions on raises, promotions, demotions, or terminations. The question would then become where Sandia Labs made decisions affecting the Plaintiffs' pay and career paths.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Consequently, even if the Court applied\n   <em>\n    Camargo\n   </em>\n   's place of decision rule in this case, the Court would not be able to determine whether the Plaintiffs' state claims challenge allegedly discriminatory decisions made on or off the federal enclave.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Sandia Labs has the burden to show, on a motion for summary judgment, that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, the Court would deny the motion if it applied the\n   <em>\n    Camargo\n   </em>\n   rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   The Plaintiffs' specific complaints do not clearly indicate where the alleged actions took place.

Although the Plaintiffs do not explain precisely why evaluation employees on those factors in particular disadvantage women, the Court can imagine a theory that these factors, at the very least, provide biased managers-whom the Plaintiffs allege are mostly men-the means or avenues to apply those biases to female employees' disadvantage. For example, Kennicott specifically alleges that her manager \"engaged in ... gender-based critiques of her communication and teamwork skills, noting that she had a reputation for being 'difficult' \" and advised her to be \" 'softer' in her speech,\" Complaint \u00b6 58, at 12-13-critiques that, conceivably, may not levied in the same way against male employees.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"25\">\n   <p id=\"p-198\">\n    The record suggests that Sandia Labs' Compensation Group was involved in creating the employee performance evaluation process.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    1150 n.14.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-199\">\n    The Plaintiffs argue that, because they challenge Sandia Labs' policies, the decision place at issue is where those policies were created and/or managed.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Response at 2 (\"[T]he challenged common policies and practices at the heart of this class action appear to have been created and/or monitored off federal land.\"); Post-Hearing Response at 4 (arguing that the Plaintiffs do not challenge managers' decisions but rather the \"systematic discrimination against women as a class by way of four company-wide policies\");\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 4-5 (\"Plaintiffs have even shown how the named Plaintiffs' individual allegations stem from specific, challenged companywide policies.\").
