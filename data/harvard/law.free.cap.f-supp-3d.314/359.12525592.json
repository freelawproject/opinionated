Summary J. Ex. K. His supervisor, Lieutenant Kelly Graves, gave him a 100% recommendation, and he also earned a 100% \"D.C. Code Score.\" <em>Id.</em> ; <em>see also</em> Opp. to Mot. Summary J. 5. Mr. Hardy's overall score of 81% represents the average of these four scores and placed him 17 out of 21 tryout participants. <em>See</em> Mot. Summary J. Ex. K. Nine participants, including three female officers, were selected for the bike team, but Mr. Hardy was not selected. Opp. to Mot. Summary J. 5.</p><p id=\"p-11\">In June 2015, Mr. Hardy contacted the Board's Employee Relations office to discuss his concern that female officers were favored over him in the formation of the bike team. <em>Id.</em> at 6.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Employee Relations forwarded Mr. Hardy's complaint to the Board's Equal Employment Opportunity, or EEO, office. <em>Id.</em> In August 2015, Mr. Hardy spoke with Andre Smith, an EEO counselor, to discuss the bike selection process and other instances of perceived discrimination. <em>Id.</em></p><p id=\"p-12\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"361\" href=\"#p361\" id=\"p361\">*361</a>The Plaintiffs allege that Mr. Hardy's supervisors learned of his complaint as soon as he contacted the EEO office, and that Lt. Graves retaliated against Mr. Hardy because of it. <em>Id.</em> at 6-11. For example, they allege that when Mr. Hardy sought promotion to corporal, Lt.

The Board dismissed their complaint because Mr. Hardy's estate lacked standing. <em>Id.</em> at 26-27. The Plaintiffs then sued the Chairman of the Board of Governors in federal court, alleging that the Board violated Title VII by committing sex discrimination and by retaliating against Mr. Hardy for engaging in activity protected by Title VII. The Defendant moved to dismiss the Complaint.

A plaintiff must satisfy the administrative exhaustion requirement for each discrete act of discrimination or retaliation of which he complains. <em>Nurriddin</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8934445\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/382/79/#p92\">382 F.Supp.2d at </extracted-citation>93 (citing <em>Nat'l R.R.

Graves discriminated against Mr. Hardy for engaging in Title VII activity. To satisfy the counseling requirement for this claim, which would be the first step toward showing exhaustion, Mr. Hardy would have had to believe that Lt. Graves retaliated against him and would have had to consult with an EEO Counselor about the alleged retaliation. This he did not do.</p><p id=\"p-24\">The Plaintiffs seek to satisfy the counseling requirement in three ways. First, they note that Mr. Hardy contacted EEO Counselor Andre Smith. Opp. to Mot. Summary J. 23-24. Second, they note that Mr. Hardy complained about unfair treatment in a letter that he sent to Gina Lewis, who worked in Employee Relations. <em>Id.</em> at 24-26.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Third, they argue that they <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"363\" href=\"#p363\" id=\"p363\">*363</a>satisfied the counseling requirement on Mr. Hardy's behalf by contacting an EEO Counselor as the representatives of his estate. <em>Id.</em> at 26-30.</p><p id=\"p-26\">The Plaintiffs do claim that Mr. Hardy's letter to Ms. Lewis complained about Lt. Graves retaliating against him for Title VII activity. Pls.' Response to Def.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts \u00b6 21. But the letter does not reference retaliation, allege that Lt. Graves treated Mr. Hardy differently because of his Title VII activity, or even suggest that Lt. Graves knew of Mr. Hardy's Title VII activity. <em>See</em> Opp. to Mot. Summary J. Ex. 18. To the contrary, the letter states that Lt. Graves mistreated Mr. Hardy because of his sex and that Mr. Hardy felt clear Lt. Graves \"was coming for [him] personally\" even before he engaged in Title VII activity. Opp. to Mot. Summary J. Ex. 18, 1. Thus, the record shows that Mr. Hardy did not initiate counseling for retaliation and suggests that he did not believe the treatment he experienced was retaliation for Title VII activity. This is fatal to the Plaintiffs' retaliation claim. One can only sue for the specific Title VII violations that were complained of to one's employer. <em>Nurriddin</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8934445\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/382/79/#p92\">382 F.Supp.2d at 92</extracted-citation>. Swapping Title VII horses midstream frustrates the employer's ability to address actual misconduct before litigation becomes necessary and increases the time and expense involved in defending against frivolous allegations.</p><p id=\"p-27\">As for the Plaintiffs' argument that they have satisfied the counseling requirement on Mr. Hardy's behalf, it is inconsistent with the requirement that \"[a]ggrieved persons who believe they have been discriminated against\" undergo counseling. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.105\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105</extracted-citation>(a). The Plaintiffs emphasize that Title VII defines \"person\" broadly to include governments, agencies, unions, companies, and, most importantly here, legal representatives. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(a). But no one disputes that the Plaintiffs are persons. The question is whether they have received counseling as \"[a]ggrieved persons who believe they have been discriminated against.\" And the Plaintiffs do not allege that Lt. Graves discriminated against them, but that he discriminated against Mr. Hardy for engaging in Title VII activity. Thus, they cannot satisfy the counseling requirement. This conclusion follows from the plain language of <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.105\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105</extracted-citation>(a).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-28\">Perhaps in recognition of their textual argument's weakness, the Plaintiffs suggest two other reasons that their initiation of counseling should satisfy <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.105\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105</extracted-citation>(a). First, they worry that requiring the aggrieved person to initiate counseling would prevent justice from being done when employees murder their colleagues. Opp. to Mot.

Wright v. United States</em> was a man whose wife had been murdered. <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4297416\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/914/837/#p840\">914 F.Supp.2d 837</extracted-citation>, 840 (S.D. Miss. 2012). The woman's supervisor, who had been in an affair with her, was indicted for the murder. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4297416\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/914/837/#p840\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> The plaintiff sought to initiate a Title VII sex discrimination and retaliation claim as the decedent's legal representative. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4297416\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/914/837/#p840\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4297416\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/914/837/#p840\"> at 840, 842</extracted-citation>. The court recognized that a Title VII claim initiated by an employee survives him and may be pursued by the employee's legal representatives. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4297416\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/914/837/#p840\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4297416\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/914/837/#p840\"> at 841-42</extracted-citation>. But it \"found no case recognizing the authority of a deceased employee's representative to <em>initiate</em> an administrative complaint on behalf of the deceased employee.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4297416\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/914/837/#p840\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4297416\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/914/837/#p840\"> at 842</extracted-citation> (emphasis added). And it held that the husband could not assert a Title VII claim on behalf of his wife that she had not initiated while still alive. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4297416\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/914/837/#p840\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"4297416\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/914/837/#p840\"> at 843</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-31\"><em>Wright</em> did not insist, as the Plaintiffs do, that Title VII provides a necessary remedy for murder. But if a Title VII claim were necessary to promote justice, the problem could likely be resolved by an equitable doctrine such as estoppel since exhaustion in the Title VII context is not jurisdictional but functions like a statute of limitations. <em>See</em> <em>Bowden v. United States</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650400,3703281\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/106/433/\">106 F.3d 433</extracted-citation>, 437 (D.C. Cir. 1997). And <em>Wright</em> shows that, contrary to the Plaintiffs' view, precedents allowing a decedent's estate to pursue Title VII claims that the decedent initiated while still alive are distinguishable from situations like their own. This makes sense because an employee must satisfy the counseling requirement to initiate a Title VII claim, and once that requirement is satisfied it will not pose a bar to litigation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In short, the Plaintiffs' arguments cannot overcome the fact that the text of the regulation and the only precedent that is on point show they cannot satisfy the counseling requirement on behalf of Mr. Hardy.</p><p id=\"p-32\"><strong>IV.</strong></p><p id=\"p-33\">For the reasons stated above, I conclude that the Plaintiffs have failed to satisfy Title VII's exhaustion requirements. Thus, the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgement will be granted. A separate order will issue.</p><p id=\"p-36\">The Complaint named Janet Yellen as the Defendant, in her official capacity. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(d) automatically substitutes her successor, Jerome Powell, as the Defendant.</p><p id=\"p-37\">Summary judgment on Ms. Hardy's claims will also be granted on the alternative ground that she cannot sue as a personal representative of Mr. Hardy's estate because Mr. Pope is the sole personal representative of that estate. <em>See</em> Mot. Summary J. Ex. U. Ms. Hardy's unsupported statement that she disagrees with this assertion does not create a genuine factual dispute. <em>See</em> Pls.' Response to Def.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts \u00b6 28.</p><p id=\"p-38\">The record does not reflect exactly how Mr. Hardy thought his non-selection for the bike team was discriminatory. But the Plaintiffs have offered their own explanation. The Plaintiffs assert that the scores on the speed and cone tests were percentiles rather than percentages and that, because the worst performer on the speed test scored 62%, Mr. Hardy could have been the worst performer on the cone test and still deserved a 62% score \"at a minimum.\" Pls.' Response to Def.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts \u00b6 16. According to the Plaintiffs, this shows that the Board scored Mr. Hardy arbitrarily on the cone test to ensure female officers would score above him. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650400,3703281\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/106/433/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> But what the Plaintiffs' argument really shows is their own failure to understand mathematics. Being the worst performer and being in the sixty-second percentile are not the same. In any event, only the Board's alleged retaliatory actions post-dating the tryouts are now before me.</p><p id=\"p-39\">According to the Board, Mr. Hardy could not reschedule his exam because of an unwavering rule against make-up exams that protects the integrity of testing. Mot. Summary J. 9-10; <em>see also <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7650400,3703281\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/106/433/\">id.</extracted-citation></em> Ex. N \u00b6 4. The Plaintiffs disagree, noting that the Board had never administered the corporal exam before and that nothing in the General Order setting guidelines for participation in the Corporal Program prohibited rescheduling the test. Pls.' Response to Def.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts \u00b6 19. They also argue that the Board's willingness to accommodate a different employee's travel schedule by conducting an interview by phone shows that the Board should have accommodated Mr. Hardy's rescheduling request. Opp. to Mot. Summary J. 21. But none of this undermines the Board's position. A telephonic interview does not implicate the process integrity concerns that are raised by allowing one test taker to take a standardized test at a different time than his peers.</p><p id=\"p-40\">The parties dispute whether transfer required Mr. Hardy to submit a written request up the chain of command and whether Mr. Hardy did so. <em>See</em> Mot. Summary J. 10; Pls.' Response to Def.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts \u00b6 22. For purposes of this ruling, I assume the Plaintiffs' version of events is correct.</p><p id=\"p-41\">The phrase \"discriminated against\" appears to include \"retaliated against,\" since Title VII's anti-retaliation provision describes retaliation as discrimination based on engagement in protected activity. <em>See</em> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). In any event, the Plaintiffs concede that <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.105\">29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105</extracted-citation> governs exhaustion of their retaliation claims. <em>See</em> Opp. to Mot.
