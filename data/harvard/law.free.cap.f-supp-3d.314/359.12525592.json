Graves discriminated against Mr. Hardy for engaging in Title VII activity. To satisfy the counseling requirement for this claim, which would be the first step toward showing exhaustion, Mr. Hardy would have had to believe that Lt. Graves retaliated against him and would have had to consult with an EEO Counselor about the alleged retaliation. This he did not do.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-24\">\n       The Plaintiffs seek to satisfy the counseling requirement in three ways. First, they note that Mr. Hardy contacted EEO Counselor Andre Smith. Opp. to Mot. Summary J. 23-24. Second, they note that Mr. Hardy complained about unfair treatment in a letter that he sent to Gina Lewis, who worked in Employee Relations.\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       at 24-26.\n       <footnotemark>\n        7\n       </footnotemark>\n       Third, they argue that they\n      satisfied the counseling requirement on Mr. Hardy's behalf by contacting an EEO Counselor as the representatives of his estate.\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       at 26-30.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-25\">\n       But none of this shows Mr. Hardy believed that Lt. Graves retaliated against him and that he consulted with an EEO Counselor about the problem. Although Mr. Hardy complained to Mr. Smith and Ms. Lewis about sex discrimination, he did not complain that Lt. Graves mistreated him in retaliation for engaging in Title VII activity. The Plaintiffs do not allege that Mr. Hardy complained to Mr. Smith about retaliation.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       Opp. to Mot. Summary J. 23-24. In fact, they allege that the retaliation of which they complain took place\n       <em>\n        after\n       </em>\n       Mr. Hardy contacted Mr. Smith and in response to that contact.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       <em>\n        id.\n       </em>\n       at 6.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-26\">\n       The Plaintiffs do claim that Mr. Hardy's letter to Ms. Lewis complained about Lt. Graves retaliating against him for Title VII activity. Pls.' Response to Def.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts \u00b6 21. But the letter does not reference retaliation, allege that Lt. Graves treated Mr. Hardy differently because of his Title VII activity, or even suggest that Lt. Graves knew of Mr. Hardy's Title VII activity.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       Opp. to Mot. Summary J. Ex. 18. To the contrary, the letter states that Lt. Graves mistreated Mr. Hardy because of his sex and that Mr. Hardy felt clear Lt. Graves \"was coming for [him] personally\" even before he engaged in Title VII activity. Opp. to Mot. Summary J. Ex. 18, 1. Thus, the record shows that Mr. Hardy did not initiate counseling for retaliation and suggests that he did not believe the treatment he experienced was retaliation for Title VII activity. This is fatal to the Plaintiffs' retaliation claim. One can only sue for the specific Title VII violations that were complained of to one's employer.\n       <em>\n        Nurriddin\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8934445\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/382/79/#p92\">\n        382 F.Supp.2d at 92\n       </extracted-citation>\n       . Swapping Title VII horses midstream frustrates the employer's ability to address actual misconduct before litigation becomes necessary and increases the time and expense involved in defending against frivolous allegations.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-27\">\n       As for the Plaintiffs' argument that they have satisfied the counseling requirement on Mr. Hardy's behalf, it is inconsistent with the requirement that \"[a]ggrieved persons who believe they have been discriminated against\" undergo counseling.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.105\">\n        29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (a). The Plaintiffs emphasize that Title VII defines \"person\" broadly to include governments, agencies, unions, companies, and, most importantly here, legal representatives. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(a). But no one disputes that the Plaintiffs are persons. The question is whether they have received counseling as \"[a]ggrieved persons who believe they have been discriminated against.\" And the Plaintiffs do not allege that Lt. Graves discriminated against them, but that he discriminated against Mr. Hardy for engaging in Title VII activity. Thus, they cannot satisfy the counseling requirement. This conclusion follows from the plain language of\n       <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.105\">\n        29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (a).\n       <footnotemark>\n        8\n       </footnotemark>\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-28\">\n       Perhaps in recognition of their textual argument's weakness, the Plaintiffs suggest two other reasons that their initiation of counseling should satisfy\n       <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.105\">\n        29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1614.105\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (a). First, they worry that requiring the aggrieved person to initiate counseling would prevent justice from being done when employees murder their colleagues. Opp. to Mot. Summary J. 27-28.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-29\">\n       Second, they argue that this requirement is inconsistent with precedents establishing that a decedent's estate may pursue Title VII claims that the decedent initiated while living.\n       <em>\n        <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.105\">\n         Id.\n        </extracted-citation>\n       </em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201614.105\">\n        at 28\n       </extracted-citation>\n       .\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-30\">\n       Neither of these concerns swayed the court in what appears to be the only judicial opinion to have decided this question.\n       <footnotemark>\n        9\n       </footnotemark>\n       The plaintiff in\n       <em>\n        Wright ex rel.

The court recognized that a Title VII claim initiated by an employee survives him and may be pursued by the employee's legal representatives.\n       <em>\n        <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4297416\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/914/837/#p840\">\n         Id.\n        </extracted-citation>\n       </em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4297416\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/914/837/#p840\">\n        at 841-42\n       </extracted-citation>\n       .

But if a Title VII claim were necessary to promote justice, the problem could likely be resolved by an equitable doctrine such as estoppel since exhaustion in the Title VII context is not jurisdictional but functions like a statute of limitations.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       <em>\n        Bowden v.

Cir. 1997). And\n       <em>\n        Wright\n       </em>\n       shows that, contrary to the Plaintiffs' view, precedents allowing a decedent's estate to pursue Title VII claims that the decedent initiated while still alive are distinguishable from situations like their own. This makes sense because an employee must satisfy the counseling requirement to initiate a Title VII claim, and once that requirement is satisfied it will not pose a bar to litigation.\n       <footnotemark>\n        10\n       </footnotemark>\n       In short, the Plaintiffs' arguments cannot overcome the fact that the text of the regulation and the only precedent that is on point show they cannot satisfy the counseling requirement on behalf of Mr. Hardy.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-33\">\n       For the reasons stated above, I conclude that the Plaintiffs have failed to satisfy Title VII's exhaustion requirements. Thus, the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgement will be granted. A separate order will issue.\n      </p>\n     </p>\n    </div>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
