MCFADDEN, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiff Sylvia Singletary, a licensed doctor of veterinary medicine, alleges that her former employer, Howard University, unlawfully terminated her employment and seeks damages and other relief for breach of contract and under the Anti-Retaliation Clause of the False Claims Act and the District of Columbia's wrongful termination public policy exception. First Am. Compl. (\"Am. Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 7, ECF No. 4. The University seeks to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, contending that Dr. Singletary did not engage in activity protected under the False Claims Act and that the University did not actually terminate her employment. Howard Univ.'s Mem. of P. &amp; A. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (\"Mot. to Dismiss\") 6-12, ECF No. 9. The Court finds that Dr. Singletary has neither sufficiently alleged that she engaged in protected activity nor that the University terminated her employment. Dr. Singletary's False Claims Act claim should therefore be dismissed for failure to state a claim, and because the University's other grounds for dismissal presents a challenge to her standing, her other claims will be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The University's motion will accordingly be granted and the Amended Complaint will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Dr. Singletary, a licensed doctor of veterinary medicine, is a former University employee.

She does not, however, allege any factual detail about who gave her the alleged termination notice, the format of the alleged communication, or any effective date of the termination. Indeed, the phrasing of Dr. Singletary's allegation-that her employment \"\n    <em>\n     would be\n    </em>\n    terminated\"-implies that the University, at most, evidenced the possibility of termination at a future date.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 18 (emphasis added).
