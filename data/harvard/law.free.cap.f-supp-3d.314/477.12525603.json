(Dkt. 1). Plaintiff has also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, a motion for a preliminary injunction, and a motion for an expedited hearing on his preliminary injunction application. (Dkt. 2; Dkt. 4). For the following reasons, Plaintiff's motion for a temporary restraining order is denied. The Court sets a status conference for\n   <em>\n    Thursday, July 5, 2018, at 3:00 P.M.\n   </em>\n   , at the United States Courthouse, 2 Niagara Square, Buffalo, NY 14202-3350.\n   <em>\n    All parties and/or their counsel must appear at that status conference\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff avers that he owns and operates \"Crash-A-Rama,\" which he describes as \" '[t]he wildest show on wheels,' featuring men and women running old junk cars in exciting and entertaining events.\" (Dkt. 2 at 3-4). Plaintiff further avers that he is the sole owner of a registered federal trademark for the name, \"Crash-A-Rama.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1 at 16-25 (exhibits to Plaintiff's complaint) ). Plaintiff has operated Crash-A-Rama at the Holland International Speedway (the \"Speedway\") in Holland, New York for eighteen years. (Dkt. 2 at 3-4). However, Defendants recently acquired the Speedway, and they now operate that location under the name \"Hillside Buffalo, LLC a/k/a The Track at Hillside Buffalo.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff avers that on or about May 30, 2018, Defendants \"knowingly and purposefully converted [his] business and federal trademark ... into 'Crash-O-Rama'; all for [D]efendants' exclusive profit and gain and to the detriment of [P]laintiff[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Defendants have advertised a \"Crash-O-Rama\" event to take place on Saturday, June 16, 2018, at the Speedway, and appear to have done so in conjunction with the sale of tickets both online and in print. (Dkt. 2 at 4-6;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 1 at 33, 37, 41-46 (exhibits to Plaintiff's complaint) ). Plaintiff avers that this \"slight and nearly unnoticeable change\" to his registered trademark was intended to capitalize upon Plaintiff's \"good reputation, unique auto racing, and successful business history and earnings\" by confusing and \"trick[ing] the public and consumers ... to sell tickets and generate money only to [Defendants'] benefit.\" (Dkt. 2 at 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The next day, Plaintiff notified Defendants by email that they had infringed upon his registered trademark, and he demanded that they \"cease and desist\" any further misappropriation of the \"Crash-A-Rama\" name. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). In his complaint,\n   Plaintiff alleges that he sent a second email to Defendants on June 13, 2018, rendering essentially the same notice described in the first email. (Dkt. 1 at 7, 52). Plaintiff avers that his emails have not halted Defendants' continued use of his registered trademark, and thus, he seeks a temporary restraining order to prevent Defendants from holding the \"Crash-O-Rama\" event on Saturday, June 16, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 2 at 5-6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Subject Matter Jurisdiction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Here, Plaintiff alleges that he has a registered federal trademark in the name \"Crash-A-Rama,\" and that Defendants have infringed upon this property right by using the name \"Crash-O-Rama\" in the advertisement, promotion, and sale of their tickets for this event. (Dkt. 1 at 7). In addition, the \"Crash-O-Rama\" event is scheduled to be held at the same location as the previous \"Crash-A-Rama\" events, which would likely give rise to at least some consumer confusion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%2011355284\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff also specifically alleges that Defendants have converted his trademark to \"intentionally confuse[ ] and trick[ ] the public and consumers ... to sell tickets and generate money\" based upon Plaintiff's own \"good reputation and successful business history and earnings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Furthermore, Plaintiff has attached several exhibits to his Complaint that display information conveyed by defendants JM Motorsports and Hillside Buffalo, LLC, which use the \"Crash-O-Rama\" name in the advertisement and sale of tickets for this event over the Internet. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 33, 37, 41). These allegations suggest that Plaintiff's trademark is being \"use[d] in commerce\" for the sale or advertisement of services, and in a deceptive manner that may create consumer confusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201114\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1)(a). Therefore, although Plaintiff's allegations pertaining to the violation of the Lanham Act are not artfully drafted, the Court preliminarily finds that he has properly raised the applicability of the Lanham Act in invoking federal question jurisdiction.
