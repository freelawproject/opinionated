(Docs. 143, 144, 145). Defendants' nearly identical motions specifically address the applicability of the MCA and TCA to three Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The motions turn not on the numerous questions bulleted above, but only on whether the three Plaintiffs-during certain weeks-drove F-550 trucks or worked less than 40 hours.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These issues do require specific factual inquiries concerning each Plaintiff, but not to the extent expressed in Defendants' decertification motion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Additionally, the motions for summary judgment rely heavily on drivers' logs to show the types of trucks Plaintiffs drove and the hours Plaintiffs worked.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.601\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs respond by criticizing the accuracy of the drivers' logs. (Docs. 166, 167, 169). Therefore, the evidence used to support the narrow fact questions is limited. Accordingly, this defense should not overly complicate the trial as Defendants support the defense with a limited body of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court also notes that many of the specific fact questions cited by Defendants apply to each Plaintiff-i.e. Defendants raise the same defenses against most, if not all, Plaintiffs. This lends support to the notion that Plaintiffs are similarly situated. The Court references one of Defendants' cited cases to support this position. In\n   <em>\n    Vanzzini\n   </em>\n   , the court considered certifying a collective action when a defendant raised an MCA defense:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendants have legitimate individualized defenses\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     with respect to at least one of the putative class members.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   While the evidence available was not sufficient to grant summary judgment for the reasons explained above,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Defendants may still put on evidence to demonstrate that the MCA exemption applies to Mr. Flanagan, which they may not do with respect to any of the other remaining opt-in class members.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The kind of highly factual, individualized inquiry that determining whether the MCA exemption applies to Mr. Flanagan would require in the wake of the Court's decision on Defendants' MCA Summary Judgment Motion counsels against including him in the certified class.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Vanzzini\n   </em>\n   , 995 F.Supp.2d at 723 (emphasis added). The court did not include Mr.\n   Flanagan in the certified class because the MCA defense would apply solely to Mr. Flanagan, not to other putative class members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 723-724. Here, Defendants assert MCA defenses against most, if not all, Plaintiffs. (Doc. 87 at 9). Therefore, Plaintiffs in this case are more similarly situated than Mr. Flanagan was to the putative class members in\n   <em>\n    Vanzzini.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In other words, although the MCA defense may require specific factual inquiries about each Plaintiff, Defendants assert the MCA defense against every Plaintiff. Therefore, collective treatment is less problematic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Highly-Compensated Employee Defense\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendants next contend that the HCE raises individualized issues that preclude collective treatment. (Doc. 146 at 20). Defendants argue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Indeed, most discovery Plaintiffs admitted that they earned in excess of $100,000 on an annualized basis. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   fn. 2 supra). However, some Plaintiffs will deny that they earned more than $100,000 annually.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , (Ex. T-N. Renteria Response to Request for Admission No. 1). So as a threshold matter, the highly compensated exemption may be available for some operators based on their annualized earnings, but not for others. Thus, there are discrepancies among which defenses may be asserted and which exemptions may apply to each Plaintiff.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. Defendants also note that the HCE defense will require an examination of Plaintiffs' management activities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   However, Defendants' HCE arguments are subject to the same analysis as the MCA arguments above. Defendants assert the HCE defense against many, if not all, Plaintiffs. (Doc. 87 at 8). Therefore, each Plaintiff must undergo the same factual inquiries-demonstrating again that the Plaintiffs are similarly situated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Overall, it appears that Defendants assert the MCA and HCE defenses against most Plaintiffs and rely on a limited body of evidence to support the defenses. Therefore, each Plaintiff must undergo the same factual inquiry as to whether that Plaintiff is subject to the MCA or HCE exemption. The Court does not see how posing this inquiry 70 times in one collective trial is any less difficult then posing the same inquiry 70 times in 70 separate trials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Fairness and Procedural Considerations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The third factor to weigh requires an examination of fairness and procedural\n   considerations.\n   <em>\n    Falcon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3889829\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/580/528/#p534\">\n    580 F.Supp.2d at 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under this factor, the Court considers \"the primary objectives of the FLSA \u00a7 216(b) collective action: (1) to lower costs to the plaintiffs through the pooling of resources, and (2) to limit the controversy to one proceeding which efficiently resolves common issues of law and fact that arise from the same alleged activity.\n   <em>\n    Reyes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%20101808\">\n    2007 WL 101808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (citing\n   <em>\n    Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc. v.

Defendants suggest:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiffs have benefitted from whatever efficiency has been gained through the conditionally certified action and discovery from Defendants to date, but given the liability issues that are purely personal to each Plaintiff the case cannot remain certified or be tried on a representative basis fairly or efficiently.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   (Doc. 146 at 27-28). Nonetheless, as Plaintiffs note, the alternative is to dismiss the opt-in Plaintiffs' claims without prejudice. (Doc. 171 at 20);\n   <em>\n    Vanzzini\n   </em>\n   , 995 F.Supp.2d at 720. The result would be the filing of 70 identical lawsuits which would proceed to 70 identical trials. Such a situation would result in an exponential growth in costs-both in money and time-for both parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vanzzini\n   </em>\n   , 995 F.Supp.2d at 723 (Stating, \"there is a vast difference between granting decertification regarding a potential class of hundreds, or even dozens, and thereafter facing as many individual suits, and granting decertification regarding two potential class members.\"). Concerning costs and efficiency to both parties, collective action is favored.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Court next considers the second and third factors-the ability to manage a collective action to resolve common issues without prejudicing either party. As mentioned previously, the Plaintiffs share similar factual and employment similarities and Defendants' defenses, while requiring some specific factual questions, are generally asserted against all Plaintiffs and supported by a limited body of evidence. Further, the Court notes this case is set for a bench trial, which provides flexibility in juggling a potentially complex case. (Doc. 141). Accordingly, the Court believes the trial can be collectively managed fairly and efficiently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Defendants cite\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   as \"a cautionary tale of a district court's erroneous denial of a defendant's decertification motion, and the waste of judicial and litigant resources and time that resulted.\" (Doc. 146 at 28) (citing\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4026817\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/561/567/#p574\">\n    561 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   574 ). The cautionary tale of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   is admittedly unnerving.
