ECF No. 50. Although Plaintiff may be chomping at the bit to get to trial, Defendant's motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .

Specifically, this is a case about alleged copyright infringement of photographs of teeth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Dr. Mitchell A. Pohl is a practicing dentist in Boca Raton, Florida. ECF No. 41, at 2. Starting around the year 2000, Pohl began taking before-and-after photographs of his cosmetic dental work for his practice's website.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3; ECF No. 49-1, at 3. He takes these photos to promote his skills in the field of cosmetic dentistry. ECF No. 40-1, at \u00b6 19. One pair of photographs displays his patient Belinda's teeth. ECF No. 49-1, at 5-7. Pohl took these photos in the fall of 2004. ECF No. 41, at 5. The photos consist of two direct shots of the patient's teeth-one before the dental work and the other after the dental work. The patient is revealing her teeth and, in both shots, the photo consists of her teeth, her lips, and a small area around the mouth. ECF No. 49-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Figure 1: The before-and-after photos of Pohl's patient, Belinda. ECF No. 49-2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In November 2005, Pohl prepared and filed an application for a copyright. ECF No. 40-1, at \u00b6 8; ECF No. 41, at 3. The Register of Copyrights issued TX 6-201-837 with an effective date of November 28, 2005. ECF No. 40-2. On the application, the nature of the authorship was identified as \"Text and Photographs;\" a handwritten \"Web Site\" also appears in the space identifying the nature of the authorship.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The application identified the work's completion in 2000 and November 20, 2000 as the date of its first publication.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In 2014, Pohl applied for a Supplementary Registration, which the Register of Copyrights issued as TX 6-484-589. ECF No. 40-1, at \u00b6\u00b6 14-15; ECF No. 42-3. The purpose of the Supplementary Registration was to limit the copyright to only the photographs. ECF No. 40-1, at \u00b6 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In April 2016, Pohl performed a reverse-image search on Google of the before-and-after photos of patient Belinda. ECF No. 40-1, at \u00b6 21. In doing so, Pohl claims to have discovered seven websites on which Belinda's toothy visage smiled back at him-seven websites that were not his own.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 22. All seven websites allegedly identified Defendant Officite as the designer or developer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. Rather than brush off this discovery, Pohl, through his attorney, sent a letter to Officite demanding that it cease and desist using these photographs on the discovered websites. ECF No. 40-5, at \u00b6\u00b6 5-6. By June 2016, the photographs were no longer on the seven websites. ECF No. 41, at 7; ECF No. 40-5, at \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.

Officite is armed to the teeth in legal arguments-some persuasive, some not. This Court addresses only those arguments necessary to resolve this case and therefore holds its tongue on the issue of damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Plaintiff's Copyright Extends to Materials He Claims to Have Concurrently Deposited With the 2005 Registration.\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Officite first attempts to limit the scope of Pohl's 2005 copyright to only his website as it appeared in 2000, rendering the copyright toothless as to the 2004 photos. Officite reasons that because the copyright registration identified the work's completion in 2000 and November 20, 2000 as the date of its first publication, then 2000 is the correct year for the copyright's scope. ECF No. 50, at 5-9. Because Pohl took the before-and-after shots of Belinda's chompers in 2004, the copyright cannot cover them-or so Officite argues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Pohl fights tooth and nail against this argument. He explains that he mistakenly identified 2000 as the year of the work's completion and mistakenly identified November 20, 2000 as the date of the photos' first publication. He erroneously interpreted the copyright registration form to direct him to add the date of his\n   <em>\n    website's\n   </em>\n   creation and first publication-not the date of the\n   <em>\n    photographs'\n   </em>\n   creation and first publication. ECF No. 40-1, at \u00b6 16. \"I made this mistake due to my unfamiliarity with the copyright application process,\" Pohl explains.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342701\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/39/1392/#p1404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 17 &amp; 18. He states that he should have entered 2005 as the year the work was completed and November 21, 2005 as the date of first publication.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342701\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/39/1392/#p1404\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Pohl also claims that he deposited materials concurrent with the copyright application that exhibited the website as it existed in 2005. ECF No. 53-1, at 11 (\"Q: Which version of the website did you use? A: That's also-you know, whatever version I had up in 2005. Q: Do you know whether you used an earlier version of the website? A: Whatever was up in 2005.\"). The deposited materials, Pohl claims, came in the form of \"a DVD or a CD of [his practice's] website.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10. This CD or DVD included the before-and-after shots at issue. ECF No. 40-1, at \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   While Officite asserts that the copyright registration form-with its incorrect dates-is the critical document that limits the scope of copyright protections,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 50, at 5-9, Pohl argues that it is the deposited materials that are covered by the copyright.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 46, at 6.

It reasoned that \"the plaintiff has deposited with the Copyright Office the versions of the programs which defendants were 'caught' using in 1986 and which it asserts were infringed. The erroneous date entered on the registration form does not affect [the plaintiff's] right to sue.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3935260\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/646/1329/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3935260\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/646/1329/\">\n    at 1342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   So too here.

And a jury may find Pohl's self-serving testimony to be as persuasive as plaque is useful to molars.

There is, after all, only so much to argue about the creativity and originality of close-up photographs of teeth. He superficially applies authority holding that originality in photographs \"\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   include posing the subjects, lighting, angle, selection of film and camera, evoking the desired expression, and almost any other variant involved.\"\n   <em>\n    Rogers v. Koons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520812\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/960/301/#p307\">\n    960 F.2d 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 307 (2d Cir. 1992) (emphasis added). \"Pohl was responsible for,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , selecting the camera, posing the subject matter, and determining the lighting and photo angle before taking the photographs,\" he argues. ECF No. 46, at 9. Such analysis is riddled with cavities that no cursory filling can rectify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Pohl's described process involves no \"creative spark.\"\n   <em>\n    Feist\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318883\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/340/#p345\">\n    499 U.S. at 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318883\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/340/#p345\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Pohl does not know what type of camera he used-or even if it was a digital camera or one requiring film. ECF No. 53-1, at 8. He does not know if patient Belinda was sitting or standing when he photographed her mouth.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318883\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/340/#p345\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   To the extent he posed her for the camera, it was to tilt her head, lift her chin up or down, instruct her to smile, or to tell her to look at the camera.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. As for lighting, there is no creativity in merely having sufficient lighting in the room where Pohl took the photographs. He offers no evidence regarding the shading or lighting of the photographs. The photo angle involved Pohl \"mov[ing] the camera in and out until I get it in focus,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7,-the most rudimentary and basic task for photographers since the era of the daguerreotype. The whole process took no more than five minutes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The photographs serve the purely utilitarian purpose of advertising Pohl's services. He admits as much. \"I use the before and after pictures of my dental work to promote my skills in the field of cosmetic dentistry.\" ECF No. 40-1, at \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Surely arranging Chinese food in different patterns after placing them on decorative plates to achieve an aesthetically pleasing look involved more \"creative spark\" than directing a subject to smile and moving a camera to focus on a portion of the subject's face. If the former is neither creative nor original, then the latter\n   most certainly is not. In short, when viewing the before-and-after photos, no pairs of eyes on a reasonable jury can find any modicum of creativity or originality in these photographs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    C\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This Court next sinks its teeth into Pohl's motion for partial summary judgment on the issue of copyright infringement. \"To establish infringement, two elements must be proven: (1) ownership of a valid copyright, and (2) copying of constituent elements of the work that are original.\"\n   <em>\n    Feist\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318883\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/340/#p345\">\n    499 U.S. at 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11318883\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/499/340/#p345\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).

Regarding the second element, Pohl \"must establish, as a factual matter, that the alleged infringer actually copied [his] copyrighted material.\"\n   <em>\n    Latimer\n   </em>\n   , 601 F.3d at 1233.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Pohl's evidence has some bite. He provides a copyright registration, a Supplementary Registration, and affixes patient Belinda's before-and-after shots to his declaration. ECF Nos. 40-1, at 2.
