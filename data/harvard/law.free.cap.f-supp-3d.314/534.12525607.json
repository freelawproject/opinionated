NATHAN, District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   After a truck carrying contaminated milk further contaminated several hundred thousand pounds of milk and cheese in a cheese-making plant, litigation ensued. The transport company that delivered the contaminated milk had an insurance policy with each of the parties to this action. Plaintiff Harleysville Worcester Insurance Company (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Harleysville\") defended its insured in the underlying litigation; Defendant Wesco Insurance Company, Inc. (\"Defendant\" or \"Wesco\") disclaimed coverage. In this case, Harleysville seeks reimbursement from Wesco for the costs to defend and indemnify the transport company, including the costs of settling the underlying actions. Now before the Court is Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and Defendant's cross-motion to withdraw any deemed admissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court GRANTS Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and DENIES as moot Defendant's cross-motion to withdraw any deemed admissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

No. 48, Ex. A. The Harleysville policy covers \"those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to\n   pay as damages because of 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' to which this insurance applies,\" but includes an exclusion for \" 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use or entrustment to others of any aircraft, 'auto' or watercraft owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Beer Decl., Ex.

The Precipitating Incident and the Underlying Actions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In June 2013, one of the milk trailers belonging to M &amp; T was damaged in a roll-over accident while hauling milk. Defendant's Statement of Additional Material Facts (\"SAMF\"), Dkt. No. 64, \u00b6 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   M &amp; T used Blue Grass Tank &amp; Equipment (\"Blue Grass\") for repairs. SAMF \u00b6 2. Upon the trailer's return after its repairs, Thomas Sr. directed an M &amp; T employee to power-wash the trailer from within to remove any debris left from the repair. SAMF \u00b6 5. This employee did not pull the valves off the service lines that run from the tanks to the rear of the trailer before he performed this cleaning. SAMF \u00b6 6. Thomas Sr. saw \"red dirt\" coming out of the discharge manifold of the trailer, which he later stated was consistent with the work Blue Grass performed. SAMF \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   By regulation, M &amp; T is required to wash its trailers with brushes and a chlorinated cleaner before picking up milk. SAMF \u00b6 8. Dairy plants wash the trailers' interiors prior to loading product, although this service can be performed at any dairy, whether or not the trailer is picking up milk there. SAMF \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. Whenever and wherever a trailer is washed, a \"wash tag\" is issued without which milk may not be picked up. SAMF \u00b6 11. Thomas Sr. testified that he took the trailer to Queensboro Farm Products, Inc. (\"Queensboro\") for a machine wash and to receive a wash tag on August 12, 2013, however Queensboro's employees testified that the trailer was never washed there and that milk haulers often take their wash tags without having their trailers washed. SAMF \u00b6\u00b6 2-15. The absence of a wash tag is sufficient grounds to reject a trailer attempting to make a pickup or delivery. SAMF \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 14, 2013, M &amp; T used the milk trailer to transport milk for the first time since the repairs were made. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 3. Agri-Mark, Inc. (\"Agri-Mark\") hired M &amp; T to travel to Agri-Mark's facility, load milk into the milk trailer, and deliver the milk to Agri-Mark's customer, Great Lakes, at its cheese plant in Adams, New York. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 4. The milk delivered by M\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   &amp; T was unloaded through pipes into Great Lakes' plant and was mixed with other milk at the plant. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Shortly thereafter, a Great Lakes operator disconnected the lines through which milk was being pumped and observed what appeared to be debris. SAMF \u00b6 24. Upon further investigation, Great Lakes determined that the contamination spread to other parts of their plant, including an entire cheese making line. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 5-6; SAMF \u00b6\u00b6 23-27. Great Lakes' \"milk receiver\" testified that he did not check for a wash tag, and the wash tag for the trailer was never located. SAMF \u00b6\u00b6 16, 18-19. Based on the contamination incident, Great Lakes submitted a claim to its comprehensive general liability carrier (which also happens to be Harleysville) for property damage totaling $957,650.21. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After the incident, Great Lakes filed two actions, one in federal court and one in state court (together, the \"Underlying Actions\"). Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 8. In the Underlying Actions, Great Lakes claimed damages of approximately $966,000 due to loss of cheese, milk, and other products at the plant, the cost of storage of the contaminated cheese, the cost of cleaning, sanitizing and inspecting the plant, the opportunity cost of plant down-time, and the diversion of milk as a result of the contamination. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 9; Beer Decl., Exs. C (state court complaint) &amp; G (federal court complaint). In the state court action against M &amp; T, Great Lakes also claimed continuing damages and sought reimbursement for the cost of storage, pre-judgment interest, attorneys' fees and punitive damages. Beer Decl., Ex. C. In the federal action, Great Lakes sued Agri-Mark, who, in turn, brought a third-party complaint against M &amp; T.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Beer Decl., Exs. G &amp; H (third-party complaint).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Defending M &amp; T in the Underlying Actions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Harleysville was first notified of the contamination incident on August 20, 2013. By letter dated December 30, 2013, Harleysville notified M &amp; T that it was investigating the claims. Beer Decl., Ex. N. After the Underlying Actions were filed, Harleysville wrote M &amp; T again on April 15, 2014, disclaiming its duty to indemnify M &amp; T, but stating that it would defend M&amp;T \"for the entire complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at HWIC00645-HWIC00646. Harleysville agreed to provide M &amp; T a defense in the Underlying Actions under a complete reservation of rights to deny coverage. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On or about September 23, 2013, M &amp; T notified Wesco of the contamination incident. SAMF \u00b6 34. By letter dated November 6, 2013, Wesco denied coverage to M &amp; T for any liability arising out of the incident. Def. 56.1 \u00b6 12; Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 13; Beer Decl., Ex. M. At the time Wesco disclaimed coverage, the Underlying Actions had not yet been filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Beer Decl., Ex. M, at HWIC00675. The parties dispute when Wesco received notice of the Underlying Actions, which were filed on March 3, 2014 (federal court action), April 3, 2014 (third-party federal action) and December 17, 2015 (state court action).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Amended Complaint, Dkt. No. 44, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 15, 20. Harleysville claims to have sent a copy of the third-party complaint against M &amp; T to Wesco on April 14, 2014. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 16 (citing Beer Decl., Ex. P). Wesco claims it was not notified of any of the actions until January 19, 2016, when M &amp; T's personal counsel transmitted a letter demanding that Wesco immediately assume M &amp; T's defense and indemnification in both actions. SAMF \u00b6 51 (citing Declaration of Josh H. Kardisch (\"Kardisch Decl.\"), Dkt. No. 61, Ex. Q).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Represented by counsel hired by Harleysville, M &amp; T asserted various affirmative defenses and cross-claims in the Underlying Actions arguing that Great Lakes or other defendants were responsible for the alleged harm. SAMF \u00b6\u00b6 41, 43-44. Bluegrass and Queensboro were dismissed from the Underlying Actions by stipulation on October 8, 2015 and January 8, 2016, respectively. SAMF \u00b6\u00b6 49-50.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On April 29, 2016, Harleysville informed Wesco that it would commence a declaratory judgment action against Wesco unless Wesco agreed to cover M &amp; T in the Underlying Actions. Beer Decl., Ex. R. Further, on October 14, 2016, Harleysville's counsel sent Wesco a letter advising that the Judge in the Northern District case had ordered that the parties engage in \"meaningful settlement discussions,\" asserting that Harleysville was not required to defend and indemnify M &amp; T in either action as its policy excluded coverage for \"property damage\" caused by an \"auto,\" and arguing that Wesco was required to defend both actions. SAMF \u00b6 56 (citing Kardisch Decl., Ex. S). Wesco responded by email on November 11, 2016, stating that as Wesco had not received any material information aside from the basic allegations, it could not possibly be in a position to make a settlement recommendation. SAMF \u00b6 59 (citing Kardisch Decl., Ex. V).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On December 16, 2016, a settlement conference was held in the federal court action, attended by counsel for Great Lakes, Agri-Mark, M &amp; T, Wesco, and Harleysville. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 22. Great Lakes' settlement demand was $1.5 million, and Agri-Mark refused to contribute to a global settlement above a nominal amount. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 23. After extensive all-day negotations facilitated by the Honorable Glenn T. Suddaby, United States District Judge for the Northern District of New York, the Underlying Actions were fully settled at the conference, with M &amp; T agreeing to pay $1,025,000 (with Harleysville paying $1,000,000, and M &amp; T paying $25,000, a sum later reduced to $12,500), and Agri-Mark agreeing to pay $50,000. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 24. As part of the settlement, Agri-Mark released all third party claims it asserted against M &amp; T.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Wesco did not contribute to the settlement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   M &amp; T assigned to Harleysville \"all of M &amp; T's rights, claims for relief and causes of action against Wesco with respect to the Underlying Action.\" Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 30. During the conference, Judge Suddaby opined that the settlement range being discussed was \"perfectly reasonable,\" while adding that his opinion was ultimately \"of no moment.\" Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 27; Def. 56.1 \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Present Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Prior to the settlement, Harleysville commenced the instant action on September 19, 2016, seeking a declaratory judgment that it has no obligation to defend or indemnify M &amp; T in the Underlying Actions, seeking a declaratory judgment that Wesco has that obligation, and seeking reimbursement from Wesco for all amounts Harleysville has paid to defend M &amp; T. Dkt. No. 1. On January 27, 2017, Plaintiff filed its first amended complaint, additionally seeking reimbursement for all amounts that Harleysville and M &amp; T paid in settling the Underlying Actions. Dkt. No. 44. On February 2, 2018, Wesco answered the amended complaint, asserting a counterclaim for declaratory judgment as well. Dkt. No. 45. On June 2, 2017, Plaintiff filed the instant motion, moving for summary judgment. Dkt. No. 47. On July 27, 2017, Wesco moved to withdraw any\n   deemed admissions to Plaintiff's first requests for admissions during discovery. Dkt. No. 63.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Harleysville's argument for summary judgment is quite simple. According to Harleysville, it is undisputed in the underlying action that Great Lakes' plant was damaged by the contaminated milk that M &amp; T delivered. Wesco, having provided automobile insurance that covers the operation of the M &amp; T milk trailer in question, had a duty to defend M &amp; T in the underlying action. Harleysville, by contrast, did not have that duty because of the automobile exclusion contained in its policy with M &amp; T. Yet Wesco did not defend M &amp; T, despite having notice of the claim and, later, of the litigation. Harleysville did defend M &amp; T. As a result, Wesco now owes Harleysville reimbursement for the costs it expended in its defense and for the reasonable settlement of the claims against M &amp; T.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Wesco disputes each of Harleysville's statements. Wesco contends that it had no duty to defend or indemnify M &amp; T under the provisions in its policy because: 1) the pleadings in the Underlying Actions did not allege property damage caused by an \"accident;\" 2) the pleadings in the Underlying Actions did not allege an accident resulting from the \"ownership, maintenance or use\" of the milk trailer; and 3) the pleadings in the Underlying Actions alleged property damage that falls with the policy's \"care, custody and control\" exclusion of the policy. In asserting these\n   arguments, Wesco contends that because no final determination was made as to M &amp; T's liability in the Underlying Actions, factual issues remain that bear on Wesco's duty to indemnify. Alternatively, Wesco contends that even if it breached its duty to defend and indemnify, it should be excused from reimbursement both because it did not receive timely notice of the Underlying Actions and so was prejudiced in its ability to investigate or defend the claim, and because the settlement amount was not reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Duty to Defend\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court begins with Harleysville's argument that Wesco breached its duty to defend M &amp; T in the Underlying Actions. Under New York law, \"[a]n insurer's duty to defend its insured is exceedingly broad.\"\n   <em>\n    Regal Constr. Corp. v. Nat'l Union Fire Ins.

Wesco's policy with M &amp; T covers property damage caused by an accident and resulting from the use the milk trailer. Beer Decl., Ex. B, at II.A. In Great Lakes' complaint against M &amp; T, in the very first paragraph the plaintiffs alleged \"[t]his Complaint arises out of the recklessly indifferent and grossly negligent conduct of Defendants [M &amp; T Transport], who contaminated and then delivered a shipment of milk to Plaintiff[.]\" Beer Decl., Ex. C, \u00b6 1. The Complaint, in pleading a cause of action of negligence, continues that Great Lakes suffered damages as a proximate result of M &amp; T using the milk trailer in question for its shipment \"despite the fact that the trailer contained the Metal Contaminant ... and despite the fact that, after the June 2013 accident, the trailer was given only a deficient hand-washing by M &amp; T Transport's untrained employee.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51-56. In Agri-Mark's third party claim against M &amp; T, again, M &amp; T was alleged to have caused any damages through its negligence in, among other things, \"negligently permitting milk to be loaded into a trailer that had not been properly cleaned and/or sanitized; failing to properly transport the milk in a manner to prevent contamination; failing to deliver the milk in the condition it was received[.]\" Beer Decl., Ex. H, \u00b6 17.

Specifically, Wesco argues that its policy with M &amp; T did not cover the incident because it was not an \"accident,\" did not result from the \"ownership, maintenance or use\" of the trailer, and because Wesco received no timely notice of the litigation. The Court addresses these arguments below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   For purposes of considering Wesco's duty to defend, however, it is sufficient to conclude that there is no genuine material dispute that the allegations in the pleadings of the Underlying Actions at least potentially brought the incident within the auspices of Wesco's policy with M &amp; T. \"[A]n insurer can be relieved of its duty to defend [only] if it establishes as a matter of law that there is no possible factual or legal basis on which it might eventually be obligated to indemnify its insured under any policy provision.\"\n   <em>\n    Allstate Ins.

Wesco's policy with M &amp; T states that Wesco \"will pay all sums an 'insured' legally must pay as damages because of 'bodily injury' or 'property damage' to which this insurance applies, caused by an 'accident' and resulting from the ownership, maintenance, or use of a covered\n   'auto.' \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kardisch Decl., Ex. AA. This means that the policy provides coverage for \"property damage\" only if it is both \"caused by an 'accident' \" and results \"from the 'ownership, maintenance, or use' of the covered 'auto.' \" Wesco does not dispute that the truck at issue was a covered auto, nor that property damage resulted, but does dispute both the presence of an \"accident\" as defined by the policy, and that the accident resulted from \"use\" or \"maintenance\" of the vehicle. Defendant Wesco's Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment and in Support of Its Cross Motion (\"Opp.\"), Dkt. No. 62, at 15-25. Based upon these arguments, Wesco claims it correctly disclaimed coverage and is not required to reimburse Harleysville now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Alternatively, if the Court were to reject Wesco's interpretation of \"accident\" and \"ownership, maintenance, or use,\" Wesco raises a third argument for why the policy did not provide coverage for the incident. Wesco contends that the underlying actions fell within the so-called \"care, custody or control\" exclusion in the policy. Under this exclusion, the policy does not apply to damage to \"property owned or transported by the 'insured' or in the 'insured's' care, custody or control.\" Opp. at 24 (quoting Kardisch Decl., Exhibit AA, at II.B.6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Fourth and finally, were the Court to conclude that, on the basis of uncontroverted facts, Wesco owed M &amp; T a duty to indemnify as a matter of law, Wesco contends that it is still excused from covering M &amp; T because of the prejudice it suffered from allegedly receiving late notice of the Underlying Actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Court addresses these four arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Underlying Incident Qualifies as an \"Accident\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Wesco's first argument with respect to the definition of \"accident\" is unpersuasive. As stated above, M &amp; T's policy with Wesco only provides coverage for \"property damage\" if it is \"caused by an 'accident.' \" Wesco's policy with M &amp; T defines \"accident\" to \"\n   <em>\n    include\n   </em>\n   continuous or repeated exposure to the same conditions resulting in 'bodily injury' or 'property damage.' \" Kardisch Decl., Ex. AA, at V.A (emphasis added). Wesco argues that because the allegations in the Underlying Actions did not include \"a continuous or repeated exposure,\" that the definition of accident is not met. Opp. at 17. However, a provision that broadens the term \"accident\" to also\n   <em>\n    include\n   </em>\n   a situation of repeated exposure does not limit the definition to\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   covering those types of accidents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Relying on a New York Court of Appeals decision in\n   <em>\n    Michaels v. City of Buffalo,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4437138\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/754/#p758\">\n    85 N.Y.2d 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 758,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4437138\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/754/#p758\">\n    628 N.Y.S.2d 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4437138\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/754/#p758\">\n    651 N.E.2d 1272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995), Wesco next argues that \"accident\" refers to \"an event involving some trauma, violence, or casualty, or application of external force in which the auto is involved.\" Opp. at 17. According to Wesco, the Underlying Actions did not allege an incident fitting that definition. But the Court of Appeals did not create such a rigid definition; instead, it held that the word \"accident\" must be defined by relation to the \"reasonable expectation and purpose of the ordinary business person when making an ordinary business contract\" and \"is not given a narrow, technical definition by the law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4437138\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/754/#p758\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4437138\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/754/#p758\">\n    at 757\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4437138\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/754/#p758\">\n    628 N.Y.S.2d 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4437138\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/85/754/#p758\">\n    651 N.E.2d 1272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation marks and citation omitted);\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State Farm Mut.

The unloading of the contaminated milk from the truck to the Great Lakes plant arises from the \"inherent nature\" of the vehicle. No reasonable juror could find otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Turning to the second prong of the definition of \"use\"-whether negligence was the cause of the injury-both parties misstate the question. Harleysville contends that there \"is no\n   <em>\n    bona fide\n   </em>\n   factual dispute regarding whether the contamination incident resulted from the maintenance and/or use (including loading/unloading) of M &amp; T's milk trailer,\" citing to reports and testimony produced in discovery in the underlying action. Harleysville's Memorandum of Law in Further Support of Its Motion for Summary Judgment (\"Reply\"), Dkt. No. 74, at 6-7. But even assuming the contamination in the trailer caused the damage, that does not establish\n   <em>\n    negligence.\n   </em>\n   Wesco counters that \"the allegedly contaminated milk, and neither the trailer nor its negligent use, was purportedly responsible for Great Lakes' (and by extension Agri-Mark's) harm.\" Opp. at 20. But the key here is how the contaminated milk\n   <em>\n    came to be\n   </em>\n   contaminated, and whether that is the result of negligence by M &amp; T related to their trailer. Harleysville offers an incisive analogy to a drug store which delivers a spoiled drug. Reply at 8, n.3. If the drug was spoiled and all the vehicle did was deliver it to the customer, the store's auto policy might not provide coverage for the customer's resulting illness. However, if the drug spoiled\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   the refrigeration system in the vehicle failed, the drug store would be covered for the resulting illness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court finds no genuine material dispute exists regarding whether\n   <em>\n    negligence\n   </em>\n   in the use of the milk trailer caused the injuries to Great Lakes. In the Underlying Actions, M &amp; T attempted to raise issues about the behavior of Great Lakes-in failing to check for a wash tag before delivery, or in failing to shut down certain lines to mitigate contamination-and about the behavior of Blue Grass and Queensboro-for creating the metal contaminants and not cleaning them, respectively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kardisch Decl., Ex. N, \u00b6\u00b6 53-57, 71. However, the attorney Harleysville hired to defend M &amp; T in the Underlying Actions argued for comparative negligence, meaning that M &amp; T was negligent, even if other actors potentially were as well. Kardisch Decl., Ex. O. This concession of negligence was supported by M &amp; T's own expert, Douglas C. Adams, President of Prime Consulting Group, Inc. Mr. Adams was retained to evaluate the damages claim, and while his report concluded that Great Lakes was responsible for some\n   <em>\n    portion\n   </em>\n   of the damages, in part because it \"accepted the M &amp; T load without a 'wash tag,' \"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Kardisch Decl., Ex. P, at 6-8, implicit in Mr. Adams' report is that while Great Lakes may have failed to contain the damage, M &amp; T was still negligent in delivering the contaminants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Even now, after discovery in this action, Wesco does not argue that M &amp; T was not negligent at all. Wesco argues that Blue Grass caused the existence of the metal shavings and that Queensboro failed to sufficiently clean the trailer,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 12, however, this does not account for the responsibility M &amp; T had in ensuring that it did not contaminate its cargo. At no point does Wesco offer any support for its implied contention that M &amp; T's actions in bringing the trailer to Queensboro for washing (if that happened) were sufficient to satisfy its duty of reasonable care and absolve it of liability under a negligence theory. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Judge Suddaby-while not making a determination as to negligence-commented that \"M &amp; T's argument that it is free from liability appear tenuous, particularly in light of the evidence marshaled by\n   Agri-Mark.\"\n   <em>\n    Great Lakes Cheese,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%205717337\">\n    2016 WL 5717337\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *13, n.16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Wesco attempts to defeat summary judgment by raising factual issues from the Underlying Actions here, but based on the undisputed evidence, M &amp; T was at least partially negligent, and any reasonable juror would find that negligence in the use of the trailer was at least partially the cause of the injury. Wesco asserts that \"[s]ince there was never a determination in the underlying action as to how the milk became 'contaminated', much less whether M &amp; T's acts or omissions in the use of the trailer caused or contributed to said condition, there are at the very least questions of fact which preclude summary judgment on the issue of coverage herein.\" Opp. at 20-21. Yet the mere fact that a final determination implicating\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   was never made in the Underlying Actions is not sufficient to find a\n   <em>\n    genuine\n   </em>\n   issue of material fact here. While in the context of declaratory judgment actions, courts generally find it premature to establish a duty to indemnify if the underlying action is still pending, there is no\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule.\n   <em>\n    Atl.

For the purposes of determining when the definition of \"use\" of the vehicle as set forth in Wesco's policy encompasses this type of incident, no reasonable jury would find M &amp; T entirely free of negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The \"Care, Custody, and Control\" Exclusion Does Not Apply\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Wesco's third argument as to why its policy with M &amp; T does not cover this incident fails as well. Section II.B.6 of Wesco's policy with M &amp; T excludes coverage for \"property damage\" to \"property owned or transported by the 'insured' or in the 'insured's' care, custody or control.\" Kardish Decl., Ex. AA. The parties agree that the milk M &amp; T was transporting was within its care, custody, or control, but this is irrelevant, given that Great Lakes never paid for this milk and, thus, it was not part of the damages Great Lakes sought.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 19-20; Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 10. However, Wesco argues that the exclusion goes further, covering the \"alleged damage to the plant\" because it is \"a natural consequence and flows directly from the cargo within M &amp; T's 'care, custody and control.' \" Opp. at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   A plain text reading of the contractual provision does not support Wesco's attempt to broaden the exclusion. Great Lakes' plant, milk, and cheese were never in the \"care, custody or control\" of M &amp; T, and no evidence exists in this record that suggests that a party entering into a commercial business auto policy for a milk trailer would expect the exclusion to apply beyond the cargo to all \"natural consequences\" of the cargo's delivery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Moreover, Wesco's argument lacks support in the law. When the Second Circuit was faced with interpreting the care, custody or control exclusion, albeit in the context of a landlord-tenant policy, the\n   court found the exclusion applies \"[w]here the insured has sufficient possessory dominion over the property damaged.\"\n   <em>\n    Monari v. Surfside Boat Club Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"257548\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/469/9/#p12\">\n    469 F.2d 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 12 (2d Cir. 1972). M &amp; T has absolutely no possessory dominion over the cheese, other milk, or plant equipment that form the core of Great Lakes' alleged damages. Wesco offers no case law supporting its extension of the exclusion to what \"flows directly\" from the property in its care, custody or control, nor can the Court find any basis in the law or in the plain text of the exclusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the uncontroverted evidence, no reasonable jury could conclude that the exclusion applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Wesco Is Not Excused from Its Duty by Reason of Untimely Notice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Having determined that, on the basis of the undisputed evidence, Wesco's policy\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   cover M &amp; T for the incident as a matter of law, the Court turns to Wesco's final argument for why it should be relieved of its duty to indemnify M &amp; T. Wesco contends that even if it had a duty to M &amp; T under the terms of its policy, because it did not receive timely notice of the underlying litigation it was impaired from conducting a thorough investigation and providing a suitable defense, a prejudice that vitiates the contract. Opp. at 26-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Section 3420(c) of New York's Insurance Law allows an insurer to disclaim coverage if it was prejudiced as a result of a failure to provide timely notice.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Ins.%20Law%20%C2%A7%203420\">\n    N.Y. Ins. Law \u00a7 3420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(A). New York law previously allowed insurers to deny coverage on the basis of late notice without regard for whether the late notice caused any prejudice. In 2008, however, the law was amended, and under sections 3420(a)(5) and (c)(2)(C), the insurer carries the burden of proving both that there was a failure of timely notice\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that this failure \"materially impair[ed] the ability of the insurer to investigate or defend the claim.\" Thus, in order to appropriately deny coverage on this basis, Wesco must show it was prejudiced by the purported late notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   According to Wesco, it first learned of the Underlying Actions in January 2016, when M &amp; T's personal counsel, Peter Knych, forwarded the complaints.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kardisch Decl., Ex. Q. Relying on contemporaneous notes from Harleysville's claim file, Plaintiff disputes this timeframe, asserting instead that Harleysville sent Agri-Mark's third party complaint to Wesco on April 14, 2014. Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 16 (citing Beer Decl., Ex. P); Reply Declaration of Jeffrey A. Beer Jr., Esq. (\"Beer Reply Decl.\"), Dkt. No. 72, Ex. B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Nonetheless, assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that Wesco is correct about the timing of the notice, it would still not be allowed to deny coverage, because no reasonable jury could conclude that Wesco carried its burden that the delayed notice \"materially impair[ed]\" its ability to \"investigate or defend the claim.\" Wesco complains that by the time it was notified, discovery had been completed and monetary demands and offers were exchanged. Opp. at 32. Wesco further charges that it had to wait another 10 months to receive a complete copy of the file in the underlying matter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Ins.%20Law%20%C2%A7%203420\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In sum, Wesco argues that it was not provided materials in sufficient time \"to evaluate the strengths/weaknesses of Great Lakes' and Agri-Mark's claims, the value of each element of alleged property damage, or the relative benefits of settling\n   versus trying the matter to verdict.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Ins.%20Law%20%C2%A7%203420\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Ins.%20Law%20%C2%A7%203420\">\n    at 32-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   However, on the basis of the full record of undisputed evidence before the Court, including Wesco's actions upon receiving notice of the lawsuits, Defendant's claim under \u00a7 3420(c) fails as a matter of law.

Grace &amp; Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11193203\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/218/204/#p210\">\n    218 F.3d 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 210 (2d Cir. 2000). Implicit in that declaration of equitable principle are two requirements. First, it must be determined that Harleysville had no duty to indemnify M &amp; T\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   itself, because if Harleysville's policy with M &amp; T\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   covers an incident of this nature, Harleysville would be obligated to pay its fair share. Second, before the Court requires Wesco to reimburse Harleysville the full amount, the settlement amount must be deemed \"reasonable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Harleysville Had No Duty to Indemnify As a Matter of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   For essentially the same reasons that Wesco's policy\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   cover M &amp; T for the incident, there can be no material dispute that Harleysville's general liability policy with M &amp; T does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   provide coverage. The Harleysville policy contains an automobile exclusion stating that the insurance does not apply to \" 'property damage' arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use\" of any auto owned or operated by its insured. Beer Decl., Ex. A. The exclusion specifically states that \"use\" includes \"loading and unloading\" as well.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.2.g. As a result, and given the above analysis, no reasonable juror could find that Harleysville's policy covers M &amp; T for the incident.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Essex Ins. Co. v.

As M &amp; T personally contributed $12,500 to the settlement, an amount that was likely to have been paid even if Wesco had defended M &amp; T, and an amount that would be paid in excess of Wesco's coverage limitation of $1,000,000, Harleysville is not entitled to reimbursement of the $12,500.

Wesco disputes this statement, noting that Plaintiff \"did not supply certified copies of the bills submitted by [the law firm] for its defense of M &amp; T in the underlying action, nor did it produce evidence of its actual payment of said bills.\" Defs. 56.1 \u00b6 29.
