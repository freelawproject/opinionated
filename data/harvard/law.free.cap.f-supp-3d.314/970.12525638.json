This issue arose in the context of opening statements, where Plaintiff's counsel mentioned that this case (the civil case)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   would be the first time Plaintiff had an opportunity to tell his story to a jury of his peers. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr. [Dkt. # 329-3) at 8:9-12.) Defense counsel, in turn, stated the following during his opening statement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   Mr. Patrick's attorney mentioned in her opening statement that Mr. Patrick has been waiting a long time to tell his story to the jury. She is absolutely right about that. But it wasn't the first time he had a chance. Mr. Patrick had the chance to tell the jury that was going to decide whether he spent the rest of his life in prison or get the death penalty his story. He knew his life was on the line. It was the highest of stakes in 1995. He had his own attorney. He had plenty of time to prepare his defense. Trial rolls around. The judge tells him: You have an absolute right to tell your story, Mr. Patrick. It's your constitutional right. He says nothing. He says nothing about his alibi. He says nothing about what he was doing that day. He says nothing about his confession being coerced. He says nothing about anyone else's confession being coerced.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57:5-57:20.) Neither party objected to the other's opening statement. The Court raised the issue\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , and the parties were instructed to brief the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Neither party, however, has found a case squarely on point. What they have found instead are two lines of competing principles pertaining to Fifth Amendment silence. On one hand, there is the line of cases beginning with\n   <em>\n    Griffin v. California\n   </em>\n   , which held that a criminal defendant's Fifth Amendment rights are violated if the prosecutor draws an adverse inference of guilt from that silence.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1524757\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/380/609/#p615\">\n    380 U.S. 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 615,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1524757\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/380/609/#p615\">\n    85 S.Ct. 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1524757\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/380/609/#p615\">\n    14 L.Ed.2d 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1965) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

At the second trial, the same government witness testified about Raffel's inculpatory statement, but Raffel changed course: he took the stand and refuted the government's witness.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1276208\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/271/494/#p497\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The government then revealed through cross-examination that Raffel refused to testify at his first trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1276208\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/271/494/#p497\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Over defense counsel's objection, the Court found the cross-examination to be proper, explaining that \"[the] immunity from giving testimony is one which the defendant may waive by offering himself as a witness....

Applying, in effect, the balancing test Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, and mindful of the \"grave constitutional overtones,\" the Court ruled that, in the circumstances of the case, the cross-examination was prejudicial error.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6161067\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/353/391/#p424\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6161067\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/353/391/#p424\">\n    at 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6161067\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/353/391/#p424\">\n    77 S.Ct. 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The court, pursuant to its supervisory powers, upheld the reversal of a conviction after a trial in which the defendant had been asked by the prosecutor why he had not given his alibi during police interrogation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9429\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/171/#p174\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Again the Court used a balancing test and found that the circumstances closely paralleled those in\n   <em>\n    Grunewald\n   </em>\n   , and further noted that the \"assumption of inconsistency underlying [\n   <em>\n    Raffel\n   </em>\n   ] is absent here.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9429\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/171/#p174\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9429\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/171/#p174\">\n    at 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9429\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/171/#p174\">\n    95 S.Ct. 2133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Raffel\n   </em>\n   was thus relegated to a footnote, noting that since\n   <em>\n    Hale\n   </em>\n   did not reach any constitutional claims, it was unnecessary to decide whether\n   <em>\n    Raffel\n   </em>\n   had survived subsequent decisions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9429\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/171/#p174\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9429\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/171/#p174\">\n    at 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9429\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/171/#p174\">\n    95 S.Ct. 2133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   n.4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Nonetheless,\n   <em>\n    Raffel\n   </em>\n   was resuscitated to a degree in\n   <em>\n    Jenkins v.

It thus appears that the Supreme Court is sending mixed signals about the circumstances in which a criminal defendant's prior silence can be used against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   None of this, of course, settles the precise issue before the Court. But these cases do highlight some relevant principles: (1) when a defendant exercises his right not to testify absolutely, the government cannot comment upon his silence; (2) instances where silence can be used against a defendant are justified only if (a) inconsistency can be inferred from prior silence and subsequent testimony and (b) there is an element of unfairness (i.e., the defendant should not be permitted to use the Fifth Amendment as both a sword and a shield); and (3) the analysis should be fact specific and carefully balance the protections of the Fifth Amendment against the need for a full and fair development of the facts through cross-examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Application to this Case\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The above principles suggest that Plaintiff should not be penalized for invoking his Fifth Amendment rights during his criminal trial. He simply chose not to testify. His silence, moreover, as understood within the unique facts of this case, does not suggest that his present decision to testify is inconsistent or less credible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grunewald\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6161067\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/353/391/#p424\">\n    353 U.S. at 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6161067\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/353/391/#p424\">\n    77 S.Ct. 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Black J., concurring) (\"The value of constitutional\n   privileges is largely destroyed if persons can be penalized for relying on them.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   That said, this is still a civil case, and although Plaintiff has not refused to take the stand (an act that would permit an adverse inference), the question remains whether his counsel put his prior silence at issue during opening argument by stating that Plaintiff has been waiting since the day of his arrest to tell his story to a jury. This statement invited a response. And had defense counsel simply rebutted this proposition by merely noting that Plaintiff had a prior opportunity to testify, there would be little cause for concern. But Defense Counsel's comments went further than that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Mr. Patrick had the chance to tell the jury that was going to decide whether he spent the rest of his life in prison or get the death penalty his story. He knew his life was on the line. It was the highest of stakes in 1995. He had his own attorney. He had plenty of time to prepare his defense. Trial rolls around. The judge tells him: You have an absolute right to tell your story, Mr. Patrick. It's your constitutional right. He says nothing. He says nothing about his alibi. He says nothing about what he was doing that day. He says nothing about his confession being coerced. He says nothing about anyone else's confession being coerced.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiff's opening comment verged on the impermissible use of the Fifth Amendment right as both a sword and a shield, but it is unclear to the Court that this result was intentional; whereas defense counsel's response was extreme and had the potential to turn Plaintiff's exercise of the Fifth Amendment's protections into an offensive weapon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   For this reason, if Plaintiff makes no further reference to his previous inability to tell his story, Defendants will be barred from any further comment or any evidence referring to Plaintiff's assertion of his right to remain silent in his criminal trial. On the other hand, if Plaintiff makes any other comment about this trial being his first opportunity to tell his story, Defendants will be permitted to rebut the same with evidence and argument that Plaintiff's failure to testify in his criminal trial is a proper factor that may be used to weigh his credibility in the case at bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the defendants are ordered to refrain from discussing Plaintiff's Fifth Amendment silence at his criminal trial, unless the door is once again opened by Plaintiff's counsel either through elicited testimony or argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Plaintiff admits as much. And the only case from Defendants that comes close to addressing the issue, attached as a one-page transcript to Defendants' brief, is\n    <em>\n     Fields v Chicago\n    </em>\n    , 10-cv-1168 (N.D. Ill.). There, the judge allowed defense counsel to comment on the plaintiff's prior Fifth Amendment silence. But the Court in\n    <em>\n     Fields\n    </em>\n    supplied no analysis supporting the ruling (i.e., whether it was constitutional or evidentiary), and (2) the judge merely permitted counsel to note that the plaintiff previously chose not to testify. In the case at bar Defense counsel said much more.\n    <em>\n     Fields\n    </em>\n    is therefore of limited value to the present issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
