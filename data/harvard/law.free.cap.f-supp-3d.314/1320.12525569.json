Plaintiffs, 3637 Corp., Inc. and Lucky's Arcade, Inc., filed a Response [ECF No. 21], to which Defendants filed a Reply [ECF No. 27]. The Court has carefully considered the parties' written submissions, the record, and applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Lucky's Arcade is the owner of real property located on Northwest 36th Street and Northwest 27th Avenue in Miami, Florida. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint [ECF No. 1] \u00b6\u00b6 19, 24-25). 3637 Corp. is the tenant for the premises. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17). This case arises out of a decision by the City of Miami and Cejas, its zoning administrator, not to issue a Certificate of Use to 3637 Corp. that would permit 3637 Corp. to operate a supper club at which patrons could purchase alcoholic beverages and enjoy sexually-oriented dance performances. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Compl.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 6, 2009, 3637 Corp. applied to the City of Miami for zoning approval to convert a portion of the existing building-which for \"years\" had been used as an adult book and video store (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26)-into a \"bar and supper club\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30). Although operation of a bar and supper club \"was a permitted use as of right\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31) in the zoning district applicable to the property (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-29, 57), 3637 Corp. nevertheless submitted an Application (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. A, Application for a Special Exception [ECF No. 1-3] 2-6\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) for approval of a Special Exception for \"supper club use with 4COP/quota alcoholic beverage license with beer, wine, and liquor\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   3 (capitalization omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 8, 2009, the City of Miami Zoning Board adopted Resolution No. ZB-R-09-0035 (\"2009 Approval\") (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. B, Resolution No. ZB-R-09-0035 [ECF No. 1-3] 8-9), granting the requested Special\n   Exception and allowing for a \"bar/supper club establishment\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 32). The 2009 Approval was subject to three conditions: (1) approval of the Special Exception would \"run with this operator only\" and \"any changes to a different operator\" would \"require a separate special exception\"; (2) signage details for the project were to be submitted to the Planning Department for review and approval by separate permit; and (3) the establishment was to \"have security and operate with[in the] permitted use.\" (2009 Approval 8 (alteration added; capitalization omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 33) ). In addition, the 2009 Approval provided the Special Exception had a \"time limitation of twelve months in which a building permit must be obtained.\" (2009 Approval 8 (capitalization omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In early 2010, 3637 Corp. applied for a modification to the Special Exception to extend the time in which 3637 Corp. was required to apply for a building permit. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 35). On May 10, 2010, the City of Miami Zoning Board adopted a second resolution (\"2010 Approval\") (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. C, Resolution No. ZB-R-10-024 [ECF No. 1-3] 11-12), granting an \"extension of time\" of unspecified length for the Special Exception granted in the 2009 Approval to allow \"a bar/supper club establishment\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   11 (capitalization omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 36).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 28, 2010, the Florida Legislature adopted Senate Bill 1752 (\"SB 1752\") (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex. D, Committee Substitute for Senate Bill No. 1752 [ECF No. 1-3] 14-107), which stated development orders (including special exceptions and building permits) issued by local governments which had an expiration date of between September 1, 2008 and January 1, 2012 were extended and renewed for a period of two years after their original date of expiration (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 38). On December 23, 2011, 3637 Corp. sent a Letter (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. E, Request for Extension [ECF No. 1-3] 109) requesting the deadline for acquiring a building permit be extended. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 39 (explaining the Request for Extension notified the City of 3637 Corp.'s intent \"to avail itself of the two year statutory extension of development approval time frames\") ). The City subsequently granted a two-year extension pursuant to SB 1752 in a document signed on October 30, 2013 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. F, Notification Form [ECF No. 1-3] 111), which listed the prior \"Permit Expiration Date\" as \"May 28, 2011\"; the \"New Exp[iration] Date\" as \"May 28, 2013\"; and the \"Reason[s] for Extension\" as \"[r]e-platting of property; extensive County and City permitting process; [and] [e]quitable [e]stoppel\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (alterations added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 39).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Complaint alleges a timeline of events that does not match up with its exhibits. Sometime after the City granted the two-year extension under SB 1752, \"a timely request\" for a building permit for construction of the bar and supper club was submitted to the City's building department. (Compl. \u00b6 40 (citing\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. G, Building Department Permit Application [ECF No. 1-3] 113) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiffs allege the \"request for a building permit was timely\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41), \"[t]he City processed the request for building permit in 2013\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42 (alteration added) ), and \"[b]y April 2013, the City Building department completed its review of the building permit application for the bar and supperclub and was prepared to issue that permit\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43 (alteration added) ). However, the Building Department Permit Application cited in the Complaint (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40), contains a stamp indicating it was not received until December 2, 2015 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Building Department Permit Application 113). Plaintiffs allege \"the building department claimed to have discovered that the underlying Special Exception approval had\n   expired\" (Compl. \u00b6 44 (citing\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. H, Letter from Cejas to Fulford [ECF No. 1-3] 115-17) ), but after \"counsel for the project advised the City that a notice of extension of time under SB 1752 had been provided to the City, and that therefore the Special Exception had not expired\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45 (citing\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. I, Letter from Krischer to the City [ECF No. 1-3] 119-21) ), \"[t]he City subsequently determined that 3637 Corp., Inc.'s invocation of SB 1752 had tolled the time in which the building permit had to have been sought[,] deemed the building permit application to be timely\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46 (alterations added), and ultimately issued a Master Building Permit \"[o]n November 6, 2013\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47 (alteration added) (citing\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. J, Master Building Permit [ECF No. 1-3] 123-25) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Letter Plaintiffs cite to in support of their assertion the building department claimed the Special Exception had expired relates to the City's denial of a Certificate of Use, not a building permit (\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Letter from Cejas to Fulford); and the Letter Plaintiffs cite for the proposition \"counsel for the project advised the City that a notice of extension of time under SB 1752 had been provided to the City, and that therefore the Special Exception had not expired\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 45 (citing Letter from Krischer to the City) ), is dated March 31, 2017 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Letter from Krischer to the City 119), years after the City issued the Master Building Permit on November 6, 2013 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Master Building Permit 123;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 46).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In any case, the Master Building Permit issued November 6, 2013 specifically identified the intended use as a \"supperclub.\" (Master Building Permit 123;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 48). Nine Supplemental Building Permits were subsequently issued for specific components of the construction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 49 (citing\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Exs. K-1 through K-9, Supplemental Building Permits [ECF No. 1-3] 127-57) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Sometime later, 3637 Corp. began construction of the bar and supper club, starting with complete demolition of the interior of the existing adult bookstore space. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50). Over the ensuing 32 months, 3637 Corp. made physical improvements to the interior of the club, and received and passed inspections from the City for the completed work. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51 (citing Supplemental Building Permits) ). In particular, 3637 Corp. installed interior walls; air conditioning; performance stages; lighting systems; sound systems; physical bar and counter tops; carpeting; tile; light displays; mirrors; wall fixtures; furniture; a DJ booth and studio; refrigerators; bar ware and glass ware; and kitchen equipment, as well as \"other material associated with bar and supper club use.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In 2015, the Building Permit was further amended to show the build out of the entire authorized space. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52 (citing Supplemental Building Permits) ). The Master Building Permit states, \"all inspections are finalized\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Master Building Permit) ), and, along with four of the Supplemental Building Permits, indicates \"final zoning\"; \"status completed\"; \"result: OK\"; and \"remark: approved\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54 (internal quotation marks and footnote call number omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On June 20, 2016, the City issued a Building Certificate for the premises. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56 (citing\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. M., Building Certificate [ECF No. 1-3] 172-74) ). The Building Certificate, which lists the \"Permit Holder\" as \"Caibai Constuction LLC\" and the \"Owner\" as Lucky's Arcade, states the zoning use for the premises is a \"supperclub.\" (Building Certificate 172 (capitalization omitted) ). The Building Certificate goes on to state \"[t]his certificate is issued to the above-named permit holder for the building and premises at the above described location, and certifies that the\n   work has been completed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alteration added) ). While Plaintiffs allege \"[t]he 'named permit holder' is Lucky's Arcade\" (Compl. \u00b6 59 (alteration added) ) and \"[t]he Building Certificate[ ] ... thus is ... issued to the ... property owner, Lucky's Arcade\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60 (alterations added) ), the Building Certificate plainly lists \"Caibai Constuction LLC\"-not Lucky's Arcade-as the \"Permit Holder\" (Building Certificate 172).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Plaintiffs explain the Building Certificate is one of two approvals that must be granted by the City prior to the occupancy of a new or remodeled building. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 61). The Building Certificate signifies approval of a building as being safe to occupy; and takes into account, among other things, that the building is structurally sound, fire prevention and protection requirements have been met, and plumbing and electrical have been constructed to code and are safe to use. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62). Prior to the occupancy of a new or remodeled building, the City also requires the building be granted a Certificate of Use, certifying the proposed use complies with the City's zoning requirements. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Seven days after the Building Certificate was issued, the \"principal\" of 3637 Corp., James Fulford, began to contact Cejas to schedule a meeting regarding obtaining the Certificate of Use. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64 (citing\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. N, Emails from Fulford to Cejas [ECF No. 1-3] 176-83) ). Approximately three weeks later, Fulford and Cejas met to discuss the issuance of a Certificate of Use. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65). The \"outcome\" of this meeting was that Cejas would undertake to \"research the status\" of the property and its eligibility for a Certificate of Use. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 66 (internal quotation marks omitted) ). Over the next nine months, despite constant, numerous, and repeated inquiries by Fulford, Cejas and the City failed to respond with the status of the Certificate of Use or take any other action related to the Certificate of Use. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 68).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Finally, in March 2017, Cejas issued a letter advising the City was denying 3637 Corp.'s request for a Certificate of Use. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 70 (citing Letter from Cejas to Fulford) ). The letter identified four grounds for not issuing the Certificate of Use. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Letter from Cejas to Fulford). First, the 2009 Approval and the 2010 Approval granting \"Supper Club\" use should not have been initially granted because pursuant to Chapter 4, Section 4-7 of the City's Alcohol Ordinance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   no certificate of use and/or occupancy shall be issued to any applicant for consumption or sale of liquor on the premises or off the premises and/or beer and wine for consumption on the premises ... if the place of business of the applicant is situated less than 1,500 feet from a place of business with a prior alcoholic beverage license.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   115 (alteration added; emphasis omitted) ). According to Cejas's Letter, \"[a]t the time [the] application was processed[,] an establishment[ ] known as El Palacio Sport Caf\u00e9, Inc.... [was] located within ... 1,500 feet ... [and] was operating with an Active Certificate of Use for Supper Club with a 4COP liquor license.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alterations added) ). As El Palacio's supper club use \"remain[ed] active\" as of March 2017, Cejas determined 3637 Corp.'s application \"would not have met the distance requirements set forth in Section 4-7 of the Alcohol Ordinance in 2009, 2010 or today if a Liquor Survey was provided.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   115-16 (alteration added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Second, according to Cejas, the 2009 Approval was subject to the condition the property would be re-platted prior to obtaining any Building Permit. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   116). Building Permit approval had been \"nullif[ied]\" because re-platting of the land never took place. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alteration added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Third, the 2009 Approval was granted on the condition the Special Exception would \"run with this operator only\" and \"any changes to a different operator [would] require a separate Special Exception.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alteration added; internal quotation marks omitted) ). At the time the 2009 Approval was granted, 3637 Corp. had an \"equal principal partnership between ... operator[ ]s ... known as Jerrett Hodas and Martin Hodas.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alterations added) ). Since that time, however, 3637 Corp. \"was sold to 100% principal operator known as James Fulford.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to Cejas, \"[t]he transference of a [b]usiness corporation in excess of 50% to a new party constitute[d] a change in operator\" and \"thus nullif[ied]\" the Special Exception. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alterations added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Last, the Special Exception had expired. Under section 1606.2 of Zoning Ordinance 11000, \"[n]o original limitation shall be for more than one ... year nor less than [60] days[,] [n]o extension shall be [granted] for more than one ... year, and not more than one ... extension may be granted for any Special Exception.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alterations added; internal quotation marks omitted) ). Cejas states in his Letter that pursuant to this rule, the Building Permits \"were issued in error[,] as the Exception had expired, and the establishment had not reached the stage of acquiring a Certificate of Use within that time frame.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (alteration added) ). As the Building Permits were issued in error, they conveyed no rights. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On the basis of these four reasons, Cejas stated there was good cause to deny the Certificate of Use. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   116-17). Cejas recommended 3637 Corp. re-apply for supper club use \"when distancing requirements pursuant to Chapter 4 are attainable,\" or apply for a \"Restaurant Certificate of Use with the ability to place a 4COP SFS license so long as the property meets the minimum requirements of a 'bonafide' restaurant establishment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   117).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   3637 Corp. timely filed an administrative appeal of Cejas's Letter to the City's Planning and Zoning Board (\"PZAB\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 72 (citing Letter from Krischer to City) ). 3637 Corp. also submitted to the City a request for public records pursuant to Chapter 119, Florida Statutes. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73 (citing\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. Q, Email from Fernandez to Harrington [ECF No. 1-3] 191-93) ). The request, made April 11, 2017, asked the City to turn over any public records containing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   1. Any information collected by the City with regard to the beneficial ownership in a corporation, company, limited partnership or such other legal entity designated as the operator of a Supper Club on any Special Exception application processed pursuant to the requirements of Ordinance 11000 or any Exception application processed pursuant to the requirements of Miami 21 requesting the approval of such a use between January 1, 2002, and April 1, 2017; [and]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   2. Any information collected by the City with regard to the approval of a change in the beneficial ownership of a corporation, company, limited partnership or such other legal entity previously authorized by the City to operate a Supper Club use between January 1, 2002, and April 1, 2017.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   (Email from Fernandez to Harrington 192 (alteration added) ). In response to this request, the City produced no documentation that would have supported or tended to support its position with respect to the application for Certificate of Use. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 74).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On June 7, 2017, the PZAB denied the appeal by a vote of four to three. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76 (citing\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. R., PZAB Resolution [ECF No. 1-3] 195-96) ). The PZAB decision \"was based on evidence indicating\n   there was a change in operator from the disclosures of ownership furnished when the original application of 3637 Corp.... was originally submitted for a Special Exception hearing.\" (PZAB Resolution 195 (alteration added) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   3637 Corp. appealed the PZAB decision to the Miami City Commission (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 77), which, on July 27, 2017, affirmed the PZAB decision by a unanimous vote (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78 (citing\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. S, Miami City Commission Resolution [ECF No. 1-3] 198-200) ). The City's Resolution explained 3637 Corp. had been afforded an opportunity to be heard by the PZAB at a public hearing before the PZAB on June 7, 2017, where 3637 Corp. was represented by counsel, testimony by professional staff was given, and comments of the public were considered. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Miami City Commission Resolution 198).

Plaintiffs also direct the Court's attention to page 14 of the Complaint, which alleges \"Defendants individually, and in concert, inflicted damage on Plaintiffs\" (Compl. \u00b6 80); and the prayers for relief contained at the end of each Count, which request the Court award Plaintiffs \"all actual, consequential, and special damages resulting from of [sic] the actions of the Defendants\" (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   17;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Resp. 8).

The Complaint makes no allegations Lucky's Arcade has any interest in operating a supper club on the property, or even that the terms of 3637 Corp.'s lease give Lucky's Arcade a pecuniary interest in 3637 Corp.'s desired business operations on the premises. (\n   <em>\n    See generally id.\n   </em>\n   ). While Plaintiffs articulate how 3637 Corp. was harmed by Defendants' denial of its opportunity to operate a supper club offering sexually oriented dance, they do not state how this decision adversely affected Lucky's Arcade as 3637 Corp.'s landlord.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   And Plaintiffs' allegation Lucky's Arcade was the named permit holder on the Building Certificate (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56-60), does not persuade the Court otherwise. First, the Court notes the Building Certificate plainly lists \"Caibai Constuction LLC\" as the \"Permit Holder,\" and states only that Lucky's Arcade is the \"Owner.\" (Building Certificate 172). Second, even if Lucky's Arcade were the named permit holder on the Building Certificate, Plaintiffs do not articulate what Lucky's Arcade's status as the \"permittee of the Building Certificate\" (Resp. 8) has to do with the harm alleged in the Complaint. Unlike the Certificate of Use, the City did not deny Plaintiffs the Building Certificate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 56). Moreover, the Building Certificate is merely \"the approval of the building as being safe to occupy:\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that it is structurally sound, that fire prevention and protection requirements have been met, that plumbing and electrical have been constructed to code and are safe to use,\n   <em>\n    etc.\n   </em>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62). The Building Certificate is unrelated to the content of the proposed speech on the premises, and Plaintiffs do not articulate how any of the harms described in the Complaint could be traceable to the City granting the Building Certificate to Lucky's Arcade as the \"named permit holder.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59 (internal quotation marks omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Last, while Plaintiffs insist they do not provide in their Complaint \"legal conclusions or mere labels\" (Resp. 9), they do just that where they state, \"Defendants\n   individually, and in concert, inflicted damage on Plaintiffs\" (Compl. \u00b6 80); and by requesting \"all actual, consequential, and special damages resulting from of [sic] the actions of the Defendants\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   17).
