(collectively, the \"Plaintiffs\"), a software development and information technology services company. The Plaintiffs seek judicial review of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service's (\"USCIS\") decision to deny Sage IT's petition to extend Mr. Sitaram's H-1B status as a nonimmigrant worker in a specialty occupation. The USCIS found that Mr. Sitaram had exhausted his maximum of six years of H-1B eligibility and that his stay could not be extended through a statutory three-year extension. The USCIS reasoned that Mr. Sitaram was ineligible for the extension because his approved application for preference status (an \"I-140\"), one of two requirements for the extension, had been revoked when his previous employer withdrew their petition. In moving for summary judgment, the Plaintiffs assert that the agency's decision was arbitrary and capricious because the USCIS later promulgated a regulation that no longer required an I-140 be automatically revoked upon an employer's notice of withdrawal. Defendant L. Francis Cissna, Director of the USCIS,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. Upon consideration of the pleadings, relevant law, related legal memoranda in opposition and in support, and the entire record, I find that at the time the USCIS adjudicated Mr. Sitaram's petition, the applicable regulation was unambiguous and that the USCIS's denial was not arbitrary and capricious.

Under Section 104(c), the USCIS will grant a three-year extension to the six-year maximum on H-1B status if two conditions are met. First, the alien must be a beneficiary of a petition for a preference status. Second, the alien must be unable to obtain this preference status because of per-country limitations. These two conditions must be maintained throughout the adjudication of the petition. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20103.2\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.2</extracted-citation>(b)(1).

L. No. 106-313, \u00a7 104(c)(2). Form I-140 is used to apply for this priority status. <em>See</em> CAR-II at 230. When an employer files an I-140 on behalf of an employee, the employer is requesting preference status for the employee-beneficiary. <em>See <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201153\">id.</extracted-citation></em> ; AC21, Pub.

When the I-140 is approved, the beneficiary is certified as eligible for preference status and must wait until the agency reaches his priority date in the backlog of petitions. Because Mr. Sitaram's second I-140 was revoked during the adjudication of his petition, he became ineligible to receive priority status. <em>See</em> CAR-I at 3. As a result, he no longer met the first requirement of Section 104(c).

Reg. 82,398</extracted-citation>. The Plaintiffs maintain that the USCIS has clarified another provision in the same amendment to include applications filed before the effective date, and that retroactive application of the I-140 amendment comports with the overall purpose of AC21, which <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"209\" href=\"#p209\" id=\"p209\">*209</a>they characterize as \"perhaps the most liberal H-1B legislation ever enacted.\" Pls.' Mot. for Summ. J. 21; Pls.' Opp. to Def.'s Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. 9, 13, ECF No. 16. But that defies the clear intent from the text of the regulation, which provides a prospective date for application. Put simply, the amendment language does not compel retroactive application.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-34\">Last, the Plaintiffs contend that there is a \"well-established liberal-remedial maxim to the effect that any ambiguities in a remedial statute should be resolved in favor of persons for whose benefit the statute was enacted\" and that the USCIS \"routinely\" granted H-1B extensions in the past for similar issues. Pls.' Opp. to Def.'s Cross-Mot. for Summary J. 9, 13, ECF No. 16. But, as already explained, no ambiguities exist in the regulation and further, none of the Plaintiffs' case law nor examples cited support these sweeping statements. In <em>FDIC v. Meyer</em> , the Supreme Court discussed the general recognition that \"sue-and-be-sued waivers are to be liberally construed.\" <extracted-citation case-ids=\"230419\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/471/#p480\">510 U.S. 471</extracted-citation>, 480, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"230419\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/471/#p480\">114 S.Ct. 996</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"230419\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/510/471/#p480\">127 L.Ed.2d 308</extracted-citation> (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). In <em>King v. St. Vincent's Hospital</em> , the Supreme Court references in a footnote, as an alternative basis for its decision, the canon that \"provisions for benefits to members of the Armed Services are to be construed in the beneficiaries' favor.\" <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222957\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/215/\">502 U.S. 215</extracted-citation>, 220 n.9, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222957\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/215/\">112 S.Ct. 570</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222957\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/215/\">116 L.Ed.2d 578</extracted-citation> (1991). Both of those contexts-sovereign immunity and the Armed Forces-are vastly different than the one presented here. Moreover, the Plaintiffs offer scant details of only two examples of the \"routine\" granting of similar H-1B extensions, and it is not clear that, in the H-1B visa context, two examples constitute routine action. <em>See</em> Pls.' Opp. to Def.'s Cross-Mot. for Summary J. 9 n.2.</p><p id=\"p-35\">In a footnote, Sage IT concedes it made a \"strategic mistake\" in the timing and method of its petition filing. Pl.s' Mot. for Summ. J. 10 n.7. Here, the timing of Mr. Sitaram's job changes, his employers' visa filings, and the USCIS's evolving processing requirements conspired against him. This is unfortunate, but not unlawful. Because the text of the regulation is clear that it applies prospectively, and because Mr. Sitaram was no longer a beneficiary of a petition for a preference status at the time of the USCIS's decision, the USCIS did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in adjudicating his petition.</p><p id=\"p-36\">The Plaintiffs alternatively argue that the USCIS should have granted a one-year extension under Section 106(a). <em>See</em> Compl. 10; Pls.' Mot. for Summ. J. 12-15. Section 106 provides for one-year incremental extensions \"until such time as a final decision is made.\" <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201184\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1184</extracted-citation> note. The administrative record, however, only reflects consideration of a three-year extension. In the Plaintiffs' petition to the USCIS for an extension to Mr. Sitaram's H-1B status, the Plaintiffs requested only the \"3 year's [<em>sic</em> ] extension.\" CAR-I at <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"210\" href=\"#p210\" id=\"p210\">*210</a>24. The USCIS denied the petition because Mr. Sitaram was not eligible under Section 104(c); the agency did not consider eligibility for a one-year extension under Section 106(a). <em>See</em> CAR-I at 4. In reviewing an administrative decision under the APA, a trial court will not consider \"issues not raised before the agency.\" <em>Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety v. Fed. Motor Carrier Admin.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3447042,1554059\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/429/1136/\">429 F.3d 1136</extracted-citation>, 1149 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (discussing the administrative waiver doctrine). Because the Plaintiffs did not raise, and the agency did not adjudicate, a one-year extension, the Court will not address it here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-37\"><strong>IV.</strong></p><p id=\"p-38\">For the foregoing reasons, the Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment will be denied, and the Defendant's cross-motion for summary judgment will be granted. A separate order will issue.</p><p id=\"p-41\">Director Cissna is automatically substituted as the Defendant. <em>See</em> Fed. R. Civ. P. 25(d).</p><p id=\"p-42\">Section 106, originally enacted by AC21 in 2000, was amended in 2002 by DOJ-21.</p><p id=\"p-43\">The parties' Joint Appendix splits the Certified Administrative Record (\"CAR\") into two parts, CAR-I and CAR-II.

CAR-I at 3, 24.</p><p id=\"p-45\">The second requirement is met by Mr. Sitaram and uncontested by the Government. <em>See</em> <em>id.</em> at 15-16; Def.'s Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. 8. Mr. Sitaram's priority date was set at November 23, 2011. Pls.' Mot. for Summ. J. \u00b6 6. This date saved Mr. Sitaram's place in line as he awaited priority status. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20204.1\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.1</extracted-citation>(b). When Sage IT filed its H-1B petition on behalf of Mr. Sitaram in April 2016, the latest priority dates for which the government was granting EB3 or EB2 status to a person born in India were August 8, 2004 and November 8, 2008, respectively. Pls.' Mot. for Summ. J. 15. As these dates fall well before Mr. Sitaram's priority date, he was then ineligible for a preference status.</p><p id=\"p-46\">Even if the amended language applied retroactively, which it does not, Mr. Sitaram's second I-140 petition would still be automatically revoked. The amendment protects only against automatic revocation of approvals older than 180 days, and only 74 days passed between the approval of his petition and the withdrawal of support by TIBCO. <em>See</em> CAR-I at 30; CAR-II at 12. In addition, the new regulation would not reinstate Mr. Sitaram's first I-140, properly revoked five years ago. <em>See</em> Pls.' Mot. for Summ. J. 9 \u00b6 6. The Plaintiffs do not offer a temporal limit to applying the amendment retroactively, and it cannot be that the agency, which set a prospective date for the amendment's application, instead intended the regulation to apply to all previously revoked I-140's without limit. No provision in the revocation regulation purports to revive revoked I-140's. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20205.1\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 205.1</extracted-citation>(a)(3)(iii)(C).</p><p id=\"p-47\">Although the issue was not presented to the agency and is therefore not properly before this Court, it is unlikely that the Plaintiffs would have prevailed on this argument. The USCIS made a final decision on Mr. Sitaram's petition on March 27, 2017, rendering him ineligible for a one-year extension under Section 106(a). <em>See</em> CAR-I at 3.</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
