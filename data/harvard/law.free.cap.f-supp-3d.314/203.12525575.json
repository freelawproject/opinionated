MCFADDEN, United States District Judge\n      Sandeep Sitaram is a citizen of India and employee of Sage IT, Inc. (collectively, the \"Plaintiffs\"), a software development and information technology services company. The Plaintiffs seek judicial review of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service's (\"USCIS\") decision to deny Sage IT's petition to extend Mr. Sitaram's H-1B status as a nonimmigrant worker in a specialty occupation. The USCIS found that Mr. Sitaram had exhausted his maximum of six years of H-1B eligibility and that his stay could not be extended through a statutory three-year extension. The USCIS reasoned that Mr. Sitaram was ineligible for the extension because his approved application for preference status (an \"I-140\"), one of two requirements for the extension, had been revoked when his previous employer withdrew their petition. In moving for summary judgment, the Plaintiffs assert that the agency's decision was arbitrary and capricious because the USCIS later promulgated a regulation that no longer required an I-140 be automatically revoked upon an employer's notice of withdrawal. Defendant L. Francis Cissna, Director of the USCIS,\n       <footnotemark>\n        1\n       </footnotemark>\n       filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. Upon consideration of the pleadings, relevant law, related legal memoranda in opposition and in support, and the entire record, I find that at the time the USCIS adjudicated Mr. Sitaram's petition, the applicable regulation was unambiguous and that the USCIS's denial was not arbitrary and capricious. Accordingly, the Plaintiffs' motion will be denied and the Defendant's cross-motion for summary judgment will be granted.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-11\">\n       H-1B visas permit qualified workers in specialty occupations to work in the United States.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n        8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (a)(15)(H)(i)(B).

The Plaintiffs maintain that the USCIS has clarified another provision in the same amendment to include applications filed before the effective date, and that retroactive application of the I-140 amendment comports with the overall purpose of AC21, which\n      they characterize as \"perhaps the most liberal H-1B legislation ever enacted.\" Pls.'

Pls.' Opp. to Def.'s Cross-Mot. for Summary J. 9, 13, ECF No. 16. But, as already explained, no ambiguities exist in the regulation and further, none of the Plaintiffs' case law nor examples cited support these sweeping statements. In\n       <em>\n        FDIC v.

Both of those contexts-sovereign immunity and the Armed Forces-are vastly different than the one presented here. Moreover, the Plaintiffs offer scant details of only two examples of the \"routine\" granting of similar H-1B extensions, and it is not clear that, in the H-1B visa context, two examples constitute routine action.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       Pls.'

This is unfortunate, but not unlawful.
