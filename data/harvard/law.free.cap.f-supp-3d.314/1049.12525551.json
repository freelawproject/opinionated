For example, with respect to the Zaca Tributary, Dr. Lee states that it \"perform[s] a suite of functions that contribute to maintaining the integrity of ... the Santa Ynez Estuary\" including \"sediment mobilization, transport, and deposition, surface and groundwater storage and exchange, and surface water flow.\" (Dkt. 252-3, Lee Decl. at ECF 10139 &amp; \u00b6 9). In addition, Zaca Tributary performs physical and chemical functions such as \"cycling and detention of elements and compounds, detention of particulates, and export of organic carbon\" and performs plant community and faunal functions including \"maintenance of the characteristic structure and diversity of the plant community, production and export of organic carbon, maintenance of the structure and complexity of faunal habitats, and production of food for a range of faunal species.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). With respect to physical or hydrological functions, Dr. Lee notes that Zaca Tributary's main functions are: (1) sediment mobilization, transport and deposition; (2) surface and groundwater storage and exchange; and (3) surface water flow. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267214\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/1281/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267214\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/1281/\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Lee Report at ECF 10205). In support of his conclusions, Dr. Lee relies on histograms of pebble counts he and his team collected that show \"a consistent pattern of movement of sand, gravel, and cobble sized sediment ... via stormflows.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Zaca Tributary also performs a variety of chemical functions such as: (1) cycling elements and compounds; (2) detention of imported elements and compounds; (3) detention of particulates; and (4) organic carbon export. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267214\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/1281/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).

Dr. Lee concludes \"that taken alone, the contribution of ecosystem functions and services of Zaca Tributary to the downstream chemical, physical, and biological integrity and functioning of the Santa Ynez Estuary is significant. If discharges of pollutants such as heavy concentrations of nitrogen, herbicides and pesticides, and heavy metals associated with untreated storm water runoff were introduced into Zaca Tributary,\" pollutants could reach the Santa Ynez Estuary in a matter of hours or one to two days.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF 10208);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Orchard Hill Building Co. v.

According to Dr. Josselyn, none of the waters at issue have a significant nexus to a TNW.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF 10877; Dkt. 252-12, Expert Opinion Report by Michael Josselyn, Ph.D. (\"Josselyn Report\") at 10891).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Having carefully reviewed the expert reports submitted by the parties, the court is not persuaded that Dr. Josselyn's report creates any triable issues as to whether Palmer Road Creek,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cat Canyon Creek and Zaca Tributary significantly affect the physical, biological and chemical integrity of a downstream TNW.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court first turns to defendant's contention that Cat Canyon Creek, Palmer Road Creek and Zaca Tributary are nothing more than \"drainages\" which are dry most of the year and located many miles from the nearest TNW. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 252-1, Jt. Br. at 22-23; Dkt. 252-12, Josselyn Decl. at \u00b6\u00b6 4-12). Defendant asserts that none of the waters at issue are jurisdictional because they have insignificant flow and contribute less than one percent of the water to their nearest respective TNW. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 252-1, Jt. Br. at 22-3). However, defendant does not offer any authority suggesting that the amount of flow to the nearest TNW is determinative.

Defendant's position would, in effect, \"destroy [CWA] jurisdiction through 'death by a thousand cuts.' \"\n   <em>\n    Precon II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=603%20Fed.%20Appx.%20149\">\n    603 Fed.Appx. at 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting argument that wetlands lacked a significant nexus \"because the 448-acre wetlands make up a small percentage of the Northwest River watershed\") (internal quotation marks omitted). Defendant also points out that the waters are \"tens of miles from the nearest\" TNW, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 252-1, Jt. Br. at 3), but again, defendant cites no authority suggesting that such a distance precludes the existence of CWA jurisdiction or studies showing that waters beyond a certain distance cannot significantly affect a downstream\n   TNW. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=603%20Fed.%20Appx.%20149\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   );\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cal. Sportfishing\n   </em>\n   , 124 F.Supp.3d at 1018 (concluding that a ravine which flows into a creek and then into a river located 19 miles downstream from the facility at issue sufficient to confer jurisdiction under the CWA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Dr. Josselyn claims that Cat Canyon Creek, Palmer Road Creek and Zaca Tributary are ephemeral streams, which are streams with \"flowing water only during, and for a short duration after, precipitation events in a typical year[,]\" (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 252-12, Josselyn Report at ECF 10952-53), and that the government's data shows that water typically flows only following rain events. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 252-12, Josselyn Decl. at \u00b6\u00b6 28-29). However, even if true, the Army Corps of Engineers Jurisdictional Determination Form Instructional Guidebook (\"Guidebook\"), which defendant itself cites, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 252-1, Jt. Br. at 18-19), contemplates that \"[c]ertain ephemeral waters in the arid west are distinguishable from the geographic features described below where such ephemeral waters are tributaries and may have a significant nexus to TNWs.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 252-14, Evid. Appx., Guidebook at ECF 11146). The Guidebook notes that even an \"unnamed ephemeral tributary\" may be jurisdictional under the CWA so long as it has a significant nexus with a TNW. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF 11153-55). The Guidebook is consistent with Justice Kennedy's concurrence, where he took issue with the plurality's requirement of standing water or continuous flow for at least \"some months\" as ignoring the nature of waters \"in the western parts of the Nation\" and \"mak[ing] little practical sense in a statute concerned with downstream water quality[.]\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rapanos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275930\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/715/\">\n    547 U.S. at 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275930\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/715/\">\n    126 S.Ct. at 2242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment). Thus, even ephemeral streams may be jurisdictional under the CWA so long as they possess a significant nexus to a TNW.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As for the existence of a significant nexus, Dr. Josselyn opines that the \"flow generated from these sites is very infrequent and unlikely to have a significant effect on the downstream navigable water\" and that in some instances, the large amount of flow that Dr. Lee recorded was the result of human intervention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 252-12,\n   Josselyn Report at ECF 10905). He explains that none of the facilities at issue \"are located directly on any feature with an [OHWM] and most are hundreds of feet and up to 0.4 miles from a feature with an [OHWM].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Dkt. 252-12, Josselyn Report at ECF 10904). However, Dr. Josselyn's analysis does not examine whether the waters significantly affect the chemical, physical, or biological integrity of a TNW even though Justice Kennedy's significant nexus calls for such analysis. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 252-12, Josselyn Report at ECF 10900) (explaining that in his significant nexus determination, Dr. Josselyn considered: (1) the presence of an OHWM; (2) the volume of flow; and (3) proximity to navigable waters);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rapanos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275930\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/715/\">\n    547 U.S. at 779-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275930\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/715/\">\n    126 S.Ct. at 2248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]f the wetlands, either alone or in combination with similarly situated lands in the region, significantly affect the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of other covered waters more readily understood as 'navigable.' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Instead, Dr. Josselyn criticizes Dr. Lee's significant nexus analysis as being based only on \"generalized theories\" without any \"site-specific ecological data[.]\" (See Dkt. 252-1, Jt. Br. at 31-32; Dkt. 252-12, Josselyn Decl. at ECF 10959-60 &amp; \u00b6\u00b6 13-22). To the contrary, Dr. Lee and his team performed site-specific studies in the Zaca Creek and Cat Canyon Creek watersheds and performed field work on multiple occasions between 2008 and 2016. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 252-3, Dr. Lee Report at ECF 10190). For instance, between December 2008 and April 2009, Dr. Lee and his team collected measurements, \"pebble counts, characterization of dominant vegetation, photographs, and flow estimates.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 252-3, Dr. Lee Report at ECF 10190). Also, for the wet seasons between the fall of 2009 and spring of 2016, Dr. Lee and his team \"conducted periodic field observations of stream conditions\" and \"regularly traveled downstream along the length of each stream system ... and then downstream along the rivers to the estuaries of\n   the Santa Ynez and Santa Maria Rivers[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF 10191). During these visits, he collected data from instruments and \"took photographs of stream conditions, faunal species using stream systems, runoff events, and instruments.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Dr. Lee also cites a soil map that was created by the United States Natural Resources Conservation Service that sets forth the types of soils found within the Zaca Creek and Cat Canyon Creek watersheds, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3275930\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/547/715/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ECF 10186), and pebble counts from Zaca Tributary to show that there are \"large inputs of very fine sediment throughout the channel system.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF 10204).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   While it is true that Dr. Lee's report cites general studies and relies on data collected by others, defendant does not offer any authority as to why Dr. Lee, or any expert for that matter, cannot rely on general principles and studies performed by others to reach his conclusions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 252-1, Jt. Br.);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
