FURMAN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case is one of scores in this District and other courts around the country involving claims against the trustee of a statutory trust containing residential mortgage-backed securities. Plaintiffs, investors in securities issued by a Delaware statutory trust, allege that the indenture trustee for the trust, Defendant Citibank N.A. (\"Citibank\"), breached its duties under various contracts, the Trust Indenture Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77aaa\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the common law. In particular, Plaintiffs claim that they were harmed because Citibank failed to take certain actions when it discovered breaches of representations and warranties by the seller and servicer of the loans at issue and upon learning of \"Events of Default.\" Each side now moves, pursuant to Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for summary judgment. (Docket Nos. 135, 139). Plaintiffs also move, pursuant to Rule 23, for class certification. (Docket No. 109).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   As discussed below, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs' claims fail as a matter of law because they cannot prove that Citibank could have taken action to avoid the harms that ultimately befell them. That is because Citibank is not alleged to have learned about the purported breaches until 2009. Yet, before that date, the entities against whom Citibank might have pursued claims had declared bankruptcy and the deadline to assert claims within the bankruptcy proceedings had passed. Against that backdrop, Plaintiffs fail to present any non-speculative reason to believe that Citibank could have and should have taken any different actions than it did, let alone that such actions would have prevented any harms to Plaintiffs. Accordingly, and for the reasons discussed below, Citibank's motion for summary judgment is granted and Plaintiffs' motions are denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The background of this action is summarized in greater detail in a prior opinion of this Court, familiarity with which is assumed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fixed Income Shares: Series M v.

As a result of that Opinion\n   (which granted in part and denied in part Citibank's motion to dismiss) and subsequent developments, two Plaintiffs remain: PIMCO and TIAA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5762784\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/130/842/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5762784\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/130/842/\">\n    at 858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dismissing certain causes of action and all claims relating to the New York common law (or \"PSA\") trusts). (Docket Nos. 115, 136 (\"Defs.' Mem.\"), at 3). Further, their claims are limited to one Delaware statutory trust: the American Home Mortgage Investment Trust 2004-3 (\"AHM 2004-3\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. 3). That trust was created when a \"seller,\" American Home Mortgage Acceptance Inc. (\"AHM Acceptance\") bundled and sold mortgage loans to a \"purchaser,\" Lehman ABS Corporation, which in turn exchanged the loans with the trust for notes. (Docket No. 144 (\"Delange Decl.\"), Ex. 2 (\"MLPA\"); Docket No. 159 (\"Resp. CSUF\"), \u00b6\u00b6 14, 21). The notes then became investment instruments, issued under an Indenture that designated Citibank as the Indenture Trustee. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Delange Decl., Ex. 1 (\"Indenture\"). Meanwhile, American Home Mortgage Servicing, Inc. (\"AHM Servicing\"), the \"master servicer,\" was responsible for collecting and remitting payments as well as taking enforcement action against borrowers as necessary. (Indenture;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Delange Decl. Ex. 3, at \u00a7\u00a7 3.06, 3.13;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Resp. CSUF \u00b6\u00b6 2, 17, 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The AHM 2004-3 trust, like most residential mortgage-backed securities trusts, is governed by three main agreements: the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement or MLPA; the Indenture between Citibank and the issuer; and the Servicing Agreement (Delange Decl., Ex. 3 (\"SA\") ), among Citibank, AHM Servicing, and the issuer. These agreements grant investors certain powers and remedies, and define the duties of Citibank as trustee. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indenture \u00a7 6.01(b)(i) (\"Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture ....\"). Significantly, Citibank's duties as trustee are more limited than the duties of an ordinary trustee at common law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Elliott Assocs. v. J. Henry Schroder Bank &amp; Trust Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1309556\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/838/66/#p71\">\n    838 F.2d 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 71 (2d Cir. 1988) (noting that a securities trustee's duties \"are strictly defined and limited to the terms of the indenture\");\n   <em>\n    Magten Asset Mgmt. Corp. v. Bank of N.Y.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20Misc.%203d%201132\">\n    15 Misc. 3d 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (A),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%201326795\">\n    2007 WL 1326795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2007) (\"The role of an indenture trustee differs from that of an ordinary trustee ... because its obligations are defined primarily by the indenture rather than by the common law of trusts. An ordinary trustee is subject to duties beyond those in the trust agreement ....\" (citation omitted) ). Broadly speaking, two types of those duties are relevant here. First, under the MLPA, the seller made various representations and warranties about the underwriting of each loan in the trust (for example, that the loans were originated in accordance with the lender's underwriting guidelines). (MLPA \u00a7 3.2(v) ). The agreements provide that, \"[u]pon the discovery ... of a breach of any of the representations and warranties made in the [MLPA] in respect of any Mortgage Loan which materially and adversely affects the interests of the Noteholders,\" Citibank \"shall give prompt written notice to the other parties\" to the agreements. (SA \u00a7 2.03). Once a seller receives such notice, it is then required to cure the breach, substitute another loan in place of the defective loan, or repurchase \"such Mortgage Loan\" at its unpaid principal balance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Second, the agreements provide that Citibank has certain responsibilities in the event that an \"Event of Default\"-defined to include \"a default in the observance or performance of any covenant or agreement of the Issuer made in the Indenture,\" so long as certain conditions are met-occurs and becomes \"known to\" Citibank. (Indenture\n   88). Specifically, Citibank is required to notify all parties and the investors of the breach. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6.05). Additionally, Citibank must \"exercise the rights and powers vested in it ... us[ing] the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs.\" (Indenture \u00a7 6.01(a) ). (Federal law imposes a similar duty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trust Indenture Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77ooo(c) (requiring that an indenture trustee \"exercise in case of default ... such of the rights and powers vested in it by such indenture, and to use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs\").) Notably, however, the Indenture Agreement states that \"[t]he Indenture Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice or knowledge of any ... Event of Default ... unless a Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee\"-defined as \"any officer ... with direct responsibility for the administration of the Indenture and also, with respect to a particular matter, any other officer to whom such matter is referred because of such officer's knowledge of and familiarity with the particular subject\" (Indenture 109)-\"has actual knowledge thereof or [has received] written notice of any such event ... at its Corporate Trust Office.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6.01(i) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The residential mortgage-backed securities at issue in this case were issued in 2004. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. 3). Three years later, on August 6, 2007, AHM Acceptance and AHM Servicing filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy petitions in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. (Docket No. 138 (\"Russell Decl.\"), Ex. 30 (\n   <em>\n    In re:\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am. Home Mortg. Holdings, Inc.\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    In re AHM\n   </em>\n   \"), No. 07-11047 (Bankr. D. Del.), Docket No. 1) ). Thereafter, the Bankruptcy Court established January 11, 2008, as the bar date for filing proofs of claim. (Russell Decl., Ex. 32-2) (\n   <em>\n    In re AHM\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 1708), at \u00b6 5) ). Citibank filed proofs of claim \"on a precautionary basis\" against each debtor's estate prior to the bar date. (Russell Decl., Ex. 27, at 2). The Bankruptcy Court later approved a liquidation plan that established a formula for estimating and allowing claims for breaches of representations and warranties. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Russell Decl., Ex. 32-3 (\n   <em>\n    In re AHM\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 7029), at Art. 7(B) );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Russell Decl., Exs. 32-4, 32-5 (\n   <em>\n    In re AHM\n   </em>\n   , Docket Nos. 7042, 7555) ). Under that plan, the value of \"[e]ach Breach of Warranty Claim\" was \"calculated based upon loan vintage (i.e., year and quarter of origination) and certain estimations and simplifying assumptions.\" (Russell Decl. Ex. 32-3, at Art. 7(B) ). Loans originated in 2004, including all of the loans in the AHM 2004-3 trust, were assigned an assumed breach rate of 0.01%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). To the extent relevant here, the plan allowed damages per breach of such loans of 0.0% of the principal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). On March 5, 2010, the Bankruptcy Court so ordered a stipulation resolving Citibank's proofs of claim, awarding it zero dollars for any representation-and-warranty claims and $65,475 for servicing-related claims. (Russell Decl., Ex. 32-6 (\n   <em>\n    In re AHM\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 8653) ). Citibank notified the AHM 2004-3 noteholders of these developments, and informed them that Citibank did not intend to take any further action in the bankruptcy proceedings \"unless otherwise instructed and directed.\" (Russell Decl., Ex. 26, at 3;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%201326795\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 27). Citibank received no such instruction or direction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs filed this suit on November 24, 2014, alleging that Citibank \"failed to discharge its essential duties as trustee.\" (Docket No. 142 (\"Pls.' Mem.\"), at 1). The remaining Plaintiffs' claims are based on two main sets of allegations. First, Plaintiffs argue that Citibank discovered\n   breaches of representations and warranties that the seller of the underlying mortgage loans had made regarding the loans in the trust and that Citibank failed to act on those breaches as required under the governing agreements. In particular, Plaintiffs allege that Citibank failed to provide notice of the breaches, ensure cures of the breaches, or force the seller to repurchase the breaching loans. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   1-2, 11-22, 36-38). Second, Plaintiffs contend that Citibank had knowledge but failed to provide notice of servicer breaches, which matured into defaults under the governing agreements, in turn triggering a reimbursement provision. More specifically, Plaintiffs claim that Citibank failed to act prudently to protect their interests upon these Events of Default and failed to enforce the Trust's rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   1-2, 24-38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARDS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate where the admissible evidence and the pleadings demonstrate \"no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

But even if the Court were to look past the deficiencies in Plaintiffs' Complaint to the record, their claims would still fall short because they fail to support any non-speculative ground upon which they could recover from Citibank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Granted, that is not for lack of trying. Recognizing the fate of the plaintiffs' analogous claims in\n   <em>\n    BlackRock\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs here insist that they have \"identified the precise actions Citibank could have and should have taken, and supported it with substantial evidence.\" (Pls.' Mem. 32). But few of Plaintiffs' allegations are in fact \"precise,\" and even fewer are actually pleaded in their Complaint. More fundamentally, Plaintiffs' arguments do not survive close scrutiny. For instance, Plaintiffs first contend that Citibank could have and should have taken various steps to investigate and pursue claims by the bar date in the AHM bankruptcy or before the bankruptcy altogether. They contend, for example, that Citibank filed proofs of claim in the bankruptcy proceedings only as to 234 loans despite the fact that (1) \"at the time, at\n   least 7,460 Trust loans were missing title policies and were therefore eligible for repurchase\" and (2) that \"an adequate investigation\" would have revealed that \"the Trust's loan pool contained an extremely high percentage of loans with material R &amp; W breaches that adversely affected the noteholder's rights.\" (Pls.' Mem. 31-32).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, they assert that Citibank might have been able to bring claims against Deutsche Bank, as \"Custodian,\" for failing \"to take possession of the loan files and providing notice of loan file defects to enforce AHM's obligation to repurchase defective loan files.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   34). But these arguments all suffer from a fatal flaw (separate and apart from the fact that they are unpleaded in the Complaint): They are predicated on actions that Citibank allegedly could have or should have taken\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   2009 and, thus, are time barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs are on slightly firmer ground in contending, next, that Citibank breached its duties as trustee by agreeing to settle the claims that it did file in the bankruptcy proceedings on the cheap-if only because those contentions relate to Citibank's actions within the limitations period. (Pls.' Mem. 3-4, 33-35). But those claims fail for a different reason: Plaintiffs do not proffer any non-speculative evidence that Citibank could have obtained more than it did in the bankruptcy proceedings. Notably, to prove that Citibank could have obtained a more favorable result is no easy task, as the amounts for which Citibank settled its claims were based on the liquidation plan approved by the Bankruptcy Court, and the Bankruptcy Court blessed the stipulation of settlement itself, explicitly finding that \"the relief requested\" was \"in the best interests of the Debtors' estates, their creditors and other parties in interest.\" (Russell Decl., Ex. 32-6 (\n   <em>\n    In re AHM\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 8653), at 1).

By contrast, under its agreement with CGMRC, AHM was contractually obligated to repurchase all EPD loans, without the need for CGMRC to prove a breach. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 154, Ex. 5.2, at \u00a7 7.05 (\"In the event that any Mortgagor fails to make the first, second or third scheduled Monthly Payment due on a Mortgage Loan ... within the calendar month such payment is due, Seller shall repurchase such Mortgage Loan ... within five (5) Business Days following ....\") ). Thus, the mere fact that CGMRC and similarly situated creditors obtained a better return on their EPD claims does not provide a basis to conclude that Citibank could have obtained a better result on the claims at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Third, Plaintiffs contend that Citibank could have and should have pursued relief against various \"solvent third parties.\" (Pls.' Mem. 34;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 324). Relatedly, they assert that Citibank \"failed to provide notice\" to noteholders so that they could \"take action to protect their rights and avoid or mitigate losses due to the defective loans.\" (Pls.' Mem. 34;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   28-29). \"Proper notice,\" they insist, \"would have enabled noteholders to, among other things, determine whether to take independent or collective action to protect their interests against such [representation-and-warranty] breaches, including against solvent responsible parties such as [Deutsche Bank]. Moreover, had Citi[bank] timely disclosed all known defaults, investors would have had valid claims under the securities laws against the Trust's underwriters-Citigroup; Lehman Brothers; Bear Stearns &amp; Co., Inc.; and UBS Investment Bank ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34). But Citibank\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   provide notice to noteholders that it had filed proofs of claim in the bankruptcy proceedings, and invited them to \"instruct[ ] and direct[ ]\" Citibank to take action-an invitation that went unaccepted. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. 11; Russell Decl. Ex. 26, at 2). Additionally, these theories of recovery are not pleaded in the Complaint-except in the broadest of terms (Compl. \u00b6 324), which fall far short of stating a plausible claim for relief. And in any event, Plaintiffs must ultimately do more than merely state that Citibank or the noteholders could have theoretically pursued claims against other solvent parties. They would have to show, through non-speculative evidence, that a \"prudent person\" in Citibank's position would have pursued such claims\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that they likely would have recovered more than Citibank did. Plaintiffs fail to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs argue for the first time that Citibank \"failed to act prudently with respect to pursuing the Trust's claims against AHM because of its numerous conflicting roles in the transaction.\" (Pls.' Mem. 36). For instance, they contend that, \"[i]n connection with the Trust, Citi was both an underwriter and the trustee\" and \"had an economic incentive to refrain from aggressively prosecuting the Trust's Seller [representation-and-warranty] claims because doing so would have potentially exposed Citi to liability ... for making false statements in connection with the offering.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36-37). Once again, however, Plaintiffs are conflating under the name \"Citi\" two distinct entities: the indenture trustee, the only Defendant in this case, and the securities underwriter, non-party Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (\"CGMI\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Counterstatement \u00b6 122). More fundamentally, Plaintiffs do not provide any concrete evidence that the Trustee's actions were influenced in any way by a conflict of interest. That is, conclusory assertions aside, Plaintiffs fail to prove that, by virtue of any conflict of interest, Citibank caused them concrete harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In sum, for the reasons stated above, Plaintiffs are stuck between a rock and hard place. By pleading that Citibank did not learn of the alleged breaches until 2009, they avoid a statute-of-limitations problem. In doing so, however, they run headlong into a bankruptcy problem. By contrast, fixing the bankruptcy problem by alleging knowledge before 2007 would run them headlong into the statute-of-limitations problem. The result is that Plaintiffs' claims against Citibank fail as a matter of law and must be dismissed. Accordingly, Citibank's motion for summary judgment is granted. It follows that Plaintiffs' motions for summary judgment and class certification are denied as moot. The Clerk of Court is directed to terminate Docket Nos. 109, 135, 139, and 157; to enter judgment in favor of Citibank; and to close the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Plaintiffs' assertion that Citibank limited its proofs of claim to breaches \"in only 234 loans\" finds no support in the portions of their Rule 56.1 Statement that they cite. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Mem. 3, 32 (citing Docket No. 140 (\"Pls.' Counterstatement\"), at \u00b6\u00b6 101, 104) ). For present purposes, the Court assumes the truth of Plaintiffs' assertion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    Needless to say, if Plaintiffs could proceed on a theory that Citibank breached its duties with respect to its handling of the claims that it filed prior to the bar date, their damages would be limited to the loans underlying those claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
