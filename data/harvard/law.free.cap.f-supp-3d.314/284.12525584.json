Eiland avers that his counsel performed deficiently by failing to challenge this deliberate or reckless omission and resulting misrepresentation, as the information was available to Sparks\n   during the several months leading up to the submission of the wiretap application. ECF No. 1159 at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Eiland claims the toll records and pen register data would have \"provided a record of long distance numbers called and received by Miller's phone,\" as well as \"the duration of calls.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202518\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 15 n.5. Had this information been included in the application, Eiland argues, a reasonable judge might have found that normal investigative techniques were sufficient.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202518\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202518\">\n    at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Eiland's theory is that the omission of this information renders the affidavit less than the \"full and complete statement\" required under the statute to establish the necessity of the wiretap. His attorney's incompetence, he argues, stems from his failure to consider information available from \"Miller and other sources\" which would have shown that \"Miller regularly made or received long distance calls to or from out of town drug sources on the target phone\" during the three months leading up to the wiretap application.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202518\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202518\">\n    at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . With this information, Eiland contends that his counsel could have established the need for a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing that might have invalidated the warrant and the resulting evidence therefrom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The crux of this argument rests on Eiland's assertion that the Miller wiretap was necessary, \"\n   <em>\n    primarily\n   </em>\n   , to identify out of town drug sources, methods of transporting drugs from them into the District of Columbia and related information such as storage facilities.\" ECF No. 1159 at 14 (emphasis added). After representing this goal of identifying out-of-town contacts as the primary reason for the wiretap, Eiland asserts that the omission of information already used by the FBI to identify some of the defendants' out-of-town contacts constituted a material misrepresentation to the issuing judge regarding the necessity of the tap.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202518\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202518\">\n    at 14-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In fact, there is nothing in the Sparks 2/13/04 Affidavit giving the indication that the identification of \"out-of-town drug sources\" was the\n   <em>\n    primary\n   </em>\n   justification for the wiretap.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A308-09; Sparks 2/13/04 Aff. 51-52. Instead, as the government observes in its Opposition Brief, the affidavit identifies a number of important details about the drug trafficking operation that had eluded authorities after months of conducting traditional investigative techniques. ECF No. 1169 at 22-23. These areas included: \"(a) the means by which the drugs were obtained; (b) the manner and timetable of shipments; (c) the locations where drugs and illegally obtained assets were hidden; or (d) the manner in which the defendants concealed their activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Eiland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694888,4235194\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/338/\">\n    738 F.3d at 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (paraphrasing the February 13, 2004, Sparks Affidavit). As the D.C. Circuit noted, while the pen register data no doubt conveyed important information, it could not convey the substance of what was being discussed on the calls.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694888,4235194\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/338/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The affidavit also established that there were no cooperating sources able to fill in most of these gaps.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694888,4235194\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/338/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Even if it is assumed that Eiland's counsel acted deficiently by failing to raise these specific objections to the wiretap evidence, Eiland cannot show that he was thereby prejudiced. Given the wide range of gaps in the investigation at the time the initial affidavit supporting the Miller wiretap was submitted, it is highly unlikely an issuing judge would have denied the wiretap application due to the availability of pen register and toll record data. As the D.C. Circuit has already held on direct appeal, \"[t]he government was not obliged to include in the applications every detail known to it concerning the conspiracy.\"\n   <em>\n    Eiland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694888,4235194\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/338/\">\n    738 F.3d at 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The affidavit \"adequately demonstrated that traditional investigative techniques had been employed\n   and holes remained in the evidence that could only reasonably be filled by wiretap.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694888,4235194\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/338/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Eiland has therefore failed to demonstrate that his counsel's failure to challenge the omission of pen register and toll record data prejudiced him by depriving him of a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    ii. The Omission of Information Regarding a Key Informant\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Eiland's assertion that his counsel performed deficiently by failing to challenge the omission of information about CW-12 in the initial affidavit supporting the Miller wiretap merits little discussion. He argues that because this informant was \"trusted enough by the main targets of the investigation,\" CW-12 could have been used by law enforcement to \"advance the investigation by traditional methodology.\" ECF No. 1159 at 19. The omission of information about this informant and his potential investigative value in the initial Miller wiretap affidavit, Eiland argues, was a \"deliberate or reckless attempt to mislead the issuing court on the necessity for electronic surveillance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As the Circuit observed on direct appeal, CW-12 \"was in a halfway house from January 16, 2004 to March 5, 2004.\"\n   <em>\n    Eiland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694888,4235194\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/338/\">\n    738 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   351 n.4. CW-12 was therefore not mentioned in the Sparks affidavit \"because he was not able to provide assistance to the investigation until he left the halfway house.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694888,4235194\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/338/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Information about CW-12 in the initial affidavit was therefore\n   <em>\n    completely irrelevant\n   </em>\n   to establishing the necessity of the Miller wiretap in February of 2004. Eiland's counsel did not perform deficiently by failing to assert a meritless argument, and this claim is consequently rejected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    iii. The Mischaracterization of Cinquan Blakney as a Leader of the Organization Under Investigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Eiland next argues that his counsel performed deficiently by failing to challenge the \"deliberate or recklessly misleading portions of all affidavits supporting the Miller and Eiland taps mischaracterizing Cinquan Blakney as a leader of the organization under investigation.\" ECF No. 1159 at 22. This mischaracterization, he argues, came from the repeated references to Blakney in the wiretap application affidavits as a third leader of the criminal organization along with Miller and Eiland.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24. Eiland contends in his Motion that at the time the initial Miller wiretap application was submitted, no informants available to the government had been able to link Blakney to the conspiracy, and no controlled purchases listed in the affidavit connected Blakney to the Miller/Eiland organization.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-30. Consequently, he argues, the difficulty of investigating Blakney by traditional methods was erroneously considered in conjunction with the investigation of Eiland and Miller, which he argues played a significant role in the determination that the wiretaps were necessary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23. Moreover, Eiland asserts that the first affidavit for the Miller wiretap failed to state facts establishing probable cause that Blakney was a leader of the organization.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Eiland concedes that the affidavits did provide pen register and toll record data showing that \"50 calls to or from Miller's phone between November 6, 2003, and January 17, 2004 involved a phone subscribed to Cinquan Blakney's mother, assertedly used by Mr. Blakney.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30. Eiland also cites a statement by Agent Sparks in the affidavit supporting the Miller wiretap explaining that \"one Jamilla Brown 'was ... able to confirm that Cinquan Blakney and Frederick Miller have a long standing close relationship.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30 (quoting Sparks 2/13/04 Aff. 30, \u00b6 47). These two allegations, Eiland avers, were too weak to establish probable cause that Blakney was a leader of the organization,\n   given that \"[t]here is no information on the content of the calls, whether Mr. Blakney was the caller of recipient, or even if such calls were completed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Eiland's own Motion acknowledges that the affidavits contained all of the above listed information concerning Miller's connections to Blakney, including a statement explaining that Blakney refused to sell heroin to one Eric Allison because \"he did not want any problems with Eiland because he knew Allison sold Eiland's heroin.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27 (quoting Sparks 2/13/04 Aff. 21, \u00b6 32). Furthermore, the excerpts listed in Eiland's Motion from the Sparks 2/13/04 Affidavit all refer to difficulties in investigating the \"trio\" (Miller, Blakney, and Eiland) by traditional methods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24. Aside from asserting a more tenuous factual link between Miller and Blakney than existed between Miller and Eiland, the Motion fails to convincingly show that Agent Sparks's decision to list Blakney as a third potential leader of the criminal organization played a significant role in the issuing judges' decisions to allow the wiretaps. As already discussed above, the investigation was hindered by the inadequacy of traditional methods to identify a number of important details about the operation as a whole-not only, or even predominantly, the details of Blakney's involvement. Eiland ignores these significant investigative difficulties, instead generally asserting that \"significant progress\" had been made in the investigation against Miller prior to the wiretap.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31. Such progress, he argues, was lacking in the investigation of Blakney.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Because all of the above information was reflected in the affidavits, the issuing judges were in a position to evaluate the strength of the wiretap applications based on the relevant information available to the government at that time. Those issuing judges, this Court, and the D.C. Circuit have each individually verified that the wiretaps were justified by both probable cause and necessity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Eiland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1588429\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/398/160/#p162\">\n    398 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   163-172 ;\n   <em>\n    Eiland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694888,4235194\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/338/\">\n    738 F.3d at 346-351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Any additional objection by Eiland's attorney challenging the sufficiency of the affidavits on these specific grounds would have been highly unlikely to have changed those determinations. Eiland's assertion that a challenge by his attorney to these statements could have entitled him to a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing is thus nothing but weak speculation, falling well short of the strong initial showing required to clear the \"significantly higher hurdle than would exist on direct appeal\" as required by \u00a7 2255.\n   <em>\n    Frady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184490\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/456/152/#p166\">\n    456 U.S. at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184490\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/456/152/#p166\">\n    102 S.Ct. 1584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Furthermore, Eiland has done nothing to demonstrate that the \"misleading\" statements in any of the Miller wiretap affidavits were made deliberately or with reckless disregard for the truth. \"Under\n   <em>\n    Franks v.

Cir. 1988) ). Given the documented connections between Miller and Blakney, it is not at all clear that listing Blakney in the wiretap affidavits as a possible third leader of the organization was even reckless, let alone deliberately inserted to mislead the issuing judges. The probability that a\n   <em>\n    Franks\n   </em>\n   hearing would have been ordered in the event of Eiland's proposed objection is thus incredibly low. Consequently, even if this Court indulges the\n   generous assumption that Eiland's attorney acted deficiently by failing to raise these specific objections to the Miller wiretap affidavits, Eiland has failed to show that he was prejudiced by this failure.

Agent Bevington's testimony was mitigated, it held, by: (1) the trial court's instruction that the jury was the sole judge of witness credibility and therefore not bound by expert testimony; (2) the trial court's instruction to the jury stating, in essence, that witnesses who have accepted plea agreements for lighter sentences may have motive to lie; (3) Bevington's statement that he had no knowledge of the particular cooperating witnesses at Eiland's trial; (4) Bevington's admission on cross examination that sometimes cooperating witnesses lie; and (5) the significant evidence of Eiland's guilt, including the information collected from the wiretaps.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694888,4235194\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/338/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   By claiming that his counsel acted deficiently by failing to object to Agent Bevington's testimony, Eiland fails to consider that\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   was decided several years after his trial. While the D.C. Circuit had confronted witness credibility vouching by prosecuting attorneys in previous cases,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. v. Boyd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7412226,3619475\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/54/868/\">\n    54 F.3d 868\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 871-72 (D.C.

Circuit \"joined the other courts of appeals 'that have addressed the issue in condemning' the government's use of overview witness testimony.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. McGill\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4147569,12310238\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/815/846/\">\n    815 F.3d 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 876 (D.C.

Eiland therefore cannot show that his\n   counsel acted deficiently, as the law he argues should have been considered had yet to be adopted within the D.C. Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Even if Eiland's counsel did act deficiently by failing to object to the vouching testimony, Eiland was not sufficiently prejudiced by Agent Bevington's testimony to prevail on his \u00a7 2255 motion in light of the other mitigating factors listed by the D.C. Circuit. To show prejudice for the purposes of an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, Eiland must demonstrate \"a reasonable probability that [he] would not have been found guilty\" but for his trial counsel's errors.\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The admission of Bevington's vouching testimony was already held by the Circuit to be harmless error, with any potential prejudice mitigated by other factors-namely the \"significant evidence of [Eiland's] guilt.\"\n   <em>\n    Eiland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694888,4235194\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/338/\">\n    738 F.3d at 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He has thus failed to show that he was prejudiced by his attorney's failure to move\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to object to Agent Bevington's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Eiland also identifies a portion of Agent Bevington's testimony that he claims implied that the Government and the Court were monitoring the truthfulness of the informants' testimony. Eiland's motion states, in relevant part, that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   Bevington explained that if a cooperating witness \"... provided substantial assistance to the government...' the prosecutor files a motion with the court which unties its' [sic] hands in sentencing. Bevington testified that neither law enforcement nor the prosecutor determines the ultimate sentence. \"It's the judge they plead before.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   ECF No. 1159 at 39. These statements, Eiland argues, suggest \"that the government and the court were monitoring the truthfulness of [the witness's] testimony and that any untruthfulness would be punished.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Eiland's argument that his attorney performed deficiently by failing to object to Agent Bevington's statement \"suggesting that the court was monitoring the truthfulness of the witness testimony\" is completely devoid of merit. ECF No. 1159 at 38-39. As the government observed in its Opposition, the D.C. Circuit determined this exact argument to be invalid on appeal, holding that \"Agent Bevington merely stated that after a cooperating witness's compliance is complete, the government files a motion giving the court discretion to depart from a mandatory minimum in sentencing the witness.\"\n   <em>\n    Eiland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694888,4235194\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/338/\">\n    738 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   353 n.9. The Circuit specifically found that the testimony was not used to \" 'explicitly or implicitly indicate that [the government] can monitor and accurately verify the truthfulness of the witness' testimony.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694888,4235194\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/338/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Counsel's Failure to Present Evidence that Eiland had a Source of Income from his Auto-Shop Business\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Eiland contends that his counsel performed deficiently by failing to present evidence at trial of the income Eiland received from his auto shop business, which he argues would have \"rebutted the Government's evidence that Eiland did not have a legitimate source of income to support the life style that he was living prior to his arrest in this case.\" ECF No. 1159 at 52. Eiland states that he was earning over $100,000 annually from this business, and his business partner, Melvin Furr, would have testified to this effect had he been called as a witness.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3566545,6046410\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/508/1066/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Eiland has provided no affidavits by Furr to this effect. Nor has he even stated\n   whether or not he informed his attorney of this business relationship, as noted by the Government in its Opposition. ECF No. 1169 at 37. Furthermore, in light of the \"significant evidence of [Eiland's] guilt\" already discussed above as sufficient to mitigate any prejudice resulting from Agent Bevington's improper vouching testimony, it is extremely unlikely that the revelation of this additional source of income would have had any effect on the trial verdict.\n   <em>\n    Eiland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694888,4235194\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/338/\">\n    738 F.3d at 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Eiland has therefore failed to demonstrate prejudice as a result of any potentially deficient performance by his counsel for failing to raise this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Counsel's Failure to Object to FBI Agent Hall's Lay Opinion Testimony Interpreting Wiretaps\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, Eiland contends that his trial counsel performed deficiently by failing to object to FBI Agent Hall's opinion testimony interpreting the evidence gathered from the various wiretaps used in the investigation. ECF No. 1159 at 36. He cites\n   <em>\n    United States v. Hampton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3664656,4049929\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/978/\">\n    718 F.3d 978\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 981-83 (D.C. Cir. 2013), in which the Circuit held that \"a lay witness may not give opinion testimony interpreting cryptic evidence when the testimony violates Federal Rule of Evidence 701.\"\n   <em>\n    Eiland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694888,4235194\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/338/\">\n    738 F.3d at 354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (paraphrasing\n   <em>\n    Hampton\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Again, Eiland cites authority that did not exist at the time of his trial. His attorney did not perform deficiently by failing to object to testimony that had yet to be deemed improper within the D.C. Circuit. Eiland therefore fails to demonstrate deficient performance by his trial counsel. Moreover, the Circuit, addressing this exact argument on appeal, determined that Eiland \"failed to demonstrate any error [in allowing Agent Hall's testimony] was substantially prejudicial.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694888,4235194\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/738/338/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Eiland has therefore failed to demonstrate prejudice as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Eiland has failed to show that the performance of his trial counsel was both deficient and prejudicial as required to establish ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
