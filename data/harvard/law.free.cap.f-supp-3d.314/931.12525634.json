Indeed, it would seem that Motorola waited almost ten years after its intellectual property was allegedly taken to initiate suit. On September 7, 2017, after the parties had briefed the motion to dismiss, Judge Der-Yeghiayan (shortly before his retirement) wrote that \"Motorola's claims appear to be untimely based upon the representations made by [Hytera].\" However, he determined it was best to convert Hytera's motion to dismiss to a motion for summary judgment in order to resolve the statute of limitations issue based on evidence rather than allegations and representations. [Dkt. # 58, at 2].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Notably, the court allowed the parties until October 6, 2017, to conduct discovery on the statute of limitations issue and stayed all other discovery. [Dkt. # 58]. We say \"notably\" because, nearly\n   <em>\n    eight months ago\n   </em>\n   , the judge allowed the parties\n   <em>\n    one month\n   </em>\n   in which to take discovery on a\n   <em>\n    very limited topic.\n   </em>\n   While the inquiry should have been uncomplicated, it has become a long, drawn out, pitched battle-one, in a rhetorical sense, to rival the Punic Wars-albeit without the elephants and the Alps and the sheer drama.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 20, 2017, Motorola filed a motion to compel, seeking a broad range of documents and arguing they were relevant to the issue of Hytera concealing the theft of Motorola's trade secrets. There were three categories of documents going back nine years: Hytera's internal documents explaining how they developed their radio products; documents covering Hytera's use, receipt, and consideration of Motorola's trade secrets and products; and documents covering any investigation by Hytera into its possession of Motorola trade secrets. [Dkt. # 81, at 13-15]. Hytera protested that such discovery went beyond the statute of limitations issue. [Dkt. # 81, at 12]. Judge Der-Yeghiayan, while reiterating that discovery on issues beyond the statute of limitations was stayed [Dkt. # 81, at 10-11], expressed concern that Hytera's motion for summary judgment could \"basically eliminate [Motorola's] complaint\" and allowed the broad discovery over Hytera's objections. [Dkt. # 81, at 13]. Hytera said it would need until December 1, 2017, to make such an expansive production, and Judge Der-Yeghiayan set that as the new statute of limitations discovery deadline. [Dkt. # 81, at 15].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After that, the parties exchanged motions to compel repeatedly. [Dkt. # 67, 84, 110, 119, 121, 140, 173]. Deadlines were extended, from one month to several. [Dkt. # 91]. Thousands of pages of memoranda and exhibits were filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   And, again, this\n   was all over the supposedly limited discovery on a limited topic that ought to have taken little time and effort. The very nature of what occurred tends to sustain the all too prevalent observation that discovery has become more important than the actual case.\n   <em>\n    Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p595\">\n    550 U.S. 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 595, n.13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p595\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p595\">\n    167 L.Ed.2d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) ;\n   <em>\n    A.H.

[Dkt. # 91]. Among other things, Motorola now asks to conduct a forensic examination of the computers of \"key Hytera witnesses who have been involved in the use of Motorola's confidential information and any relevant Hytera servers ... on which Hytera has stored Motorola documents,\" all of which are located in China. [Dkt. # 175, at 5]. But even that is not the end. Indeed, Motorola says it wants to \"\n   <em>\n    begin\n   </em>\n   with forensic inspection of the computers of the following Hytera employees: G.S. Kok, Y.T. Kok, Samuel Chia, Jue Liang, Roger Zhang, Phaik Ee Ooi, Yu Kok Hoong.\" [Dkt. # 175, at 5 n.2 (emphasis added) ]. The word \"begin\" is italicized for obvious reasons. We are now over eight months into this statute of limitations discovery with no end in sight. In fact, Motorola wants to \"begin\" forensic inspection one month after the deadline for statute of limitations discovery has passed. One is reminded of Churchill's famous quip: \"Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Over the course of two lengthy hearings on March 21 and April 4, 2018, I tentatively concluded that forensic examination of Hytera's computers would be appropriate, but only if the parties could arrive at a suitable protocol that would not, among other things, run afoul of Chinese law. As we discuss,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   at 5, that was a mistake. But the law frowns on relying on a blunder to gain an opportunistic advantage.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Architectural Metal Systems, Inc. v.

Motorola, however, maintained that this would take up too much time-a remarkable protest considering the already unnecessarily prolonged history of the discovery that was supposed to be limited to the timeliness of the Motorola Complaint. What impressed me initially at the March 21 hearing were Motorola's discussion of two emails that Hytera had long produced to Motorola, that seemed to indicate that Hytera thought certain software should be rewritten to make it look different from Motorola software. That initially appeared\n   relevant to fraudulent concealment as such a tack would seem make it more difficult for Motorola to discover that the formerly-Motorola-now-Hytera employees had somehow misappropriated trade secrets. [Dkt. # 209, at 20-25, 49, 53-54].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   But at some point between March 21 and April 4, as counsel for Hytera put it at the April 4 hearing, those emails became a \"crowbar to get everything\" [Dkt. # 210, at 45], and we went from discovery relevant to the equitable tolling of the statute of limitations, which remains the scope of discovery allowable at this point, to looking for anything, as I unfortunately and incorrectly put it at the April 4 hearing, \"of value or relevance to this case.\" [Dkt. # 210, at 46].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   And, as the April 4\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   hearing progressed, that is clearly where things went, with the limitations of discovery to the statute of limitations issue being put out of view and replaced by what was relevant to the alleged theft of Hytera's \"confidential information\" and generally those who may have been recipients of it. [Dkt. # 210, at 54]. Under that expanded view, discovery would then encompass any file that implicated any Hytera/Motorola confidential information or showed use of the Motorola code or information by Hytera related to this case. [Dkt. # 210, at 58-60, 64]. Evidence that Hytera was using Motorola code or information might be relevant to Motorola's case-in-chief but, but the issue at hand was equitable tolling of the statute of limitations. And, the material sought by Motorola was not relevant to the narrow issue of whether Motorola knew or should have known enough to have filed its Complaint earlier.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   4 Wright, Miller, Steinman, Federal Practice and Procedure, Section 1056 at 257,\n   <em>\n    et. seq.\n   </em>\n   (2015)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Toward the end of the hearing, in response to counsel for Hytera stating that he \"accept[ed] that [he] lost the argument,\" I pointed out that I could change my mind and that \"reconsideration is a valuable tool.\" [Dkt. # 210, at 72].

What is being sought goes beyond the issue of equitable tolling. In the end, Motorola's counsel and I were talking about relevance to allegations in Motorola's complaint. [Dkt. # 210,\n   at 92-95]. And so, well beyond the statute of limitations, by the end of the April 4 hearing, discovery was encompassing documents related to Motorola's entire case. [Dkt. # 210, at 96].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As we have said, \"all judges make mistakes,\"\n   <em>\n    Fujisawa Pharm.

And so, it must now be said that there are two significant problems with Motorola's motion that dictate it be denied. First, it is not apparent that the Hytera computers in China-or as Motorola's counsel put it, \"evidence of where our stuff went\" [Dkt. # 209, at 61]-is relevant to the statute of limitations issue, and Motorola does not explain how it might be relevant. Motorola filed suit some time after the applicable statutes of limitations ran, but has indicated that it hopes to rely on the doctrine of fraudulent concealment to toll the statutes and stave off Hytera's pending motion for summary judgment. [Dkt. # 173, at 2]. But nothing in any of Motorola's filings shows how the information it hopes to find in the computers in China through forensic examination has anything to do with equitable tolling of the statute of limitations and fraudulent concealment. Indeed, without any forensic inspection, Motorola has filed its response to Hytera's motion for summary judgment and has not made a motion before Judge Norgle to delay the briefing, as Rule 56(d), Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, would have permitted. Of course, inferences from silence are often perilous. But in a context where some prompt outcry would be expected, Motorola's willingness to proceed in the summary judgment case is significant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Richman v.

As already noted, at the hearing, Motorola made it clear that it felt entitled to anything at all that had to do with its information, use of it, or what might have been done with it. More recently, Motorola has asserted that \"Hytera's concealment of its theft-for instance, by deleting evidence of its use of Motorola's confidential information\" is somehow \"highly relevant\" to \"Hytera's statute of limitations defense, as they corroborate Motorola's inability to discover the theft during the limitations period.\" [Dkt. # 212, at 10]. But, throughout this tortuous journey, it has been left to speculation how any of this would show that Motorola could not have discovered the theft of its trade secrets earlier than it claims to have. Motorola seems to be confused regarding what constitutes fraudulent concealment in the context of equitable tolling with, perhaps, proof of the theft itself or perhaps spoliation. Indeed, it argues that the evidence it's looking for would \"rebut Hytera's assertions that the absence of that [evidence] means it was never taken.\" [Dkt. # 212, at 10]. That may be relevant to liability, but Motorola has never explained how it is relevant to the statute of limitations, equitable tolling, or fraudulent concealment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Discovery was limited to back in September of 2017-a limitation that has been more honored in the breach than the observance. The issue was what Motorola knew or should have known, and when it knew or should have known it. Deleted documents don't move that meter one way or the other. \"[E]vidence of where [their] stuff went\" [Dkt. # 209, at 61 ]is irrelevant. Let's say the employees took the trade secrets, sent them around Hytera, and then deleted them or hid them in a folder designated \"vacation photos.\" So what? Motorola never had access to any of Hytera's computers any more than it does\n   now, so how would Hytera deleting or hiding the files in China prevent Motorola from discovering it had a claim in Chicago or Malaysia? In other words, Motorola was not relying on some act of Hytera that inappropriately lulled it into not filing or believing it had no case. Conversely, Hytera could never have deleted or hidden Motorola's trade secrets; it could have posted them on a video screen in their offices in China. How would that allow Motorola, in Chicago or Malaysia, to discover they had a claim? Motorola has never had an answer for any of this.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The cases Motorola relies upon have nothing to do with what it's asking for here.\n   <em>\n    Frees, Inc. v.

But it can be noted that at least 3 of the factors weigh against Motorola's motion: (1) as detailed above, Motorola has claimed, but not explained or shown how the discovery sought is relevant to the statute of limitations/equitable tolling issue; (2) Motorola's request is an exceedingly broad one-a request for forensic examination of several computers to \"begin\" with, and for a broad category of information; it is anything but specific; and (3) given that one of the Motorola plaintiffs is located in Malaysia and it seems the employees involved were located there as well-Motorola does not distinguish between its parent company and its Malaysian subsidiary anywhere in its complaint,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    [Dkt. # 1]-based on Motorola's own complaint, it is as likely as not that the information stolen did not originate in the United States. While Motorola claims that the confidential documents and source code originated in the United States [Dkt. # 212, at 12], it does so without any support. The fact of the matter is that the employees Motorola is accusing of having stolen confidential trade secret information worked at Motorola's Malaysian subsidiary, over 9,000 miles from the United States.
