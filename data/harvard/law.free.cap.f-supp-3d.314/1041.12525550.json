'165 and '117, are invalid under 35 U.S.C. section 101 (\" Section 101\") for lack of patent-eligible subject matter as interpreted by the\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   court.\n   <em>\n    Alice Corp.

The '165 and '117 patents are designed to improve the sharing of location-based information for people with personal communication devices. To improve the sharing of location-based information, a system receives from the user's mobile device the location of the user. The system stores that location data, along with other information about the user and the user's location, in a user-specific space. Plaintiff contends that this system accurately determines the user's location and allows it to be shared with select users of the system. Facebook, however, contends that the asserted claims are directed to the abstract idea of separately storing and then selectively sharing location-based information, which are mental processes that have been performed by humans\n   for decades. Facebook also asserts that the patent does not provide any technological innovation that would transform this abstract idea into a patent-eligible concept, thereby failing to meet the\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court shall address additional facts as necessary in the remainder of this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Rather, instead of setting forth a bright line test separating abstract ideas from concepts that are sufficiently concrete so as to require no further inquiry under the first step of the\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   framework, courts are tasked with making the evaluation whether any particular claims are directed to a patent-ineligible abstract idea by \"compar[ing] claims at issue to those already found to be directed to an abstract idea in previous cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Papst Licensing GmbH &amp; Co.

This is a relatively simple and abstract idea, one which can be carried out using a pen and paper. Following the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   , the Court finds the asserted claims are similar to the abstract idea of hedging because they are undisputably well-known functions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Specifically, the claims described the basic concept of hedging, or protecting against risk. The court explained that 'hedging is a fundamental economic practice long prevalent in our system of commerce and taught in any introductory finance class.' \"). The claims are in practical effect patenting the \"idea itself\" and using computer components to carry out the abstract process.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n    at 2354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court thus finds that the claims of the patents-in-suit are directed to a basic concept of storing and selectively sharing location-based information. Because these are undisputedly well-known functions that humans have traditionally performed for decades, these claims are directed to an abstract idea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Evaluation of Abstract Claim for a Limiting Inventive Concept.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Step two of the\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   analysis requires evaluation of abstract claims for a limiting inventive concept. \"A claim drawn to an abstract idea is not necessarily invalid if the claim's limitations-considered individually or as an ordered combination-serve to \"transform the claims into a patent-eligible application.\"\n   <em>\n    Papst\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12135574\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/193/1069/#p1081\">\n    193 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1082 (citing\n   <em>\n    Content Extraction &amp; Transmission LLC v.

Cir. 2014) ). This second step requires that the Court evaluate whether the claim contains \"an element or combination of elements that ensures that the patent in practice amounts to significantly more than a patent upon the abstract idea itself.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892926\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/1343/#p1348\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1083 (citing\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2355 ). Simply because a patent invokes\n   the use of a computer does not transform an abstract idea into a patent-eligible invention: \"[f]or the role of a computer in a computer-implemented invention to be deemed meaningful in the context of this analysis, it must involve more than the performance of 'well-understood, routine, [and] conventional activities previously known to the industry.\"\n   <em>\n    Content Extraction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6892926\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/776/1343/#p1348\">\n    776 F.3d at 1347-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581589\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2347/\">\n    134 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2359 ). It is \"well-settled that mere recitation of concrete, tangible components is insufficient to confer patent eligibility to an otherwise abstract idea\" where those components simply perform their \"well-understood, routine, conventional\" functions.\n   <em>\n    In re TLI Communications LLC Patent Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5923224\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/607/#p611\">\n    823 F.3d 607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 611 (Fed.

Cir. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Here, the Court finds that the subject patents lack any inventive concept that transforms the abstract idea of storing and selectively sharing location-based information into patentable subject matter. The claims do not provide how the claimed methods and systems will specifically execute or apply the fundamentally abstract idea of storing and selectively sharing location-based information. Although Plaintiff points to the specifications to demonstrate how the abstract idea may constitute an inventive concept, a Section 101 analyses must be based on the language of the claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Synopsys Inc. v.

Upon thorough examination of the claims of the patents-at-issue, the Court can discern no inventive concept that transforms the abstract idea of selectively storing and sharing location-based information in the area of personal communication devices into a patent-eligible application of that abstract idea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   An \"inventive concept must be significantly more than the abstract idea itself, and cannot simply be an instruction to implement or apply the abstract idea on a computer.\"\n   <em>\n    BASCOM Global,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924463\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/1341/#p1350\">\n    827 F.3d at 1349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, the patents do not claim any particular process or concept, but instead rely on computer components to perform conventional activities commonly understood. The claims are not directed to a unique solution to a process specific to computers. The claims are not tied to any particular machine and do not transform any specific idea or article into a different thing, thereby creating an inventive concept to remove it from the realm of the abstract idea. The claims here simply recite the use of generic features, such as entering data into a computer database and organizing it based on some criteria.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924463\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/1341/#p1350\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5924463\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/827/1341/#p1350\">\n    at 1347-1348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
