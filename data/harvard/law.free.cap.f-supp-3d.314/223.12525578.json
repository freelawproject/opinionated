Following his conviction for possessing a firearm as a convicted felon, West was sentenced as an armed career criminal pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e).

Specifically, West asserts that his prior felony convictions for New Jersey second-degree aggravated assault, third-degree aggravated assault, and second-degree robbery do not constitute \"violent felon[ies]\" under ACCA's remaining applicable provision, known as the \"elements clause.\" Pet.'s Suppl. Mot. 2;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B). That is so, according to West, because: 1) the New Jersey assault statute requires only that a defendant act recklessly; and 2) the relevant provision of the New Jersey robbery statute does not require the use of violent physical force.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet.'s Suppl.

West therefore asks this Court to vacate and correct his sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Government counters that West's motion should be dismissed on the procedural grounds that it does not satisfy the requirements for second or successive petitions, is time-barred, and is procedurally defaulted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.'s Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. &amp; Suppl.

On the merits, the Government argues that West's prior convictions for assault and robbery qualify as violent felonies under ACCA's elements clause and that West's sentence should therefore stand.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at 19-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Upon consideration of the pleadings and the relevant law, and for the reasons discussed below, I agree with the Government that West's motion to vacate and correct his sentence is procedurally barred and, in any event, fails on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Federal law prohibits convicted felons, such as West, from possessing firearms.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). On October 1, 2004, a jury convicted West of violating that prohibition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   10/1/2004 Minute Entry. Generally, prior felons found guilty of unlawfully possessing a handgun in violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1) face up to 10 years' imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). That sentencing calculus changes, however, if the individual qualifies for a sentencing enhancement under ACCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As relevant here, ACCA provides that a defendant convicted of violating \u00a7 922(g)(1) is subject to a mandatory minimum prison term of 15 years if the defendant has three prior convictions for a \"violent felony.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 924(e)(1). ACCA defines \"violent felony\" as \"any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one\n   year\" that (1) \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\"; (2) \"is burglary, arson, or extortion, [or] involves use of explosives\"; or (3) \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B). Those provisions, respectively, have come to be known as ACCA's \"elements clause,\" \"enumerated clause,\" and \"residual clause.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To start, the Government argues that West's motion does not satisfy the statutory requirements for a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion-specifically, the requirement that his claim \"relies on a new rule of constitutional law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S.'s Opp'n 11-15. In the alternative, the Government argues that West's motion is untimely under \u00a7 2255(f)'s one-year statute of limitations and is procedurally defaulted due to West's failure to raise his ACCA claims at trial or on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.'s Opp'n 15-19. On the merits, the Government asserts that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   2015 does not entitle West to relief because West's prior convictions for New Jersey aggravated assault and robbery qualify as violent felonies-and thus expose him to ACCA's 15-year mandatory minimum sentence-under ACCA's still-valid elements clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    at 19-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Having considered those arguments, I agree with the Government that West's \u00a7 2255 petition should be DENIED. A discussion of the various procedural and substantive issues presented by West's motion will quite clearly demonstrate why.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural Requirements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Federal law erects several procedural hurdles that federal habeas petitioners must clear before their claims may be considered on the merits. The Government argues that West's motion fails to clear two such procedural hurdles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   First, the Government argues that West's motion fails to satisfy the threshold standard for a second or successive motion under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That standard, in relevant part, authorizes a district court to entertain a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion only when the applicant shows that the claim relies on \"a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2255(h)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2244(b)(2)(A). The Government contends that West has failed to carry his threshold burden to show that his motion in fact \"relies\" upon\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   2015.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2255(h)(2). That conclusion follows, the Government asserts, because West has not demonstrated that his mandatory minimum sentence was indeed rendered pursuant to ACCA's now-invalid residual clause, as opposed to the constitutionally permissible elements clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Second, the Government argues that West's motion runs afoul of the one-year statute of limitations period applicable to \u00a7 2255 motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2255(1). When a habeas petitioner asserts a challenge based upon a right \"newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review,\" the one-year limitations period begins running on \"the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2255(f)(3). The Government concedes that\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   2015 triggered a new one-year period for the filing of \u00a7 2255 motions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S.'s Opp'n 16; West's initial post-\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   2015 petition, moreover, was filed within that one-year period.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pet.'s Mot. Notwithstanding those considerations. the Government maintains that West's claim is untimely because, without demonstrating that he was sentenced pursuant to the residual clause (as opposed to the elements clause), West cannot show that his claim is \"in fact predicated on\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   2015's invalidation of the residual clause.

As discussed below, however, I conclude that New Jersey's second-degree robbery statute, as interpreted by the New Jersey Supreme Court, requires more than mere\n    <em>\n     de minimis\n    </em>\n    or \"slight\" force.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    <sup>\n     <a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fr12\" name=\"fr12\">\n      12\n     </a>\n    </sup>\n    <em>\n     New Jersey v.
