Manafort, Jr. has moved to suppress the evidence seized pursuant to a search warrant executed at his Alexandria, Virginia residence on July 26, 2017. Def.'s Mot. to Suppress [Dkt. # 264] (\"Def.'s Mot.\") at 1-2. He argues that the warrant was unconstitutionally overbroad.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-4. He also complains that the affidavit submitted in support of the warrant application did not set forth probable cause to support the seizure of electronic devices; that the agents who executed the search exceeded its permissible scope; and that the government has improperly retained some of the items it seized.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2, 4-10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The government opposed the motion, Gov't Mem. in Opp. to Def.'s Mot. (Public) [Dkt. # 284], (Sealed) [Dkt. # 286] (\"Gov't Opp.\"), the motion is fully briefed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply to the Gov't Opp. [Dkt. # 289] (\"Def.'s Reply\"), and the Court heard argument on May 23, 2018. As explained in more detail below, the Court will deny the motion. Given the nature of the investigation, the warrant was not too broad in scope, and the affidavit set forth sufficient grounds to believe that there would be relevant material on the premises stored on electronic media. And, even if the Court could find fault with the warrant application if it were reviewing it\n   in the first instance, the agents relied in good faith on a warrant signed by a United States Magistrate Judge. For all of these reasons, the evidence obtained during the execution of the warrant will not be suppressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 25, 2017, federal agents applied for a warrant in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, seeking authorization to search Manafort's condominium in Alexandria.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Search Warrant, Notice Att. at 1-16 (\"Warrant\"). The application sought authorization to search for and seize materials relating to alleged violations of ten criminal statutes, Application for a Search Warrant, Notice Att. at 17-66 (\"Appl.\"), and it was supported by an affidavit prepared by an FBI agent, who stated there was \"probable cause to believe that the [Alexandria residence] contain[ed] evidence, fruits, and instrumentalities\" of those offenses. Aff. in Supp. of Appl., Notice Att. at 22-62 (\"Aff.\") \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The agent averred that between 2006 and 2014, Manafort and his associate, Richard W. Gates, III, worked as political consultants for the Ukrainian Party of Regions, and Viktor Yanukovych, who was the head of the Party and the President of Ukraine from 2010 to 2014. Aff. \u00b6 9. According to the affidavit, Manafort and Gates established a number of bank accounts in Cyprus. Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. Those accounts received payments to Manafort or Manafort-related entities for their work on behalf of the Ukrainians, and they were used to pay vendors directly for goods and services purchased by Manafort. Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 11-14. The affiant also states that Manafort performed \"significant work\" for Rinat Akhmetov, a financial supporter of President Yanukovych, and Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch. Aff. \u00b6 9. He adds that a company jointly owned by Manafort and his wife received a $10 million loan from a \"Russian lender,\" identified in documents obtained by the government as \"Derapaska.\" Aff. \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The affidavit sets forth grounds to believe that Manafort, Gates, and their entities, including Davis Manafort, failed to register as agents of a foreign principal as required by the Foreign Agent Registration Act (\"FARA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20611\">\n    22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 21, until June of 2017. Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 9. The agent also stated that the foreign source income reported on Manafort's tax returns did not appear to include the distributions to or from the Cypriot bank accounts on his behalf, Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, nor did Manafort file the reports required by the Bank Secrecy Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=31%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%205314\">\n    31 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 5322(a), to disclose his interest in those foreign accounts. Aff. \u00b6 18. The affidavit also detailed alleged misrepresentations to secure bank loans and loan extensions. Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 24-46. [redacted]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The agent then listed a number of facts and circumstances underlying his belief that defendant's Alexandria residence was likely to contain evidence of these crimes. First of all, an individual who works with Manafort had told the agent that Manafort used a home office at that address to conduct his business and that he maintained\n   records there. Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 64-66. Also, defendant had communicated with the Department of Justice about filings to be made under FARA, and at least one communication from 2016 was addressed to defendant's Alexandria residence. Aff. \u00b6 68. The government was in possession of bank and financial records for defendant, [redacted] and \"Davis Manafort Part.\" addressed to his residence in Alexandria, and it had records showing that Manafort's prior residence had been listed as the address of record for a number of accounts. Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 70-71. Also, investigators had obtained bank records and invoices sent to defendant's home in Alexandria reflecting the purchase of clothing, jewelry, rugs, and other goods using funds wired from several of the Cypriot accounts listed in the affidavit. Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 72-73. They had evidence of wire transfers from the Cypriot accounts to a rug store in Alexandria totaling more than $360,000, and a store owner reported that it was defendant who purchased the rugs. Aff. \u00b6 73. This led the agent to believe that rugs purchased using funds from the Cypriot accounts would also be found at the residence. Aff. \u00b6 73.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   With regard to electronic files, the employee source told the agent that Manafort: used a Mac desktop computer in his home office; \"frequently stored\" historical and current records on \"external hard drives, thumb drives, and magnetic disks;\" \"made widespread use of electronic media in the course of his business activity;\" and had kept a \"drawer full of phones and electronic equipment\" at a prior residence. Aff. \u00b6 76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Based on the application and supporting affidavit, U.S. Magistrate Judge Theresa C. Buchanan approved the issuance of a search warrant on July 25, 2017. Warrant, Notice Att. at 1. The warrant authorized law enforcement agents to search defendant's Alexandria residence, including \"any locked drawers, containers, cabinets, safes, computers, electronic devices, and storage media (such as hard disks or other media that can store data) found therein.\" Warrant. Notice Att. at 12. Among other items, it authorized agents to seize:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1.

First, it was not necessary for the agent to allege that the electronic devices on the premises had themselves been\n   <em>\n    used\n   </em>\n   in the commission of the offense; while the warrant did call for the\n   <em>\n    seizure\n   </em>\n   of any that had,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Warrant \u00b6 2, Notice Att. at 14, it also authorized the\n   <em>\n    search\n   </em>\n   of electronic devices for relevant records that might be stored on them. Warrant, Notice Att. at 12. Thus, it was sufficient that the affidavit provided reason to believe that evidence related to the crimes listed in the warrant would be stored on the devices in the home.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Griffith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275602\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1265/\">\n    867 F.3d at 1273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (to justify the search for and seizure of a cell phone, \"police needed reason to think not only that [the defendant] possessed a phone, but also that the device would be located in the home and would contain\n   incriminating evidence about his suspected offense\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Second, once more,\n   <em>\n    Griffith\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable. In that case, the police were following leads in a year-old murder case. The D.C. Circuit invalidated the warrant because \"the affidavit failed to establish probable cause to believe that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   cell phone (or other electronic device) containing incriminating information about Griffith's suspected offense would be found in the apartment.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275602\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1265/\">\n    867 F.3d at 1279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original). The Court of Appeals noted the lack of any allegation in the affidavit that the defendant even possessed a cell phone, as well as the absence of any evidence that he was still in possession of the same cell phone he might have used at the time of the murder under investigation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275602\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1265/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275602\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1265/\">\n    at 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Also, Griffith had been incarcerated on other charges in the interim. The Court was therefore concerned that even if Griffith did own a phone at the time the agent applied for the warrant, there were no facts in the affidavit suggesting that it would still contain evidence from the year before, or, if he had obtained a new phone, that it would contain anything of value. And there were no facts tying phones belonging to any other occupant of the apartment to the offense at all.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275602\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1265/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275602\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1265/\">\n    at 1276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At bottom, the problem in\n   <em>\n    Griffith\n   </em>\n   was the failure to articulate any connection between the items to be seized and the crime that was being investigated; the Circuit based its ruling on the \"limited likelihood that any cell phone discovered in the apartment would contain incriminating evidence of Griffith's suspected crime.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275602\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1265/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275602\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/867/1265/\">\n    at 1275\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   That is hardly a problem in this case. The crimes for which probable cause was set forth in the affidavit relate to the conduct of an international business operation and international financial transactions, and they involve activities for which records are ordinarily generated and often retained on electronic media.

Def.'s Mot. at 3. But this does not negate the proposition that the agents were entitled to rely on the judgment and expertise of the federal Magistrate Judge who reviewed and signed the warrant. And, as explained above, the warrant\n   is sufficiently particularized, and the nature and number of criminal offenses under investigation justified a search for broad categories of business records which are often stored on computers and other devices, so it was not objectively unreasonable for the agents to rely upon the Magistrate Judge's decision to permit the search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Defendant again points the Court to the opinion of the D.C. Circuit in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

While Griffith, the individual under investigation, lived in an apartment leased by his girlfriend, \"the warrant did not stop with any devices owned by Griffith, which already would have gone too far. It broadly authorized seizure of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   cell phones and electronic devices, without regard to ownership.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1276 (emphasis in original). This compounded the problem the Court of Appeals had already identified, that \"the affidavit failed to establish probable cause to believe that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   cell phone (or other electronic device) containing incriminating information about [the defendant's] suspected offense would be found in the apartment.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1279 (emphasis in original);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1278 (\"[T]he affidavit sought, and the warrant granted, authorization to search for and seize every electronic device found in the home. The warrant's material overbreadth in that regard underscored the police's unawareness of the existence of any such devices in the first place (much less the existence of any belonging to Griffith) ....\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Thus, there is little in the opinion that bears on the case at hand. The claimed overbreadth here is not comparable since the warrant application did not ask for devices or files with no connection to Manafort or the financial transfers to him [redacted] that were the subject of FBI scrutiny. And unlike the affidavit that failed to aver that Griffith even had a cell phone, much less a cell phone that might still contain messages that had been exchanged about a murder a year before, the affidavit here supplied reason to believe that the business and banking records that were the object of the search had been seen and could still be found in the premises to be searched.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. The government's execution of the search warrant and retention of seized materials did not violate the Fourth Amendment.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, the defense argues that the agents who executed the search warrant exceeded its scope when they seized\n   or copied \"every electronic and media device in the Manafort Home,\" including an Apple iPod and other music devices and cameras and video cameras. Def.'s Mot. at 7. Defendant asserts that agents could not have reasonably believed these devices were \"used in the commission of the subject offenses.\" Def.'s Mot. at 6-7, quoting\n   <em>\n    Heldt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3688008,458531\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/668/1238/\">\n    668 F.2d at 1256, 1260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"the search itself must be conducted in a reasonable manner, appropriately limited to the scope and intensity called for by the warrant,\" requiring an officer to execute a search \"strictly within the bounds set by the warrant\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   But, as noted earlier, the warrant authorized the seizure of records stored on electronic devices related to the alleged offenses, not just devices used to commit the alleged crimes, Paragraph 2 of Attachment B - Items to be Seized - did call for \"[c]omputers or storage media used as a means to commit the Subject Offenses.\" Warrant \u00b6 2, Notice Att. at 14. But Paragraph 1 of Attachment B authorized a search for and the seizure of \"[r]ecords relating to\" the subject offenses, Warrant \u00b6 1, Notice Att. at 13, and the warrant defines \"records\" to include \"all forms of creation or storage, including any form of computer or electronic storage (such as hard disks or other media that can store data) ... and any photographic Form (such as ... videotapes, motion pictures, or photocopies).\" Warrant at 3, Notice Att. at 15. While devices such as an iPod Touch are primarily used to play music or videos,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. at 7, they are also \"storage media\" that can be used to store Files or photographs of important records.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Minn. May 13, 2011) (affidavit established probable cause to believe that an iPod was among the devices used to store and transmit information in a fraud and identity-theft scheme). Thus, agents did not exceed the scope of the warrant when they seized or copied iPods, cameras, or other electronic media that could be used to store materials related to the alleged offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Finally, Manafort complains in this motion that the government violated his Fourth Amendment rights by failing to return those materials seized that were not covered by the warrant, He told the Court, \"[t]o date, the government has not represented that the materials seized were subject to any process or procedure to insure the government only retained materials within the\n   <em>\n    scope\n   </em>\n   of the search warrant. The government has only represented that the materials have been subject to a\n   <em>\n    privilege\n   </em>\n   review.\" Def.'s Mot. at 7 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The government responded that it imaged as many of the devices and storage media as possible on site so that it would not have to take them all. Gov't Opp. at 19; Notice Att. at 7-9 (listing thirty-one items digitally imaged on the premises, including an Apple iMac, a Mac Book Air, and numerous flash drives). The agents then utilized an automated process to segregate categories of irrelevant and privileged information from what had been seized or imaged. Gov't Opp. at 19. Meanwhile, prosecutors communicated with the defense in November and December of 2017, explaining the review protocol and offering to discuss it with counsel:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   In particular, these materials are being processed to segregate out both privileged material (including, for example, those instances where Manafort is the sole privilege holder) and personal material that is irrelevant to the prosecution. If you would like to discuss in further\n   detail what these processes entail, please let us know.... The government also has obtained possession of other electronic devices (including computers), which ... are being processed and/or reviewed by a separate taint team of agents and prosecutors to ensure that the prosecution team is not provided with any privileged material.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Nov. 17 Letter at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   According to the government, the defendant did not ask to review the materials that had been sorted pursuant to the government's protocol; he did not suggest that the protocol was inadequate to segregate material that fell outside the scope of the warrant; and he did not ask the government to return any materials found to be outside the scope of the warrant. Gov't Opp. at 20. So, there seems to be little to defendant's contention that materials seized were not subject to the necessary review, and defendant has not pointed to circumstances that require suppression.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   This case does not present the sorts of problems identified in the cases cited in defendant's pleadings. In\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, the November correspondence reveals that the government was already in the process of reviewing seized materials within four months of executing the search warrant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 17 Letter at 3.

Here, the government took responsible steps to segregate privileged or irrelevant material and offered to provide more detail on its processes to defense counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Nov. 17 Letter at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   At the hearing, defense counsel also complained that the government had not yet returned any paper records it has found to be irrelevant, Tr. at 69, and neither side could state definitively whether electronic devices that are not needed have been returned.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 80. The defendant did not file a motion for return of property,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Crim. Proc. 41(g), but with respect to the retention of seized materials, the government will be ordered to return any paper records it has determined fall outside the warrant. Regarding electronic devices that were seized, in particular, devices such as iPods or cameras that are not used primarily to store records or to transmit communications, the Court will order the parties to confer and file a status report on whether there are any that can be returned that have not yet been delivered. As for imaged devices, they pose no constitutional problem. Courts have upheld the government's retention of images created during the execution of a search warrant given the need to authenticate exhibits at a later date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.
