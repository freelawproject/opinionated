According to plaintiffs, the Court should have waited either twenty days (under\n   <em>\n    Starnes\n   </em>\n   ) or fourteen days (in accordance with common practice in this district) to give them time to prepare and file their reconsideration motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court notes that the D.C.

After noting that the \"practice\" in this district was to wait ten days before carrying out a transfer order, the\n   <em>\n    Starnes\n   </em>\n   court concluded that \"special circumstances surrounding pro se prisoner petitions filed from afar suggest a somewhat longer period of time,\" and that the ordinary ten-day delay therefore \"might well be increased to 20 days\" in such cases.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 935.

Recons. Mot. at 5-8. For example, plaintiffs assert that unlike in\n    <em>\n     Alabama\n    </em>\n    , where the specific issue was the Corps's decision to reallocate water from Lake Lanier, plaintiffs here are concerned about the impact that the entire updated water management plan-which plaintiffs allege was created in violation of various environmental statutes-will have on ecosystems in Florida.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at 6 (\"An entire economy, culture and way of life is at stake for Floridians in the Apalachicola ecosystem.\");\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Pls.' Compl. at 55 (seeking, among other things, an \"injunction against implementation of the updated [plan] until the Corps properly evaluates the impact[ ] of its actions on the Apalachicola ecosystem\"). But the fact remains that both lawsuits challenge the same action by the same agency: the Corps's March 2017 update to its water management plan for the ACF River Basin. As a result, the bulk of the factors that supported the Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     Alabama\n    </em>\n    also apply here.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Alabama\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524682\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/304/56/#p69\">\n     304 F.Supp.3d at 63\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201542321\">\n     2018 WL 1542321\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *5 (explaining that the case most directly affects \"the residents of Georgia ...[,] Alabama[,] and other parts of the ACF Basin\" and that the challenged decision \"was made by personnel from the Corps' offices in Atlanta and Mobile\"). To the extent that plaintiffs' motion identifies other differences,\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Pls.' Recons. Mot. at 7 (arguing that unlike the State of Alabama, plaintiffs here did not seek to circumvent unfavorable Eleventh Circuit precedent), those differences are insufficient to justify the \"extraordinary\" measure of post-transfer review,\n    <em>\n     In re Sosa\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1878184,5710061\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/712/1479/\">\n     712 F.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    1480 n.1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
