In 2009, Plaintiffs Free Speech Coalition, Inc., the American Society of Media Photographers and individuals involved in the production of adult media, filed suit in this Court alleging that the Statutes and their implementing regulations violated the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments, and were unconstitutionally vague.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Only Plaintiffs' First Amendment challenge remains. Specifically, this Court must again decide, under new controlling precedents, whether the Statutes violate the First Amendment as-applied and/or are facially overbroad. Because the Third Circuit has ruled that the Statutes are content-based and therefore subject to strict scrutiny, this Court must decide, in evaluating the as-applied challenge, whether they are narrowly tailored to a compelling governmental interest. Also, the Court must decide whether the two organizational Plaintiffs, Free Speech Coalition and the American Society of Media Photographers, have standing to bring an as-applied challenge on behalf of their members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In light of the commercial nature of Plaintiffs' work, the Court found \"the fit between the Statutes' effect on Plaintiffs and its goal of combatting child pornography is reasonable because every Plaintiff that produces sexually explicit depictions uses a considerable number of youthful-looking performers and derives commercial revenue from these depictions, and the burden associated with record-keeping is a justifiable cost of doing business.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828931\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/957/564/#p571\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828931\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/957/564/#p571\">\n    at 591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    FSC II\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit had suggested two situations where the Statutes might be facially overbroad: their application to depiction of \"clearly mature adults\" and to \"private, noncommercial depictions created and viewed by adults in their homes.\"\n   <em>\n    FSC II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3871477\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/519/#p526\">\n    677 F.3d at 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This Court limited its discussion to those two scenarios, finding that Plaintiffs had not met their burden in either case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   First, it noted that Plaintiffs had not presented evidence of any genre of pornography limited to clearly mature adults, in contrast to the \"vast\" legitimate sweep of the Statutes-over one-third of porn on the Internet, one Government expert testified, was teen porn.\n   <em>\n    FSC III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828931\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/957/564/#p571\">\n    957 F.Supp.2d at 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the basis of the evidence showing a substantial appetite for pornographic depictions of youthful individuals, the Court found that \"the Statutes' prophylactic nature [was] justified because even though they may reach depictions of mature adults, any more targeted record-keeping requirement, i.e., a record-keeping requirement applying only to individuals who appear to be age 25 or younger, would introduce subjectivity, uncertainty and immeasurable enforcement difficulties into the regulatory scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828931\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/957/564/#p571\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828931\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/957/564/#p571\">\n    at 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court considered the question of the Statutes' application to private communications to be a closer issue, but ultimately ruled for the Government because Plaintiffs had failed to show that there existed \"a substantial amount of private communications that even fall under the Statutes' scope\" or \"actual burden or chilling of such communications caused by the Statutes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828931\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/957/564/#p571\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828931\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/957/564/#p571\">\n    at 596\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FSC IV\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    : Second but Now-Vacated Decision of the Third Circuit (2015)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <em>\n    1.

The Government submitted three declarations, summarized below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The cross-motions for judgment are now ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Plaintiffs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Plaintiffs stress the demanding standard of strict scrutiny, and argue that the Government has not met its burden of showing that the Statutes are narrowly tailored to a compelling governmental interest. Specifically, argue that under\n   <em>\n    United States v.

(Pls.' Br. at 5-14, ECF 246; Pls.' Supp. Br at 3-4, ECF 266).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Plaintiffs next argue that the Government has failed to meet its burden of showing that the Statutes are the least restrictive means to protect children from child pornography among effective alternatives. (Pls.' Br. at 14-28, ECF 246; Pls.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Supp. Br at 3-4, ECF 266.) Plaintiffs advance seven alternatives to the Statutes that they assert are less restrictive and equally effective, such that the Statutes are not narrowly tailored:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n   1) Criminal laws prohibiting and punishing child pornography\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n   2) Self-certification of compliance, as provided by 18 U.S.C. 2257A(h)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n   3) \"Industry standards\" and intellectual property laws\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n   4) An age-verification law limited to persons who might reasonably appear to be underage\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   5) A law limited to commercial productions\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n   6) A law limited to \"primary\" producers of sexual expression\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n   7) A recordkeeping law enforced only by administrative sanction (Pls.' Br. at 16-28; Pls.' Supp. Br at 5-18.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Plaintiffs then argue, briefly, that the Statutes are unconstitutionally overbroad because the Statutes would conceivably apply, regardless of the age of the individuals depicted, to private expression between consenting partners, \"artistic expression, educational expression, political expression, journalistic expression.\" (Pls.' Br. at 29.) Finally, Plaintiffs assert that they have organizational standing to challenge the Statutes on behalf of their members under Third Circuit precedent, particularly because organizations had successfully litigated First Amendment challenges in the past, as in\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   In their supplemental brief, Plaintiffs reiterate their earlier arguments regarding the need for the Government to demonstrate an \"actual problem\" necessitating the enactment of the Statutes, point out the lack of evidence that any Plaintiff used minors in creating sexually explicit expression, assert that the Government has \"failed to produce evidence\" that any of the proposed alternatives would be less effective than the Statutes, and argue that this Court should evaluate Plaintiffs' facial challenge under strict scrutiny because it was remanded by the Third Circuit. (Pls.' Supp. Br. at 3-18.) Plaintiffs object, in particular, to the Government's proposed limitation of the Statutes to Plaintiffs' depictions of mature adults over 30 as an improper judicial rewrite of the Statute under\n   <em>\n    United States v. Stevens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582194,12448252\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/460/\">\n    559 U.S. 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582194,12448252\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/460/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1577\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3582194,12448252\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/460/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). Finally, Plaintiffs object to the affidavits submitted by Government, and request that such testimony be taken in open court. (Pls.' Supp. Br. at 18-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   <em>\n    2. Government\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   The Government first argues that the organizational plaintiffs lack standing to bring an as-applied (as opposed to facial) challenge on behalf of their members because, as the panel had held in the now-vacated\n   <em>\n    FSC IV\n   </em>\n   , \"the as-applied narrow tailoring inquiry requires an examination of whether an individual producer's speech was unnecessarily burdened,\" which would make Free Speech Coalition and the American Society of Media Photographers improper plaintiffs because of their heterogeneous membership. (Gov't's Br. at 5-8, ECF 249.) The Government also distinguishes\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   as facial challenges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   The Government next argues that the Third Circuit remanded only the issue of whether the Statutes were narrowly tailored, and that this Court should decline to revisit whether preventing or combating child pornography is a compelling governmental interest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   The Government devotes the bulk of its brief to refuting the alternatives to the Statutes provided by Plaintiffs. Citing\n   <em>\n    Burson v.

Florida Bar\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588820\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1656/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 1656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12588820\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1656/\">\n    191 L.Ed.2d 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), which concerned a state law creating a 100-foot \"campaign-free zone\" around polling places and a prohibition on personal campaign solicitations by judicial candidates, respectively, the Government argues that Statutes may be upheld under strict scrutiny based on \"precedent, common sense, and...legislative history\" if they are \"narrowly\" but not \"perfectly\" tailored. (Gov't's Br. at 2, 16-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   The Government, which considers the Statutes to impose only minimally burdensome requirements, next attempts to demonstrate that each of the seven proposals advanced by Plaintiffs would be either less effective, or not less restrictive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-33.) For example, the Government argues that an age restriction limiting the application of the Statutes to performers under 30 would not be less restrictive as applied to Plaintiffs, all of whom had testified that they had all used youthful-looking individuals in their work, and no Plaintiff had testified at trial that having an age cutoff was a desirable alternative. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-24.) With respect to relying criminal prosecutions alone, the Government argues that most prosecutions are for images of very young children, and it is hard to get a conviction for images of older children; for these children, including those in the age range of confusion, the Statutes therefore serve as a deterrent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Finally, the Government asks the Court not to reach Plaintiffs' facial overbreadth challenge if it finds the Statutes invalid as applied to Plaintiffs, but if the Court chooses to address the issue, it should find that Plaintiffs have not met their burden of showing that the Statutes are substantially overbroad, as the Third Circuit had found in\n   <em>\n    FSC IV\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   In its supplemental brief, the Government begins with the premise that Plaintiffs' proposed alternatives to the Statutes should be considered \"in light of the reality of ubiquitous, readily-accessible child pornography on the Internet, and finite law enforcement resources.\" (Pls.' Supp. Br. at 4, ECF 265.) The Government cites prior opinions in this case, statistics regarding the millions of pornographic images of children on the Internet, and affidavits it attached to its supplemental brief from a vice-president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and an FBI agent, to argue that \"[t]he Statutes are unquestionably more effective than doing away with any enforceable age verification requirement whatsoever.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The Government next argues that Plaintiffs' proposed alternatives would be less effective than the age verification, labeling, and recordkeeping scheme created by the Statutes, various \"interrelated\" provisions of which, it asserts, work together. The Government does not refute each of Plaintiffs' proposed alternatives to the Statutes, instead discussing at length why only one of the alternatives, exempting secondary producers of actual or simulated sexually explicit conduct, would be less effective than the Statutes. Limiting the Statutes to primary producers, the Government argues, would fail to effectuate a \"crucial purpose\" of the Statutes-namely \"creating a regime whereby law enforcement, secondary producers, and others can easily find the age verification records associated with a particular film or photograph once it leaves the hands of its original creator,\" which the record evidence indicated occurred frequently. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Finally, while the Government makes clear its position, expressed in its pre-argument briefing, that the Statutes should be upheld in full, it argues, in the alternative, that this Court might invalidate the Statutes, or applications thereof,\n   only in part. Specifically, if the Court deems \"partial invalidation\" appropriate, the Government requests that the Statutes be invalidated \"only as applied to Plaintiffs' depictions containing no individuals under age 30.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) The Government argues that partial invalidation of the Statutes is warranted under various cases including\n   <em>\n    Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6000164\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/320/\">\n    546 U.S. 320\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6000164\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/320/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6000164\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/320/\">\n    163 L.Ed.2d 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006),\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In particular, the Government argues invalidating the Statutes as to Plaintiffs' depictions of clearly mature adults would satisfy the three-part test for what it terms \"partial invalidation\" set forth in\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Government's Supplemental Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   As encouraged by the Court, the Government attached several declarations to its final brief, to supply additional factual material in line with the implicit requirement of the Third Circuit that in order to sustain its new burden of proving narrow tailoring, and this Court's new requirement of applying strict scrutiny, the factual record should be supplemented. The Government filed three declarations as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   <em>\n    1. Declaration of John Shehan\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Shehan is Vice President of the Exploited Children Division of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), a non-profit \"created to help find missing children, reduce sexual exploitation, and prevent child victimization.\" (Shehan Decl. \u00b6 2, ECF 265-2.) Shehan describes NCMEC's CyberTipline, which for the past two decades has allowed the public and electronic service providers to provide secure tips and leads about child sexual exploitation, including child pornography. (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 3-4.) NCMEC refers tips to law enforcement both in the United States and internationally. (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.) Shehan describes a \"tremendous increase\" in reports to the CyberTipline in recent years; the number of reports designated by the submitting party as being related to child pornography rose from 506,611 in fiscal year 2013 to 9,864,767 in fiscal year 2017, although only a fraction of these reports are \"resolved to a U.S domestic location.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13.) NCMEC also works with the \"Internet industry\" by \"notifying ESPs when NCMEC receives information concerning active, publicly-viewable web pages depicting apparent child pornography on their site.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) NCMEC provided 21,499 notifications of apparent child pornography on publicly viewable URLs in 2014; 45,923 in 2015; 45,243 in 2016; and 56,565 in 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   <em>\n    2. Declaration of Jackie Dougher\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Dougher is a Supervisory Special Agent in the Violent Crimes Against Children Section at the FBI, and the FBI liaison to NCMEC. (Dougher Decl. \u00b6 1, ECF 265-3.) Through her work, Dougher reviews reports from the NCMEC CyberTipline, the \"vast majority\" of which \"concern suspected child pornography.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2.) Dougher asserts that child pornography can be found \"on a wide variety of platforms on the open internet,\" and the images she sees from CyberTips \"involve children of any age, from very young children to older individuals where it may be difficult to determine whether they are minors or adults.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.) Although she considers law enforcement to have made investigations of child pornography a priority, child pornography has not been eliminated, and due to the volume of available child pornography on the Internet, \"the FBI must prioritize its investigations and is less likely to investigate cases involving images\n   where it is difficult to determine if the person in the image is a child or an adult.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <em>\n    3. Declaration of Janine Johansen\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Johansen, a Department of Justice paralegal, conducted Google searches for \"2257 compliance software\" and \"2257 compliance tools\" at the behest of Kathryn Wyer, an attorney for the Government in this litigation. (Johansen Decl., ECF 265-4). She lists the URLs for five websites advertising web-based applications, recordkeeping services, and record management software for \u00a7 2257 recordkeeping, as well as the pricing for various subscription levels, if available. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3-7.) One subscription package available through\n   <em>\n    http://www.my2257.com\n   </em>\n   , for example, gives FSC members a $300 discount off the $2995 one-time licensing fee for the large organization package. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 5.) Johansen says nothing about the quality or reliability of these products or services, and does not specify whether she downloaded the software, or attempted to use it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Attached to the last of these declarations is a voluminous report entitled \"The National Strategy for Child Exploitation Prevention and Interdiction,\" a Department of Justice report to Congress dated as of April 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The task, for this Court, is to \"compare 'the amount of speech that implicates the government's interest in protecting children' with 'the amount of speech that is burdened but does not further the government's interest' in an effort to 'weigh the legitimate versus problematic applications of the Statutes.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3871477\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/519/#p526\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    FSC II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3871477\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/519/#p526\">\n    677 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   538 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   First, the number of valid applications of the Statute remains large, particularly in regards to the vast universe of child pornography. Child pornography, despite carrying drastic criminal penalties, continues to flourish. According to the affidavits submitted by the Government, a vast universe of child pornography exists on the Internet, subjecting children to brutality and sadism in the course of those images' creation. The Government has submitted extensive findings of fact, numbers 62-75, in an attachment to its Supplemental Brief (ECF 265-1) which the Court, without repeating verbatim, finds to accurately and appropriately state the dangers of child\n   pornography. As long as the demand for child pornography continues in the United States, the Court cannot overlook the significance of the Congressional interests in enacting the Statutes, the high number of child pornography prosecutions, and the need for judicial decision making to respect these factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Moreover, the third and fourth factors for substantial overbreadth analysis-the nature of the activity to be regulated and the nature of the state interest underlying the regulation-continue to militate in favor of maintaining the Statutes' validity. The Third Circuit in\n   <em>\n    FSC IV\n   </em>\n   identified the state interest in the Statutes as \"protecting children from sexual exploitation by pornographers.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229250\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/142/#p153\">\n    787 F.3d at 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This is a state interest of the highest order. By enacting strict prohibitions on child pornography, and setting a clear boundary line at age 18, Congress addressed what it saw as a need to protect children under 18 from being sexually exploited by pornographers, and this must be respected. Read in the context of laws criminalizing child pornography, the Statutes make clear to producers and consumers that the activity to be regulated is adult pornography-and the Statutes' purpose is to keep adult pornography limited to adults. This, too, counsels in favor of upholding the Statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Even after being invited by this Court to supplement the record on remand (which they did not), Plaintiffs simply have not shown that the impermissible applications of the Statutes to private, non-commercial depictions of sexual conduct and to depictions of clearly mature adults outweigh the legitimate applications of the Statutes so as to render the Statutes substantially overbroad. The Third Circuit's prior approval, summarized above, is still controlling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   The Court finds that Plaintiffs have not met their burden of showing that the Statutes are substantially overbroad. Thus, the Court rejects Plaintiffs' claim that existing precedent warrants striking down the challenged Statutes,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202257\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2257A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.

Because it had already been settled in the litigation that protecting children was a compelling governmental interest, the court began by addressing the issue of whether COPA was narrowly tailored to the compelling interest of protecting children.

Thus, a statute covering only commercial producers might be less restrictive as to potential plaintiffs not currently before this Court, but would not be less restrictive as to Plaintiffs.

As the Government notes, the identification, age-verification, record-keeping, and labeling requirements together create a statutory scheme whereby an interested party who sees the label on a sexually explicit work can learn the location of the records, and find the records of the performer's identity and date of birth.

As to primary producers of adult pornography, the Court does not see the act of securing age verification, in and of itself, as particularly burdensome. It is customary in the United States for individuals to produce photo\n   identification when entering airports and/or airplanes, public and private buildings, etc. Drivers' licenses, or ID cards for people who do not drive, contain a photograph and date of birth and are commonly required for identification in many instances, such as when a \"youthful-looking\" person wants to purchase an alcoholic drink, or buy alcohol itself, in a state requiring a minimum age of 21 for this purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   <em>\n    2.

However, as the Court previously found, some Plaintiffs, including Barbara Alper, admitted that they want to, and would in the absence of the Statutes, undertake projects without checking IDs for any performers because they wish to create sexually explicit images of anonymous individuals.\n   <em>\n    FSC III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828931\" index=\"278\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/957/564/#p571\">\n    957 F.Supp.2d at 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   In its post-trial opinion, the Court found that \"every Plaintiff-producer who testified admitted he or she has used models ages 18-24 years old...[D]espite Plaintiffs' professed interest in not employing women or men aged 17 or younger, the evidence is irrefutable that Plaintiffs are interested in using youthful-looking performers.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828931\" index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/957/564/#p571\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828931\" index=\"279\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/957/564/#p571\">\n    at 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-271\">\n   For example, Sinclair Institute admitted that 10% of the models in its videos are ages 18 to 20 (Def. Ex. 132 at 7); David Steinberg admitted that 12% of the models in his works are ages 18-24 (Audio File 6/4/13 P.M.); Marie Levine admitted she has used models ages 21-25 in her web-shows and that her website offers access to third-party sites, with which she revenue-sharing arrangements, that show young-looking models (Audio File 6/5/13 A.M.); and Barbara Nitke admitted 8 out of 20 models in her works between 2005 and 2009 were under age 25 (Def. Ex 97). According to Defendant's analysis of Plaintiffs' depictions, which is part of the record in this case, between 21% and 61% of the performers in a cross-section of depictions by seven Plaintiffs (Dodson and Ross, Levine, Levingston, photographer Craig Morey (a member of ASMP), Nitke, Sinclair, and Vivid Video (a member of FSC) ) were under the age of 25.

At the same time, a substantial percentage of Plaintiffs' work depicts older individuals. In its vacated decision in\n   <em>\n    FSC IV\n   </em>\n   , the Third Circuit calculated that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-274\">\n   of the models employed by Dodson and Ross, 45% of them are under 30 years of age. Levine's under-30 models account for 40.3%. Similarly, 47.37% of Nitke's models are under 30. Levingston's number 60%. And 33.97% of the Sinclair Institute's models were under 30. Finally, based on self-reported figures, 24% of Steinberg's models were under 30 while the \"vast majority\" of participants in Carol Queen's live-streamed masturbation fundraiser were in their 30s and 40s along with \"10 to 12 percent\" under age 25.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-275\">\n   <em>\n    Undoubtedly, these figures demonstrate that the number of performers to whom\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    the Statutes apply, yet for whom requiring identification does not protect children, is not insignificant.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229250\" index=\"281\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/142/#p153\">\n    787 F.3d at 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding, under intermediate scrutiny, that the testimony of the Government's expert \"supports a finding that requiring identification for performers up to age 30 implicates the Government's interest in protecting children\" and \"the evidence indeed demonstrates that a significant proportion of Plaintiffs' work falls squarely within the Statutes' permissible scope\") (emphasis added). To take\n   <em>\n    FSC IV\n   </em>\n   's analysis one step further, the opposite percentages from those it quoted-i.e., the percentage of performers over 25 or 30-are also substantial. For example, for Levingston, it is 40%; for the Sinclair Institute, nearly 66%. Both this Court and the Third Circuit found that this was an acceptable balance to strike under intermediate scrutiny. The question now before this Court, in considering Plaintiffs' as-applied challenge under strict scrutiny, is whether that conclusion continues to hold true under a more stringent level of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   Put differently, the question for this Court is whether a universal identification and age verification requirement is narrowly tailored as applied to Plaintiffs, producers who depict a substantial number of youthful-looking performers and a substantial number of performers who are much older. Although the Court is wary of reducing strict scrutiny analysis to a simple numerical endeavor, it is clear that many performers depicted in Plaintiffs' work are subject to the identification and age-verification requirements where, as\n   <em>\n    FSC IV\n   </em>\n   put it, \"for whom requiring identification does not protect children.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229250\" index=\"282\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/142/#p153\">\n    787 F.3d at 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This remains true of Plaintiffs' expression is a relevant consideration for the Court's as-applied analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   Although the Court concludes providing identification and age verification is not burdensome, it is somewhat overinclusive as applied to Plaintiffs, who must check identification and age verification for a large proportion of their performers who are old enough not to be mistaken for minors.

This Court previously found that two of Plaintiffs' projects, Dodson and Ross's \"genital art gallery\" and Alpers' depictions of anonymous sex on Fire Island were \"effectively shut down\" by the Statutes.\n   <em>\n    FSC III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828931\" index=\"291\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/957/564/#p571\">\n    957 F.Supp.2d at 585\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Government nonetheless makes a valid point in noting that many adult pornography photos and videos do not show the faces of the performers. In a number of these depictions, which exist in this record, the image (such as the photos in the \"genital\n   art gallery\") only shows parts of the female or male anatomy, such as genitalia, and there is no way of knowing from the images themselves, the age of the performer, or whether the performer is \"youthful looking\" or clearly mature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-280\">\n   The record reveals that virtually all producers require their performers to sign a release, authorizing the use of the work produced to be distributed commercially and setting forth any royalties, fees, etc. This release document is obviously intended to be legally binding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   In their initial post-remand brief, Plaintiffs mention, in passing, the possibility of relying on the fact that minors cannot enter legally binding contracts or license their image, a proposal they essentially abandon in their supplemental brief. (Pls.' Br. at 22-24.) Plaintiffs explain that if a minor signed a release to disseminate the image of the minor, it would be voidable because minors cannot contract; thus, producers have to check verify a performer's age to ensure that the release is legally binding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   However, Congress' overriding intent to protect minors prevents the Court from finding this overinclusive, and requires a conclusion that the Statutes are, as to age verification, narrowly tailored. Preventing minors from acting as performers in pornographic productions is a more important social goal than burdening producers with age verification requirements, and this requires that the age of all performers be verified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   For these reasons, the Court finds that the universal age verification and identification requirement is narrowly tailored to the Government's compelling interest in protecting children from participating in pornography as applied to Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   <em>\n    3. As applied to Plaintiffs, the identification and age-verification requirements are the least restrictive means of advancing the Government's interest in protecting children from child pornography\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   a. A statutory scheme, including identification and age-verification requirements, applying only to individuals over a specific age\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   The obvious implication of the narrow tailoring analysis conducted above is the alternative that has formed a principal focus of the parties' debate on remand: a statutory scheme applying only to individuals over 30. For the reasons discussed above, the Court finds that this would be less restrictive as applied to Plaintiffs, particularly insofar as Plaintiffs' speech involved individuals over 25 or 30. The Court is sympathetic to the Government's argument that requiring producers to assess whether a performer looked to be over 30 before asking for identification would introduce unnecessary and potentially harmful subjectivity into the age verification scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   Under federal (and also state) laws, child pornography criminal statutes apply to depictions of any person under the age of 18. Thus, the Plaintiffs have shown that adult pornography producers uniformly insist that their performers prove that they are at least 18 years old. Otherwise, the producers could be liable for producing child pornography with severe criminal penalties. Although the Statutes do not specify an age, the existence of a child pornography demarcation line at age 18 is significant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   Because the child pornography laws\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   draw a \"strict demarcation line\" at age 18,\n   the Statutes make clear to producers of adult pornography, and others, including consumers, that as long as the performers are over 18 years of age, there are no statutory prohibitions on employing them for adult pornography. This strict dividing line does not allow for any confusion that would render the Statutes not narrowly tailored as applied to Plaintiffs. By Congress adopting this strict borderline, there is no ambiguity, persons under 18 may not perform in adult pornography. This fact is legally significant. Congress perceived the need to protect children (under 18) from being performers, and, and this must be respected and upheld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   b. Relying on criminal laws punishing child pornography\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   Plaintiffs first argue that identification and age-verification pursuant to the Statutes is not necessary because child pornography is already a federal crime, and a sufficient deterrent to employing minors in adult entertainment. They further note that there was no evidence at trial that any Plaintiff employed minors in their work. Plaintiffs frequently note the fact that there are basically virtually no prosecutions for employing minors in adult pornography, citing to a 2016 Department of Justice report, which they attached to their initial post-remand brief, showing only three prosecutions for record-keeping violations of \u00a7 2257 and none for violations of \u00a7 2257A in fiscal years 2011 through 2015. (DOJ Report, ECF 246-1.) Plaintiffs argue the lack of prosecutions as evidence that minors are not used in pornography and the Statutes simply impose needless, onerous burdens. The Plaintiffs' comparison of the frequency of child pornography prosecutions to the paucity of prosecutions for violations of \u00a7\u00a7 2257 and 2257A does not necessarily prove any relation-except that many people are willing to watch and trade in child pornography despite the heavy criminal penalties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   There is another inference that may be drawn from the DOJ Report: the Statutes are having a deterrent effect. Indeed, in the criminal jurisprudence area, deterrence is an important factor in every judge's sentencing decision. But, stiff penalties have failed to deter many persons from committing crimes. However, perhaps crime would be much worse if the penalties were not so severe. There is evidence that Congress and many citizens believe tough penalties deter criminal conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   The Government's supplemental affidavits showed that child pornography is a growing problem; Dougher, the FBI agent, attested to the fact that \"the FBI must prioritize its investigations and is less likely to investigate cases involving images where it is difficult to determine if the person in the image is a child or an adult.\" (Dougher Decl. \u00b6 4.) Even if the FBI were to pursue a particular investigation, cases have established that can be difficult to prosecute child pornography violations for older children.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Malloy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3656059\" index=\"292\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/568/166/#p176\">\n    568 F.3d 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 176 (4th Cir. 2009) (\"because the children depicted in child pornography frequently cannot be found, the prosecutor must show that the subject is a minor solely from...pictures. Consequently, most prosecutions for child pornography involve a subject that is not simply 'youthful-looking' but unmistakably a child\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   The Government's supplemental evidence demonstrates child pornography as a significant law enforcement problem. The Government has shown that the sexual exploitation of children is a pressing, growing problem. However, its burden as to Plaintiffs' as-applied challenge, was to show that, as applied to Plaintiffs' speech, relying on criminal laws is equally effective and less restrictive. The record requires the Court to conclude that the Government\n   has met its burden of doing so. As long as Plaintiffs, and other producers, verify their performers are over 18, they have no risk of criminal prosecution. The Statutes are effective in protecting children under 18 from being used as pornographic performers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   The Court finds that the identification and age-verification requirements do satisfy strict scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Review of statutory and regulatory provisions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   Section 2257 is entitled \"Record keeping requirements,\" yet the identification and age-verification requirements are arguably closer to the core of the Statutes' protection of children from sexual exploitation. Because the burdens imposed by the Statutes' record-keeping requirements were such a central focus of the trial, it is necessary to address this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   The Statutes require producers of depictions of actual or simulated sexually explicit conduct to \"create and maintain individually identifiable records pertaining to every performer portrayed in such a visual depiction,\" to be maintained at the producer's business premises.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202257\">\n    18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (c) ; 2257A(a), (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   The Regulations contain many additional requirements for record-keeping. For example, the Regulations require-as the Statutes do not-that \u00a7\u00a7 2257 and 2257A records must be segregated from other records,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2075.2\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e), and \"[r]ecords required to be maintained under this part shall be categorized alphabetically, or numerically where appropriate,\" and categorized both by name and work.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"295\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2075.3\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other respects, the Regulations lessen the burdens of \u00a7\u00a7 2257 and 2257A, such as through time limits not mentioned in the Statutes: records must be maintained at the producer's place of business \"for seven years from the date of creation or last amendment or addition\" or for five years if the producer goes out of business.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"296\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2075.4\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 75.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(Gov't's Findings of Fact, ECF 265-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   In a general sense, eliminating the statutory record-keeping requirements altogether does not make the age verification scheme less effective in combatting child sexual exploitation. Although the Statutory recordkeeping requirements help ensure that producers not only secure, but also maintain age verification records for the performers appearing in their sexually explicit films and photographs, it creates significant extra burden. Most producers of adult pornography have agreed voluntarily to keep age documentation records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Instead, most of the burden Plaintiffs face under the Statutes is due to the procedures they must put in place to store, organize, and make available records for performers generally. These startup costs associated with creating a recordkeeping system under the Statutes, including the costs of creating indexes, advance the Government's interests in preventing the sexual exploitation of children. Collecting additional identification for the clearly mature performers that each Plaintiff also employs and inserting them into this system does not impose a significant additional burden. For example, Plaintiffs are not required to create a separate electronic database for clearly mature adults. Instead, any clearly mature performers would be just one more data point in a preexisting recordkeeping scheme.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-307\">\n   <em>\n    FSC IV\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4229250\" index=\"300\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/787/142/#p153\">\n    787 F.3d at 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Plaintiffs incur these burdens with respect to the substantial proportion of their performers who are clearly adults, and thus maintaining these records does not actually serve to protect children. The universal record-keeping requirement, as applied to Plaintiffs, is overinclusive, and therefore not narrowly tailored to the Government's interest in protecting children from sexual exploitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-309\">\n   a. Application to the Regulations\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-310\">\n   Moreover, the Court finds that the Regulations impose many burdensome obligations, including obligations that go beyond the requirements of the Statutes.

Courts regularly declare both statutes and their regulations unconstitutional simultaneously.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Conchatta Inc. v.

Plaintiffs' self-policing alternatives\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   Plaintiffs offer various self-policing alternatives to the Statutes: self-certification through \u00a7 2257A(h) ; the self-certification form it developed in the course of the proceedings after remand (ECF 265-2; 265-3), and relying on producers to verify age in order to ensure that contracts to reproduce an individual's image are legally binding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-315\">\n   b. Self-certification under \u00a7 2257A(h)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-316\">\n   The self-certification alternative offered by Plaintiffs is the so-called 2257A(h) exception. Section 2257A(h) states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-317\">\n   (h)(1) The provisions of this section and section 2257 shall not apply to matter, or any image therein, containing one or more visual depictions of simulated sexually explicit conduct, or actual sexually explicit conduct as described in clause (v) of section 2256(2)(A), if such matter-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-318\">\n   (A)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-319\">\n   (i) is intended for commercial distribution;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-320\">\n   (ii) is created as a part of a commercial enterprise by a person who certifies to the Attorney General that such person regularly and in the normal course of business collects and maintains individually identifiable information regarding all performers, including minor performers, employed by that person, pursuant to Federal and State tax, labor, and other laws, labor agreements, or otherwise pursuant to industry standards, where such information includes the name, address, and date of birth of the performer; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-321\">\n   (iii) is not produced, marketed or made available by the person described in clause (ii) to another in circumstances such than [sic] an ordinary person would conclude that the matter contains a visual depiction that is child pornography as defined in section 2256(8)...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-322\">\n   (2) Nothing in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) shall be construed to exempt any matter that contains any visual depiction that is child pornography, as defined in section 2256(8),\n   <em>\n    or is actual sexually explicit conduct within the definitions in clauses (i) through (iv) of section 2256(2)(A)\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-323\">\n   18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2257A(h) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-324\">\n   The plain language of 2257A(h) makes clear its limited scope. Among other things, depictions of actual sexually explicit conduct (excluding \"lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area\")-which would encompass much of Plaintiffs' speech-are not eligible for this exemption. It would therefore not be an equally effective alternative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-325\">\n   c. FSC's \"self-certification\" form\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-326\">\n   At the suggestion of the Court during post-remand proceedings, Plaintiff Free Speech Coalition developed a self-certification form intended to formalize the \"industry standards\" referred to in \u00a7 2257A(h)(A)(ii). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 259-3.) The form is accompanied by a memorandum explaining the use of the form and stating, as policy binding on all members of Plaintiff Free Speech Coalition, that \"[i]f any potential performer does not produce a valid photo identification document verifying that the person is an adult, the initial producer shall not produce, record, or transmit any image of that person in any work or production containing visual depictions of\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    simulated sexually explicit conduct\n   </em>\n   .\" (FSC Memo, ECF 259-2.) The inclusion of actual sexually explicit conduct in the policy thus extends the self-certification\n   outside what is allowed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2257A(h)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-327\">\n   It is also entirely unclear to whom \"compliance\" is being certified under this supposed self-certification regime. The form itself contains fields to be filled out by the performer, including name and date of birth, and fields for the \"initial producer\" to attest that he has checked an identification, and to specify the type of identification document (e.g. driver's license or passport). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 259-3.) The form further states, in small print, that it \"must be filled out for each performer for each adult production and kept for seven years\n   <em>\n    in confidence\n   </em>\n   .\" (ECF 259-3; emphasis added.) While the form states on the second page that the initial producer is responsible for \"[m]aking sure that the signed release, this form, and the copy of the identification document are forwarded to the person or company responsible for the production.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-328\">\n   It is also unclear what is meant by \"in confidence,\" a term not used in the Statutes or Regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-329\">\n   The Court finds that the proposed self-certification form would be an equally effective alternative for recordkeeping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-330\">\n   d. Relying on the fact that minors cannot enter binding contracts is a less restrictive, equally effective alternative to record-maintaining rule\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-331\">\n   Most of the testimony on this point was from representatives of the organizational Plaintiffs and concerned purportedly general \"industry\" practices.\n   <em>\n    FSC III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3828931\" index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/957/564/#p571\">\n    957 F.Supp.2d at 572, 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court finds this is an important factor in finding that the labeling requirement is narrowly tailored. However, the Statute itself only requires labeling, in general, but then provides for the Attorney General to devise regulations for the form and nature of the label.

However, such employment would violate child pornography laws.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the conduct it forbids includes violating record-keeping and labeling requirements, for making false statements, and for selling or transferring explicit works without the required labels.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"312\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202257\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-344\">\n   Like Section 2257, Section 2257A imposes criminal penalties for record-keeping and labeling violations, for making false statements, and for selling or transferring explicit works without the required labels.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2257A(f). First-time Section 2257A violations are punishable by imprisonment of up to one year, or up to five years for offenses involving minors. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2257A(i)(1)-(2). Subsequent offenses involving minors are punishable by two to ten years' imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"313\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202257\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 2257A(i)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-345\">\n   <em>\n    2. Except for the required age verification, criminal penalties are not narrowly tailored or the least restrictive alternative as applied to Plaintiffs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-346\">\n   Plaintiffs contend the punishments contained in the statute are unduly harsh-one could receive five years in prison for a simple record-keeping or labeling violation. Moreover, the acts rendered unlawful do not precisely address the problem for which the Statutes were ostensibly enacted, the protection of minors from being used in child pornography. Because Section 2257 mandates prison time for record-keeping and labeling violations regardless of the age of the performers-without imposing its requirements on, or addressing its penalties to, minors-the only way that the Statutes address child pornography is if they have deterrent effect on individuals considering engaging in child pornography. As noted above, it is possible that the small number of prosecutions is evidence of some deterrent effect. By explicitly imposing penalties on violations involving adults (regardless of age) separate from those it imposes for violations involving minors,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2257A(i), Section 2257A essentially acknowledges that it is overinclusive by design.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-347\">\n   Thus, a criminal law that is not actually targeted to child pornography and punishes record-keeping and labeling violations with several years' imprisonment is obviously unduly harsh and is not narrowly tailored.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-348\">\n   <em>\n    3. A statute allowing criminal punishment for record-keeping and labeling violations is not the least restrictive means of protecting minors from child pornography\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-349\">\n   Plaintiffs assert the criminal penalties are not the least restrictive means of achieving the Government's compelling interest, and that a punishment for record-keeping violations by administrative sanction would be equally effective and less restrictive. Plaintiffs offer the example of a subsection of federal immigration law, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(e)(5), which imposes civil monetary penalties for \"paperwork violations\" on employers for failing to make or keep records that an individual is legally authorized to work in the United States. The Court finds this alternative eminently reasonable. A punishment by administrative sanction would be equally effective, and less restrictive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-350\">\n   The Court repeats, that the laws punishing child pornography are not affected by this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-351\">\n   <strong>\n    IX. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-352\">\n   The above discussion of the litigation history, contentions, and this Court's analysis of these issues has led to several conclusions that certain sections of the Statutes are unconstitutional as applied to Plaintiffs. Other parts remain intact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-353\">\n   The Third Circuit did exactly this in its last ruling when it invalidated a portion of \u00a7 2257(c). The Circuit Court did not strike the requirement that a person who is subject to \u00a7 2257(a)\"shall maintain the records required by this section at his business premises\" but struck the remainder of the Statute giving the Attorney General more power to prescribe regulations as to what other places could house those records and, more importantly, that the records must be \"available to the Attorney General for inspection at all times.\" In striking this latter language, the Third Circuit was relying on a Supreme Court case,\n   <em>\n    City of Los Angeles v. Patel\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590955\" index=\"314\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2443/\">\n    135 S.Ct. 2443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590955\" index=\"315\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2443/\">\n    192 L.Ed.2d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), which appears to be a valid approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-354\">\n   The Court has labored in trying to be fair, yet follow the dictates of the controlling precedents. The parties may conclude that coming to a joint agreement, even\n   though neither side is getting everything it asks for, is superior to further appeals and possible further remands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-355\">\n   The Court has purposely not attempted to finalize the exact parameters of this relief, in specific language.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-356\">\n   The Court will require counsel to consider these rulings and propose a decree with precise language to carry out the Court's decision. Even if the parties cannot agree totally on all issues, the Court requests that they attempt to agree on the language the Court should use in its final judgment. If the parties cannot agree, then the Court will require each party to submit their own draft and the Court will make a final decision on the final decree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-357\">\n   In the event the parties cannot agree, within 14 days (which time will be extended upon request if discussions warrant), the Court will expect each side to propose its own decree with specific language as to statutory sections that are or not impacted, within 21 days, and as to any injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-360\">\n    Plaintiffs' Fourth, Fifth, Fourteenth, and unconstitutional vagueness challenges are no longer before the Court.
