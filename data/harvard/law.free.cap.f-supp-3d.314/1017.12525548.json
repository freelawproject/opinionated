Wright, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Scott Smith alleges numerous violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act arising from architectural barriers located at a Domino's Pizza restaurant. Before the Court are the motions of Defendants Bradley Pizza, Inc., and Pamela M. Dahl to dismiss Smith's complaint. (Dkts. 29, 64.) Also before the Court is Smith's appeal of the January 24, 2018 Order of United States Magistrate Judge Katherine M. Menendez, which denied Smith's motion for service-of-process expenses and attorneys' fees, as well as his request for leave to amend the complaint. (Dkts. 72, 87.) For the reasons addressed below, the Court denies Defendants' motions to dismiss and affirms the January 24 Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Smith, who has a disability that requires him to use a wheelchair for mobility, visited a Domino's Pizza franchise (Domino's) located in Red Wing, Minnesota, on May 25, 2017. When he arrived at the location, Smith found that the parking lot did not contain enough accessible parking spaces, and the sole parking space marked as accessible\n   was not designated by a sign, was not adjacent to an access aisle, and was not located on an accessible route to the Domino's entryway. Smith also alleges that the threshold to the entryway appeared to be higher than .5 inches. These architectural barriers deterred Smith from patronizing the Domino's, but he plans to return to the Domino's when the architectural barriers are removed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Smith commenced this action against Defendant Bradley Pizza, Inc., a corporation that owns and operates the Domino's, and Defendant Pamela M. Dahl, who owns the property on which the Domino's is located (the property). Smith alleges that the architectural barriers listed in the complaint violate the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and he seeks a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and attorneys' fees and costs. Bradley Pizza answered the complaint on July 7, 2017. After Bradley Pizza advised the Court that it intended to move to dismiss Smith's complaint for mootness because it had brought the property into compliance with the ADA, the magistrate judge stayed all other pretrial litigation pending the resolution of the mootness issue. Shortly thereafter, Smith sought leave to move to amend his complaint. Because all matters unrelated to mootness had been stayed, the magistrate judge denied Smith's request, which this Court subsequently affirmed. Bradley Pizza moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on November 10, 2017; and Dahl, who was not served with the complaint until December 14, 2017, moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim on January 4, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Smith subsequently moved for an award of service-of-process expenses, as well as the attorneys' fees he incurred filing the motion for expenses, because Dahl allegedly failed to waive service of process. Although the mootness issue had not been resolved and all other pretrial matters were stayed, Smith also sought leave to amend the complaint. In the January 24 Order, the magistrate judge denied both the motion for service-of-process expenses and attorneys' fees and the request for leave to amend the complaint. The magistrate judge reasoned that \"the first thing that should be decided in this case is whether the Defendants have ... remedied the issues that were specifically identified in the complaint.\" The magistrate judge explained that, should this Court deny the motions to dismiss, Smith will be permitted to amend the complaint. Smith timely appealed the January 24 Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Bradley Pizza moves to dismiss the complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). However, any motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)\"must be made before pleading if a responsive pleading is allowed.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b).

The absence of evidence that barriers have been removed is sufficient to defeat a motion to dismiss for mootness, despite Defendants' remediation efforts and the dearth of affirmative evidence of noncompliance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sawczyn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4208893\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/8/1108/#p1111\">\n    8 F.Supp.3d at 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (denying dismissal for mootness because court could not conclude as a matter of law that defendant had satisfied its heavy burden of establishing voluntary cessation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants maintain that the slope of the parking space does not violate the ADA because they performed all readily achievable remedies. Defendants' expert, Quarve-Peterson, states that the accessible route is \"reasonable at an existing building and site constructed before 1991 and compliant with the ADA guidelines issued by the United States Department of Justice.\" Quarve-Peterson also observes that the ADAAG \"are used differently depending on whether a small business is altering an existing building, building a brand new facility, or removing architectural barriers that have exist[ed] for years.\" However persuasive this reasoning may be to determining whether additional alteration to the accessible parking space is \"readily achievable\" (and, therefore, whether Smith will ultimately succeed on his claim that the parking space violates the ADA), this argument fails to address whether Defendants have met their burden to establish that all architectural barriers identified in the complaint have been removed. Without proof demonstrating that they have removed the architectural barrier of excessive slope in the parking space in front of the Domino's, Defendants have not established that Smith's claim is moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In summary, despite Defendants' effort to bring the property into compliance with the ADA, an architectural barrier identified in the complaint remains on the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Smith's claim alleging a violation of the ADA is not moot. Accordingly, Defendants' motions for dismissal and judgment on the pleadings for mootness are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Failure to State a Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Dahl also moves to dismiss Smith's complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). Dahl maintains that Defendants have obtained \"readily achievable\" compliance with the ADA and ADAAG. Smith contests dismissal, arguing that the \"readily achievable\" claim is an affirmative defense that exceeds the scope of the mootness question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Failure to remove an architectural barrier \"where such removal is readily achievable\" violates the ADA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012182\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(A)(iv). The claim that removal of an architectural barrier is not readily achievable ordinarily is an affirmative defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colo. Cross Disability Coal. v. Hermanson Family Ltd. P'ship I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9485869\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/264/999/#p1002\">\n    264 F.3d 999\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1002-03 (10th Cir. 2001). Factors bearing on whether removal of a barrier is readily achievable include the nature and cost of the barrier's removal, the financial resources of the business or property, the\n   expense of remediation, and the impact of remediation on the business and its operations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gathright-Dietrich v.

However, \"a plaintiff need not plead facts responsive to an affirmative defense before it is raised.\"\n   <em>\n    Braden v.

For this reason, Smith is not prepared to address any factor that is germane to Dahl's \"readily achievable\" affirmative defense. Because the parties have neither conducted relevant discovery nor fully briefed the factors bearing on this issue, Dahl's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Smith's Appeal of the January 24 Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Smith challenges the decision of the magistrate judge to deny both his motion for an award of service-of-process expenses and attorneys' fees and his request for leave to amend the complaint prior to resolution of the mootness issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court's review of a magistrate judge's ruling on a nondispositive issue is \"extremely deferential.\"\n   <em>\n    Scott v.

Minn. 2010) (internal quotation marks omitted). A decision is contrary to law when a court \"fails to apply or misapplies relevant statutes, case law or rules of procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4263629\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/750/1049/#p1050\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In support of the decision to deny service-of-process expenses and attorneys' fees, the magistrate judge concluded that Smith failed to comply with Rule 4(d). Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(d). Rule 4(d) requires a plaintiff to deliver sufficient copies of the required documents to the defendant through a reliable means.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4263629\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/750/1049/#p1050\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Smith failed to deliver the documents to Dahl, providing them to Dahl's counsel instead. As the magistrate judge observes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [M]ost critically, even assuming that [Smith's counsel's] actions complied with Rule 4(d)(1)'s requirements to provide a specific set of materials with two copies and a waiver form, the record demonstrates that Ms. Dahl never authorized either of her attorneys to accept service on her behalf. The mere fact that Messrs. Sheu and Sullivan represent Ms. Dahl is not a basis for concluding that they were authorized to waive service or accept it on her behalf.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Smith contends that he complied with the procedural requirements of Rule 4(d) by providing copies of the requisite forms to Dahl's attorneys, who are proper recipients of waiver forms even if they are not authorized to receive service of process. Smith's argument lacks the support of any rule of civil procedure and defies logic. As a defendant must be personally served with the summons and complaint unless the defendant's counsel is authorized to receive service of process,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schultz v. Schultz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2213420\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/436/635/#p639\">\n    436 F.2d 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 639-40 (7th Cir. 1971), it follows that only the defendant, herself, can\n   <em>\n    waive\n   </em>\n   the right to receive personal service. Because Smith failed to comply with the requirements of Rule 4(d), the magistrate judge correctly determined that Smith is not entitled to service-of-process expenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The magistrate judge also denied Smith's request for the attorneys' fees that he incurred when bringing the motion for expenses. Although Rule 4(d)(2)(B) authorizes attorneys' fees for any motion\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   to collect expenses, Smith's motion was not required because he neither completed the meet-and-confer process nor confirmed that Dahl was unwilling to pay her service-of-process expenses prior to initiating the motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(d)(2)(B). Because Smith's motion was not required to collect the expenses, the magistrate judge determined that attorneys' fees are not warranted. This ruling is not clearly erroneous or contrary to law. As such, there is no justification for modifying or setting aside the magistrate judge's denial of Smith's motion for service-of-process expenses and attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Smith also appeals the magistrate judge's denial of his request for leave to amend the complaint prior to resolution of the mootness issue. Again, Smith misconstrues the magistrate judge's ruling. The January 24 Order provides that, in the event that this Court denies Defendants' motions to dismiss, Smith will be granted leave to amend his complaint. As those motions are denied, Smith is granted leave to amend his complaint within 21 days after the date of this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Based on the foregoing analysis and all the files, records, and proceedings herein,\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   1.
