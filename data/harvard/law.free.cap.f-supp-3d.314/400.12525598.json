Rule 29 Motion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In mid-trial motions, Walker argued that Count One, Hobbs Act Robbery, and Count Two, violence in furtherance of Hobbs Act Robbery, were multiplicitous, violating his Fifth Amendment protection against double jeopardy. Trial Tr. 533:3-9, Jul. 14, 2018 (\"Count One and Count 2 both charge Hobbs Act Robbery, 18 U.S.C. 1951. It is not that there are two subsections, it is not Part A and Part B or Clause 1 and Clause 2 ... both of those charges charge the exact same statute. When we look at the facts in the case and the language of the statute, they do so in exactly the same way.\"). The court reserved decision on the motion, letting all four counts go to the jury. Walker was found guilty as charged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 115, Jul. 15, 2016; ECF No. 118, Jul. 18, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Because the elements of proof required for Hobbs Act Robbery are sufficient to prove violence in furtherance of Hobbs Act Robbery, Count Two is dismissed as multiplicitous.\n   <em>\n    United States v.
