KELLY, United States District Judge\n   In 2017, Plaintiff Patricia Gavin, proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , filed this lawsuit to seek various forms of relief related to her student loans. This Opinion concerns four issues: (1) whether the doctrine of state sovereign immunity bars Gavin's claims against the Illinois Student Assistance Commission (\"ISAC\"); (2) Gavin's motion to amend her complaint (ECF No. 62); (3) Gavin's motion to \"stay\" a change in her disability status that was apparently made by the Social Security Administration (\"SSA\") (ECF No. 55); and (4) Gavin's motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 54). For the reasons explained below, Gavin's claims against ISAC will be dismissed, and all three motions will be denied. In addition, the Court will order Nelnet, Inc. to file its motion for judgment on the pleadings by June 14, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In Gavin's telling, the deaths brought to light the forgery of Gavin's purported waiver of her survivor benefits, and the Air Force corrected the forgery by restoring those benefits to Gavin.

She did not clearly assert any particular cause of action, but did request relief under the Tucker Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The relief that Plaintiff seeks appears primarily to relate to her student loans, and includes a discharge of her loans and an order ending the garnishment of her income by ISAC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Except for Nelnet (which answered Gavin's complaint) and ISAC (which has not appeared), the Defendants filed motions to dismiss over the next few months. The Defendants argued as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 The Federal Agency Defendants moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and also for failure to state a claim on the ground that Gavin failed to describe any misconduct by the government or to assert any recognized cause of action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 39-1 at 4-7.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 The Attorney Defendants, who had been name partners at Godwin Gruber (the since-disbanded law firm that employed Gavin's divorce attorney), argued that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over Gavin's claims against them; that the Court lacked personal jurisdiction over them, because they are not residents of the District of Columbia and because all of Gavin's claims against them arose from conduct in Texas and Louisiana; that Gavin failed to state a claim against them; and that she failed to plead her fraud allegations with particularity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 10 at 3-12; ECF No. 20 at 3-12.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 The Sallie Mae Defendants moved to dismiss on the ground that Gavin's complaint described no conduct they had committed and thus failed to state a claim against them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 7 at 4-5.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 AES moved to dismiss on the ground that Gavin had failed to state a claim for relief against it, because it is merely a loan servicer and does not itself hold any debt against Gavin; AES also argued Gavin had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies under federal education law for any claim that she is entitled to a discharge of her student loans.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 14-1 at 6-8.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \u2022 Prudential argued that Gavin had failed to state a claim against it; that it had not been properly served; and that\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   barred Gavin's claims, which she had previously litigated in this District.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 17-1 at 2, 4-7 (citing\n   <em>\n    Gavin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4223033\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/72/332/\">\n    72 F.Supp.3d 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Keller argued that Gavin failed to state a claim against it because she alleged no misconduct by Keller, merely that she had gotten her MBA there.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 27-1 at 2-4. Keller also alleged that Gavin had failed to exhaust her administrative remedies; had failed to plead her fraud allegations with particularity; and had failed to identify a proper basis for invoking the Court's jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-10.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   As summarized in a prior Order, Gavin failed to make any substantive response to these motions to dismiss, even though the Court repeatedly warned Gavin to do so and provided her,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , with a lengthy extension of her time to respond.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 44. The Court therefore granted the motions to dismiss as conceded, and dismissed Gavin's claims against the Defendants that had moved to dismiss (that is, all Defendants except ISAC and Nelnet).\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In response, Gavin filed a motion for \"reinstatement of all claims.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reinstatement Mot. Gavin offered two explanations for her failure to respond to the motions to dismiss. First, during the course of the litigation, she had moved to Costa Rica to teach yoga classes and only recently returned.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Change of Address \u00b6 12. Second, Gavin referenced a medical condition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reinstatement Mot. \u00b6 1. However, Gavin did not explain how the condition, which appears to be\n   longstanding, had prevented her from responding to the motions.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-3. Nor did Gavin provide any substantive response to the motions to dismiss the Court had granted as conceded. The Court therefore denied the motion for \"reinstatement\" by minute order on February 12, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On March 6, 2018, the Court held a scheduling conference with Gavin and Nelnet. The Court noted that ISAC had not appeared, that it was not clear whether ISAC had been properly served, and that ISAC appears to be a state government body immune from suit in federal court under the Eleventh Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The Court advised Gavin that, if she believes this Court has jurisdiction over her claims against ISAC, she should submit a supplemental brief setting forth her arguments in favor of jurisdiction. The Court subsequently issued a Scheduling Order with a deadline for this submission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 53 \u00b6 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Scheduling Order also laid out a procedure for Gavin to amend her complaint. The Order explained that, if Gavin wished to amend her complaint, she would have to file a copy of her proposed amended complaint and a brief explaining how she met the standard for leave to amend under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 53 \u00b6 2. In particular, if Gavin intended her amended complaint to resurrect her claims against the dismissed Defendants, she would have to explain (i) why her previous failure to timely oppose the motions to dismiss did not constitute undue delay, and (ii) why her proposed amendments would not be futile.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Gavin subsequently filed a brief regarding ISAC, as well as a motion for leave to amend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s ISAC Br.; Mot. to Amend.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   She has also filed two other motions. The first seeks to \"stay\" a change to her student loan discharge date and social security disability benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stay Mot. The second purports to be a motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SJ Mot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For the reasons explained below, Gavin's claims against ISAC will be dismissed, and her outstanding motions will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Whether State Sovereign Immunity Bars Gavin's Claims against ISAC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   ISAC is an agency of the State of Illinois.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   110 Ill.

Ill. 2004). Under the doctrine of state sovereign immunity, \"suits against the States and their agencies\" in federal court \"are barred regardless of the relief sought.\"\n   <em>\n    P.R.

This doctrine admits of few exceptions, namely where the state has consented to suit in federal court or where Congress has validly abrogated state sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coll. Sav. Bank v. Fla. Prepaid Postsecondary Educ.

If Congress wishes to abrogate state sovereign immunity, it must do so unequivocally based on a valid grant of constitutional authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ala. v.

Similarly, while Congress can sometimes require a state to waive sovereign immunity as a condition tied to grants of federal\n   funds, Congress must express that condition clearly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barbour v.

Cir. 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Gavin's only argument for jurisdiction is that Illinois, by participating in federal student loan programs, has waived its sovereign immunity with respect to suits against ISAC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s ISAC Br. \u00b6 68. In particular, she argues that ISAC is merely a \"collection agent for the federal government,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75, and thus is not immune from suit, because any financial effect from this lawsuit would ultimately flow to the U.S. Treasury,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-62, 68. Put simply, that is not a cognizable basis to find a waiver of Illinois's sovereign immunity.

Stay Mot. Ex. C. Second, on February 19, 2018, Gavin received a letter from Nelnet informing her that, based on information provided by SSA, she may qualify for \"Total and Permanent Disability Discharge\" of her loans as of April 5, 2016.

Gavin appears to argue that the discharge date should be earlier, in April 2011.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Stay Mot. at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   This motion appears to seek relief from Nelnet, namely a partial discharge of Gavin's student loans. It thus amounts to a request for preliminary relief, but Gavin has not even attempted to satisfy the standard for such relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winter v. Nat. Res. Def.

To that extent, the motion must also be denied. The SSA is not a party to this action. And even if Gavin sought to join the SSA, claims against it would have to be dismissed at this juncture.

ECF No. 26.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    While the latter filing is styled as a \"proposed amended complaint,\" it in fact appears to present reasons why her proposed amended complaint (attached as Exhibit A to the filing) should be accepted.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mot. to Amend. Therefore, the Court treats it as a motion for leave to amend.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Gavin does cite a judicial opinion in an action brought by the FTC against the company that operates Keller. Proposed Am. Compl. at 1 n.1 (citing\n    <em>\n     FTC v. DeVry Educ. Grp., Inc.\n    </em>\n    , No. 2:16-cv-579,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%206821112\">\n     2016 WL 6821112\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (C.D. Cal. May 9, 2016) ). But Gavin does not explain which of the allegations in that case are relevant to her claims, or how. Indeed, the earliest misstatements alleged in the FTC's complaint occurred in 2008.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 20-43,\n    <em>\n     FTC v. DeVry Educ. Grp. Inc.\n    </em>\n    , No. 2:16-cv-579, ECF No. 1 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 27, 2016). Gavin began her studies at Keller in 2004,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6 35, so there is no direct line between the allegations in the FTC case and her theory that Keller's misstatements induced her to take on the student loans at issue in this action. Thus, even construing Gavin's complaint liberally in her favor, this bare cross-reference to the FTC action is not enough to state a claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
