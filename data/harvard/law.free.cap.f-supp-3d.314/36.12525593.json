Ms. Jones, who was known to her colleagues as a lesbian woman, began an intimate relationship with Ms. Weeks, who at the time was known to her colleagues as a heterosexual woman who had previously been married to a man. The unexpected relationship between the two women created a wave at MPD, and Ms. Jones and Ms. Weeks now allege that the ripples from that wave created a hostile work environment for them, in violation of Title VII and the D.C. Human Rights Act (DCHRA), for which they sue the District of Columbia (the District or D.C.) Both Plaintiffs allege that they were subjected to harassment and hostility on the basis of sexual orientation and sex, as well as retaliation for complaining. Because the claims all emanate from allegations related to Plaintiffs' lesbian relationship, and they have not raised a genuine issue of material fact as to harassment based on sex, the Court will grant D.C.'s motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiffs' sex discrimination claims under Title VII and DCHRA. However, because there are disputes of material fact concerning Plaintiffs' claims of a hostile work environment due to their sexual orientation and retaliation for protected activities under DCHRA, the Court will deny summary judgment on those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

[Dkt. 26] \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In July 2006, Ms. Jones and Ms. Weeks began a romantic relationship.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ; Def.'s Undisputed \u00b6\u00b6 4, 76. By September 2006, both were assigned to PSA 703, riding together as partners, and reporting to Sgt. Podorski.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jones Dep. at 113. Ms. Jones testified that around that time, while on duty with Sgt. Podorski in an MPD scout car, she told him that she was dating another female officer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jones Dep. at 28-30. Sgt. Podorski did not react with anger or otherwise negatively at the time, although Ms. Jones says that \"at some point he became angry.\" Jones Dep. at 37. Also in September 2006, both Plaintiffs together told Sgt. Podorski about their relationship.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jones Dep. at 42-43; Weeks Dep. at 20-23. According to Ms. Weeks, Sgt. Podorski responded by telling Ms. Weeks \"you let the kid come out and play,\" which she took to mean that she \"let [her] emotions come out.\" Weeks Dep. at 24. Ms. Jones did not recall Sgt.

Alleged Hostile Actions Related to Work Assignments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 24, 2006, Plaintiffs arrived at a domestic violence call where two family members were suspected of hitting and threatening a teenage family member with a knife.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Podorski IAD File Narrative Report [Dkt. 94-7] at 2 (Podorski IAD); Jones Dep. 120.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs talked with the teenager and determined that she had been attacked for telling her family that she was a lesbian.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Podorski IAD at 5. Sgt. Podorski ordered Plaintiffs not to arrest the two family members and to bring the teenager to a mental health facility for evaluation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. Sgt. Podorski stated that he had prior experience with the teenager and knew she had mental health issues and was a runaway.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Podorski Dep. at 53, 122-24. Plaintiffs disagreed with his order, and called the MPD Gay and Lesbian Unit (GLU) to complain about it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Podorski IAD at 5. Sgt. Brett Parsons of the GLU, along with another MPD officer, came to the scene, interviewed witnesses, and arrested the two family members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Sgt. Podorski was subsequently referred to the U.S. Attorney's Office for \"Failure to Make a Lawful Arrest,\" and cited by MPD's Internal Affairs Division (IAD) for Neglect of Duty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Podorski IAD Final Report [Dkt. 94-11] at 3. Ms. Jones alleges that after these events on September 24, 2006, Sgt. Podorski prevented the Plaintiffs from riding together on a daily basis, even during periods when they were assigned to the same PSA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jones Disputed \u00b6\u00b6 J028-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In November 2006, Plaintiffs participated in the annual \"open season\" bidding process, in which MPD officers bid on different PSA assignments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jones OHR Complaint (Apr. 20, 2009), Jones OHR File [Dkt. 94-3] at 3. Both Plaintiffs had planned to bid for PSA 703, but Sgt. Podorski assigned Ms. Jones to be out on duty during bidding, and when she returned to the 7D office, PSA 703 was full.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   As a result, Ms. Weeks bid on and was assigned to PSA 703, Ms. Jones was assigned to PSA 701, and Plaintiffs were unable to ride together as squad-car partners.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Ms. Jones alleges that Sgt.

Podorski \"would call-in\" to inquire about Plaintiffs' court appearances, which he would not do with other officers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In November 2006, Sgt. Podorski gave Ms. Jones a performance evaluation score of 28, representing \"exceeds expectations,\" on her annual performance evaluation. Def.'s Undisputed \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In January 2007 Sgt. Podorski informed Plaintiffs that he believed they were unsafe riding together because they had too many Use of Force Incident Reports (UFIRs).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Podorski Dep. at 42-46. At some point that month, Sgt. Podorski posted a notice at 7D, stating that Ms. Jones, Ms. Weeks, and one other officer had too many UFIRs and experienced too many injuries at work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jones Dep. at 55-56;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Weeks Dep. at 85. Plaintiffs allege that this posting was harassing because it was unusual and violated their privacy, and that the record does not support the District's contention that Sgt. Podorski separated Plaintiffs because of their UFIRs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jones Opp'n at 33-34;\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jones Disputed \u00b6 J044;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Jones Dep. at 58 (calling the posted notice an invasion of privacy); Weeks Dep. at 85 (asserting that the posting of the notice created a hostile work environment). Sgt. Podorski testified that he told other sergeants in 7D that Plaintiffs were overly aggressive when they worked together, but he did not recall \"a specific incident\" that \"triggered\" the notice posting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Podorski Dep. at 45-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the notice on excessive UFIRs was posted, Ms. Weeks told Sgts. Eric Levenberry and Buddy Smallwood that she believed Sgt. Podorski was being unfair.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Weeks Dep. at 63. According to Ms. Weeks, Sgt. Levenberry told her she could file a complaint with the District's Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Office, but warned her that if she did, Sgt. Podorski might tell people that Ms. Weeks had slept with him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Sgt. Levenberry recalled the conversation but not how he advised Ms. Weeks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Levenberry Dep. [Dkt. 94-12] at 19. Ms. Jones testified that, also in January 2007, she and Ms. Weeks together complained to Lt. Derek Larsen about Sgt. Podorski, telling Lt. Larsen that they did not want to work with Sgt. Podorski anymore because of the way he had been treating them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jones Dep. at 69, 72-79. There was apparently no immediate response; Lt. Larsen testified that he advised Plaintiffs several months later, in October 2007, that if they were having a problem with Sgt. Podorski they could file an EEO complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Larsen Dep. [Dkt. 94-1] at 42-43. In February 2007, Plaintiffs also talked with Lt. Ashley Rosenthal, a former EEO counselor for 7D and trainer at the Police Academy, about Sgt. Podorski's allegedly harassing behavior; Plaintiffs allege that Lt. Rosenthal advised them to document their complaints but did not take further steps to address their concerns.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Weeks Dep. at 333; Rosenthal Dep. [Dkt. 97-9] at 59-62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In March 2007, Ms. Jones began her new assignment in PSA 701. During this time, Sgt. Podorski was responsible for Roll Call assignments to scout cars, and Ms. Jones alleges that Sgt. Podorski routinely refused to assign her and Ms. Weeks to the same scout car, even though he would routinely assign other officers in heterosexual relationships to ride together.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Statement of Officer Tonia L. Jones, Jones OHR File at 68-74.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Also during March 2007, Plaintiffs met with Joel Maupin, Commander of 7D, to complain about Sgt. Podorski and to request that they both be transferred to the midnight shift to avoid his supervision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Weeks Dep. at 137. CDR Maupin informed Plaintiffs that they could file an EEO complaint, but that he had a policy between open bids of agreeing to reassignments only with a \"body-for-body\" replacement; that is, a transferring officer had to find another officer to take her place.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 136-37, 142; Jones Dep. at 127-28. CDR Maupin testified that the \"body-for-body\" requirement\n   is standard procedure because of staffing limitations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Maupin Dep. [Dkt. 93-12] at 31, while Plaintiffs contend that the \"body-for-body\" policy was not an official policy and was selectively enforced in a discriminatory way.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Weeks Dep. at 130-32 (Ms. Weeks describing her understanding that one other officer had been permitted to change her shift without a \"body-for-body\" replacement). Both Ms. Weeks and Ms. Jones were reassigned to the midnight shift later in 2007, in August and September, respectively, when each had found a replacement with whom to switch.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Weeks Dep. at 125-26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Alleged Hostile Actions at Myrtle Beach Bike Week\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Sgt. Yurell Washington was the supervisor in 7D on the midnight shift to whose supervision each Plaintiff voluntarily transferred in late summer 2007.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Weeks Disputed \u00b6 W010; Def.'s Undisputed \u00b6 80. Before those transfers, in May 2007, Plaintiffs had traveled with Sgt. Washington and his girlfriend to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, for an annual motorcycle rally (Bike Week).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Undisputed \u00b6 82; Weeks Disputed \u00b6 W012. During the several-hours-long drive, during which the travelers talked and, at various times, Plaintiffs openly kissed in the back seat, Sgt. Washington asked Ms. Weeks why she \"switched to being with women,\" which Ms. Weeks alleges was invasive and harassing. Weeks Opp'n at 14;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Washington Dep. [Dkt. 94-15] at 77-79, 116-17. Sgt. Washington contends that the question came up naturally in conversation and that he had no hidden motive in asking it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Washington Dep. at 77-78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A number of MPD officers traveled to Myrtle Beach for \"Bike Week\" and during the vacation Plaintiffs stayed at a rental house with other officers including Sgts. Podorski and Washington. Jones Dep. at 102;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Washington Dep. at 113. During a party one night at a different house, a clearly drunk Sgt. Podorski walked out onto the porch and yelled, \"Do you want to f-k?\" in front of a large group that included Plaintiffs. Jones Dep. at 46. That Sgt. Podorski asked this question is undisputed; there is a dispute as to whether he was seriously propositioning Ms. Weeks or both Plaintiffs,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Weeks Dep. at 118 (\"I took it as him being serious.\"), or if the outburst was directed at no one in particular,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Undisputed \u00b6 118; Podorski Dep. at 66 (\"I don't know if I was yelling at them or someone else in the house.\"). Ms. Jones testified that other officers at the party expressed their indignation to her about the Sergeant's conduct, although apparently none presented evidence in discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jones Dep. at 106. Ms. Jones also testified that she helped to restrain other officers from attacking Sgt. Podorski.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (\"I was trying to stop other people from assaulting [Sgt. Podorski].\"). Plaintiffs argue that their recollections of other officers' reactions after Sgt. Podorski's outburst corroborates Ms. Jones's testimony that the outburst was directed at either Ms. Weeks or both women.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Alleged Hostile Actions by Sgt. Washington and Other Officers\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   After Ms. Weeks transferred to the midnight shift in August 2007, Sgt. Washington suggested a couple of times that they ride their motorcycles to work together. Weeks Dep. at 124 (recalling that Sgt. Washington invited her to ride their bikes \"a couple times\"); Washington Dep. at 55 (recalling that he asked her once, in a casual, friendly manner). Ms. Weeks now complains that she felt harassed by Sgt. Washington's offers to ride their motorcycles to work together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   By mid-September 2007, Plaintiffs were both assigned to the midnight shift and were again patrolling together. During a\n   patrol prior to September 19, Plaintiffs stopped an automobile that had been reported stolen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Undisputed \u00b6 119; Washington Dep. at 53. A woman who was a known prostitute was driving the car; after talking with her, Plaintiffs accepted her word that the owner of the car (who had reported it stolen) had given her permission to drive it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Undisputed \u00b6 120; Weeks Dep. at 151-53. Plaintiffs reported the encounter to Sgt. Washington, who ordered them to arrest the woman as a suspected car thief. Plaintiffs refused.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Undisputed \u00b6\u00b6 120-21; Washington Dep. at 53. Sgt. Washington became angry because Plaintiffs defied his direct orders, although he ultimately agreed not to insist that they lock up the suspect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Weeks Dep. at 157. Sgt. Washington testified that Plaintiffs' insubordination during this incident, particularly Ms. Weeks's vocal resistance to his orders, was \"the last straw,\" and he determined to separate them. Washington Dep. at 54;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 55 (stating that Ms. Weeks resisted his orders vocally, while Ms. Jones was largely silent throughout the incident).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Sgt. Washington separated Plaintiffs by assigning Ms. Weeks to the so-called \"Marjorie Court detail,\" a temporary fixed-post assignment to provide protection to a fellow officer at his home, on September 19, 2007.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Undisputed \u00b6 124; Washington Dep. at 55, 80-81. During such a stint on October 5, 2007, Ms. Weeks arrested a suspect on an unrelated matter, but Sgt. Washington ordered her to return to her detail and assigned the arrest to another officer to process at the lock-up. Ms. Weeks charges that in doing so Sgt. Washington was treating her unfairly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Weeks Internal Affairs Division Interview at 9-11 (Oct. 7, 2007) [Dkt. 94-18] (Weeks IAD Interview). Plaintiffs believe that Sgt. Washington assigned Ms. Weeks to the detail in order to separate Plaintiffs, and that his intent was punitive. Ms. Weeks alleges that another officer asked for the detail but Sgt. Washington refused because he was \"saving\" it for Ms. Weeks. Weeks OHR Complaint (Apr. 20, 2009), Weeks OHR File at 3 [Dkt. 94-4]; Weeks Dep. at 128;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Washington Dep. at 60 (testifying that he did not recall telling anyone that he was \"saving\" the detail for Ms. Weeks).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs further allege that Sgt. Washington inappropriately referred to their sexual orientation. According to Ms. Weeks's testimony, Sgt. Washington's girlfriend told Ms. Weeks that he had described the women as \"the butch one\" (Ms. Jones) and \"the femme one\" (Ms. Weeks), which Ms. Weeks considered derogatory, harassing, and evidence of Sgt. Washington's inappropriate focus on their sexual orientation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Weeks Dep. at 95-97. Sgt. Washington testified that he did not recall using those terms, but that it was \"a known impression\" in 7D that Ms. Jones was \"butch\" and Ms. Weeks was \"femme.\" Washington Dep. at 79. Plaintiffs also allege that Sgt. Washington frequently initiated frank discussions with Plaintiffs about his sexual attraction to other women, which Plaintiffs assert was unprofessional and which they believe Sgt. Washington would not have done with heterosexual female colleagues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Weeks Disputed \u00b6 W097; Washington Dep. at 131-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Further, Plaintiffs complain that other MPD employees harassed them because of their sexual orientation. They allege that,\n   in September 2007, they were standing together when Officer Stephen Pristoop, a colleague, offered $5,000 to Ms. Weeks to watch the couple have sex; Plaintiffs rejected the offer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Undisputed \u00b6 135; Jones Dep. at 264-66. Officer Pristoop was later fired by MPD, due to unrelated inappropriate actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Undisputed \u00b6 138; Washington Dep. at 59-60. Ms. Jones alleges that Sgt. Buddy Smallwood asked her if he \"could have a kiss,\" adding that Ms. Weeks would not find out.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jones Dep. at 262. Ms. Weeks alleges that Officer William Chapman would frequently tell her that she should \"go back\" to men. 3d Am. Compl. [Dkt. 26] \u00b6 18. There is no allegation that either Plaintiff reported any of these encounters to MPD at the time.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Weeks Dep. at 266 (\"I can't remember if I told someone [about Officer Pristoop].\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Investigations of Ms. Weeks for Neglect of Duty and Absence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In September and October of 2007, Ms. Weeks was investigated, on Sgt. Washington's orders, for two separate incidents involving MPD's absence and leave policies. First, on September 26, 2007, Ms. Weeks was investigated for \"neglect of duty\" after allegedly leaving a squad car partner (not Ms. Jones) behind and neglecting to follow MPD procedures after doing so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Undisputed \u00b6\u00b6 126-28; Washington Dep. at 626-3.

That complaint included a subsection titled \"HARASSMENT\" in which Ms. Weeks alleged \"remarks\" by Sgts.

Harassment based on an employee's protected status-here, sexual orientation, sex, and protected activity under DCHRA-is a descriptor of a hostile work environment which is shown by a series of ongoing events that are sufficiently severe and pervasive to interfere unreasonably with an employee's work performance. A number of Ms. Weeks's allegations occurred within the one-year time frame.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Brooks\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4154833,5889899\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/748/1273/\">\n     748 F.3d at 1278\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\" '[A] plaintiff may not combine discrete acts to form a hostile work environment claim without meeting the required hostile work environment standard,' but a hostile work environment claim is not rendered invalid 'merely because it contains discrete acts that the plaintiff claims (correctly or incorrectly) are actionable on their own.' \") (quoting\n    <em>\n     Baird v.

Moreover, the District's argument about the timeliness of allegations based on \"discrete\" acts simply does not apply to the hostile work environment claims at bar.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Baird\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3851124,3768254\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/662/1246/\">\n     662 F.3d at 1251-52\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[T]he district court erred to the extent that it categorically excluded [plaintiff's] time-barred complaints in considering the hostile work environment claim, thus failing to employ the\n    <em>\n     Morgan\n    </em>\n    analysis, including, of course, a determination of which acts exhibit the relationship necessary to be considered 'part of the same actionable hostile environment claim.' \") (quoting\n    <em>\n     Morgan\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p117\">\n     536 U.S. at 103\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254428\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/101/#p117\">\n     122 S.Ct. 2061\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    The District also argues that Ms. Weeks failed to file her original OHR complaint (March 31, 2008) within 15 days of receiving her Exit Letter (December 14, 2007) so that all of her DCHRA claims should be dismissed. DCHRA provides that \"timely filing of a complaint with [OHR] shall toll the running of the statute of limitations while the complaint is pending.\" D.C. CODE \u00a7 2-1403.16(a). The District is correct concerning any claims by Ms. Weeks that were not based on an alleged hostile work environment. As to her allegations of a hostile work environment, due either to her sexual orientation, sex, or in retaliation\n    for her protected activity, her complaint is timely under D.C. law.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Although a closer question, the Court is not persuaded by the District's further argument that Ms. Weeks failed to raise an adequate claim of a hostile work environment. The District argues that the initial OHR complaint filed by Ms. Weeks \"clearly alleged\n    <em>\n     sexual orientation\n    </em>\n    discrimination\" but not a hostile work environment. Reply at 3-4. However, as stated above, the Court interprets Ms. Weeks's OHR complaint-alleging harassment through \"remarks\" by Sgts. Podorski and Washington about her relationship with Ms. Jones, threatening discipline, and a lowered evaluation score-as advancing a claim of a hostile work environment. Ongoing harassment due to protected status is exactly what may be sufficiently severe so as to constitute a hostile work environment that intrudes on an employee's ability to work.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Ms. Jones also filed her original OHR complaint on March 31, 2008, describing similar allegedly hostile acts, including the incident in which Sgt. Podorski allegedly refused to sign Ms. Jones's report and threw it on the ground in anger.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Jones OHR Complaint (Mar. 31, 2008). As did Ms. Weeks, Ms. Jones included a section entitled \"HARASSMENT.\" Ms. Jones filed her OHR Complaint almost immediately after receiving her Exit Letter,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Jones Exit Letter (Mar. 28, 2008). Some of the allegedly ongoing behaviors took place during the one-year period before that filing with OHR. Therefore, Ms. Jones timely complained of a hostile work environment due to her sexual orientation, sex, and/or retaliation for protected activities under DCHRA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      2. Merits\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    At this point in this litigation, Plaintiffs allege that they experienced a hostile work environment on the basis of sexual orientation beginning in September 2006, when they informed Sgt. Podorski that they were in a same-sex relationship. Plaintiffs contend that the news of their relationship led to different treatment throughout the fall of 2006, with increasingly hostile behavior in 2007 and later. They argue that they were subjected to harassing comments in the workplace, with Sgt. Podorski criticizing each woman to the other and making disparaging remarks about the relationship in the fall of 2006.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Jones Dep. at 109-10 (recalling that around this time Sgt. Podorski told Ms. Jones that Ms. Weeks was a \"drama queen\" and \"poison\"). They complain that Sgt. Podorski prevented them from bidding on the same PSA in late fall 2006 because he assigned Ms. Jones to be out on duty during bidding. In addition to this central complaint, Plaintiffs allege that Sgt. Podorski frequently targeted Plaintiffs with hostility such as his inappropriately posted notice concerning their UFIRs in January 2007 to embarrass Plaintiffs,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Jones Dep. at 55-56; Weeks Dep. at 85; made other staffing decisions to prevent them from riding together during the fall of 2006 and into the spring of 2007,\n    <em>\n     see, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Jones OHR File at 13-14 (alleging that Sgt.

Ms. Weeks also testified that Sgt.

Washington's inappropriate focus on their sexual orientation. Weeks Dep. at 95-97. Sgt.

Washington Dep. at 79.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    The District counters that its actions were based on the legitimate needs of the workplace and not motivated by animus based on Plaintiffs' sexual orientation or protected activity. For example, the District argues that Plaintiffs had increased UFIRs when they worked together (a point Plaintiffs do not challenge) and that Ms. Jones had long been known by her colleagues to be a lesbian, so it would not make sense to attribute hostility in the workplace against Ms. Jones due to her relationship with Ms. Weeks.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Undisputed \u00b6 13. Additionally, the District raises non-discriminatory bases for the allegedly hostile behavior of Sgts. Podorski and Washington. Aside from the danger posed by Plaintiffs' UFIRs when they worked together, the District contends that Sgt. Podorski's alleged hostility toward Plaintiffs is traceable to their refusal to follow his orders in handling the domestic violence call on September 24, 2006. Similarly, Sgt. Washington became frustrated\n    and angry when Plaintiffs outright refused, in September 2007, to arrest a prostitute suspected of stealing a reported stolen car as he ordered.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    To determine whether a work environment is hostile, courts look to \" 'all the circumstances,' including the 'frequency of the discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work performance.' \"\n    <em>\n     Vickers v.

It tries to frame Plaintiffs' hostile work environment claims as simply an amalgam of the sergeants' alleged improper actions, which may have been uncivil but were separated by gaps of time, rendering them only ordinary workplace trials and tribulations. In\n    <em>\n     Bryant\n    </em>\n    , however, the district court granted summary judgment after determining that almost \"none of the events described in plaintiff's 21-page complaint [had]\n    <em>\n     any\n    </em>\n    racial or age-related overtones.\"\n    <em>\n     Bryant\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9107606\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/265/52/\">\n     265 F.Supp.2d at 64\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added). The two alleged incidents in\n    <em>\n     Bryant\n    </em>\n    that were not \"completely neutral\" with regards to any protected status were comments by co-workers, one of whom allegedly called the plaintiff an extremely offensive racial epithet while in a Metro station, and the other of whom allegedly told plaintiff that she believed \"black women were at the bottom\" of a perceived hierarchy for advancement in government jobs.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9107606\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/265/52/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9107606\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/265/52/\">\n     at 64\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The\n    <em>\n     Bryant\n    </em>\n    case is not, however, the perfect analog that the District wishes it were. Mses. Weeks and Jones allege that Sgt. Podorski explicitly disparaged their relationship and made sexual comments, in the context of other allegedly hostile actions\n    that could be interpreted to have been motivated by hostility based on the relationship; Ms. Jones also alleges that Sgt. Smallwood, also her superior, asked her if he could \"have a kiss.\" Such allegations of explicit sexual behavior, or inappropriate comments regarding the same-sex relationship, render the comparison to\n    <em>\n     Bryant\n    </em>\n    inapposite.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Hammel\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20F.%20Supp.%203d%20219\">\n     206 F.Supp.3d at 239\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (discussing a manager's inappropriate reference to plaintiff's and other employees' sexual orientation).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    The District also argues that \"Plaintiffs' multiple complaints regarding personnel decisions\"-including the claim at the heart of this case, that Sgt. Podorski began to separate them after learning of their same-sex relationship-do not support a harassment claim. The District argues that its \"legitimate need to manage employee staffing levels and employee assignments is not trumped by Plaintiffs' desire to ride in the same car.\" Mot. at 39. Of course, this is true-so long as the need is legitimate. The problem is that D.C. has discarded the records that would show officer assignments so that a comparison of Plaintiffs' experience and that of others could be made. As a result, the nature of MPD's legitimate needs and Plaintiffs' experiences between fall 2006, when Plaintiffs informed Sgt. Podorski of their same-sex relationship, and August 2007, when Ms. Weeks transferred to the midnight shift under Sgt. Washington, must be based on credibility determinations of witness testimony by a fact-finding jury.\n    <footnotemark>\n     17\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Further to this point, the District argues that Mses. Jones and Weeks had increased UFIRs when they worked together, which provides a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason why Sgt. Podorski separated them. While Plaintiffs complain that Sgt. Podorski inappropriately posted information about their UFIRs, they do not deny the number of UFIRs they filed. Ultimately, the written record is insufficient to make this determination and a jury will have to evaluate witness credibility.\n    <footnotemark>\n     18\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    Further potential evidence of a hostile work environment could be found by a jury in Sgt. Podorski's drunken shout, \"Do you want to f-k?\" during a party at Bike Week. The District argues that the outburst was an isolated incident and stresses that it occurred outside of work. It cites\n    <em>\n     Bergbauer v. Mabus\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3894524\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/934/55/\">\n     934 F.Supp.2d 55\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (D.D.C. 2013), in which summary judgment was granted even though the plaintiff's supervisor had touched her sexually on one occasion outside of work.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    It is true that antidiscrimination statutes do not constitute \"a general civility code.\"\n    <em>\n     Oncale\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503242\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/75/#p78\">\n     523 U.S. at 81\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11503242\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/523/75/#p78\">\n     118 S.Ct. 998\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . It is also true that Sgt. Podorski's outburst occurred in a social setting, away from the District of Columbia. However, the party was attended by many coworkers and supervisors and the offending comment was made by a direct supervisor. Actions outside the workplace can contribute to a hostile work environment.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Greer v. Paulson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5861272,3566566\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/505/1306/\">\n     505 F.3d 1306\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1314 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (\"We join our sister circuits in rejecting a\n    <em>\n     per se\n    </em>\n    rule against considering incidents alleged to have occurred while an employee was physically absent from the workplace.\"). While a single offensive utterance outside the workplace does not create a hostile work environment at work, the Court cannot make that distinction here on the written record. Further, it is uncontested that Sgt. Podorski lowered the annual evaluations of Mses. Jones and Weeks (whose rating was quickly raised by another sergeant) in late fall 2007.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    As the District correctly argues, \"not everything that makes an employee unhappy is an actionable adverse action,\" and allegations must objectively contribute to the discrimination alleged in order to be actionable.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Mot. at 39 (quoting\n    <em>\n     Lester v. Natsios\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9047603\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/290/11/#p28\">\n     290 F.Supp.2d 11\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 28 (D.D.C. 2003) ). The Court finds that this principle bars Plaintiffs from presenting the entirety of their allegations to a jury. Some of the incidents of which Plaintiffs complain are mere trivialities that do not support their allegations. These include Sgt. Washington asking Ms. Weeks \"a couple times\" to ride their motorcycles to work together in August 2007; Sgt. Podorski throwing a form to the floor in annoyance in March 2008; Sgt. Washington accusing Ms. Weeks of being AWOL in October 2007 when she was admittedly AWOL\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n    did not learn of this AWOL until a full year later-\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , clearly it could not have created a hostile work environment in 2007; and Sgt. Washington marking each Plaintiff absent for two hours, the minimum time for personal leave, when they reported for work late after attending a wedding. Plaintiffs do not dispute the MPD policy to grant such personal leave in two-or-four hour increments or that Sgt. Washington marked them out before he left 7D, before they arrived at 7D, and before he knew when Plaintiffs actually reported for work. In addition, Plaintiffs did nothing to correct the record, not speaking with Sgt. Washington or the timekeepers. This small snafu is merely one of those trivial annoyances any employee might suffer.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    The Court also finds that Sgt. Washington's assignment of Ms. Weeks to the temporary Marjorie Court detail in the fall of 2007 was provoked by her refusals to follow his direct orders to arrest the prostitute driving a stolen car. Ms. Weeks complains she could not ride with Ms. Jones and that Sgt. Washington had \"informed other officers who asked for the Marjorie Court detail that he was 'saving this for my girl.' \" Weeks OHR Complaint (Apr. 20, 2009) at 3;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Washington Dep. at 157 (stating that he did not recall saying he was saving the Marjorie Court detail for Ms. Weeks but that \"[i]t may have happened\"). Ms. Weeks does not deny that she refused to follow Sgt. Washington's direct order, that she argued with him about it, and that he became angry as a result. This uncontested insubordinate conduct provides a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for Sgt. Washington's temporary assignment not connected by word or inference to Ms. Weeks's sexual preference.\n    <footnotemark>\n     19\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    The Court also finds that the uncontested evidence related to CDR Maupin's \"body-for-body\" policy is insufficient to suggest that he targeted Plaintiffs because of their sexual orientation. Ms. Weeks identified a single comparator, whom she\n    <em>\n     thought\n    </em>\n    may have been allowed to transfer between bids despite the alleged policy.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Weeks Dep. at 130-32. That single possible example does not discount the legitimate business purpose of CDR Maupin in deciding not to institute the mandatory transfer of a replacement-or work short-handed-to accommodate a transfer request outside the bid process. CDR Maupin suggested that Plaintiffs file an EEO complaint about Sgt. Podorski with IAD if they wanted to do so but they apparently decided to forego that route. Notably, Plaintiffs do\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    complain that CDR Maupin failed to investigate their report that Sgt. Podorski was treating them inequitably, but only complain about the body-for-body policy, as to which they have no evidence of illegal hostility.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Finally, some of Plaintiffs' allegations of inappropriate sexual comments by co-workers cannot as a matter of law support their claims. Where these allegations concern the offensive behavior of other non-supervisory officers that was not reported, MPD cannot be held liable.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Curry v. D.C.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671241,1738214\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/195/654/\">\n     195 F.3d 654\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 660 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (holding that an employer may be held liable for harassment by a non-supervisory co-worker only if the employer knew or should have known of harassment and failed to take appropriate remedial action). Thus, Officer Pristoop's alleged offer to pay Plaintiffs to watch them have sex,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Jones Dep. at 264-66, and Officer Chapman's allegedly encouraging Ms. Weeks to \"go back\" to dating men,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    3d Am. Compl. \u00b6 18, do not support Plaintiffs' claims, because there is no evidence that either Plaintiff told MPD about these incidents.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    <strong>\n     B.

Merits\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    Although her claim is timely, Ms. Weeks fails to make out a case of hostile work environment based on sex under DCHRA (Count III) or Title VII (Count V). Both plaintiffs' sex discrimination arguments rely on the theory that they suffered harassment in 7D because they, as women in a lesbian relationship, failed to conform to \"typical gender stereotypes.\" Weeks Opp'n at 28; Jones Opp'n at 26-27. Ms. Weeks also alleges that she was subjected to a hostile work environment due to her sex when she became an Investigator in November 2008 and joined the Detectives' Office. Again, she attributes \"examples of the harassment\" to \"[her] non-conformity with gender stereotypes and perceptions about her sexual orientation,\" not to her female sex. Weeks Opp'n at 34.\n    <footnotemark>\n     21\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    This Court disagrees with those courts that have held that Title VII prohibits discrimination based on sexual orientation; whether it should have then, or should be amended to do so now, the Court finds no suggestion that the Congress of 1964, or the Supreme Court cases, intended the language of Title VII to be so broad. Rather, this Court agrees with the District that sexual orientation is a separate class of protected individuals and notes that Plaintiffs make such allegations in Count I. A change in federal law awaits congressional action. For this reason, as well as the untimeliness of Ms. Jones's Title VII charge, the lack of merit to Ms. Weeks's Title VII sex-discrimination charge, and the lack of merit to Plaintiffs' DCHRA charge of sex discrimination, this Court will grant summary judgment to the District on Counts III and V.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    Even were Ms. Weeks's allegations based on her sex, rather than her sexual orientation, the Court finds that she fails to demonstrate a hostile work environment in the Detectives' Office. Ms. Weeks alleges that her \"cases, search warrants, and other job duties\" were routinely given to \"male investigators or detectives with less experience.\" Weeks Opp'n at 33.\n    <footnotemark>\n     22\n    </footnotemark>\n    She offers no specifics and, on the question of whether cases were transferred to males when they were ripe for arrest warrants, she provided only vague testimony that this happened one time. While Ms. Weeks argues in brief that she was told \"to not be so 'timid,' \"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%20401816\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , she testified that she was asked\n    <em>\n     whether\n    </em>\n    she was \"timid.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Weeks Dep. at 259. Ms. Weeks claims that she was \"ridiculed\" by Sgt. King, her supervisor in the Detectives' Office, when she requested training. Weeks Opp'n at 34. In fact, however, Sgt.

While the tampon may have offended Ms. Weeks, it was not threatening or even particularly offensive. It appears to have been, at worst, an anonymous crass joke.

Plaintiffs place their first complaints in January 2007, when they spoke together to Lt. Derek Larsen about Sgt. Podorski, telling Lt. Larsen that they did not want to work with Sgt. Podorski anymore because of the way he had been treating them.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Jones Dep. at 69, 72-79. Around the same time, Ms. Weeks also spoke to Sgts. Levenberry and Smallwood about Sgt. Podorski's alleged harassment; she claims that although they informed her of her right to file an EEO complaint, they warned that if she did so, Sgt. Podorski might claim that she had slept with him.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Weeks Dep. at 63. In February 2007, Plaintiffs also discussed Sgt. Podorski's allegedly harassing behavior with Lt. Rosenthal.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Weeks Dep. at 333; Rosenthal Dep. at 59-62. Several months later, in October 2007, Plaintiffs went out on stress leave, filing forms with MPD that identified Sgts. Podorski and Washington by name and advanced allegations of harassment. Plaintiffs filed their OHR complaints in March 2008 and amended them in April 2009. A reasonable juror could conclude that these complaints support a retaliatory hostile work environment claim.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    Plaintiffs allege that Sgt. Washington confronted Ms. Jones in November 2007 and \"yelled ... '[y]ou can feed the dogs but they will bite you,' \" which she understood to be a threat related to her complaints of harassment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Jones Disputed \u00b6 J088; Washington Dep. at 83-84 (\"I think I may have said that, yeah.\"). According to a written statement in one of Ms. Jones's administrative complaints, on January 22, 2008 Sgt. Washington said to her, \"Y'all pulled that shit. You jumped on the band wagon with Weeks. I always been straight with you. That shit is f-ked up. You and your girl f-ked up.\" Jones PD-119 Report (Jan. 22, 2008). Both Plaintiffs also believe that their lowered performance ratings of \"meets expectations\" by Sgt. Podorski in November 2007 were motivated by retaliatory animus.\n    <footnotemark>\n     24\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    The District counters that Plaintiffs' retaliation claims fail, primarily because the claims are based on the same facts as the hostile work environment claims, which the District argues have not been established. As stated above, the Court disagrees with the premise of this argument.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    The District also argues that Plaintiffs' allegations are insufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of their employment, but, again, the Court disagrees. Plaintiffs' allegations suggest that, in the wake of their taking concrete steps to raise their claims of discrimination and harassment based on sexual orientation in fall 2007, Sgt. Podorski and, later, Sgt. Washington became increasingly hostile toward them. In particular, Plaintiffs attribute Sgt. Podorski's lowered performance evaluations in 2007 as well as increased anger and hostility from Sgts. Podorski and Washington in late 2007 and January 2008 to retaliatory motives. From the written record, the Court cannot make the credibility determinations needed to decide the facts,\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , whether the alleged harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to interfere with Plaintiffs' abilities to perform their jobs, and whether it was provoked by disdain for their sexual orientation or in retaliation for their complaints.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    The District's motion for summary judgment will be denied as to Count VII.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    <strong>\n     III.

The motion will be granted as to Counts III and V in Plaintiffs' Third Amended Complaint [Dkt. 26]; Counts II, IV, VI, and IX, which Ms. Jones has withdrawn, will be dismissed with prejudice.

The Vaughan-Roach Report, authored by an MPD employee named Sharon Vaughan-Roach, included a summary of internal mediation related to Plaintiffs' complaints, as well as Ms. Vaughan-Roach's findings regarding the allegations. There is insufficient information in the record regarding Ms. Vaughan-Roach's qualifications or seniority to attribute her findings to MPD; the Court may cite to this and other administrative documents in the record in analyzing the claims at bar to the extent the documents provide evidence of timing.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"16\">\n    <p id=\"p-163\">\n     Sgt.

Plaintiffs also cite to other portions of Sgt. Branham's testimony in which she attributes motives to the alleged behavior of Sgts. Podorski and Washington. To the extent that these portions of Sgt.

As will be explained below, the Court finds that the allegations concerning some of Sgt. Washington's remarks (\n     <em>\n      e.g.\n     </em>\n     , \"You and your girl f-ked up\") and behavior could support Count VII, which alleges a\n     <em>\n      retaliatory\n     </em>\n     hostile work environment, but not Count I, which alleges a hostile work environment based on sexual orientation.
