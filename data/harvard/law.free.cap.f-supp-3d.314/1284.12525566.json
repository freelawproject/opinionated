On October 20, 2017, Defendant Southern-Owners Insurance Company (\"SOIC\") filed Defendant Southern-Owners Insurance Company's Response in Opposition to Zurich American Insurance Company's Motion for Final Summary Judgment (Doc. 91; SOIC's Response), and on December 1, 2017, Plaintiff Zurich American Insurance Company (\"ZAIC\") filed Zurich American Insurance Company's Response to Southern Owners Insurance Company's Motion for Final Summary Judgment (Doc. 98; ZAIC's Response).

Background and Undisputed Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This dispute between two insurers arises from an underlying premises liability action, Case No. 2012-CA-13359 (\"Underlying Action\"), filed by Charles McMillan (\"McMillan\") in the Circuit Court, Fourth Judicial Circuit, In and For Duval County, Florida. In the Underlying Action, McMillan asserted a negligence claim against Catamount Constructors, Inc. (\"Catamount\").\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint (Doc. 91-1; Underlying Amended Complaint). ZAIC undertook Catamount's defense and settled McMillan's claims against Catamount.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff, Zurich American Insurance Company's Third Amended Complaint (Doc. 77; Third Amended Complaint) \u00b6\u00b6 18, 22;\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   ZAIC's Response to SOIC Second Request for Production (Docs. 88-9, 88-10, 88-11 and 88-12; collectively, Bill Analysis Report). In the instant action, ZAIC brings a claim for equitable subrogation to recover its defense costs and indemnity payment made on behalf of Catamount, or in the alternative, a claim for equitable contribution as to ZAIC's indemnity payment, based on the following undisputed facts.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Third Amended Complaint \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Subcontract Between Catamount and Duval\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Catamount served as the general contractor for a construction project in which it contracted to furnish and install a complete gravel/sand sub-base package (the \"Project\") at the Dr. Pepper West Point Trade Center, a distribution warehouse located at 2300 Pickettville Road, Jacksonville, Florida 32220 (the \"Site\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Subcontract Agreement Between Catamount and Duval (Doc. 88-1; Subcontract) at 2 \u00b6 1. On April 12, 2012, Catamount and Duval Concrete Contracting (\"Duval\") executed the Subcontract, whereby Duval agreed to \"furnish[ ] all labor, materials, tools, equipment and insurance necessary to\" complete the Project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Additionally, Duval agreed to \"indemnify and hold Contractor [Catamount] harmless from all claims, losses, fines, penalties, assessments of damages arising out of Subcontractor's [Duval's] work or from Subcontractor's breach of any term hereof.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 \u00b6 19. Further, Duval agreed to maintain liability insurance which named Catamount as an additional insured, and would provide primary coverage to Catamount for any \"liability arising out of\" Duval's work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4 \u00b6 11, Attachment C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Duval's Policy with SOIC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In accordance with the terms of the Subcontract, Duval purchased, and on April 19, 2011, SOIC issued a commercial general liability policy effective from June 15, 2011, through June 15, 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Southern-Owners Insurance Company's Certified General Liability Insurance Policy No. 072322-78005160-11 (Doc. 88-2; SOIC Policy). According to the Blanket Additional Insured Endorsement (SOIC Policy at 42; the \"Endorsement\"), \"[a] person or organization is an Additional Insured, only with respect to\n   <em>\n    liability arising out of 'your work\n   </em>\n   ' for that Additional Insured by or for you [Duval]... If required in a written contract or agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Endorsement (emphasis added). Further, the SOIC Policy \"is primary for the Additional Insured, but only with respect to\n   <em>\n    liability arising out of 'your work'\n   </em>\n   for that Additional Insured by or for you. Other insurance available to the Additional Insured will apply as excess insurance and not contribute as primary insurance to the insurance provided by this endorsement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The SOIC Policy defines \"your work\" as \"(1) [w]ork or operations performed by you or on your behalf; and (2) [m]aterials, parts or equipment\n   furnished in connection with such work or operations.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SOIC Policy at 41 \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Catamount's Policy with ZAIC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ZAIC issued a commercial insurance policy to Catamount, effective from March 1, 2012 through March 1, 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Zurich American Insurance Company's Policy No. GLA 5490400-00 (Docs. 88-3 and 88-4; collectively, ZAIC Policy). The ZAIC Policy provided excess insurance \"over [a]ny other primary insurance available to you [Catamount] covering liability for damages arising out of the premises or operation, or the products and completed operations, for which you have been added as an additional insured by attachment of an endorsement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 88-3) at 58 \u00b6 4(1)(b). Further, the ZAIC Policy provided that \"[w]hen this insurance is excess, we will have no duty...to defend the insured against any 'suit' if any other insurer has a duty to defend the insured against that 'suit.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 58 \u00b6 4(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Underlying Action and ZAIC's Defense of Catamount\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   McMillan initiated the Underlying Action on December 13, 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Underlying Action Docket (Doc. 90-2). On May 6, 2013, the state court granted McMillan's motion to file an amended complaint to add Catamount as a defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Underlying Action Docket; Underlying Amended Complaint. On April 15, 2014, with leave of court, Catamount filed a third-party complaint against Duval for indemnification, contribution, and negligence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Underlying Action Docket at 6. On January 6, 2015, McMillan, with Duval's consent, sought leave to file the Second Amended Complaint (Doc. 88-5; Underlying Second Amended Complaint) to add Duval as a defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Motion for Leave to Amend Complaint (Doc. 91-2; McMillan's Motion to Amend). The Underlying Action Docket shows no order resolving McMillan's Motion to Amend.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Underlying Action Docket. Nevertheless, on February 10, 2015, Duval filed an answer to the Underlying Second Amended Complaint, and then, as reflected by the filings on the Underlying Action Docket, Duval and the other named defendants litigated the Underlying Action based upon the Underlying Second Amended Complaint until the parties reached a settlement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the Underlying Second Amended Complaint, McMillan asserted negligence claims against Catamount and Duval based on the following allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Underlying Second Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 25-42. On May 30, 2012, McMillan visited the Site and \"slipped and fell due an accumulation of debris as he walked across an outside parking lot area of the bottling plant towards a port-o-let\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   where Defendant Catamount had begun construction work and established a construction site,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28, and where \"Duval had previously begun concrete cutting work and had established a construction site,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. \"The accumulation of debris on the outside walk ways was a defectively dangerous condition and/or the causes and/or origins thereof were created by and/or known to\" Catamount and Duval, \"or had existed for a sufficiently long period of time that said Defendant[s] in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known of said condition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30, 39. Catamount and Duval, each acting \"for themselves or by and through their respective agents, employees or servants\n   acting within the course and scope of their respective employments and authority,\" breached their respective duties of care owed to McMillan by:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   a) failing to properly instruct their respective employees, agents, and/or servants as to the proper care and maintenance of the outer areas and walkways, and thereby knowingly permitting a dangerous condition(s) to remain on the premises to the peril of the Plaintiff, and/or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   b) failing to provide reasonable and adequate warnings of the actually or constructively known dangerous condition(s) and/or the potential for danger and injury to the Plaintiff, and/or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   c) failing to operate or maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition for protection of the Plaintiff. [sic]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   d) failing to maintain the outer area of the Defendant's business was [sic] caused a debris/slip condition and failing to provide a safe, slip-free walkway surface.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31, 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   ZAIC initially assumed Catamount's defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter dated April 15, 2014, from Tom Finch, Claim Specialist, with Zurich American Insurance Company to Duval Concrete Contracting (Doc. 77-6; First Tender) at 2. Having done so, ZAIC hired the law offices of Conroy Simberg to represent Catamount.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Bill Analysis Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On the same day that Catamount filed the third-party complaint against Duval, ZAIC, pursuant to the Subcontract, tendered the defense and indemnity of Catamount to Duval and requested that Duval notify its insurer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Tender at 2-3. Upon ZAIC's discovery that SOIC issued a commercial general liability policy to Duval, ZAIC made a second tender to Duval, and a first tender to SOIC, on June 22, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter dated June 22, 2015 from Michele Mecca, MCU Specialist with Zurich American Insurance Company to O'Hara Law Firm, Southern-Owners Insurance Company and All Lines Insurance Agency, Inc. (Doc. 77-7; Second Tender).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   SOIC denied the Second Tender on July 30, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter dated July 30, 2015 from Mark F. Shannahan, AIC, with Southern-Owners Insurance Company to Michele Mecca, with Zurich American Insurance Company (Doc. 77-8; SOIC Denial).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On November 9, 2015, ZAIC issued a check in the amount of $275,000 to settle McMillan's claims against Catamount.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bill Analysis Report (Doc. 88-12) at 37. ZAIC incurred and expended $83,474.82 in attorney's fees and defense costs in defense of Catamount in the Underlying Action.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Bill Analysis Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On September 29, 2017 (Doc. 90-1; State Court Order), some two years after the settlement of McMillan's claims and the filing of this action, the Honorable Karen Cole granted summary judgment in favor of Duval on Catamount's third party claim for indemnification based on her determination that Duval was not obligated to indemnify Catamount for its liability to McMillan.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   In reaching her conclusion, Judge Cole determined that \"the only claim ever made by the Plaintiff [McMillan] against the Defendant general contractor Catamount was for direct liability arising out of negligent acts\n   by Catamount rather than for vicarious liability arising out of negligent acts by Catamount's subcontractor, Duval Concrete.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Construing the indemnification provision of the Subcontract, Judge Cole concluded that Catamount was not entitled to indemnification for its own negligence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, Duval prevailed in the state court indemnification action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Instant Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On August 21, 2015, ZAIC initiated this action to recover its attorney's fees, defense costs, and the settlement payment from SOIC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff, Zurich American Insurance Company's Complaint for Declaratory Judgment (Doc. 1; Complaint);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Bill Analysis Report. Because ZAIC has amended its pleading several times,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Third Amended Complaint, filed with leave of Court on June 1, 2017,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Order Granting Plaintiff's Unopposed Motion for Leave to Amend (Doc. 75), is the operative pleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In the Third Amended Complaint, ZAIC asserts two causes of action against SOIC: a claim in Count I for equitable subrogation in which it seeks reimbursement of the attorney's fees and costs incurred in the defense of Catamount in the Underlying Action, as well as indemnity or reimbursement for the sum paid in the settlement of McMillan's claim against Catamount,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Third Amended Complaint at 7-8; and in Count II, an alternative claim for contribution in which it seeks reimbursement of any amount paid in excess of Catamount's pro rata share of the insurers' common liability,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On June 14, 2017, SOIC moved to dismiss the Third Amended Complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Southern-Owners Insurance Company's Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Third Amended Complaint for Lack of Subject Matter Jurisdiction (Doc. 79; Motion to Dismiss). ZAIC filed a response on June 28, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff, Zurich American Insurance Company's, Response to Defendant, Southern-Owners Insurance Company's, Motion to Dismiss Zurich's Third Amended Complaint (Doc. 80). Upon review, the Court determined that it had subject matter jurisdiction over the claims in the Third Amended Complaint and denied SOIC's Motion to Dismiss on February 26, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order (Doc. 101; Order Denying Motion to Dismiss).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Thereafter, the parties filed their respective cross-motions for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   ZAIC's Motion and SOIC's Motion. In ZAIC's Motion, ZAIC purports to seek entry of final summary judgment in its favor on both its claim for equitable subrogation, and its claim for contribution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ZAIC's Motion at 1-3. However, although mentioning its claim for contribution in passing,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ZAIC's Motion at 1-2, 9-10, 12, ZAIC's arguments in support of entry of summary judgment focus almost entirely on its claim in Count I for equitable subrogation. With regard to that claim, ZAIC's position is that McMillan's\n   allegations in the Underlying Second Amended Complaint triggered SOIC's obligation to provide primary coverage to Catamount as an additional insured.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14; ZAIC's Response at 6-10. As such, pursuant to the other insurance clause in the ZAIC Policy, ZAIC was Catamount's excess insurer and SOIC was its primary insurer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7, 13-14. Under a theory of equitable subrogation, ZAIC maintains that SOIC is obligated to reimburse ZAIC for all of the defense costs and attorney's fees expended on Catamount's behalf in the Underlying Action, as well as the settlement sum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ZAIC's Motion at 14-21. Further, ZAIC contends that SOIC's failure to defend Catamount under a reservation of rights agreement precludes SOIC from challenging the amount of its defense costs or the settlement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ZAIC's Reply at 6-7. ZAIC also asserts that it is entitled to recover the attorney's fees it incurred in this litigation pursuant to Florida Statute section 627.428.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   SOIC views the matter very differently. Generally, SOIC disputes ZAIC's premise that Catamount was an additional insured under the SOIC Policy with respect to the claims raised in the Underlying Action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SOIC's Response at 3; SOIC's Motion at 16-21. Specifically, SOIC disputes ZAIC's contention that the Underlying Second Amended Complaint is the operative pleading, and contends that the Court should determine its coverage obligations based on the Underlying Amended Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SOIC's Response at 2-3; SOIC's Motion at 4. Nevertheless, SOIC asserts that none of McMillan's pleadings in the Underlying Action triggered additional insured coverage for Catamount because McMillan did not sue Catamount based on a theory of vicarious liability for Duval's negligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SOIC's Motion at 16-21. SOIC contends that Judge Cole's finding in the State Court Order that McMillan sought to hold Catamount directly liable for its own negligence rather than vicariously liable for Duval's negligence is binding on the Court under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SOIC's Response at 6-13. In support of this argument, albeit in a separate motion, SOIC requests that the Court take judicial notice of the State Court Order and the Underlying Action Docket.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Southern-Owners Insurance Company's Motion Requesting the Court Take Judicial Notice of State Court Order and State Court Docket (Doc. 90; Motion for Judicial Notice). In response to this request, ZAIC contends that the Court may not take judicial notice of a state court's order to establish the facts and legal conclusions within the order, and regardless, collateral estoppel is inapplicable here because the issues before the state court and this Court are not identical.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff, Zurich American Insurance Company's Opposition to Defendant's Motion for Judicial Notice (Doc. 92; ZAIC's Opposition);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ZAIC's Reply at 7-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Although arguing that no issues of fact prevent entry of judgment in its favor, SOIC also argues that issues of fact do preclude entry of judgment in favor of ZAIC. Specifically, SOIC contends that even if it owed Catamount a defense in the Underlying Action, ZAIC is not entitled to reimbursement for the full settlement payment because there are material issues of fact regarding how to apportion the settlement amount between the amount attributable to Duval's negligence and that attributable to Catamount's negligence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SOIC's Response at 5-6. Further, SOIC argues that if the Court were to find that it owed Catamount a defense based on the Underlying Second Amended Complaint, it would not be obligated to reimburse ZAIC for the defense costs and attorney's fees incurred prior to ZAIC's Second Tender dated June 22, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Notably, like ZAIC, although purporting to seek entry of final summary judgment\n   on all claims in this action, SOIC does not specifically address ZAIC's alternative claim for contribution in SOIC's Motion.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   SOIC Motion. Nor does SOIC address that claim in SOIC's Response.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   SOIC Response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

P. 1.190(a). Although the state court did not enter an order ruling on McMillan's Motion to Amend, SOIC does not dispute that all the defendants in the Underlying Action, including Duval, consented to the filing of the Underlying Second Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Underlying Action Docket. Not only does Duval fail to dispute that McMillan's Motion to Amend was unopposed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   McMillan's Motion to Amend at 2 \u00b6 5, but all defendants, including Catamount and Duval, treated the Underlying Second Amended Complaint as having been properly filed-in that each filed answers to the Underlying Second Amended Complaint and actively litigated the case based on the allegations of the Underlying Second Amended Complaint.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Underlying Action Docket. Having done so, SOIC, which stands in the shoes of Duval, cannot now be heard to claim that the Underlying Second Amended Complaint was not the pleading that governed the parties' obligations in the Underlying Action. Indeed, SOIC acknowledges that prior to Judge Cole's entry of the State Court Order on September 29, 2017, none of the parties in the Underlying Action or this action even realized that the state court had not entered an order granting McMillan's Motion to Amend.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SOIC's Response at 2-3.

Notably, in the Underlying Amended Complaint, McMillan did not assert any claims against Duval, mention Duval by name, make any factual allegations regarding Duval's concrete cutting work or its presence on the premises, or identify Duval's work as a potential cause of the debris.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Underlying Amended Complaint. However, in the Underlying Second Amended Complaint, McMillan asserted a negligence claim against Duval and specifically alleged that Duval's concrete cutting work contributed to the accumulation of debris that caused him to fall.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Underlying Second Amended Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 34-42. Thus, because the Second Amended Complaint significantly enlarged the scope of the issues involved in the Underlying Action by identifying Duval as the cause (or potential cause) of the accumulated debris, the Court would find its allegations determinative of SOIC's coverage obligations. Thus, the Court now turns to the merits of the parties' contentions regarding SOIC's duty, if any, to Catamount for the claims raised in the Underlying Second Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Endorsement in the SOIC policy provides that \"[a] person or organization is an Additional Insured, only with respect to liability arising out of 'your work' for that Additional Insured by or for you [Duval]\u2026 If required in a written contract or agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Endorsement.

However, SOIC contends that McMillan did not allege that Catamount's liability arose out of Duval's work because McMillan sued Catamount for Catamount's own negligence rather than on \"theories of vicarious, constructive, derivative, or technical liability...based upon the active fault of Duval Concrete.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SOIC's Motion at\n   16.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   SOIC further contends that the doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes ZAIC from relitigating the basis of McMillan's claim against Catamount because ZAIC is bound by Judge Cole's finding in the State Court Order on Catamount's indemnity claim in which the state court determined that McMillan sued Catamount \"for direct liability arising out of negligent acts by Catamount rather than for vicarious liability arising out of negligent acts by.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SOIC's Response at 6-11; State Court Order at 4.

Further, unlike the\n   <em>\n    Evanston\n   </em>\n   parties who contributed to the plaintiff's injuries in entirely different ways, (i.e., negligent design and negligent installation), McMillan sued both Catamount and Duval for negligently creating and failing to remove the same accumulation of debris. Thus, unlike the\n   <em>\n    Evanston\n   </em>\n   insurer, SOIC would not have \"found itself in a conflict of interest\" had it assumed Catamount's defense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Evanston\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4340804\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/775/1268/\">\n    775 F.3d at 1279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Ultimately, the Court, persuaded by\n   <em>\n    Fla. Power &amp; Light\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Container Corp. of Am.\n   </em>\n   , and the consistent authority following those decisions, finds that the Endorsement either expressly fails to limit its coverage to vicarious liability, or is, at best, ambiguous as to whether SOIC's coverage obligations are limited to claims based on vicarious liability. Because ambiguous policies are to be interpreted broadly in favor of coverage, the Court will not read a vicarious liability limitation into the Endorsement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gas Kwick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414142\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/58/1536/#p1539\">\n    58 F.3d at 1539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Had ZAIC wished to limit Catamount's coverage to claims of vicarious liability only, it certainly could have done so. Indeed, its need to include such limiting language should have been readily apparent to SOIC in April of 2011 when it issued the policy given that\n   <em>\n    Fla. Power &amp; Light Co.\n   </em>\n   was decided in 1995 and the Florida Supreme Court decided the\n   <em>\n    Container Corp. of Am.\n   </em>\n   case in 1998.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Monticello\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%20667454\">\n    2009 WL 667454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at **10-11. Because ZAIC did not include language limiting its coverage to Catamount to vicarious liability, it cannot now seek such a restrictive view of its coverage obligations. Here, the Court finds that Catamount was entitled to a defense against all allegations that \"originat[ed] from,\" were \"incident to,\" or \"ha[d] a connection with,\" Duval's work.\n   <em>\n    Taurus\n   </em>\n   , 913 So.2d at 539. As such, the Court need not determine whether Judge Cole's finding that McMillan sued Catamount for direct negligence and not under a theory of vicarious liability for Duval's negligence is entitled to preclusive effect under the doctrine of collateral estoppel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The issue before the Court is\n   whether McMillan's allegations suggest that Catamount's liability arose out of Duval's work, which is not dependent on any a theory of vicarious liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Court finds that McMillan's allegations were sufficient to trigger SOIC's duty to defend Catamount because they raised the possibility that Catamount's liability arose from Duval's work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grissom v.

In the Underlying Second Amended Complaint, McMillan alleged that while visiting the Site, he slipped and fell on an accumulation of debris in an area where Catamount established a construction site and where \"Duval had previously begun concrete cutting work.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28, 37. McMillan further alleged that Catamount and Duval knew about the accumulation,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 30, 39, but breached their duties of care owed to McMillan by:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   e) failing to properly instruct their respective employees, agents, and/or servants as to the proper care and maintenance of the outer areas and walkways, and thereby knowingly permitting a dangerous condition(s) to remain on the premises to the peril of the Plaintiff, and/or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   f) failing to provide reasonable and adequate warnings of the actually or constructively known dangerous condition(s) and/or the potential for danger and injury to the Plaintiff, and/or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   g) failing to operate or maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition for protection of the Plaintiff.

McMillan's claim against Catamount for its own negligence does not preclude the possibility that Catamount's liability could be connected to, originate from, or grow out of, Duval's concrete cutting work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Category 5 Mgmt.

Indeed, Duval is alleged to have been cutting concrete in the area where McMillan slipped and to have known about the accumulation of debris in that area.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37, 39. At the very least, McMillan's allegations suggest that there was \"more than a mere coincident\" \"causal connection or relationship\" between Catamount's liability and Duval's concrete cutting work.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Taurus\n   </em>\n   , 913 So.2d at 539. Accordingly, the Court finds that the allegations in the Underlying Second Amended Complaint triggered SOIC's duty to defend Catamount. Because Catamount was an additional insured under the SOIC Policy and entitled to primary coverage from SOIC,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Endorsement, ZAIC was only obligated to provide excess coverage to Catamount,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ZAIC Policy (Doc. 88-3) at 58 \u00b6 4(2). Moreover, pursuant to the plain terms of the ZAIC Policy, as an excess insurer ZAIC had no duty to defend Catamount.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Union Fire Ins.

In doing so, ZAIC did not act as a volunteer. SOIC, not ZAIC, was primarily liable for providing a defense to Catamount. And ZAIC paid the entire amount of Catamount's debt.

Further, even after the close of discovery, SOIC did not seek leave to file a surreply to ZAIC's Reply, which addresses the discovery issue, or to supplement the record with newly discovered evidence. Moreover, in SOIC's Motion, filed on November 20, 2017, SOIC does not assert that any of ZAIC's attorney's fees and defense costs are non-recoverable.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   SOIC's Motion. Accordingly, SOIC's suggestion that entry of summary judgment would be premature is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Here, because the Court finds, as a matter of law, that SOIC owed Catamount a duty to defend and breached that duty, it is liable to ZAIC for the defense costs and attorney's fees incurred and paid on Catamount's behalf. In the SOIC Response, SOIC fails to raise any genuine issue of fact with regard to the reasonableness of the attorney's fees and costs incurred and paid by ZAIC in defending Catamount. Indeed, because ZAIC actually paid the fees and costs, they are presumed to be reasonable, and SOIC has failed to point to any facts that might arguably rebut such a conclusion. Thus, the Court finds that the attorney's fees and costs expended by ZAIC in Catamount's defense are reasonable and ZAIC is entitled to recover as damages for its claim for equitable subrogation all such fees and costs attributable to SOIC's breach of its duty to defend Catamount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   ZAIC's Bill Analysis Report reflects that ZAIC incurred and expended $83,474.82 in attorney's fees and defense costs since May 2, 2013, the date the court granted McMillan's Motion to file the Underlying Amended Complaint and add Catamount as a defendant.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Bill Analysis Report. However, although ZAIC bases its claim regarding SOIC's duty to defend on the allegations of the Underlying Second Amended Complaint, ZAIC appears to seek reimbursement for all of its attorney's fees without addressing the basis for its entitlement to fees incurred before McMillan asserted facts implicating Duval. For its part, SOIC asserts that, at most, ZAIC would be entitled to reimbursement only of fees and costs incurred after the Second Tender.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SOIC's Response at 4-5. Neither party cites any legal authority for its position, nor does either attempt to calculate the portion of fees and costs incurred following the filing of McMillan's Motion to Amend or the Second Tender. The Court declines to attempt to make that calculation in the first instance. Rather, the Court will direct the parties to confer and attempt to reach an agreement as to the date from which the damages flowing from SOIC's breach of its duty to defend are to be calculated and the amount of attorney's fees and costs ZAIC is due to be reimbursed for its defense of Catamount in the Underlying Action. In doing so the Court cautions that at this stage of the proceeding, the only remaining question is the date on which the Court begins its calculation and the mathematical calculation of the total. If the parties are unable to agree, each shall file a supplemental brief on the issue of this element of damages with citations to the record, and applicable authority if necessary, no later than June 15, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Reimbursement for the Amount of the Settlement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Next, the Court will address SOIC's duty to indemnify ZAIC for the settlement amount. ZAIC paid $275,000.00 to settle McMillan's claims against Catamount.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Billing Report Analysis (Doc. 88-9) at 5 and (Doc. 88-12) at 37. However, SOIC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   contends that even if it were obligated to defend Catamount in the Underlying Action, there are \"material facts in dispute with respect to apportionment of fault between Catamount and Duval Concrete.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SOIC's Response at 5. SOIC maintains that the SOIC Policy \"does not provide indemnity for Catamount's own negligence,\" and therefore, \"[t]he Court will have to weigh the facts/evidence in the Underlying Suit to determine what percent of Catamount's settlement payment to the Underlying Plaintiff is attributable to Duval Concrete's negligence, if any, and what percent is attributable to Catamount's negligence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6. In response, ZAIC contends that SOIC's failure to defend Catamount in the Underlying Action precludes SOIC from \"seek[ing] to apportion the settlement amount paid by ZAIC after the fact.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ZAIC's Reply at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Under Florida law, when an insurer refuses to defend and indemnify its insured for a covered claim, the insured, or its subrogee, is entitled to reimbursement for the judgment or settlement amount.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nova Cas.

There is no dispute that McMillan's negligence claim was covered under the SOIC Policy. The Court does not face a situation where the parties settled multiple claims, only some of which were entitled to coverage.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Highland Holdings, Inc. v.

Moreover, nothing in the record suggests even an inference of bad faith, fraud or collusion. Even SOIC does not argue that material facts are in dispute as to such issues. Accordingly, the Court finds that ZAIC is entitled to recover the full amount of the settlement as damages for its claim for equitable subrogation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Count II-Alternative Claim for Contribution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   As previously noted, although both ZAIC and SOIC seek entry of final summary\n   judgment, neither specifically addresses the claim in Count II for contribution, the elements of such a claim,\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   or how the undisputed facts support or fail to support the entry of judgment on such a claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, ZAIC fails to address how on the record before the Court at this stage, the Court could resolve its request for a determination of the pro rata share of liability attributable to Catamount. In light of the Court's resolution of the claim for equitable subrogation in Count I, any discussion of the contribution claim may be either academic or entirely moot. Nevertheless, in an abundance of caution, the Court will allow the parties to confer and advise the Court whether ZAIC wishes to dismiss or abandon the contribution claim, or whether the parties, having failed to file properly supported motions for summary judgment on that claim, intend to proceed to trial to resolve the claim for contribution.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Upon review, the Court finds that ZAIC's Motion is due to be granted as to its claim for equitable subrogation in Count I of the Third Amended Complaint. This is so because SOIC was obligated to defend Catamount in the Underlying Action, the SOIC Policy provided primary coverage for McMillan's claims in the Underlying Action, SOIC breached its duty to defend Catamount, ZAIC reasonably incurred attorney's fees and costs on behalf of Catamount as a result of the breach, and ZAIC is entitled to be reimbursed for its attorney's fees and costs as well as for the full amount paid in settlement of its claims in the Underlying Action. However, the Court will defer entry of judgment pending clarification as to the proper amount of attorney's fees incurred in defense of the Underlying Action that will be included in the judgment. To the extent ZAIC seeks entry of summary judgment on its alternative claim in Count II for contribution or its claim for the attorney's fees and costs incurred in pursuing this action, ZAIC's Motion is due to be denied without prejudice. In light of the Court's resolution of ZAIC's Motion, SOIC's Motion, seeking to establish that SOIC was not so obligated, is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Accordingly, it is\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   1.
