INTRODUCTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before this Court is the United States of America's (\"Plaintiff\" or \"United States\") Motion for a Preliminary Injunction (\"Motion\"). Plaintiff seeks an Order from this Court enjoining enforcement of certain provisions of three laws enacted by the State of California (\"Defendant\" or \"California\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   through Assembly Bill 103 (\"AB 103\"), Assembly Bill 450 (\"AB 450\") and Senate Bill 54 (\"SB 54\"). Specifically, Plaintiff requests that this Court preliminarily enjoin the following provisions of California law: (1) California Government Code Section 12532 (as added by AB 103); (2) California Government Code Sections 7285.1 and 7285.2 and California Labor Code Sections 90.2 and 1019.2 as applied to private employers only (as added by AB 450); and (3) California Government Code Sections 7284.6(a)(1)(C), 7284.6(a)(1)(D), and 7284.6(a)(4) (as added by SB 54). Plaintiff claims that these statutes violate the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, Art. VI, cl.2, and are invalid. Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 61, 63 &amp; 65. Plaintiff argues that federal law preempts each provision because, in the area of immigration enforcement, California \"lacks the authority to intentionally interfere with private citizens' [and state and local employees'] ability to cooperate voluntarily with the United States or to comply with federal obligations.\" Motion for Preliminary Injunction (\"Mot.\"), ECF No. 2-1, at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff also contends that California \"has no authority to target facilities holding federal detainees pursuant to a federal contract for an inspection scheme to review the 'due process' afforded during arrest and detention.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, Plaintiff implores this Court to enjoin these state law provisions because they \"stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress and are therefore preempted by federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendant vigorously opposes Plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Opp'n, ECF No. 74, contending that these three state laws properly \"allocate the use of limited law-enforcement resources, provide workplace protections, and protect the rights of [California's] residents.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. Defendant further argues that these statutes \"are consistent with applicable federal law and do not interfere with the federal government's responsibility over immigration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Defendant claims that it \"acted squarely within its constitutional authority when it enacted the law[s] [the United States seeks to enjoin] here[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   None of the state laws, according to Defendant, \"conflict[ ] with federal law or undermine[ ] the federal government's authority or ability to undertake immigration enforcement and all are consistent with the legislative framework [of the immigration laws and regulations].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This Motion presents unique and novel constitutional issues. The Court must answer\n   the complicated question of where the United States' enumerated power over immigration ends and California's reserved police power begins. The Court must also resolve the issue of whether state sovereignty includes the power to forbid state agents and private citizens from voluntarily complying with a federal program. Plaintiff's Motion requires this Court to carefully examine the purposes and principles of the federalist system-a system, established by the Constitution, of dual sovereignty between the States and the Federal Government whose principal benefit may be \"a check on abuses of government power.\"\n   <em>\n    Gregory v.

The law is clear that so long as the Federal Government is acting within the powers granted to it under the Constitution, Congress may impose its will on the States.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108302\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/452/#p458\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108302\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/452/#p458\">\n    at 460\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108302\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/452/#p458\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2395\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

With respect to the other three challenged provisions of AB 450, the Court finds that California has impermissibly infringed on the sovereignty of the United States. Plaintiff's Motion is therefore denied in part and granted in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.

Before the Court can grant the requested relief, Plaintiff must establish-as to each challenged law-that it is likely to succeed on the merits of its claim, that it is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief, that the balance of the equities tips in its favor, and that an injunction is in the public interest.\n   <em>\n    Winter v.

In the Ninth Circuit, an injunction may also be proper \"if there is a likelihood of irreparable injury to plaintiff; there are serious questions going to the merits; the balance of hardships tips sharply in favor of the plaintiff; and the injunction is in the public interest.\"\n   <em>\n    M.R. v.

Art. VI, cl. 2. The Tenth Amendment limits the powers of the United States to those which the Constitution delegates, reserving the remaining powers to the States. U.S. Const. amend. X (\"The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\").

Despite that concern, the question before the Court is limited to Plaintiff's Supremacy Clause claim and the relationship between the State and the Federal Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiff's preemption argument rests on the notion that Congress presumed immigration enforcement officers could gain access to worksites by consent of the employer. Mot. at 11-13. Plaintiff contends the entire enforcement scheme is premised on this authority.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207285.1\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Defendant does not dispute that immigration enforcement agents could, prior to AB 450, gain access to nonpublic areas of a worksite through employer consent. In enacting AB 450, the state legislators acknowledged that immigration officers could do so under existing law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Exh. J (Senate Judiciary Committee Report),\n   ECF No. 171-10. But, Defendant argues, the entry and access provisions do not conflict with IRCA because \"IRCA was not intended to diminish states' labor protections.\" Opp'n at 26. Because AB 450 permits entry and access pursuant to judicial warrant (or subpoena, for documents), or when otherwise required by federal law, Defendant claims the law does not deny the \"reasonable access to examine evidence\" required under IRCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a(e)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The arguments are wanting on both sides. By attempting to narrow the Court's focus to the criminal penalties at issue under IRCA, Defendant fails to acknowledge that immigration enforcement officers might also seek to investigate civil violations of the immigration laws or pursue investigative activities outside of IRCA's provisions. As Plaintiff pointed out at the June 20, 2018, hearing on its Motion, Trans. at 114:20-115:11, IRCA added new sections to the already existing law governing immigration enforcement activities; Defendant did not address any of these other grants of power. Further, Defendant cites no authority for its proposition that AB 450's judicial warrant requirement and savings clause together constitute \"reasonable access\" under IRCA. Irrespective of the State's interest in protecting workers, the Court finds that the warrant requirement may impede immigration enforcement's investigation of employers or other matters within their authority to investigate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Even though these two subsections of AB 450 interfere with immigration enforcement's historical practices, the Court hesitates to find the statutes preempted. In preemption analysis, the Court presumes \" 'the historic police powers of the States' are not superseded 'unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.' \"\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p398\">\n    567 U.S. at 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p398\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Laws governing labor relations and the workplace generally fall within the States' police powers. Congress has not expressly authorized immigration officers to enter places of labor upon employer consent, nor has Congress authorized immigration enforcement officers to wield authority coextensive with the Fourth Amendment. Although Plaintiff's cited cases show instances of immigration enforcement lawfully exercising its investigative authority in accordance with the Fourth Amendment, none of these cases establish that Congress has expressly or impliedly granted immigration enforcement agents such authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    I.N.S. v.

Nor do these cases show consent to be an essential pillar of the enforcement regime. Certainly, obstacle preemption may be \"implied,\" but precedent counsels against reading Congressional \"presumptions\" or \"assumptions\" into the statutes without a more robust record than that presently before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Ultimately, however, the Court need not resolve the preemption issue because Plaintiff is likely to succeed on its Supremacy Clause claim under the intergovernmental immunity doctrine. The doctrine applies in these circumstances even though the laws regulate employers and not the Federal Government directly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12033629\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/803/#p814\">\n    489 U.S. at 814, 817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12033629\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/803/#p814\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Phillips Chem.

These fines inflict a burden on those employers who acquiesce in a federal investigation but not on those who do not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Defendant argues the application of the doctrine in these circumstances would expand its reach. It notes that the intergovernmental immunity cases evaluating indirect discrimination have typically concerned laws that imposed burdens on entities contracting with, or supplying something to, the Federal Government, thus \"dealing\" with the United States in an economic sense. Trans. at 93:1-95:6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court is not convinced that the term \"deal\" is circumscribed in the manner Defendant suggests. As in other intergovernmental immunity cases, the imposition of civil fines (like the imposition of taxes) turns on whether an employer chooses to work with federal immigration enforcement. These fines are a clear attempt to \"meddl[e] with federal government activities indirectly by singling out for regulation those who deal with the government.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re NSA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3724546\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/633/892/\">\n    633 F.Supp.2d at 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court does not find Defendant's argument that the law is neutral convincing. Opp'n at 29 (arguing the law applies to \"any person or entity seeking to enforce the civil immigration laws, whether federal, state, or local\"). Given that immigration enforcement is the province of the Federal Government, it demands no stretch of reason to see that Government Code Sections 7285.1 and 7285.2, in effect, target the operations of\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   immigration enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Court finds that a law which imposes monetary penalties on an employer solely because that employer voluntarily consents to federal immigration enforcement's entry into nonpublic areas of their place of business or access to their employment records impermissibly discriminates against those who choose to deal with the Federal Government. The law and facts clearly support Plaintiff's claim as to these two subsections and Plaintiff is likely to succeed on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    Notice Requirement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   AB 450 also added a provision to the California Labor Code requiring employers to provide notice to their employees \"of any inspections of I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification forms or other employment records conducted by an immigration agency within 72 hours of receiving notice of the inspection.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2090.2\">\n    Cal.

IRCA primarily imposes obligations and penalties on employers, not employees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324a. The new California Labor Code section only requires employers to provide notice to employees if the employer itself has received notice of an impending inspection. The \"targets\" of the investigation have thus already been \"warned.\" Pursuant to federal regulations, employers are to be given at least three business days' notice prior to an I-9 inspection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8 C.F.R. \u00a7 274a.2(b)(2)(ii). The state law merely extends this prior notice to employees. Given IRCA's focus on employers, the Court finds no indication-express or implied-that Congress intended for employees to be kept in the dark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The Court declines to adopt Plaintiff's cynical view of the law. As amici point out, notice provides employees with an opportunity to cure any deficiencies in their paperwork or employment eligibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Br. for Cal. Labor Fed'n, et al., as Amici Curiae, ECF No. 134. Federal law affords such a courtesy to employers; the Court does not view an extension of that courtesy to employees as an attempt to thwart IRCA's goals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The notice provision also does not violate the intergovernmental immunity doctrine. Unlike the prohibitions on consent, violations of this provision do not turn on the employer's choice to \"deal with\" (i.e., consent to) federal law enforcement. An employer is not punished for its choice to work with the Federal Government, but for its failure to communicate with its employees. This requirement does not readily fit into the contours of the intergovernmental immunity doctrine and application would stretch the doctrine beyond its borders. The Court thus finds no merit to Plaintiff's Supremacy Clause claim as to California Labor Code Section 90.2.

Neither party provided the Court with much information on how the verification system currently works in practice and how the new law does or does not change those practices. Based on a plain reading of the statutes, the prohibition on reverification appears to stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment of Congress's purpose in enacting IRCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arizona\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p398\">\n    567 U.S. at 399-400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407266\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/387/#p398\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Congress could have chosen to tie employer liability to instances when an employer fails to verify employment eligibility when required to do so by federal law. Instead, Congress broadened liability to encompass situations when an employer knows one of its immigrant employees is or has become unauthorized to work and continues to employ them. In a single act, Congress premised criminal sanction on an employer's subjective knowledge and established a system through which employers could verify compliance with the law. As the Ninth Circuit explained in\n   <em>\n    New El Rey Sausage Co.\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   The inclusion in the statute of section 1324a(b)'s verification system demonstrates that employers, far from being allowed to employ anyone except those whom the government had shown to be unauthorized, have an affirmative duty to determine that their employees are authorized. This verification is done through the inspection of documents. Notice that these documents are incorrect places the employer in the position it would have been if the alien had failed to produce the documents in the first place: it has failed to adequately ensure that the alien is authorized.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1789147\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/925/1153/\">\n    925 F.2d at 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Prohibiting employers from reverifying employment eligibility complicates the subjective element of the crime; e.g., could an employer who might otherwise be found to \"know\" that one of its employees lacks authorization find shelter behind the state law because it could not confirm its suspicion?

Section 1373(c) governs the obligation of federal immigration authorities in responding\n   to inquiries from other government entities, and an official record of a person's citizenship or immigration status is presumably within their control. Opp'n at 12-13; Br. for City and Cnty. of San Francisco, as Amicus Curiae, at 9.

The limits on information sharing and transfers prevent or impede immigration enforcement from fulfilling its responsibilities regarding detention and removal because officers cannot arrest an immigrant upon the immigrant's release from custody and have a more difficult time finding immigrants after the fact without access to address information.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    at 25-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It contends that limiting adherence to transfer requests affords undocumented immigrants an opportunity to abscond. Plaintiff also points out that the subset of crimes for which SB 54 permits cooperation do not match the crimes under federal law that may serve as the predicate for removability or crimes for which detention is mandatory.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"262\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    at 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Additionally, it argues that requiring a judicial warrant or judicial finding of probable cause is irreconcilable with the INA, which establishes a system of civil administrative warrants as the basis for immigration arrest and removal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"263\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    at 30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The Court disagrees and instead finds that California's decision not to assist federal immigration enforcement in its endeavors is not an \"obstacle\" to that enforcement effort. Plaintiff's argument that SB 54 makes immigration enforcement far more burdensome begs the question: more burdensome than what? The laws make enforcement more burdensome than it would be if state and local law enforcement provided immigration officers with their assistance. But refusing to help is not the same as impeding. If such were the rule, obstacle preemption could be used to commandeer state resources and subvert Tenth Amendment principles. Federal objectives will always be furthered if states offer to assist federal efforts. A state's\n   decision not to assist in those activities will always make the federal object more difficult to attain than it would be otherwise. Standing aside does not equate to standing in the way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Though not analyzing an obstacle preemption claim, the Seventh Circuit recently expressed a similar view with respect to decisions to withhold assistance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Chicago v.

The Circuit explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   [T]he Attorney General repeatedly characterizes the issue as whether localities can be allowed to thwart federal law enforcement. That is a red herring. First, nothing in this case involves any affirmative interference with federal law enforcement at all, nor is there any interference whatsoever with federal immigration authorities. The only conduct at issue here is the refusal of the local law enforcement to aid in civil immigration enforcement through informing the federal authorities when persons are in their custody and providing access to those persons at the local law enforcement facility. Some localities might choose to cooperate with federal immigration efforts, and others may see such cooperation as impeding the community relationships necessary to identify and solve crimes. The choice as to how to devote law enforcement resources-including whether or not to use such resources to aid in federal immigration efforts-would traditionally be one left to state and local authorities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <em>\n    City of Chicago\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516678\" index=\"265\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/272/\">\n    888 F.3d at 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (analyzing conditions imposed on federal grants).

California has not crossed over into the exclusively federal realm of determining who may enter and remain within the United States. SB 54 only governs the activities of the State's own law enforcement agencies.

Preemption is inappropriate here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The Court's reluctance to glean such a purpose from the cited statutes is amplified because Congress indicated awareness that state law might be in tension with federal objectives and decided to tolerate those competing interests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bonito Boats, Inc. v.

In this power inheres the authority to structure and influence the relationship between state law enforcement and the community it serves. The ebb of tensions between communities and the police underscores the delicate nature of this relationship.

It claims that although \"the statute defines 'immigration authorities' to include, in addition to federal officers, 'state, or local officers, employees or persons performing immigration enforcement functions,' it also defines 'immigration enforcement' to mean 'any and all efforts to investigate, enforce, or assist in the investigation or enforcement of any federal civil immigration law, and also includes any and all efforts to investigate, enforce, or assist in the investigation or enforcement of any federal criminal immigration law that penalizes a person's presence in, entry, or reentry to, or employment in, the United States.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"316\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207284.2\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing the definitions in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"317\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207284.4\">\n    Cal.

None of the cases cited in the parties' briefs involve an analogous regulation. The preemption analysis above thus counsels against expanding the doctrine to the present situation.\n   <em>\n    North Dakota v.

Plaintiff has not identified any examples of similarly situated authorities (i.e., civil law enforcement agencies) that the State treats better than it does federal immigration authorities.

As explained in detail above, the purported \"burden\" here is California's decision not to help the Federal government implement its immigration enforcement regime. The State retains the power to make this choice and the concerns that led California to adopt this policy justify any differential treatment that results.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   For all of the reasons set forth in Part III.A.3 of this Order, the Court finds that Plaintiff is not likely to succeed on the merits of its SB 54 claim and its motion for a preliminary injunction as to this statute is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Preliminary Injunction Equitable Factors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Each party submitted evidence showing hardships to their sovereign interests and their constituencies should the Court fail to decide this Motion in their favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exhs. to Mot. and Reply, ECF Nos. 2-2-5, 46, 171-1-25, 173, 178; Exhs. to Opp'n, ECF Nos. 75, 78, 81, 83.

This Order hopefully will not be viewed through a political lens and this Court expresses no views on the soundness of the policies or statutes involved in this lawsuit. There is no place for politics in our judicial system and this one opinion will neither define nor solve the complicated immigration issues currently facing our Nation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   As noted in the Introduction to this Order, this case is about the proper application of constitutional principles to a specific factual situation. The Court reached its decision only after a careful and considered application of legal precedent. The Court did so without concern for any possible political consequences. It is a luxury, of course, that members of the other two branches of government do not share. But if there is going to be a long-term solution to the problems our country faces with respect to immigration policy, it can only come from our legislative and executive branches. It cannot and will not come from piecemeal opinions issued by the judicial branch. Accordingly, this Court joins the ever-growing chorus of Federal Judges in urging our elected officials to set aside the partisan and polarizing politics dominating the current immigration debate and work in a cooperative and bi-partisan fashion toward drafting and passing legislation that addresses this critical political issue. Our Nation deserves it. Our Constitution demands it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   IV.
