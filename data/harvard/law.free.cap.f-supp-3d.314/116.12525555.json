BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This suit arises from a professional boxing match between Prichard Colon and Terrel Williams. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 10, Dkt. 16 at 25-36. The match occurred on October\n   17, 2015 at Eagle Bank Arena in Fairfax, Virginia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. According to the complaint, the 23-year-old Prichard was an undefeated professional boxer \"considered by many in the sport to be a future world champion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mem. at 1, Dkt. 8-1. During the initial rounds of the fight, Williams allegedly \"rabbit punched\" Prichard,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , he violated boxing rules by striking Prichard on the back of the neck and head, which can cause severe injury to the brain or spinal cord.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. In the sixth round, the referee warned Williams to stop hitting Prichard in the back of the head.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. In the seventh round, Williams allegedly punched Prichard in the back of the head again, and \"Prichard fell to the canvas writhing in pain and holding the back of his head.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. The ringside doctor-Richard Ashby-then examined Prichard.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 32-35. According to the complaint, Prichard reported that he was dizzy and the back of his head hurt, which are symptoms of a brain bleed, but Dr. Ashby sent him back into the ring.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34-36. Shortly after the fight, Prichard collapsed and was taken to the hospital.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39. There, he was diagnosed with a large left-sided subdural hematoma, which required an emergent hemicraniectomy to relieve the brain swelling and evacuate the blood.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Tragically, Prichard never regained consciousness and he remained in a persistent vegetative state when this suit began.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 3, 2017, the plaintiffs-Prichard's parents Nieves and Richard Colon, along with Sean Bogle as \"legal guardian\" of Prichard's property-filed suit in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. The complaint asserted negligence claims against four defendants: (1) the ringside physician Dr. Ashby; (2) Dr. Ashby's practice, Family Practices Medical Services, P.C.; (3) the fight promoter Headbanger's Promotions, Inc.; and (4) the fight promoter DiBella Entertainment, Inc.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2, \u00b6\u00b6 6-9, 41-49. Dr. Ashby and Family Practices filed an answer on June 12, 2017. Ashby Answer, Dkt. 16 at 14-24. In the answer, they \"admit[ted] that Family Practices Medical Services, P.C. is a professional corporation through which Dr. Ashby operates a family medicine practice.\" Ashby Answer \u00b6 7. On June 14, 2017, without the consent of Dr. Ashby and Family Practices, Headbangers filed a notice of removal because Headbangers incorrectly believed that Dr. Ashby and Family Practices had not been served and because Headbangers was unable to contact them. Notice of Removal \u00b6 18, Dkt. 1; Suppl. to Notice of Removal \u00b6\u00b6 1-3, Dkt. 6. After discovering the error on June 15, 2017, Headbangers conferred with Dr. Ashby and Family Practices and obtained their oral consent to removal.

The D.C. Circuit has not weighed in conclusively on whether a dissolved or inactive corporation has a principal place of business, and the other federal circuit courts are split. The Eleventh and Third Circuits maintain a bright-line rule that an inactive or dissolved corporation has\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   principal place of business.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holston Invs., Inc. v.

Even though Family Practices was administratively dissolved in 2013, the plaintiffs allege that Family Practices maintained an actual principal place of business in the District of Columbia when the complaint was filed.

As further support, the plaintiffs point to (1) Dr. Ashby's use of a Family Practices' fax cover sheet when communicating with the Virginia Department of Professional Responsibility in 2016,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 15-5 at 1; (2) the Virginia Board of Medicine's listing for Dr. Ashby as working at \"Family Practices Medical Services\" in the District of Columbia as of 2017,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 15-2 at 3, 5; and (3) Dr. Ashby's LinkedIn page publicizing himself as \"Director at Family Practices Medical Services, P.C.\" in the \"Washington, D.C. metro area\" continuously from 1989 to the present,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 15-3 at 1; Dkt. 15-1 at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Despite the opportunity to amend its answer following removal, Family Practices does not explicitly deny the allegation that it remained in business after 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ashby Am.

Instead, Family Practices merely reiterates that its articles of incorporation were revoked in 2013, a fact that primarily informs whether Family Practices has a state of incorporation under the citizenship statute, but does not establish whether Family Practices continued to carry on business after 2013.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ashby Am.

Thus, faced with credible allegations that Family Practices in fact maintained a principal place of business in the District of Columbia when this suit was filed, Family Practices has not carried its burden of showing the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Second, under the \"dual citizenship\" imposed by the citizenship statute, the default rule is that a corporation \"is a citizen both of the state of its incorporation and the state where it has its principal place of business\" in order to ensure that truly local cases remain in local courts.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    Guerrero v.

But if a dissolved corporation like Family Practices sheds both its state of incorporation\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   its principal place of business, it would lack any state citizenship for purposes of diversity and removal jurisdiction. This would be inconsistent with the citizenship statute because \"under such a rule a defunct corporation, no matter how local in character, could remove a case to federal court.\"\n   <em>\n    Wm.

And the opportunity to remove to federal court is particularly inappropriate for a dissolved corporation-like Family Practices-that lost its articles of incorporation yet allegedly continued carrying on a truly local business. If permitted to remove whenever sued in a local forum, such a corporation would benefit from its own failure to comply with the forum's incorporation requirements and would enjoy increased opportunities for jurisdictional manipulation, \"thereby subverting a major reason for the insertion of the 'principal place of business' language in the [citizenship] statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Hertz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581808\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/77/#p92\">\n    559 U.S. at 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581808\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/77/#p92\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Third, although the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Hertz\n   </em>\n   emphasized the importance of simple jurisdictional tests (and the Eleventh Circuit's no-principal-place-of-business rule is undoubtedly straightforward), the Supreme Court gave other guidance as well. In particular, the Supreme Court directed lower courts to determine a principal place of business by looking through formalities to determine the corporation's\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   nerve center,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , its \"\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   center of direction, control, and coordination.\"\n   <em>\n    Hertz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581808\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/77/#p92\">\n    559 U.S. at 93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581808\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/77/#p92\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581808\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/77/#p92\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581808\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/77/#p92\">\n    at 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581808\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/77/#p92\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]f the record reveals attempts at manipulation[,] the courts should instead take as the 'nerve center' the place of\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   direction, control, and coordination.\" (emphasis added) ).
