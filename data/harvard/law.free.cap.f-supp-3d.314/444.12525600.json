Redpath Dep. 43:3-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   LPNY contends that it has standing because the requirement that witnesses be registered voters impairs its ability to coordinate the dissemination of its message\n   with activists and professional circulators. Pls.' Mem. at 10-11; Plaintiffs' Supplemental Memorandum (\"Pls.' Supp.\") at 7, Docket Entry 55. In his affidavit, LPNY's chair asserts that LPNY would have liked to employ the services of professional out-of-state petition witnesses, but did not because of the cost of also hiring an accompanying New York \"witness chaperone.\" Third Glogowski Decl. \u00b6 3. Glogowski further states that enforcement of the challenged witness-residency requirement \"increases the expenses of LPNY by (1) requiring us to pay for accompanying witness chaperones for our productive nonresident professionals, and (2) requiring us to pay more for less productive New York professionals.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.

Here, plaintiffs are the objects of the government action at issue. The challenged statute disqualifies Redpath from witnessing ballot petition signatures and prevents LPNY from employing the services of Redpath and other out-of-state circulators as efficiently as it might. Redpath could undoubtedly speak with more voters and seek more petition signatures on behalf of LPNY's candidates if he did not have to work as part of a team with a registered New York voter. Plaintiffs have presented evidence indicating that LPNY makes less use of out-of-state circulators in New York than it otherwise would because of the cost and inefficiency involved in hiring or arranging for volunteer New York \"witness chaperones.\" Plaintiffs have also presented evidence indicating that Redpath was not invited to circulate petitions in New York in 2016 because it was too difficult to find a qualified New York witness to accompany him. Plaintiffs have thus averred sufficient facts to establish an injury-in-fact caused by the statute's witness-residency requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Libertarian Party of Va. v.

The court in\n   <em>\n    Germalic\n   </em>\n   applied strict scrutiny to the witness-residency requirement and found that it was narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests and therefore constitutional.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2-3.

In any event, to the extent\n   <em>\n    Germalic\n   </em>\n   holds that Section 6-140(b) is constitutional, its decision is not binding on this court and, for the reasons stated above, I respectfully decline to follow it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   For all the reasons stated above, including those articulated by the majority of courts that have considered the question, I conclude that a requirement that petition signature witnesses from out-of-state register and submit to the subpoena power of New York State provides a means of serving New York State's compelling interests that is more narrowly tailored than the witness-residency requirement. \"[N]onresidents with a stake in having the signatures they witnessed duly counted and credited ... will possess the same incentive as their resident counterparts to appear.\"\n   <em>\n    Libertarian Party of Va.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4049554\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/308/#p314\">\n    718 F.3d at 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
