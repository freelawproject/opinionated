The matter is ripe for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is a product liability suit centering on Boston Scientific's permanent inferior vena cava filter (the \"Greenfield Filter\"). The Greenfield Filter was created to prevent pulmonary embolisms (Doc. 27 at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 31), which occur when a blood clot travels through blood vessels like the inferior vena cava to block one of the pulmonary arteries in the lungs. (Doc. 27 at \u00b6 18). When clots form in deep leg veins, this condition is called deep vein thrombosis. (Doc. 27 at \u00b6 18). Patients at risk of pulmonary embolisms or deep vein thrombosis are often treated with permanent or retrievable inferior vena cava filters, such as the Greenfield Filter, which trap and filter blood clots. (Doc. 27 at \u00b6\u00b6 20-21, 30).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Douse alleges that concerns about complications associated with permanent inferior vena cava filters led medical device manufacturers to begin making retrievable\n   filters by 2003. (Doc. 27 at \u00b6 36). In 2010, the United States Food and Drug Administration warned against implanting inferior vena cava filters for extended periods due to potential adverse health complications. (Doc. 27 at \u00b6\u00b6 34, 36). It released another warning in 2014. (Doc. 27 at \u00b6 36). Despite these notifications, Douse alleges Boston Scientific continued to market the Greenfield Filter for long-term use. (Doc. 27 at \u00b6 40).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In September 2003, Douse suffered a pulmonary embolism. (Doc. 27 at 22). Based on the advice of an unnamed entity, she agreed to have the Greenfield Filter implanted to prevent further blood clot-related issues. (Doc. 27 at \u00b6\u00b6 22-24). In 2017, Douse was treated for complications associated with the Greenfield Filter, and was informed that it had perforated the walls of the vein in which it had been implanted. (Doc. 27 at \u00b6 26). Apparently, such injuries are commonplace among patients who have undergone the implantation of permanent inferior vena cava filters. (Doc. 27 at \u00b6 27).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Douse then sued Boston Scientific in state court. (Doc. 2). After the Complaint was removed (Doc. 1), it was dismissed as a shotgun pleading. (Doc. 25). Douse then filed an Amended Complaint, which deleted paragraphs that had previously incorporated every preceding allegation into each succeeding count. (Doc. 27). The Amended Complaint alleges the Greenfield Filter was defectively designed and manufactured. (Doc. 27 at \u00b6 53). It further claims the Greenfield Filter was inadequately tested and had inadequate warnings, instructions, and labeling. (Doc. 27 at \u00b6 53). Based on these allegations, Douse claims Boston Scientific is liable for: negligence (Count I), strict liability defective design (Count II), strict liability manufacturing defect (Count III), strict liability failure to warn (Count IV), breach of express warranty (Count V), breach of implied warranty of merchantability (Count VI), breach of implied warranty of fitness (Count VII), fraudulent misrepresentation (Count VIII), fraudulent concealment (Count IX), negligent misrepresentation (Count X), and violations of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (\"FDUTPA\") (Count XI). (Doc. 27 at \u00b6\u00b6 67-234). Douse also seeks punitive damages. (Doc. 27 at \u00b6\u00b6 235-237). Now, Boston Scientific moves to dismiss.

It argues the Amended Complaint: (1) is an impermissible shotgun pleading; (2) is improvidently or insufficiently pled; and (3) fails to adequately allege punitive damages. Douse opposes. The Court will address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Shotgun Pleading\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Boston Scientific argues the Amended Complaint should be dismissed as a shotgun pleading because the grounds for each claim cannot be discerned. This argument fails. The Eleventh Circuit has found only four types of shotgun pleadings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The most common type-by a long shot-is a complaint containing multiple counts where each count adopts the allegations of all preceding counts, causing each successive count to carry all that came before and the last count to be a combination of the entire complaint. The next most common type, at least as far as our published opinions on the subject reflect, is a complaint that does not commit the mortal sin of re-alleging all preceding counts but is guilty of the venial sin of being replete with conclusory, vague, and immaterial facts not obviously connected to any particular cause of action. The third type of shotgun pleading is one that commits the sin of not separating into a different count each cause of action or claim for relief. Fourth, and finally, there is the relatively rare sin of asserting multiple claims against multiple defendants without specifying which of the defendants are responsible for which acts or omissions, or which of the defendants the claim is brought against. The unifying characteristic of all types of shotgun pleadings is that they fail to one degree or another, and in one way or another, to give the defendants adequate notice of the claims against them and the grounds upon which each claim rests.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Weiland v. Palm Beach Cty. Sheriff's Office\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054943\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/792/1313/#p1321\">\n    792 F.3d 1313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1321-23 (11th Cir. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Here, the Amended Complaint differs from the original because it no longer incorporates each preceding allegation into each count. Still, Boston Scientific argues\n   that it remains a shotgun pleading because the grounds for each claim are difficult to understand. To the extent this argument is based on the second of the Eleventh Circuit's enumerated shotgun pleading types-where a pleading is rife with conclusory, vague, and immaterial facts not obviously connected to any particular cause of action-it fails. If, however, this argument is simply a half-court attempt to contend Douse has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, Boston Scientific would be better served to focus its energy on higher percentage shots. The Amended Complaint is not a shotgun pleading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Negligence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Count I alleges Boston Scientific is liable for negligence. The elements of a negligence claim are \"(1) a legal duty owed by defendant to plaintiff, (2) breach of that duty by defendant, (3) injury to plaintiff legally caused by defendant's breach, and (4) damages as a result of that injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Estate of Rotell ex rel. Rotell v. Kuehnle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7053080,7053175,7053111\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/38/783/\">\n    38 So.3d 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 788 (Fla. 2d DCA 2010). Boston Scientific argues Count I should be dismissed because it does not plausibly satisfy the duty element. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Here, Douse alleges Boston Scientific had a duty to exercise reasonable care in the design, research, manufacture, marketing, testing, advertisement, supply, promotion, packaging, sale, and distribution of the Greenfield Filter. (Doc. 27 at \u00b6 68). She claims Boston Scientific breached this duty because it knew or should have known the Greenfield Filter was unsafe when used on a long-term basis, and because it failed to exercise reasonable care in the product's design, manufacture, and marketing, and failed to accompany the product with adequate warnings. (Doc. 27 at \u00b6\u00b6 75-76). Moreover, as a result of Boston Scientific's negligence, Douse alleges she suffered injuries including post-implantation deep vein thrombosis and the perforation of her inferior vena cava by the Greenfield Filter. (Doc. 27 at \u00b6 81). Accepted as true, these allegations establish a plausible claim for negligence and Count I survives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Strict Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \"Strict liability is defined as negligence as a matter of law or negligence per se; it relieves the plaintiff of the burden of proving specific acts of negligence.\"\n   <em>\n    Barrow v.

Boston Scientific argues Counts II and III should be dismissed because they do not specify what component of the Greenfield\n   Filter was unreasonably dangerous or why that was the case. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Florida has embraced two tests for whether a product is unreasonably dangerous.\n   <em>\n    Aubin v. Union Carbide Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6836521\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/177/489/#p512\">\n    177 So.3d 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 512 (Fla. 2015). The first is the \"consumer expectations\" test of Section 402A of the Second Restatement of Torts, which considers whether a product \"failed to perform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect when used as intended or in a reasonably foreseeable manner.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6836521\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/177/489/#p512\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6836521\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/177/489/#p512\">\n    at 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The second is the \"risk utility\" test from the Third Restatement, which considers whether \"the foreseeable risks of harm posed by the product could have been reduced or avoided by the adoption of a reasonable alternative design by the seller ... and the omission of the alternative design renders the product not reasonably safe.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6836521\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/177/489/#p512\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6836521\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/177/489/#p512\">\n    at 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Here, the Amended Complaint alleges that long-term inferior vena cava filter implantation positively correlates with inferior vena cava perforation. (Doc. 27 at \u00b6 27). Similarly, it alleges the entire Greenfield Filter was \"subject to breakage, collapse, migration, perforation, [and] causing thrombus.\" (Doc. 27 at \u00b6 48). Taken as true, these allegations plausibly support the contention that the Greenfield Filter was unreasonably dangerous because it was more hazardous than the ordinary consumer would expect, (Doc. 27 at \u00b6\u00b6 94, 115), and its foreseeable risks of harm exceeded its claimed benefits. (Doc. 27 at \u00b6 92). As such, Boston Scientific's arguments fail and Counts II and III survive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    2. Failure to Warn\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Count IV alleges Boston Scientific is strictly liable for failing to adequately warn of the Greenfield Filter's dangerous complications. To establish a viable claim for strict liability failure to warn, a pleading must state the defendant (1) manufactured or distributed the product, (2) failed to \"adequately warn of a particular risk that was known or knowable in light of the generally recognized and prevailing best scientific and medical knowledge available at the time of manufacture and distribution,\" and (3) that the failure proximately caused the plaintiff's injury.\n   <em>\n    Griffin v.

Boston Scientific argues Count IV should be dismissed because it does not allege how the Greenfield Filter's warnings were inadequate, because adequate warnings were provided, and because Count IV does not satisfy the learned intermediary doctrine. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Here, to establish a failure to warn, Douse begins by alleging Boston Scientific manufactured the Greenfield Filter, which was subject to a range of dangerous complications. (Doc. 27 at \u00b6\u00b6 116, 118, 121). She then claims Boston Scientific knew or should have known about the Greenfield Filter's propensity to cause such complications. (Doc. 27 at \u00b6 121). Despite that knowledge, Douse alleges Boston Scientific failed to adequately warn consumers, the medical community, Douse, or Douse's doctors about the Greenfield Filter's dangerous propensities. (Doc. 27 at \u00b6\u00b6 123). Instead, Douse alleges Boston Scientific affirmatively downplayed the possibility that the Greenfield Filter would cause unsafe complications. (Doc. 27 at \u00b6 124). These allegations sufficiently establish a failure to warn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   But Boston Scientific argues that even if the inadequacy of the warning was plausibly pled, Count IV must still fail because it does not establish proximate causation through the learned intermediary doctrine. The Court disagrees.

Fraudulent Misrepresentation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Count VIII alleges that Boston Scientific fraudulently misrepresented the Greenfield Filter's safety and efficacy to Douse, her doctors, and the public. The elements of a fraudulent misrepresentation claim in Florida are \"(1) a false statement concerning a material fact; (2) the representor's knowledge that the representation is false; (3) an intention that the representation induce another to act on it; and (4) consequent injury by the party acting in reliance on the representation.\"\n   <em>\n    Butler v.

Boston Scientific argues that Count VIII should be dismissed because it does not meet the particularity threshold of Rule 9(b). The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Count VIII generally alleges Boston Scientific falsely portrayed the Greenfield Filter as safe and effective for the prevention of pulmonary embolisms and deep vein thrombosis through its website, product brochures, and instructions for use. Specifically, it alleges Boston Scientific's website claimed the Greenfield Filter had \"[t]rusted performance, [and] [t]imeless design,\" that it had \"[p]roven [s]tability,\" \"[e]stablished [f]ilter [p]erformance,\" and that \"[f]ilter [d]esign [p]romotes [c]lot [l]ysis.\" (Doc. 27 at \u00b6\u00b6 185, 187). Meanwhile, the product brochure claimed the Greenfield Filter's\"[r]ecurved hooks are designed to provide protection against penetration.\" (Doc. 27 at \u00b6 189). This is not enough.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   For starters, the only statement capable of being interpreted as a factual assertion is that the Greenfield Filter's design \"[p]romotes [c]lot [l]ysis.\" (Doc. 27 at \u00b6\u00b6 237-238). But the Amended Complaint does not detail why this statement is false, or what relevance it has to the Greenfield Filter's safety and efficacy. Instead, it merely states Boston Scientific knew its representations were false. (Doc. 27 at \u00b6\u00b6 184, 193, 195). Rule 9(b) demands more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The other selections were statements of opinion. This is most readily indicated because they are introduced by subjective adjectives like \"trusted,\" \"timeless,\" \"proven,\" and \"established.\" (Doc. 27 at \u00b6\u00b6 185, 187). In Florida, \"[a]n action for fraud generally may not be predicated on statements of opinion ... but rather must be based on a statement concerning a past or existing fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Mejia v.

And even though Count VIII states Boston Scientific exclusively possessed information about complications associated with the Greenfield Filter's long-term implantation (Doc. 27 at \u00b6 193), it does not state what that information was or how it is relevant here. As such, Count VIII will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <em>\n    2. Fraudulent Concealment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Count IX alleges Boston Scientific fraudulently concealed material information about the Greenfield Filter's known risks.

Boston Scientific argues Count IX should be dismissed because it alleges fraud in a conclusory fashion. The Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Amended Complaint alleges Boston Scientific \"had sole access to material facts concerning the defective nature of the [Greenfield Filter], and its propensity to cause serious and dangerous side effects.\" (Doc. 27 at \u00b6 212). It continues that Boston Scientific deliberately concealed and omitted a swath of information including \"that the Greenfield Filter was not safe,\" \"that the Greenfield Filter was manufactured negligently,\" and \"that the Greenfield Filter was designed defectively.\" (Doc. 27 at \u00b6 210(a)-(f) ). These claims are problematic because the allegedly concealed information consists of legal conclusions rather than empirically provable facts. Even if that were not the case, Count IV also fails to cite any specific concealed information that would support the alleged conclusions. For instance, it does not cite any specifically concealed materials that would indicate the Greenfield Filter was not safe, or that would show it was manufactured negligently, or that it was not fit for the purpose for which it was used. Because Count IX fails to allege specific facts concealed by Boston Scientific, it will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    3.

Here, Douse claims that Boston Scientific acted deceptively by concealing the risks associated with the Greenfield Filter's long-term implantation. (Doc. 27 at \u00b6 233).
