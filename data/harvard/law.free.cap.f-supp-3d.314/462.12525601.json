Defendant provides actual examples of applications of New York Penal Law \u00a7 160.15 involving only\n    <em>\n     de minimis\n    </em>\n    force, including convictions involving at most \"form[ation] [of] a human wall\" and \"tug-of-war.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 4.)

In addition, the Government contends that \"forcibly stealing\" has been defined \"as the use or threatened force against another person ... to overcome any resistance ...\" and cannot be accomplished by\n    <em>\n     de minimis\n    </em>\n    force. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 9.) The Government further argues that the display of a firearm provides the necessary force in and of itself. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 12.) The Government criticizes Defendant's hypotheticals and contends that a conviction under subsection (4) of New York Penal Law \u00a7 160.15 requires that the weapon be displayed for the purpose of effectuating a robbery or escape.
