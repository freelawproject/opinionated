(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49) Under BBA rules, each contributing bank's submission must be based on its own independent good faith judgment, taking into account market conditions and the bank's posture as a borrower in the market for interbank loan funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 50) The contributing banks' daily submissions to the BBA reflect their costs of borrowing funds at three maturity dates-one-month, three-months, and six-months.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 51, 54) When LIBOR is published, the rates submitted by each individual contributor bank are published as well, so that it is clear how the LIBOR rates were calculated.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   According to the proposed SAC, statistical analysis indicates that-at certain times between August 31, 2007 and October 22, 2008-there was a negative correlation coefficient relationship between one-month USD-LIBOR rates and Standard &amp; Poor's (\"S &amp; P\") New York AMT-Free Municipal Bond Index (the \"S &amp; P bond index\"), which is an index that measures the performance of bonds similar to those in Solow's portfolio. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 176) This analysis suggests that an increase in one-month USD-LIBOR during those periods was, on average, associated with a decline in the value of the bonds listed in the S &amp; P bond index. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In other words, a manipulation of LIBOR that caused interest rates to increase would cause the value of the bonds in the Solow portfolio to decline. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 168)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Although Defendants' alleged manipulation of LIBOR \"tended toward overall suppression of LIBOR for much of the\n   conspiracy period,\" Defendants \"increased, decreased, or maintained the submitted LIBOR rates in order to support their trading positions or other needs of the moment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 177) In the months leading up to the liquidation of Solow's bond portfolio in November 2008, LIBOR was \"artificially inflated as a result of Defendants' conduct.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 176-180) For example, between September 12, 2008 and October 10, 2008, Defendants' submissions to the BBA for the calculation of USD-LIBOR were higher than their true costs of borrowing, which resulted in the artificial inflation of USD-LIBOR during that period.
