Section 198 of the New York Labor Law, found within Article 6 of the New York Labor Law, is titled \"Costs, remedies.\" Subsection (3) of section 198 provides that \"[a]ll employees shall have the right to recover full wages, benefits and wage supplements and liquidated damages accrued during the six years previous to the commencing of such action, whether such action is instituted by the employee or by the commissioner.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Lab.%20L.%20%C2%A7%20198\">\n    N.Y.

Mem. at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The problem with plaintiffs' argument is that section 198 is not a \"substantive provision\" but one that addresses procedural matters collateral to liability such as limitations periods and damages. As noted, the section is entitled \"Costs, remedies.\" Subsection 1 allows costs to be awarded to a prevailing employee. Subsection 1-a authorizes the Commissioner of Labor to initiate an action on behalf of an employee to seek wages to which the employee \"is entitled under the provisions of this article.\" It also authorizes any litigant to recover attorney's fees, interest, and liquidated damages. Subsection 1-b sets forth the penalty\n   for not providing the notice required by section 195(1). Subsection 1-d sets forth the penalty for not providing the wage statement required by section 195(3). Subsection 4 provides for costs and attorney's fees to a party enforcing a judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Subsection 3, the subsection that contains the \"full wages\" phrase, provides in full as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, an action to recover upon a liability imposed by this article must be commenced within six years. The statute of limitations shall be tolled from the date an employee files a complaint with the commissioner or the commissioner commences an investigation, whichever is earlier, until an order to comply issued by the commissioner becomes final, or where the commissioner does not issue an order, until the date on which the commissioner notifies the complainant that the investigation has concluded. Investigation by the commissioner shall not be a prerequisite to nor a bar against a person bringing a civil action under this section. All employees shall have the right to recover full wages, benefits and wage supplements and liquidated damages accrued during the six years previous to the commencing of such action, whether such action is instituted by the employee or by the commissioner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The text of this subsection describes the limitations period for any action that seeks to recover on a \"liability\" that is \"imposed by\" Article 6. The first sentence sets forth the limitation period for such an action. The second sentence provides that the action shall be tolled while the Commissioner of Labor conducts any investigation. The third sentence notes that an investigation is neither a prerequisite nor a bar for a person bringing a civil action. The final sentence makes clear that the right of recovery of certain damages within the six-year limitations period-specifically, \"full wages, benefits and wage supplements and liquidated damages\"-is available whether the action is instituted by the employee or by the Commissioner of Labor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The title, content and structure of section 198 thus make clear that the reference in the last section to \"full wages\" or to any other available form of damages does not create a \"liability imposed by this article.\" Rather, any such liability must be found in another section of Article 6. And Article 6 contains several substantive provisions imposing liability on employers, such as section 193, prohibiting certain deductions from wages; section 194, barring differences in rate of pay because of sex; and section 196-d, prohibiting an employer from demanding tips given to an employee. Thus, the reference to \"full wages\" can be read only as a reference to wages that are guaranteed by other sections within Article 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Other courts have similarly concluded that \" \u00a7 198 does not stand alone.

By contrast, nothing in the proposed Second Amended Complaint demonstrates such a clear manifestation of intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   With respect to plaintiffs other than Contrera and Lopez, however, plaintiffs have not stated a claim for breach of contract. The sole allegation in support of Herrera and Reyes's breach of contract claims is that \"[d]efendants agreed to pay Plaintiffs and Class Members on an hourly basis, including regular hourly rates for all hours of work up to forty per week, and premium overtime (one and one-half times the regular rate of pay) for hours worked above forty per week. However, Defendants failed to pay Plaintiffs and Class Members the full amount of wages due, including but not limited to overtime.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 438. This statement is conclusory and thus is insufficient on its own to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Plaintiffs point to no other statements or documents that could be considered on a motion to dismiss that would establish that Herrera or Reyes entered into contracts with defendants by which they should have been paid hourly. Although plaintiffs's brief refers to information external to the complaint indicating that other employees were designated as hourly workers,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. Mem. at 2, such external information cannot be considered in connection with this Court's futility analysis, which is governed by the standards applicable to a motion to dismiss. Moreover, although the proposed Second Amended Complaint alleges that Batista was designated as an hourly employee,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6 56, it does not state the amount of that hourly rate or whether he was paid at that rate for straight time hours worked. Without such allegations, the proposed Second Amended Complaint does not allege in a non-conclusory fashion that Batista was not paid his \"agreed upon wages\" for straight time. Thus, Herrera, Batista, and Reyes have failed to state claims for breach of contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Class Certification\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendants argue that plaintiffs should not be permitted to amend their complaint to add a breach of contract claim because such a claim would not be amenable to class certification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.

While defendants cite two cases that arose in the context of a motion to amend in support of their argument,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18, both of these cases are distinguishable because in each case motions for class certification\n   previously had been denied and the plaintiffs were moving to amend in an effort to cure defects raised by the courts in denying those motions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Luedke v.
