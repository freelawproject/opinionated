ECF No. 25;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Mem. Op. and Order, ECF No. 20 (Mem. Op.). In light of controlling case law, I am persuaded by Sgt. Smith's contention that Mr. Bowser's\n   pleadings fail to carry his burden to state a claim of violation of clearly established law, and that his claims must therefore be dismissed on qualified immunity grounds. I thus grant the motion for reconsideration and Sgt. Smith's underlying motion to dismiss, and give Mr. Bowser permission to file an amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The inmate was \"handcuff[ed] from the front,\" but otherwise \"had no restraints, and was allowed to walk freely.\" Addendum 2. The inmate \"was able to strike and assault the plaintiff by sneaking from behind using the handcuffs as a weapon pounding like a sledge hammer[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Plaintiff claims that Sgt. Smith \"failed to properly control and escort\" the other inmate in accordance with a \"hands on policy[,] which enabled [the inmate] to assault\" him.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. As a result, plaintiff \"suffered injuries to the neck, head, and upper right side of his shoulder and face,\" and he \"remains in continuing pain.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Bowser sued both the District of Columbia and Sgt.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Sgt. Smith asserted qualified immunity in his original motion to dismiss, Smith Mot. Dismiss, ECF No. 17, a defense that requires investigation of two prongs: (1) whether the plaintiff has alleged a violation of a constitutional right, and (2) whether the right was \"clearly established\" at the time of defendant's alleged misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Pearson v.

Sgt. Smith asserts that I have misapplied controlling case law on both prongs, and that Mr. Bowser has failed to plead sufficient facts to satisfy either. Mot. Recon. 6-12. I adhere to my conclusion on the first prong, but accept Sgt. Smith's contentions on the second.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On the first prong, I reasoned that \"[b]ased on Sgt. Smith's alleged violation of a hands-on policy, one fair inference is that the rule was adopted in response to 'conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm' to prisoners, and that Sgt. Smith acted with 'deliberate indifference' to that substantial risk in Mr. Bowser's case.\" Mem. Op. 8-9 (citing\n   <em>\n    Farmer v. Brennan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147494\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/825/#p834\">\n    511 U.S. 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 834,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147494\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/825/#p834\">\n    114 S.Ct. 1970\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1147494\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/511/825/#p834\">\n    128 L.Ed.2d 811\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994) ). Sgt. Smith argues that even if it is a \"fair inference ... that the prison policy was adopted in response to 'conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm,' there is nothing [pled] ... which would permit the inference that Sgt. Smith was\n   <em>\n    subjectively aware\n   </em>\n   \" of the risk, as the case law requires. Mot. Recon. 9 (emphasis added). But as the original opinion explained, a plaintiff \"must be granted the benefit of all inferences that can be derived from the facts alleged,\"\n   <em>\n    Hettinga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3770312,3871508\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/677/471/\">\n    677 F.3d at 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and a complaint survives if it \"state[s] a claim to relief that is plausible.\"\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Giving the pleadings that treatment, I see ample factual scenarios in which Sgt. Smith could have been subjectively aware of a substantial risk of serious harm. Perhaps he knew that the escorted inmate had a history of such violence. Perhaps he knew that the inmate had a grudge against Mr. Bowser. When I grant Mr. Bowser these possible inferences, his pleadings contain at least a plausible violation of the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   But on the second prong, I now recognize that Mr. Bowser has failed to state a violation of clearly established law. If-under some unknown, inferred set of facts-Sgt. Smith violated the Constitution, qualified immunity fails only if his conduct violated clearly established law in those particular circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Pearson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p232\">\n    555 U.S. at 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679212\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/223/#p232\">\n    129 S.Ct. 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But even if these measures were required by District of Columbia jail policy, the Plaintiff has pointed to no caselaw-and I am not aware of any-suggesting that they are required by the Constitution, or that violations of jail policy are automatically constitutional violations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wesby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12615996\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/577/#p590\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"existing law must have placed the constitutionality of the officer's conduct 'beyond debate.'

His letter dated March 30, 2018, adds no factual allegations beyond the bare violation\n   of jail policy. ECF No. 27 at 2. And in his opposition to reconsideration, Mr. Bowser adds only a few claims that are relevant to the pertinent question of whether Sgt. Smith violated a clearly established constitutional rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, he asserts that he \"was assaulted by a\n   <em>\n    known\n   </em>\n   violent offender because a Correctional Officer was not performing his job.\" Pl.'s Response to Def.'s Mot. for Recons. 1 (Opp. Mot. Recons.) (emphasis added). But this is a vague claim, not a specific one. It does not tell us whether Sgt. Smith was aware of a\n   <em>\n    relevant\n   </em>\n   history of violence or merely knew that the assaulting inmate was incarcerated, perhaps on charges of unrelated violence. Second, Mr. Bowser attaches an \"Inmate Rights\" portion of the District of Columbia Department of Corrections Inmate Handbook, which includes the right \"[t]o be protected from ... personal injury,\" Ex. 1 to Opp. Mot. Recons., and argues that if Sgt. Smith was aware of these rights, he was surely \"aware of the risk of injury he placed on the Plaintiff.\" Opp. Mot. Recons. 4. But even if Sgt. Smith knowingly violated the jail's \"own rule\" as Mr. Bowser argues,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12615996\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/577/#p590\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , that infraction also violates the Constitution only if Sgt.

Third and finally, Mr. Bowser argues that \"the designation of Sergeant implies supervisory knowledge including many years of experience ... which supports this court's finding that ... every reasonable officer would have understood his constitutional obligations at that time.\" Opp. Mot. Recons. 4. But even if I draw all possible inferences from Sgt. Smith's title, including supervisory knowledge and years of experience, that still does not tell me what clearly established constitutional rule Sgt. Smith has violated here.
