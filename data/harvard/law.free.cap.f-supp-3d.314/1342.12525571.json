The Court has carefully reviewed the Class Action Complaint [ECF No. 1]; the Motion; Plaintiff, Cody Becker's Response in Opposition [ECF No. 18]; Defendant's Reply [ECF No. 21]; Plaintiff's Notice of Supplemental Authority [ECF No. 23]; and applicable law. For the reasons explained below, the Motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff, a resident of the state of Florida (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 8), brings this putative class action under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (\"TCPA\"), 47 U.S.C. section 227, for Defendant's unsolicited telemarketing directed toward prospective customers such as Plaintiff, without regard for consumers' privacy rights (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 3). Plaintiff filed suit after the Georgia-based Defendant (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9) transmitted two text messages to his cellular telephone promoting Defendant's lead generation and customer relationship management software (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 25). The TCPA prohibits any person from calling a cellular telephone number, using an automatic telephone dialing system, without the recipient's prior express consent.

Plaintiff brings this action on behalf of a Class defined as: \"All persons within the United States who, within the four years prior to the filing of this Complaint, were sent a\n   text message, from Defendant or anyone on Defendant's behalf, to said person's cellular telephone number, advertising Defendant's services, without the recipients' prior express written consent.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37).

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. 1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the alternative, it seeks dismissal of the allegations pertaining to non-Florida-residents.

Should the Court not grant either form of relief, then Defendant moves for an order staying the litigation pending the Eleventh Circuit's decision on Article III standing to bring a TCPA claim in another case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20227\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). These arguments fail to persuade.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For its first two related arguments pertaining to non-Florida putative class members in this as-yet uncertified putative class action, Defendant relies on\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v.

In\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   , a group of plaintiffs residing outside California filed a mass action suit in California state court against a non-resident prescription drug manufacturer, alleging defects with pharmaceutical products.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/\">\n    at 1777-78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Mot. 9, n.2; Reply 1). As noted by Plaintiff,\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   addressed out-of-state plaintiffs pursuing out-of-state claims in a state court mass action. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Resp. 4). The Court is persuaded by the case law cited by Plaintiff supporting his position\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   does not apply to class actions such as this one, and does not find it necessary to distinguish, as Plaintiff does in his Response, the several cases Defendant discusses in its Motion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Tickling Keys, Inc. v.

Apr. 4, 2018), involved violations of the TCPA arising from unsolicited facsimile advertisements. There, the court made the following pertinent observations at the motion-to-dismiss stage, which are equally applicable here:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants argue that the Court lacks personal jurisdiction over [Defendants] regarding the putative class because \"[t]he class definition includes 'all persons' who 'were sent telephone facsimile messages' and is therefore not limited to\n   putative members who were sent faxes in Florida.\" ... As support, Defendants[ ] chiefly rely on\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers Squibb Company\n   </em>\n   .... Defendants' interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   is twice flawed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   First,\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   was not a class action; rather, it was a multi-plaintiff products liability action originally filed in California State court that named both resident and non-resident plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1778. The U.S. Supreme Court left open \"the question whether the Fifth Amendment imposes the same restrictions on the exercise of personal jurisdiction by a federal court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1784. Second, the holding of\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   addressed mass tort actions. The applicability of\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   in the class-action setting is still an open question.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 1789 (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (explaining that the\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   opinion did not \"confront the question whether its opinion ... would also apply to a class action in which a plaintiff injured in the forum State seeks to represent a nationwide class of plaintiffs, not all of whom were injured [in that forum]\"). For purposes of personal jurisdiction, this distinction is meaningful.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fitzhenry-Russell, et al. v.
