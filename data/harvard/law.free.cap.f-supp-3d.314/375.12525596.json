They claim that Poland Spring water products are fraudulently labeled and sold as \"spring water\" despite not meeting the requirements for \"spring water\" as defined by law. Defendant Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America Inc. (\"Nestl\u00e9\") has moved to dismiss the complaints. Although I reject many of Nestl\u00e9's arguments, I agree with Nestl\u00e9 that plaintiffs' claims are all preempted by federal law. Accordingly, I will grant the motion to dismiss and dismiss the complaint in this action as well as the complaint in all but one of the consolidated actions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></attorneys>\n\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p-13\">Plaintiffs allege that Nestl\u00e9 sells about a billion gallons of Poland Spring water every year but that not one drop of it is actually \"spring water\" within the FDA's definition. Plaintiffs insist that Poland Spring water is ordinary groundwater and surface water that Nestl\u00e9 draws from a series of artificial springs in Maine. The bulk of plaintiffs' 325-page complaint is devoted to detailing how the water produced at eight specific Poland Spring sites in Maine does not meet the FDA's \"spring water\" requirements. Doc. # 1 at 65-279.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"p-14\">According to plaintiffs, Nestl\u00e9 labels its Poland Spring water as \"spring water\" so that it may fraudulently charge consumers a higher price than they would be willing to pay for non-spring water products. Plaintiffs have allegedly relied on Nestl\u00e9's mislabeling of its water and overpaid for Poland Spring water.</attorneys>\n\n\n\n<p id=\"p-18\"><strong><em>Constitutional Standing</em></strong></p>\n\n<attorneys id=\"p-20\">The allegations here easily suffice to meet the requirements for constitutional standing. Plaintiffs allege that they relied on Nestl\u00e9's representation that Poland Spring water was \"100% Natural Spring Water,\" and because of this reliance they paid a higher price for Poland Spring water than they would have paid for alternative water products.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If Nestl\u00e9 indeed mislabeled its water as plaintiffs claim, it is plausible to conclude that plaintiffs chose to buy Poland Spring water and paid more for it than for non-spring-water alternatives. It is likewise plausible to conclude that Nestl\u00e9 was well aware of the likely effect that labeling its water as \"100% Natural Spring Water\" would have on consumer preferences. The facts alleged plausibly establish an injury-in-fact caused by Nestl\u00e9's alleged wrongful conduct and redressable by an award of damages. <em>See, e.g.,</em> <em>Estrada v.

Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America, Inc.</em> , 3:17-cv-01381(JAM). It alleges that Nestl\u00e9 has long marketed its ubiquitous Poland Spring water products as \"100% Natural Spring Water,\" despite the fact that it is not \"spring water\" as that term is very specifically defined by federal law.</p><p id=\"p-11\">By way of background, the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) establishes basic definitions (known as \"standards of identity\") for food products and prohibits the false labeling of such food products.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In accordance with its regulatory authority under the FDCA, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has promulgated a detailed regulatory definition of \"spring water\" that distinguishes it <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"379\" href=\"#p379\" id=\"p379\">*379</a>from other kinds of water that may be marketed for public sale. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20165.110\">21 C.F.R. \u00a7 165.110</extracted-citation>(a)(2)(vi).</p><p id=\"p-12\">According to the FDA, if a water product is to be labeled and sold as \"spring water,\" the water must be \"derived from an underground formation from which water flows naturally to the surface of the earth,\" and there must be a \"natural force causing the water to flow to the surface through a natural orifice.\"<em>Ibid.</em> The FDA's regulation further provides that \"spring water\" can be \"collected only at the spring or through a bore hole tapping the underground formation feeding the spring,\" and that if it is collected \"with the use of an external force,\" the water must be \"from the same underground stratum as the spring, as shown by a measurable hydraulic connection using a hydrogeologically valid method between the bore hole and the natural spring, and shall have all the physical properties, before treatment, and be of the same composition and quality, as the water that flows naturally to the surface of the earth.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20165.110\">Ibid.</extracted-citation></em></p><p id=\"p-15\">Although the crux of the complaint is that Poland Spring water does not comply with federal law, it is undisputed that the FDCA does not give rise to a private federal cause of action for violation of the FDA's \"spring water\" regulation. Accordingly, the complaint alleges only state law causes of action. The first two counts of the complaint allege general state common law claims for fraud and breach of contract on behalf of a nationwide class whose members have purchased Poland Spring water since November 5, 2003. The next nine counts on behalf of individual state sub-classes allege violations of various consumer fraud and unfair trade practice statutes of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> All of these counts of the complaint are premised on a common allegation that Poland Spring water is mislabeled as \"spring water\" in violation of federal law. Nestl\u00e9 has filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs' claims for multiple reasons I will discuss below.</p><p id=\"p-16\"><strong>DISCUSSION</strong></p><p id=\"p-17\">Nestl\u00e9 moves to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"380\" href=\"#p380\" id=\"p380\">*380</a>jurisdiction and under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. The standard that governs such a motion is well established: a complaint may not survive unless it alleges facts that taken as true give rise to plausible grounds to sustain the Court's subject matter jurisdiction and to sustain plaintiffs' claims for relief. <em>See, e.g.,</em> <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">556 U.S. 662</extracted-citation>, 678, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">129 S.Ct. 1937</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">173 L.Ed.2d 868</extracted-citation> (2009) ; <em>Kim v. Kimm</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516253\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/884/98/#p103\">884 F.3d 98</extracted-citation>, 103 (2d Cir. 2018) ; <em>Lapaglia v. Transamerica Cas. Ins. Co.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4305236\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/155/153/#p155\">155 F.Supp.3d 153</extracted-citation>, 155-56 (D. Conn. 2016). Because a federal court should ordinarily resolve any doubts about the existence of subject matter jurisdiction prior to considering the merits of a complaint, <em>see, e.g.,</em> <em>Singh v. United States Citizenship &amp; Immigration Servs.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264668\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/441/#p445\">878 F.3d 441</extracted-citation>, 445 (2d Cir. 2017), I will first consider Nestl\u00e9's arguments that challenge the Court's jurisdiction before turning to Nestl\u00e9's merits arguments.</p><p id=\"p-19\">Nestl\u00e9 first argues that plaintiffs have no standing as required to sustain this Court's jurisdiction over the complaint. In accordance with the Constitution's \"case-or-controversy\" requirement, a federal court lacks jurisdiction over a lawsuit unless a plaintiff alleges a concrete and particularized injury-in-fact that is fairly traceable to a defendant's wrongful conduct and redressable by a court order. <em>See, e.g.,</em> <em>Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins</em> , --- U.S. ----, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1547\">136 S.Ct. 1540</extracted-citation>, 1547, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1547\">194 L.Ed.2d 635</extracted-citation> (2016) ; <em>Crupar-Weinmann v. Paris Baguette Am., Inc.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276110\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/861/76/#p79\">861 F.3d 76</extracted-citation>, 79 (2d Cir. 2017).</p><p id=\"p-21\">Nestl\u00e9 argues that plaintiffs could not have been deceived because it has been sued many times before on the same grounds. According to Nestl\u00e9, these prior lawsuits and attendant media coverage put plaintiffs on notice that Poland Spring's \"spring water\" labels were false. But the possibility that any prior lawsuits or media coverage put plaintiffs on notice of anything is a fact question that is not suitable for me to resolve at the pleading stage on a motion to dismiss. Moreover, Nestl\u00e9's argument ignores Nestl\u00e9's own steadfast denials in prior lawsuits that it was mislabeling Poland Spring water. Nestl\u00e9 cannot have it both ways: that plaintiffs somehow \"knew\" Nestl\u00e9's labels were false but that <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"381\" href=\"#p381\" id=\"p381\">*381</a>Nestl\u00e9's labels were <em>not</em> in fact false. Plaintiffs have standing to maintain their claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-22\"><strong><em>The Rooker-Feldman Doctrine</em></strong></p><p id=\"p-23\">Nestl\u00e9 next argues that the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because of the <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> doctrine. \"<em>Rooker-Feldman</em> bars the federal courts from exercising jurisdiction over claims 'brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.' \" <em>Sykes v. Mel S. Harris &amp; Assocs. LLC</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073876\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/70/#p94\">780 F.3d 70</extracted-citation>, 94 (2d Cir. 2015) (quoting <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920496\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/280/#p284\">544 U.S. 280</extracted-citation>, 284, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920496\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/280/#p284\">125 S.Ct. 1517</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920496\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/280/#p284\">161 L.Ed.2d 454</extracted-citation> (2005) ).</p><p id=\"p-24\">According to Nestl\u00e9, plaintiffs are in essence complaining about an injury caused by Nestl\u00e9's settlement in November of 2003 of a similar class action lawsuit that was filed in a state court of Illinois. <em>See</em> Doc. # 53-2 at 5 (<em>Ramsey v. Nestl\u00e9 Waters N. Am.</em> , No. 03 CHK 817 (Ill. Cir. Ct., Nov. 5, 2003) (final judgment and order of dismissal with settlement agreement) ). That class action-referred to by the parties as \"the <em>Ramsey</em> action\"-involved a nationwide class of plaintiffs who purchased Poland Spring water from January 1, 1996, to November 5, 2003. Doc. # 53-2 at 8. Nestl\u00e9 relies in particular on a provision of the <em>Ramsey</em> settlement agreement stating that \"[t]he Parties agree that Defendant shall be permitted to continue to bottle, label and sell Poland Spring brand bottled water as 'spring water' using all of the spring water sources it has used since January 1, 1996,\" and that \"[n]othing in this Settlement Agreement shall require that Defendant relabel its Poland Spring brand spring water products as anything other than spring water or alter its spring water advertising in any way with respect to the spring water sources it has used since January 1, 1996.\" Doc. # 53-2 at 33-34.</p><p id=\"p-25\">Nestl\u00e9's argument relies on a misunderstanding of the scope of the <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> doctrine. The <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> doctrine does not apply merely because there has been a prior state court action or merely because the settlement of a prior state court action has not foreclosed a defendant from continuing to engage in the conduct that forms the basis for a later federal action. Instead, the <em>Rooker Feldman</em> doctrine applies only if it can be said that the prior state court action has <em>caused</em> the federal plaintiff's injuries: \"[T]he plaintiff must complain of injuries caused by a state-court judgment,\" and \"[t]he causation requirement is only satisfied if 'the third party's actions are produced by a state court judgment and not simply ratified, acquiesced in, or left unpunished by it.' \" <em>Sykes</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073876\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/780/70/#p94\">780 F.3d at 94</extracted-citation> (quoting <em>Hoblock v. Albany Cty. Bd. of Elections</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8928004\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/422/77/#p85\">422 F.3d 77</extracted-citation>, 85, 88 (2d Cir. 2005) ).</p><p id=\"p-26\">Here the provision relied on by Nestl\u00e9 at best does no more than ratify Nestl\u00e9's future conduct (and only as to those particular sources of sources of water it has used since 1996). The <em>Ramsey</em> action involved purchasers of Poland Spring water <em>before</em> November 5, 2003, while the current action involves purchasers of Poland Spring water <em>after</em> November 5, 2003. The agreement by a prior class of plaintiffs in <em>Ramsey</em> to allow Nestl\u00e9 to continue some of its conduct is precisely the kind of ratification or acquiescence that does not meet the more demanding causation requirement <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"382\" href=\"#p382\" id=\"p382\">*382</a>for the <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> doctrine. <em>See, e.g.,</em> <em>Green v. City of New York</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5633308\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/438/111/#p121\">438 F.Supp.2d 111</extracted-citation>, 121 (E.D.N.Y. 2006) (prior state court settlement agreements did not \"cause\" later federal court plaintiff's injury despite fact that settlement agreements allowed conduct by defendant that was later challenged in federal court). Plaintiffs' alleged injuries here are caused by Nestl\u00e9's purported ongoing, post-<em>Ramsey</em> course of deceptive conduct and not by what the state court in <em>Ramsey</em> ordered or by what the prior parties to the <em>Ramsey</em> judgment agreed. Accordingly, the <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> doctrine does not deprive the Court of subject matter jurisdiction over this case.</p><p id=\"p-27\"><strong><em>Release and Res Judicata</em></strong></p><p id=\"p-28\">In a similar vein, Nestl\u00e9 argues that plaintiffs' claims are foreclosed by the <em>Ramsey</em> settlement agreement. According to Nestl\u00e9, the <em>Ramsey</em> settlement precludes plaintiffs' class action for at least two reasons: (1) the <em>Ramsey</em> settlement agreement expressly released Nestl\u00e9 from plaintiffs' claims, and (2) the <em>Ramsey</em> settlement agreement triggers the rule of <em>res judicata</em> . I don't agree with either of these arguments.</p><p id=\"p-29\">As an initial matter, the record does not presently allow for a conclusion that the <em>Ramsey</em> class is the same as or is in privity with the current proposed class of plaintiffs. The <em>Ramsey</em> action involved purchasers and consumers of Poland Spring water from 1996 to the date of final judgment on November 5, 2003. Doc. # 53-2 at 8. By contrast, the present plaintiffs and proposed class include only purchasers after November 5, 2003. Doc. # 1 at 16-22, 285. Is it possible that one or more of the present class plaintiffs purchased Poland Spring water both before and after November 5, 2003? Likely so. But there is an insufficient factual record at this time to determine the degree of overlap between these two classes, and it would be speculative for me to categorically conclude at this initial pleading stage that <em>all</em> named plaintiffs and prospective class members who purchased or consumed Poland Spring water after November 5, 2003 also did so before November 5, 2003.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-30\">The <em>Ramsey</em> settlement agreement defines \"released claims\" in relevant part to include claims \"that were asserted, that could or might have been asserted in any pleading or amended pleading.\" Doc. # 53-2 at 25-26 (definition of \"released claims\"). The agreement further provides that \"the Released Claims include all claims, rights, demands, causes of action, liabilities, or suits, including Unknown Claims, as of the Effective Date.\" <em>Id.</em> at 46; <em>id.</em> at 47-48 (same). The \"Effective date\" was 30 days after entry of the final judgment in 2003. <em>Id.</em> at 49. These terms do not suggest that the release applies to immunize forever any unlawful conduct that occurred after the date of the release.</p><p id=\"p-31\">As noted above, the <em>Ramsey</em> settlement agreement also provides that \"[t]he Parties agree that Defendant shall be permitted to continue to bottle, label and sell Poland Spring brand bottled water as 'spring water'</p><p id=\"p-32\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"383\" href=\"#p383\" id=\"p383\">*383</a>using all of the spring water sources it has used since January 1, 1996.\" <em>Id.</em> at 33. But this provision applies to only a limited number of Poland Spring water facilities that were operational from 1996 to 2003 and at most binds only plaintiffs who purchased or consumed Poland Spring water prior to November 5, 2003, not those who only bought later. This provision does not furnish grounds to conclude across the board that <em>all</em> present plaintiffs and prospective class members have released any claims concerning the full range of Poland Spring sources that have produced water since November 5, 2003. Indeed, even Nestl\u00e9 does not make this categorical a claim, speculating instead that plaintiffs are \"<em>likely</em> members of the <em>Ramsey</em> class\" and that \"[m]any of them <em>probably</em> purchased or consumed Poland Spring prior to the date of the <em>Ramsey</em> Final Judgment.\" Doc. # 53-1 at 32 (emphasis added).</p><p id=\"p-33\">Under Illinois law, contractual releases that release a party from future liability \"are strictly construed against the benefiting party and must spell out the intention of the parties with great particularity.\" <em>Stratman v.

There is no clear expression of intent in the settlement agreement to prevent all claims against Nestl\u00e9 by anyone who purchased Poland Spring water after November 5, 2003.</p><p id=\"p-34\">Nestl\u00e9's argument based on the <em>Ramsey</em> judgment's permanent injunction is unavailing for the same reason. The judgment states that \"[r]eleasers are permanently barred and enjoined from commencing or prosecuting any direct or representative action ... that involves or asserts any of the Released Claims.\" Doc. # 53-2 at 18; <em>id.</em> at 25 (same). Because I conclude that plaintiffs have not released any of the claims at issue here, this injunction is inapplicable.</p><p id=\"p-35\">Similar reasons belie Nestl\u00e9's <em>res judicata</em> argument.

Federal law may preempt state law in various ways. Sometimes Congress <em>expressly</em> preempts state law by statute, and other times state law may be <em>impliedly</em> preempted if Congress has occupied an entire field or if a state law somehow conflicts with or otherwise stands as an obstacle to the purpose of a federal law. <em>See generally</em> <em>Oneok, Inc. v.

The first provision expressly preempts the States from imposing any \"standard of identity\" for food products (such as spring water) that is \"not identical to [the FDCA] standard of identity.\" <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20343-1\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 343-1</extracted-citation>(a)(1).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The unmistakable terms of this provision preempt any state <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"385\" href=\"#p385\" id=\"p385\">*385</a>requirement that would define \"spring water\" differently from how it is defined under the FDCA. Whether a State may act by means of a state statute, a state regulation, or a common law requirement, the result is the same: a State may not impose a \"spring water\" requirement that varies in scope or substance from the federal definition under the FDCA. <em>See, e.g.,</em> <em>In re PepsiCo, Inc., Bottled Water Mktg. &amp; Sales Practices Litig.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187315\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/588/527/#p532\">588 F.Supp.2d 527</extracted-citation>, 532 (S.D.N.Y. 2008).</p><p id=\"p-41\">The second significant provision of the FDCA is one that provides that \"[a]ll such proceedings for the enforcement, or to restrain violations, of this chapter shall be by and in the name of the United States.\" <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20337\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 337</extracted-citation>(a). What this provision reflects is that only the federal government-not private parties-may enforce violations of the FDCA. <em>See, e.g.,</em> <em>POM Wonderful LLC v. Coca-Cola Co.</em> , --- U.S. ----, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581234\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2228/#p2235\">134 S.Ct. 2228</extracted-citation>, 2235, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581234\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2228/#p2235\">189 L.Ed.2d 141</extracted-citation> (2014). (noting that \"the FDCA and its regulations provide the United States with nearly exclusive enforcement authority\").</p><p id=\"p-42\">Although \u00a7 337(a) does not expressly preempt state law, it has long been understood to have an implied preemptive effect. In <em>Buckman Co. v.

The Supreme Court recognized that the FDCA \"leaves no doubt that it is the Federal Government rather than private litigants who are authorized to file suit for noncompliance with\" FDCA requirements. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505666\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/341/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> at 349 n.5, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9505666\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/531/341/\">121 S.Ct. 1012</extracted-citation> (citing <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20337\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 337</extracted-citation>(a) ). Because the FDCA reserves to the federal government the exclusive authority to decide if or how the FDCA will be enforced, the Supreme Court in <em>Buckman</em> understood this to impliedly preempt a state law claim based on conduct that was wrongful solely because it violated the FDCA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-43\">The Second Circuit has noted that there can be no state law cause of action if a plaintiff's \"true goal is to privately enforce alleged violations of the FDCA.\" <em>PDK Labs, Inc. v. Friedlander</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"967\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/103/1105/#p1113\">103 F.3d 1105</extracted-citation>, 1113 (2d Cir. 1997). In equal measure, the Sixth Circuit has observed that \"[t]he [FDCA] statute's public enforcement mechanism is thwarted if savvy plaintiffs can label as arising under a state law for which there exists a private enforcement mechanism a claim that in substance seeks to enforce the FDCA.\" <em>Loreto v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co.</em> , <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=515%20Fed.%20Appx.%20576\">515 Fed.Appx. 576</extracted-citation>, 579 (6th Cir. 2013). It would not mean much for Congress to foreclose private enforcement of the FDCA if this meant that any plaintiff could end-run this restriction by suing to enforce the FDCA under the guise of a state law claim for relief.</p><p id=\"p-44\">Taken together, these two provisions of the FDCA- \u00a7 343-1(a)(1) and \u00a7 337(a) -have a broad preemptive effect on state law claims like those at issue in this case. On the one hand, \u00a7 343-1(a)(1) precludes the States from adopting their own self-styled <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"386\" href=\"#p386\" id=\"p386\">*386</a>definitions or labeling requirements for \"spring water\" that differ or depart from the federal standards. On the other hand, \u00a7 337(a) -as interpreted in <em>Buckman</em> -forecloses state law causes of action that are predicated on a violation of the FDCA rather than on some independent provision or requirement of state law.</p><p id=\"p-45\">The upshot is that only a narrow range of state law claims involving mislabeling of \"spring water\" may escape preemption by the FDCA. In order to survive preemption, a state law claim must rely on an independent state law duty that parallels or mirrors the FDCA's requirement for \"spring water,\" but must not solely and exclusively rely on violations of the FDCA's own requirements.</p><p id=\"p-46\">As Judge Posner has put it in a similar context, a State \"can impose the <em>identical</em> requirement or requirements, and by doing so be enabled ... to enforce a violation of the [FDCA] as a violation of state law.\" <em>Turek v. Gen. Mills, Inc.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3851652\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/662/423/#p426\">662 F.3d 423</extracted-citation>, 426 (7th Cir. 2011). Yet a plaintiff may not simply dress up a generic state law claim of wrongful conduct to prosecute conduct that is \"wrong\" only because it happens to violate the federal law requirements of the FDCA:</p><p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-47\">[T]he conduct on which the claim is premised must be the type of conduct that would traditionally give rise to liability under state law-and that would give rise to liability under state law even if the FDCA had never been enacted. If the defendant's conduct is not of this type, then the plaintiff is effectively suing for a violation of the FDCA (no matter how the plaintiff labels the claim), and the plaintiff's claim is thus impliedly preempted under <em>Buckman</em> .</p><p id=\"p-49\">The kind of state law claim that may survive preemption is well demonstrated in the California Supreme Court's decision <em>In re Farm Raised Salmon Cases</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673080\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/42/1077/\">42 Cal. 4th 1077</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20112\">72 Cal.Rptr.3d 112</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=175%20P.3d%201170\">175 P.3d 1170</extracted-citation> (2008). There the California Supreme Court considered a lawsuit against various grocery stores alleging that they were selling artificially colored farmed salmon without disclosing to customers the use of color additives. The lawsuits were based on various California consumer protection laws that were in turn predicated on the violation of another California law-the Sherman Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Law-that required food product labeling to reflect the use of artificial food colors and that also expressly incorporated all of the FDCA's requirements as the state law of California. <em>Id.</em> at 1086-87, <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20112\">72 Cal.Rptr.3d 112</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=175%20P.3d%201170\">175 P.3d 1170</extracted-citation>.

Nor was there was implied preemption under \u00a7 337(a) because state law created an independent state law duty, such that it could not be said that the claim was merely an attempt to enforce the FDCA. <em>See also</em> <em>In re Trader Joe's Tuna Litig.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523237\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/289/1074/#p1082\">289 F.Supp.3d 1074</extracted-citation>, 1082-85 (C.D. Cal. 2017) ( \u00a7 337(a) does not preempt food labeling claim premised on California's Sherman Law because the Sherman Law creates a separate state law duty by incorporating FDCA standards as a matter of state law).</p><p id=\"p-50\">It is one thing for a State like California to outright adopt an FDCA standard and then for a plaintiff to sue under state law for the violation of that standard. But it is wholly another thing for a State <em>not</em> to adopt or mirror an FDCA standard and then for a plaintiff to sue under a generic state law claim (such as for fraud, breach <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"387\" href=\"#p387\" id=\"p387\">*387</a>of contract, or unfair trade practices) that would not be actionable absent a violation of the FDCA standard.</p><p id=\"p-51\">Where a state law claim would not exist but for a FDCA regulation, \u00a7 337(a) impliedly preempts the claim. For example, in <em>Verzani v.

The principal complaint alleges that Nestl\u00e9's Poland Spring water products \"are falsely advertised and sold fraudulently to consumers <em>because they do not comply with the FDA's 'standard of identity' for spring water</em> , which defines genuine spring water and specifies the manner in which spring water must be 'collected' (or extracted) from the earth.\" Doc. # 1 at 12 (\u00b6 26) (emphasis added). The complaint goes on to describe in detail how the collection of Poland Spring water at multiple sites in Maine fails to comply with what the FDA requires. <em>See, e.g.,</em> <em>id.</em> at 12-16 (\u00b6\u00b6 27-41) (summary of plaintiffs' allegations); <em>id.</em> at 287 (\u00b6 879(c) ) (describing common questions of law for class certification basis to include \"[w]hether Poland Spring Water complies with FDA regulations concerning bottled spring water\").</p><p id=\"p-54\">More telling still, the complaint proclaims that because the \"FDA lacks resources to police and enforce all of its regulations,\" the enforcement of the FDA's rules is \"largely dependent upon ... private civil lawsuits such as this one.\" Doc. # 1 at 39 (\u00b6 106). Of course, that very ambition-to pursue a private cause of action under the FDCA-is exactly what \u00a7 337(a) and <em>Buckman</em> forbid.</p><p id=\"p-55\">Each and every one of plaintiffs' claims are wholly FDCA-dependent. Plaintiffs' principal claim of fraud for nationwide class relief refers solely to FDA regulations rather than any provisions of state law. <em>Id.</em> at 290-91 (\u00b6\u00b6 890-900). Plaintiffs' breach-of-contract claim for nationwide class relief similarly relies on plaintiffs' allegation that the product delivered by Nestl\u00e9 was not \"genuine spring water,\" previously defined by reference solely to <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"388\" href=\"#p388\" id=\"p388\">*388</a>FDA regulations. <em>Id.</em> at 292 (\u00b6 907). Plaintiffs' various state law claims cite specific consumer protection statutes, but each of these generic consumer protection statutes are alleged to be violated because of Nestl\u00e9's recurring failure to comply with the FDA's federal standard for spring water. <em>Id.</em> at 293 (\u00b6 915), 295 (\u00b6 926), 297 (\u00b6 939), 298-99 (\u00b6 948), 301-02 (\u00b6\u00b6 961, 965, 967), 306 (\u00b6 986), 310 (\u00b6 1007), 314-15 (\u00b6\u00b6 1031, 1034), 319 (\u00b6 1056).</p><p id=\"p-56\">As if all this weren't enough, plaintiffs' own briefing likewise concedes that \"[p]laintiffs' claims are based entirely on their allegation that 'Defendant Nestle Water's Poland Spring Water products are falsely advertised and sold fraudulently to consumers because they do not comply with the FDA's 'standard of identity' for spring water, which defines genuine spring water and specifies the manner in which spring water must be 'collected' (or extracted) from the earth.' \" Doc. # 72 at 41-42 (quoting Compl. \u00b6 26). Indeed, plaintiffs concede that their \"claims are all co-existent with the FDCA and FDA regulations and will rise or fall based solely on whether they can prove that Poland Spring Water fails to meet the FDA's identity standard.\" <em>Id.</em> at 42.</p><p id=\"p-57\">This case is similar to <em>Loreto v. Procter &amp; Gamble Co.</em> , <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=515%20Fed.%20Appx.%20576\">515 Fed.Appx. 576</extracted-citation> (6th Cir. 2013), in which the Sixth Circuit addressed a lawsuit against Procter &amp; Gamble for its cold medicine labeling that represented \"that taking Vitamin C can blunt the effects of a cold.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=515%20Fed.%20Appx.%20576\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=515%20Fed.%20Appx.%20576\"> at 579</extracted-citation>. The plaintiffs advanced claims under state consumer laws based on two theories of liability: (1) that the products were illegal because the label did not comply with FDCA requirements, and (2) that the label was false or misleading. The court held that the first theory was impliedly preempted under <em>Buckman</em> because it \"depends entirely upon an FDCA violation-<em>i.e.</em> , the <em>only</em> reason Procter &amp; Gamble's products were allegedly 'illegal' was because they failed to comply with FDCA labeling requirements.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=515%20Fed.%20Appx.%20576\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=515%20Fed.%20Appx.%20576\"> at 579</extracted-citation>. In contrast, the court allowed the second theory to proceed because it would be actionable under state tort law regardless whether it was also required by the FDCA. In other words, the label's representation about the efficacy of Vitamin C was misleading because-entirely apart from the FDCA-the claims were allegedly factually false.</p><p id=\"p-58\">Plaintiffs' claims in this case are comparable to the first theory in <em>Loreto</em> . Plaintiffs allege that Poland Spring's labels are fraudulent and misleading because they violate the FDA spring water identity regulation. Absent the FDA's specific standard of identity requirements for \"spring water,\" plaintiffs would have no claims at all.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-59\">Plaintiffs argue by way of footnote that <em>Buckman</em> is limited to the medical devices context. Doc. # 72 at 42 n.9. I don't agree. Although it is true that <em>Buckman</em> involved medical devices, the key provision on which it relied-\u00a7 337(a) of the FDCA-was part of the original FDCA when enacted <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"389\" href=\"#p389\" id=\"p389\">*389</a>in 1938. <em>See</em> Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, Pub. L. No. 75-717, ch. 675, \u00a7 307, <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20Stat.%201040\">52 Stat. 1040</extracted-citation>, 1046 (1938). Section 337(a) makes clear that it is the federal government-not the States or private parties-that retains exclusive authority to enforce provisions of the FDCA. This provision of general application lacks any indication that it applies only in the medical devices context rather than across the full range of matters regulated by the FDCA.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-60\">Plaintiffs further rely on the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Bates v. Dow Agrosciences, LLC</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5880369\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/431/\">544 U.S. 431</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5880369\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/431/\">125 S.Ct. 1788</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5880369\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/431/\">161 L.Ed.2d 687</extracted-citation> (2005), in which the Supreme Court rejected a preemption challenge under an express preemption provision of another statute-the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)-that barred state law labeling requirements \"in addition to or different from\" those required under that statute. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"5880369\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/431/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"5880369\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/431/\"> at 443</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5880369\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/431/\">125 S.Ct. 1788</extracted-citation>. Plaintiffs contend that <em>Bates</em> \"really controls here, not the narrow <em>Buckman</em> line of cases.\" Doc. # 111 at 42. I don't agree. <em>Bates</em> did not even concern the FDCA, much less did it concern the preemptive scope of \u00a7 337(a) or a similar federal-exclusivity-of-enforcement provision. Nor did <em>Bates</em> cite or discuss <em>Buckman</em> . In any event, to the extent that the reasoning in <em>Bates</em> has persuasive value here, <em>Bates</em> at best supports plaintiffs' claim against <em>express</em> preemption under \u00a7 343-1(a)(1) of the FDCA but has nothing to say about why there should not be <em>implied</em> preemption under \u00a7 337(a) of the FDCA.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-61\">In short, despite the efforts plaintiffs make to clothe their claims in the garb of state law, the reality is that they are suing solely to enforce the FDCA's federal \"spring water\" standard. That is what <em>Buckman</em> and \u00a7 337(a) do not allow. Accordingly, I will dismiss the complaints on the ground that they are impliedly preempted by \u00a7 337(a) of the FDCA.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p><p id=\"p-62\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"390\" href=\"#p390\" id=\"p390\">*390</a><strong><em>Dismissal of Consolidated Actions</em></strong></p><p id=\"p-63\">Four other class action lawsuits were filed after the filing of the <em>Patane</em> complaint and have been consolidated before me with this case. Just like the <em>Patane</em> complaint, these complaints assert nationwide and/or multi-state common law claims for fraud and/or breach of contract or breach of express warranty, as well as sub-class claims for violation of particular consumer protection statutes of particular states.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As best as I can tell, all of these complaints essentially seek to enforce the FDA's \"spring water\" standard rather than any \"spring water\" standard that has been independently established or adopted under any state law.</p><p id=\"p-64\">The consolidated cases <em>Krinsky v. Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America, Inc.</em> , 3:17-cv-01474, and <em>Lilly v. Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America, Inc.</em> , 3:17-cv-01566, were consolidated with the <em>Patane</em> case prior to Nestl\u00e9's filing of the motion to dismiss. <em>See Patane</em> docket, Docs. # 40, # 41. Nestl\u00e9's motion to dismiss expressly requests the dismissal of the <em>Patane, Krinsky</em> , and <em>Lilly</em> complaints. Doc. # 53 at 1. The <em>Brown</em> case was consolidated with this case after Nestl\u00e9's motion to dismiss was filed, but the parties stipulated that the motion to dismiss would apply equally to the <em>Brown</em> case. <em>See Brown v. Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America, Inc.</em> , 3:17-cv-01746, Doc. # 23 at 2-4. Because the <em>Krinsky, Lilly</em> , and <em>Brown</em> complaints are similar in material respects to the <em>Patane</em> complaint, I will dismiss each of the consolidated complaints for the same reason as discussed above: that they are preempted by \u00a7 337(a) of the FDCA.</p><p id=\"p-65\">The <em>Ray</em> case was not consolidated with this case until after the motion to dismiss was filed, and the <em>Ray</em> plaintiffs did not stipulate that the motion to dismiss filed in <em>Patane</em> would apply equally to the <em>Ray</em> action. <em>See Ray v. Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America Inc.</em> , 3:17-cv-01944, Doc. # 24 (stipulation that Nestl\u00e9 would have 30 days after the Court's ruling on the motion to dismiss to reply to the <em>Ray</em> complaint). Because the <em>Ray</em> complaint is similar in all material respects to the <em>Patane</em> complaint, it looks to me like my ruling here would apply with equal force to the <em>Ray</em> complaint. But because <em>Ray</em> was not subject to the motion to dismiss, I will not dismiss the case at this time. This ruling is without prejudice to Nestle's filing of a motion to dismiss the <em>Ray</em> complaint within 30 days <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"391\" href=\"#p391\" id=\"p391\">*391</a>and for the <em>Ray</em> plaintiffs to file any response.</p><p id=\"p-66\"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p><p id=\"p-67\">For the foregoing reasons, Nestl\u00e9's motion to dismiss (Doc. # 53) is GRANTED, and the following complaints are dismissed: <em>Patane v.

Although <em>Desiano</em> declined to find that <em>Buckman</em> preempted a state law claim, I do not understand <em>Desiano</em> to categorically limit <em>Buckman</em> solely to claims of fraud-on-the-FDA as distinct from claims of fraud-on-the-public where the fraud depends wholly on what the FDA requires in the first instance. <em>Desiano</em> notes concerns about preserving the prerogatives of traditional state tort law and that traditional state tort law does not protect against fraud on the FDA. Equally so, traditional state tort law does not encompass claims for conduct that is wrongful only because it runs afoul of what the FDA requires. Ultimately, <em>Desiano</em> concludes that <em>Buckman</em> did not preempt a plaintiff's state law claims because these claims \"are not premised principally (let alone exclusively) on a drug maker's failure to comply with federal disclosure requirements,\" but involved \"a wide range of putative violations of common law duties long-recognized by Michigan's tort regime.\" <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3804192\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/467/85/\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3804192\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/467/85/\"> at 95</extracted-citation>.

Mass. 2006), they overlook that the court in <em>Vermont Pure</em> followed <em>Bates</em> without citing or discussing <em>Buckman</em> .</p><p id=\"p-83\">Because I conclude that this action is impliedly preempted under \u00a7 337(a) of the FDCA, I need not consider for now Nestl\u00e9's alternative argument (Doc. # 53-1 at 48-54) that plaintiffs' claims are expressly preempted to the extent that plaintiffs effectively seek to invoke and enforce \"spring water\" requirements that differ from those set forth under the FDCA and accompanying regulations. Nor is it necessary for me to consider at this time Nestl\u00e9's highly fact-laden arguments that state regulators have authorized its actions in a manner that precludes plaintiffs' breach of contract claim and that qualifies Nestl\u00e9 for a \"safe harbor\" from enforcement of state consumer protection statutes. I will also not consider for now Nestl\u00e9's argument that I should defer to the primary jurisdiction of the FDA. Similarly, I decline at this point to address plaintiffs' equally fact-laden arguments about Nestl\u00e9's alleged corruption of state regulatory processes.</p><p id=\"p-84\"><em>See Krinsky v.
