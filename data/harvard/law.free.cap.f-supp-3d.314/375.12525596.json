They claim that Poland Spring water products are fraudulently labeled and sold as \"spring water\" despite not meeting the requirements for \"spring water\" as defined by law. Defendant Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America Inc. (\"Nestl\u00e9\") has moved to dismiss the complaints. Although I reject many of Nestl\u00e9's arguments, I agree with Nestl\u00e9 that plaintiffs' claims are all preempted by federal law. Accordingly, I will grant the motion to dismiss and dismiss the complaint in this action as well as the complaint in all but one of the consolidated actions.\n     <footnotemark>\n      1\n     </footnotemark>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-13\">\n     Plaintiffs allege that Nestl\u00e9 sells about a billion gallons of Poland Spring water every year but that not one drop of it is actually \"spring water\" within the FDA's definition. Plaintiffs insist that Poland Spring water is ordinary groundwater and surface water that Nestl\u00e9 draws from a series of artificial springs in Maine. The bulk of plaintiffs' 325-page complaint is devoted to detailing how the water produced at eight specific Poland Spring sites in Maine does not meet the FDA's \"spring water\" requirements. Doc. # 1 at 65-279.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-14\">\n     According to plaintiffs, Nestl\u00e9 labels its Poland Spring water as \"spring water\" so that it may fraudulently charge consumers a higher price than they would be willing to pay for non-spring water products. Plaintiffs have allegedly relied on Nestl\u00e9's mislabeling of its water and overpaid for Poland Spring water.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-18\">\n     <strong>\n      <em>\n       Constitutional Standing\n      </em>\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-20\">\n     The allegations here easily suffice to meet the requirements for constitutional standing. Plaintiffs allege that they relied on Nestl\u00e9's representation that Poland Spring water was \"100% Natural Spring Water,\" and because of this reliance they paid a higher price for Poland Spring water than they would have paid for alternative water products.\n     <footnotemark>\n      4\n     </footnotemark>\n     If Nestl\u00e9 indeed mislabeled its water as plaintiffs claim, it is plausible to conclude that plaintiffs chose to buy Poland Spring water and paid more for it than for non-spring-water alternatives. It is likewise plausible to conclude that Nestl\u00e9 was well aware of the likely effect that labeling its water as \"100% Natural Spring Water\" would have on consumer preferences. The facts alleged plausibly establish an injury-in-fact caused by Nestl\u00e9's alleged wrongful conduct and redressable by an award of damages.\n     <em>\n      See, e.g.,\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Estrada v.

Nestl\u00e9 Waters North America, Inc.\n      </em>\n      , 3:17-cv-01381(JAM). It alleges that Nestl\u00e9 has long marketed its ubiquitous Poland Spring water products as \"100% Natural Spring Water,\" despite the fact that it is not \"spring water\" as that term is very specifically defined by federal law.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-11\">\n      By way of background, the federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) establishes basic definitions (known as \"standards of identity\") for food products and prohibits the false labeling of such food products.\n      <footnotemark>\n       2\n      </footnotemark>\n      In accordance with its regulatory authority under the FDCA, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has promulgated a detailed regulatory definition of \"spring water\" that distinguishes it\n      from other kinds of water that may be marketed for public sale.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20165.110\">\n       21 C.F.R. \u00a7 165.110\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (a)(2)(vi).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-12\">\n      According to the FDA, if a water product is to be labeled and sold as \"spring water,\" the water must be \"derived from an underground formation from which water flows naturally to the surface of the earth,\" and there must be a \"natural force causing the water to flow to the surface through a natural orifice.\"\n      <em>\n       Ibid.\n      </em>\n      The FDA's regulation further provides that \"spring water\" can be \"collected only at the spring or through a bore hole tapping the underground formation feeding the spring,\" and that if it is collected \"with the use of an external force,\" the water must be \"from the same underground stratum as the spring, as shown by a measurable hydraulic connection using a hydrogeologically valid method between the bore hole and the natural spring, and shall have all the physical properties, before treatment, and be of the same composition and quality, as the water that flows naturally to the surface of the earth.\"\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20165.110\">\n        Ibid.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-15\">\n      Although the crux of the complaint is that Poland Spring water does not comply with federal law, it is undisputed that the FDCA does not give rise to a private federal cause of action for violation of the FDA's \"spring water\" regulation. Accordingly, the complaint alleges only state law causes of action. The first two counts of the complaint allege general state common law claims for fraud and breach of contract on behalf of a nationwide class whose members have purchased Poland Spring water since November 5, 2003. The next nine counts on behalf of individual state sub-classes allege violations of various consumer fraud and unfair trade practice statutes of Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont.\n      <footnotemark>\n       3\n      </footnotemark>\n      All of these counts of the complaint are premised on a common allegation that Poland Spring water is mislabeled as \"spring water\" in violation of federal law.

The standard that governs such a motion is well established: a complaint may not survive unless it alleges facts that taken as true give rise to plausible grounds to sustain the Court's subject matter jurisdiction and to sustain plaintiffs' claims for relief.\n      <em>\n       See, e.g.,\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Ashcroft v.

Because a federal court should ordinarily resolve any doubts about the existence of subject matter jurisdiction prior to considering the merits of a complaint,\n      <em>\n       see, e.g.,\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Singh v.

In accordance with the Constitution's \"case-or-controversy\" requirement, a federal court lacks jurisdiction over a lawsuit unless a plaintiff alleges a concrete and particularized injury-in-fact that is fairly traceable to a defendant's wrongful conduct and redressable by a court order.\n      <em>\n       See, e.g.,\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Spokeo, Inc. v.

According to Nestl\u00e9, these prior lawsuits and attendant media coverage put plaintiffs on notice that Poland Spring's \"spring water\" labels were false. But the possibility that any prior lawsuits or media coverage put plaintiffs on notice of anything is a fact question that is not suitable for me to resolve at the pleading stage on a motion to dismiss. Moreover, Nestl\u00e9's argument ignores Nestl\u00e9's own steadfast denials in prior lawsuits that it was mislabeling Poland Spring water. Nestl\u00e9 cannot have it both ways: that plaintiffs somehow \"knew\" Nestl\u00e9's labels were false but that\n      Nestl\u00e9's labels were\n      <em>\n       not\n      </em>\n      in fact false.

The agreement by a prior class of plaintiffs in\n      <em>\n       Ramsey\n      </em>\n      to allow Nestl\u00e9 to continue some of its conduct is precisely the kind of ratification or acquiescence that does not meet the more demanding causation requirement\n      for the\n      <em>\n       Rooker-Feldman\n      </em>\n      doctrine.\n      <em>\n       See, e.g.,\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Green v.

Plaintiffs' alleged injuries here are caused by Nestl\u00e9's purported ongoing, post-\n      <em>\n       Ramsey\n      </em>\n      course of deceptive conduct and not by what the state court in\n      <em>\n       Ramsey\n      </em>\n      ordered or by what the prior parties to the\n      <em>\n       Ramsey\n      </em>\n      judgment agreed. Accordingly, the\n      <em>\n       Rooker-Feldman\n      </em>\n      doctrine does not deprive the Court of subject matter jurisdiction over this case.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-27\">\n      <strong>\n       <em>\n        Release and Res Judicata\n       </em>\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-28\">\n      In a similar vein, Nestl\u00e9 argues that plaintiffs' claims are foreclosed by the\n      <em>\n       Ramsey\n      </em>\n      settlement agreement. According to Nestl\u00e9, the\n      <em>\n       Ramsey\n      </em>\n      settlement precludes plaintiffs' class action for at least two reasons: (1) the\n      <em>\n       Ramsey\n      </em>\n      settlement agreement expressly released Nestl\u00e9 from plaintiffs' claims, and (2) the\n      <em>\n       Ramsey\n      </em>\n      settlement agreement triggers the rule of\n      <em>\n       res judicata\n      </em>\n      . I don't agree with either of these arguments.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-29\">\n      As an initial matter, the record does not presently allow for a conclusion that the\n      <em>\n       Ramsey\n      </em>\n      class is the same as or is in privity with the current proposed class of plaintiffs. The\n      <em>\n       Ramsey\n      </em>\n      action involved purchasers and consumers of Poland Spring water from 1996 to the date of final judgment on November 5, 2003. Doc. # 53-2 at 8. By contrast, the present plaintiffs and proposed class include only purchasers after November 5, 2003. Doc. # 1 at 16-22, 285. Is it possible that one or more of the present class plaintiffs purchased Poland Spring water both before and after November 5, 2003? Likely so. But there is an insufficient factual record at this time to determine the degree of overlap between these two classes, and it would be speculative for me to categorically conclude at this initial pleading stage that\n      <em>\n       all\n      </em>\n      named plaintiffs and prospective class members who purchased or consumed Poland Spring water after November 5, 2003 also did so before November 5, 2003.\n      <footnotemark>\n       6\n      </footnotemark>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-30\">\n      The\n      <em>\n       Ramsey\n      </em>\n      settlement agreement defines \"released claims\" in relevant part to include claims \"that were asserted, that could or might have been asserted in any pleading or amended pleading.\" Doc. # 53-2 at 25-26 (definition of \"released claims\"). The agreement further provides that \"the Released Claims include all claims, rights, demands, causes of action, liabilities, or suits, including Unknown Claims, as of the Effective Date.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 46;\n      <em>\n       id.\n      </em>\n      at 47-48 (same). The \"Effective date\" was 30 days after entry of the final judgment in 2003.\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 49. These terms do not suggest that the release applies to immunize forever any unlawful conduct that occurred after the date of the release.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-31\">\n      As noted above, the\n      <em>\n       Ramsey\n      </em>\n      settlement agreement also provides that \"[t]he Parties agree that Defendant shall be permitted to continue to bottle, label and sell Poland Spring brand bottled water as 'spring water'\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-32\">\n      using all of the spring water sources it has used since January 1, 1996.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 33. But this provision applies to only a limited number of Poland Spring water facilities that were operational from 1996 to 2003 and at most binds only plaintiffs who purchased or consumed Poland Spring water prior to November 5, 2003, not those who only bought later. This provision does not furnish grounds to conclude across the board that\n      <em>\n       all\n      </em>\n      present plaintiffs and prospective class members have released any claims concerning the full range of Poland Spring sources that have produced water since November 5, 2003. Indeed, even Nestl\u00e9 does not make this categorical a claim, speculating instead that plaintiffs are \"\n      <em>\n       likely\n      </em>\n      members of the\n      <em>\n       Ramsey\n      </em>\n      class\" and that \"[m]any of them\n      <em>\n       probably\n      </em>\n      purchased or consumed Poland Spring prior to the date of the\n      <em>\n       Ramsey\n      </em>\n      Final Judgment.\" Doc. # 53-1 at 32 (emphasis added).\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-33\">\n      Under Illinois law, contractual releases that release a party from future liability \"are strictly construed against the benefiting party and must spell out the intention of the parties with great particularity.\"\n      <em>\n       Stratman v.

It would not mean much for Congress to foreclose private enforcement of the FDCA if this meant that any plaintiff could end-run this restriction by suing to enforce the FDCA under the guise of a state law claim for relief.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-44\">\n      Taken together, these two provisions of the FDCA- \u00a7 343-1(a)(1) and \u00a7 337(a) -have a broad preemptive effect on state law claims like those at issue in this case. On the one hand, \u00a7 343-1(a)(1) precludes the States from adopting their own self-styled\n      definitions or labeling requirements for \"spring water\" that differ or depart from the federal standards. On the other hand, \u00a7 337(a) -as interpreted in\n      <em>\n       Buckman\n      </em>\n      -forecloses state law causes of action that are predicated on a violation of the FDCA rather than on some independent provision or requirement of state law.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-45\">\n      The upshot is that only a narrow range of state law claims involving mislabeling of \"spring water\" may escape preemption by the FDCA. In order to survive preemption, a state law claim must rely on an independent state law duty that parallels or mirrors the FDCA's requirement for \"spring water,\" but must not solely and exclusively rely on violations of the FDCA's own requirements.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-46\">\n      As Judge Posner has put it in a similar context, a State \"can impose the\n      <em>\n       identical\n      </em>\n      requirement or requirements, and by doing so be enabled ... to enforce a violation of the [FDCA] as a violation of state law.\"\n      <em>\n       Turek v.

The court held that the first theory was impliedly preempted under\n      <em>\n       Buckman\n      </em>\n      because it \"depends entirely upon an FDCA violation-\n      <em>\n       i.e.\n      </em>\n      , the\n      <em>\n       only\n      </em>\n      reason Procter &amp; Gamble's products were allegedly 'illegal' was because they failed to comply with FDCA labeling requirements.\"\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=515%20Fed.%20Appx.%20576\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=515%20Fed.%20Appx.%20576\">\n       at 579\n      </extracted-citation>\n      . In contrast, the court allowed the second theory to proceed because it would be actionable under state tort law regardless whether it was also required by the FDCA. In other words, the label's representation about the efficacy of Vitamin C was misleading because-entirely apart from the FDCA-the claims were allegedly factually false.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-58\">\n      Plaintiffs' claims in this case are comparable to the first theory in\n      <em>\n       Loreto\n      </em>\n      . Plaintiffs allege that Poland Spring's labels are fraudulent and misleading because they violate the FDA spring water identity regulation.

Although it is true that\n      <em>\n       Buckman\n      </em>\n      involved medical devices, the key provision on which it relied-\u00a7 337(a) of the FDCA-was part of the original FDCA when enacted\n      in 1938.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, Pub.

Section 337(a) makes clear that it is the federal government-not the States or private parties-that retains exclusive authority to enforce provisions of the FDCA. This provision of general application lacks any indication that it applies only in the medical devices context rather than across the full range of matters regulated by the FDCA.\n      <footnotemark>\n       11\n      </footnotemark>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-60\">\n      Plaintiffs further rely on the Supreme Court's decision in\n      <em>\n       Bates v.

Ultimately,\n      <em>\n       Desiano\n      </em>\n      concludes that\n      <em>\n       Buckman\n      </em>\n      did not preempt a plaintiff's state law claims because these claims \"are not premised principally (let alone exclusively) on a drug maker's failure to comply with federal disclosure requirements,\" but involved \"a wide range of putative violations of common law duties long-recognized by Michigan's tort regime.\"\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3804192\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/467/85/\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3804192\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/467/85/\">\n       at 95\n      </extracted-citation>\n      . Here there is no similar analogue to a state law claim that does not rise or fall on the basis of what the FDCA requires.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-82\">\n      Similarly, to the extent that plaintiffs heavily rely on the reasoning of the district court in\n      <em>\n       Vermont Pure Holdings, Ltd. v.

Nor is it necessary for me to consider at this time Nestl\u00e9's highly fact-laden arguments that state regulators have authorized its actions in a manner that precludes plaintiffs' breach of contract claim and that qualifies Nestl\u00e9 for a \"safe harbor\" from enforcement of state consumer protection statutes. I will also not consider for now Nestl\u00e9's argument that I should defer to the primary jurisdiction of the FDA. Similarly, I decline at this point to address plaintiffs' equally fact-laden arguments about Nestl\u00e9's alleged corruption of state regulatory processes.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-84\">\n      <em>\n       See Krinsky v.
