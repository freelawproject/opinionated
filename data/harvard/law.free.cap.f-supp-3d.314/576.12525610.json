Though Dowd was ultimately cleared of those charges after an administrative hearing, he claims that he was harmed by having to pay lawyers to defend him and by the continued presence of the departmental charges in his NYPD personnel file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The four named defendants are NYPD officers who are represented by the Corporation Counsel of the City of New York. Defendants previously moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and plaintiff amended his complaint in response. Defendants then moved to dismiss the amended complaint, again for failure to state claims upon which relief can be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As set forth below, the Court agrees that plaintiff has failed to set forth viable claims for relief and therefore grants defendants'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   motion to dismiss the amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The following facts are as alleged in the first amended complaint (\"FAC\") and are assumed to be true for purposes of this motion. Plaintiff Charles F. Dowd served thirty-four years in the New York Police Department and attained the rank of Assistant Chief, which is in \"the top forty officers of the hierarchy of the NYPD,\" before retiring in May 2014. (FAC, Doc. 25 \u00b6\u00b6 8-9.) Defendants Sergeant Daren DeMarco, Lieutenant Kurt Weber, Deputy Inspector Joseph DiBartolomeo, and Deputy Commissioner Joseph Reznick are NYPD officers who served in the department's Internal Affairs Bureau (\"IAB\") in 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-13.) These four officers are sued in both their individual and official capacities, along with unidentified John Doe police officers alleged to be their co-conspirators. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Beginning in March 2014, Dowd alleges, defendants conspired to subject him to baseless disciplinary charges falsely asserting that he improperly accepted gifts from Black Box Network Services, a vendor doing business with the NYPD. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 16, 19.) Assisted by an unspecified number of John Does, Reznick allegedly supervised the work of DiBartolomeo; DiBartolomeo supervised Weber; and Weber in turn supervised DeMarco, who was the \"primary investigator in the matter.\" Plaintiff identifies DeMarco as \"the individual on which the entire investigation into Chief Dowd pivoted,\" but also alleges that all four defendants approved the filing of the disciplinary charges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 21;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 11-14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The substance of those charges was that on specified dates from 2010 to 2013, Black Box paid the costs for Dowd's attendance at five meals, a golf outing, and a Yankees game-for an estimated total value to him of more than $780. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21; Petition, Doc. 29-3 \u00b6 6.) In fact, however, Dowd possessed alibi evidence proving that he was out of state or otherwise occupied on six of these seven occasions. And as for the seventh-a July 1, 2010 dinner at Wolfgang's Steakhouse, at a cost of $342.87 per person-the department possessed insufficient evidence to prove either that Dowd attended the dinner or that, if he did, he failed to pay his fair share. (FAC \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff cites various reasons to believe that defendants' investigation was conducted in bad faith. According to Dowd, defendants either chose not to review or else maliciously suppressed available evidence-\"NYPD documents such as duty rosters, time sheets, travel requests and approvals, EZ Pass records, official photographs, and telephone records\"-that would have exculpated him by establishing his absence from the events in question. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 17, 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Defendant DeMarco, the lead investigator, did not interview either plaintiff or the Black Box salesmen implicated in the allegations, although two investigators from the U.S. Attorney's office did interview Dowd. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 31-32.) In addition, though DeMarco later testified under oath (at the administrative hearing described below) that he maintained a file recording the details of his investigation, the NYPD Legal Bureau denied the existence of any such file in response to a subpoena. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When Dowd learned in March 2014 that he was under investigation in connection with these allegations, he twice sought unsuccessfully to meet with the police commissioner to discuss the matter. In April 2014, at least one New York newspaper published an article implicating Dowd in alleged Black Box-related ethics violations\n   by two of his subordinates; Dowd alleges that defendants leaked the story to the press. Dowd then filed for retirement on May 1, 2014, effective thirty days later. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants brought departmental charges against Dowd in August 2014 and forwarded the charges to the New York Conflicts of Interest Board (\"COIB\" or \"Board\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19, 23.) Dowd claims that defendants intentionally waited to file the charges until after his retirement, foreclosing the possibility of resolving the matter through an internal NYPD hearing-which would have spared him the \"enormous\" expenditure of legal fees for his own defense-and preventing him from challenging the departmental charges, which remain in his personnel file to this day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 19-20, 22, 44, 57.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In January 2015, the COIB served Dowd with a notice of their \"initial determination ... that there is probable cause to believe [Dowd] violated provisions of Chapter 68 of the City Charter,\" which governs conflicts of interest. (Probable Cause Notice, Doc. 29-2;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FAC \u00b6 23.) The Board gave Dowd twenty days to respond to the allegations before it would commence a hearing at the New York City Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings (\"OATH\") to determine whether the violations had in fact occurred. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 23-24; Probable Cause Notice at 3.) Although Dowd responded to that first notice, the Board nonetheless served him in July 2015 with a Notice of Petition commencing formal proceedings, giving him thirteen days to answer the allegations or else be deemed to have admitted them in the subsequent OATH hearing. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 24-26; Notice of Petition, Doc. 29-3 at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Dowd repeatedly characterizes these COIB charges as \"criminal charges\" or a \"criminal prosecution,\" (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 2, 59;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 1, 16-18, 26, 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), citing the provision in New York City Charter Section 2606(c) that a violator of the charter's conflicts-of-interest rules \"shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\" Hence, plaintiff asserts that any failure to respond to the COIB petition \"would result in Chief Dowd being found guilty of a misdemeanor.\" (FAC \u00b6 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After Dowd hired counsel and presented evidence refuting the allegations against him, the administrative hearing judge recommended to the COIB that it dismiss the charges for lack of probable cause. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 26-28.) The COIB agreed and Dowd was \"acquitted\" after the hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 29.) However, the original departmental charges remain in plaintiff's permanent NYPD file-which \"still reflect[s] that there are charges pending against him\"-and Dowd alleges that as a result of his retirement he is \"forbidden\" from securing the removal of those charges from the file. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 4, 44, 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Due to this stain on his reputation, Dowd alleges, he has not subsequently obtained full-time employment, despite efforts to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47, 53.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Though Dowd claims that \"Defendants had no other motive but to humiliate and embarrass\" him, (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46), he hints darkly at an ulterior purpose with the allegation that \"[a]t all relevant times, the Conspirators were aware that the Police Commissioner, who had been a shareholder and director of a company affected by Chief Dowd's decisions over the years, had no affection for him.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15;\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 9, 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Original Complaint and First Motion to Dismiss\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Dowd filed the original complaint in this action on November 15, 2017. That pleading asserted three claims against defendants pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   for (1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   malicious prosecution, (2) conspiracy to deprive plaintiff of his constitutional rights, and (3) \"injunctive relief.\" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 29-44.) Dowd asked the Court to order the NYPD to remove the charges from his personnel file and to award compensatory damages for his economic losses and reputational harms, along with punitive damages, fees, and costs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In January of this year, defendants moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim. Defendants argued that Dowd had failed to allege a deprivation of liberty implicating his Fourth Amendment rights, as required to state a claim for malicious prosecution, and that the conspiracy claim accordingly deserved dismissal due to the lack of any constitutional violation (or, alternatively, due to the intracorporate conspiracy doctrine's bar on conspiracy claims against officers in the same organization). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

The amended pleading added three new causes of action: malicious abuse of process, denial of due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment, and denial of due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. (FAC \u00b6\u00b6 43-62.) As renumbered in the amended complaint, Dowd asserts the following six claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   \u2022 Count I: malicious prosecution\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   \u2022 Count II: malicious abuse of process\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 Count III: Fifth Amendment due process violation\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 Count IV: Fourteenth Amendment due process violation\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \u2022 Count V: conspiracy to violate plaintiff's constitutional rights\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \u2022 Count VI: injunctive relief\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint pursuant to Fed.
