The Court has reviewed the motions, the filings in support and opposition, the record, and is otherwise fully advised. For the reasons stated below, the Motion to Confirm, ECF No. [20] is granted and the Motion to Vacate, ECF No. [17], and Supplemental Motion to Vacate, ECF No. [29] (together, the \"Motions to Vacate\"), are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff FSC initially filed its Complaint on December 23, 2015 against Defendants PCI Consultants, Inc. (\"PCI\"), and PCI's principal, Angelo Paparella (\"Paparella\"). ECF No. [1]. FSC amended its complaint on January 13, 2016, ECF No. [8] (\"Amended Complaint\"). In the Amended Complaint, FSC alleged causes of action for breach of contract, fraud in the inducement, conversion, and unjust enrichment against PCI, and fraud in the inducement and conversion against Paparella.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-9. Simultaneous to filing its Complaint, FSC filed a Motion to Compel Arbitration, ECF No. [4], arguing that the claims asserted relate to contracts under which Defendants agreed to arbitrate. Defendants opposed the motion. ECF No. [7]. The Court granted the motion to compel on January 22, 2016 and administratively closed the case. ECF No. [11].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 13, 2017, Defendants filed their Motion to Reopen Case, ECF No. [13], advising the Court that the parties had participated in an arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") in April 2017. Defendants further advised the Court that the \"sole arbitrator issued a non-final award on July 20, 2017 and on October 10, 2017, the arbitrator, retired Broward Circuit Court Judge Jeffrey Streitfeld (\"Arbitrator\"), issued a 'Final Award' adopting the non-final award.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. In the Motion to Reopen, Defendants stated that they planned to move to vacate the award. The Court granted the Motion to Reopen. ECF No. [16].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Now before the Court are the Motions to Vacate, ECF Nos.

First, Defendants argue that the award must be vacated because Solar employed \"fraud and/or undue means\" to procure an arbitration award in its favor. ECF No. [17] at 12. Second, Defendants argue that the Arbitrator, lacked jurisdiction to enter an award exceeding one million dollars.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. Third, Defendants argue that the Arbitrator had \"irrefutable bias\" against Defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. Fourth, Defendants claim that the Arbitrator failed to hear evidence related to Solar's \"surprise damages claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22. Lastly, Defendants argues that the AAA Rules barred entry of the October 10, 2017 final award (\"October Final Award\") in favor of Solar because the July 20, 2017 award (\"July Award\") was a \"final award\" that terminated the Arbitrator's jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On November 21, 2017, Defendants filed a Supplemental Memorandum in Support of the Motion to Vacate, ECF No. [29]. There, Defendants further argue that the July Award was a \"final award\" precluding entry of the October Final Award because (1) according to an email from the AAA to the parties, after the July Award was issued, AAA administratively closed the case, ECF No. [29-1], and (2) the file name of the uploaded PDF of the July Award on the AAA's Webfile System read \"Final Award.\" ECF No. [29-5] at 3. Defendants additionally argue that Solar conceded that the July Award was a final award because after the Arbitrator issued the October Final Award, Plaintiff moved to reopen the case to correct a typographical error in the October Final Award. ECF No. [29] at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In response, Solar argues that the Arbitrator's award is supported by the record evidence and that Defendants have failed to meet their burden on their claim of fraud or undue means under\n   <em>\n    Bonar v. Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10553011\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/835/1378/\">\n    835 F.2d 1378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 1988) and on their claim of arbitrator bias under\n   <em>\n    Gianelli Money Purchase Plan &amp; Tr. v. ADM Inv'r Servs., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11824464\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/146/1309/\">\n    146 F.3d 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 1998).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [22]. Solar further argues that the Arbitrator had jurisdiction to issue an award above one million dollars and enter the October Final Award.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11824464\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/146/1309/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On November 1, 2017, Solar moved to confirm the arbitration award. ECF No. [20] (\"Motion to Confirm\"). In the Motion, Solar argues that the Court should confirm the July Award, as amended by the October Final Award and November 1, 2017 Corrected Final Award (\"Award\"), based on the presumption of validity under the FAA, which Defendants have failed to refute. Defendants oppose the Motion to Confirm, reiterating their arguments in the Motions to Vacate and also arguing that the Motion to Confirm is mooted by Defendants' Motions to Vacate, that the Court should apply the \" 'no-blue-penciling rule...[applied by n]umerous states (although, admittedly, not Florida) [to] make overly-broad noncompete agreement unenforceable\n   <em>\n    in toto\n   </em>\n   \" to the Award, and that Plaintiff's Motion to Confirm is procedurally improper because it is missing required documents under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . ECF No. [25].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    II. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This case stems from a failed initiative to qualify a solar energy constitutional amendment for the 2016 election in Florida. ECF No. [22-12]. Based on the Court's grant of the motion to compel arbitration, ECF No. [11], FSC filed a Demand for Arbitration with the AAA against Defendants PCI and Paparella seeking damages of $500,000-$1,000,000, plus punitive damages, attorneys' fees, interest, and arbitration costs. ECF No. [20] at 3. Defendants subsequently filed a separate Statement of Claim with AAA seeking $212,479.67, plus punitive damages, attorneys' fees, interest, and arbitration costs against FSC, as well as two of FSC's officers, Stephen Smith (\"Smith\") and George Cavaros, and Southern Alliance for Clean Energy Action Fund, Inc. (\"SACEAF\"). ECF No. [20] at 3. The two matters were consolidated, and during the pendency of the arbitration, Defendants added SACE as a respondent.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   SACE counterclaimed against PCI and Paparella.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Arbitrator held a three-day hearing on April 25, 26, and 28, 2017 during which the parties presented witness testimony and numerous exhibits. On July 20, 2017, the Arbitrator issued the July Award in favor of Solar. ECF Nos. [17-4], [20-1] (\"July Award\"). The following facts were found by the Arbitrator or elicited through uncontroverted testimony, unless otherwise noted:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   FSC is a not-for-profit corporation formed for the purpose of qualifying a solar energy amendment in Florida's general election in 2016. ECF No. [17-4] at 2. PCI is a \"national leader in obtaining signed petitions for ballot initiatives.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In order to be included on the ballot, Florida law required FSC to seek prior approval by the Supreme Court of Florida of the amendment's language and nearly 700,000 signed voter petitions. Arbitration Transcript (\"Tr.\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   at 12, 41, 80, 261, 282-83. The parties entered into several contracts through which PCI agreed to obtain a fixed amount of signed petitions for the solar energy initiative based on a price per signature. ECF No. [17-4] at 2. The Arbitrator highlighted three provisions of the contracts that he found of particular importance:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   1. PCI was to be paid per signature, with all signature collection expenses to be the responsibility of PCI;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   2. Amendments to the contracts must be made in writing and signed by the parties;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   3. Until the final invoice was paid in full, the signed petitions remained the property of PCI.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Arbitrator found that the first two contracts between the parties-which included amendments agreed to through an exchange of emails-were fully performed: PCI collected the required number of signatures and FSC paid PCI for those signatures on a per-signature basis. Under the third contract dated June 5, 2015, PCI agreed to collect 5,000 signatures per week at a cost of $2.65 per signature.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 59-60; 250-51; 260-61; 266.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In late summer while the parties were still waiting for approval from the Supreme Court of Florida, a competing constitutional amendment sponsored by the utility companies was introduced. ECF No. [17-4] at 2. In response, the Arbitrator found that the parties amended the June 5, 2015 agreement through a series of email exchanges to increase PCI's signature collection rate to 15,000 signatures per week.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n    at 3-4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 281.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   During the fall, after the Supreme Court approved the amendment language, PCI informed FSC that the price per signature agreed to in the June 5, 2015 contract was increasing from $2.65 to $4.00, and then again to $5.25, and that FSC would be responsible for substantial additional expenses related to the travel, housing, and per diem expenses for independent contractors hired to collect signed petitioners (\"Petitioner Expenses\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Defendants memorialized this demand for a price increase in a spreadsheet (\"October Spreadsheet\"). Tr. 86-90; 96-97; 270-71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   For approximately one month, between October 22, 2015 and November 18, 2015, PCI submitted invoices-which FSC paid without objection-that included both the per signature charge of $5.25, plus the additional Petitioner Expenses contained in the October Spreadsheet.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n    at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . During this time, Plaintiff also engaged SACE to help educate voters regarding the competing solar energy petitions and defray some of the rising costs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 295, 306. According to the testimony during the hearing, the parties agreed that FSC and SACE would split the $5.25 price per petition, with FSC paying $2.25 for the signatures and SACE paying $3.00 for voter education. Tr. at 160-62; 176-77. In furtherance of that agreement, on October 27, 2015 SACE signed a separate contract with PCI under which PCI agreed to \"use its network of independent contractors to educate Florida citizens about the benefits of solar electric power\" and SACE would pay $3.00 for each \"educational impression.\" ECF No. [22-7] Tr. at 162-166.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   On November 18, 2015, Defendants sent a new expense spreadsheet to Solar, once again increasing the required Petitioner Expenses (\"November Spreadsheet\"). ECF No. [17-4] at 3. In the email containing the spreadsheet, Paparella told FSC's principal, Steven Smith, \"don't have a heart attack.\" Tr. at 132, 298. The following day, Solar informed Defendants that it could not fund the initiative at the levels proposed in the November Spreadsheet and terminated the ballot initiative. ECF No. [17-4] at 3. At the time of termination, Solar had paid all costs and Petitioner Expenses as reflected in the October Spreadsheet, including $5.25 per petition for 217,000 petitions in PCI's custody, plus $130,000 in Petitioner Expenses for those petitions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Solar had not paid any additional Petitioner Expenses as reflected in the November Spreadsheet.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After termination, PCI demanded that Solar pay $212,479 in Petitioner Expenses per the November Spreadsheet in order to receive\n   the 217,000 signed petitions it had already paid for.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n    at 4-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to the Arbitrator's findings, after Solar refused, the dispute took on \"a nasty tone,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2013\">\n    at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , leading to this litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Meanwhile, throughout 2015, Defendants had another client that was simultaneously seeking to qualify a constitutional amendment in Florida for medical marijuana. Paparella testified that he had worked on several medical marijuana initiatives in the past, had a personal relationship with the individuals running the medical marijuana campaign in Florida, and considered medical marijuana an issue that he \"was passionate about.\" Tr. at 217-19. PCI charged the medical marijuana campaign a fixed per-petition price of $2.25.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 190, 286. Because both the medical marijuana campaign and the solar campaign needed petitioners on the ground to gather signatures, and petitioners typically carry more than one petition, there were at least some discussions between the principals of Solar, PCI, and the medical marijuana campaign regarding sharing the Petitioner Expenses. The parties and non-party witnesses presented conflicting testimony regarding the content, timing, and agreements reached during these discussions. Tr. at 87-89, 96-97, 103-05, 124, 270-71, 545. Paparella testified that Solar understood that the expenses in the October 2015 spreadsheet only reflected half the Petition Expenses Solar would be required to pay. He further testified that Solar orally agreed to pay all the expenses incurred by both campaigns-that is, double the expenses listed in the October 2015 spreadsheet-with the understanding that the medical marijuana campaign would pay what it could towards the Petitioner Expenses on an\n   <em>\n    ad hoc\n   </em>\n   basis. Paparella testified that Smith understood that Solar would \"subsidize\" the medical marijuana campaign. ECF No. [17-4] at 5;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 124.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Smith testified that he never understood the October 2015 spreadsheet to represent half of the Petitioner Expenses and never agreed to pay the medical marijuana campaign's expenses or subsidize that campaign. Tr. at 270-71. Smith further testified that when the expenses dispute arose, he tried to resolve the issue with Paparella amicably. For example, he stated in an email: \"Please help me understand why we should be responsible for 374,479 in expenses.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tr. at 407.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Arbitrator found Paparella's testimony not credible. Accordingly, the Arbitrator concluded that there was no oral agreement for Solar to cover either medical marijuana's expenses or expenses that were double those listed in the October spreadsheet. ECF No. [17-4] at 5.

ECF No. [17] at 18 (\"PCI was not afforded its right to a three-person tribunal\"), 19 (noting PCI was \"deprived PCI of its right to demand a three-person panel\"). In making this argument, Defendants selectively quote the AAA Rules in attempt to lead this Court to believe that any claim above one million dollars must be heard by three arbitrators.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19 (representing that: \"The AAA Rules require a three-person arbitration panel in disputes where a party's claims exceed $1 million\" and quoting the AAA Rule L-2 (\"[I]f the parties...claim...involves at least $1,000,000, then three arbitrator(s) shall hear and determine the case\" (modifications by Defendants) ). However, AAA Rule L-2 states, in full, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Large, complex commercial cases shall be heard and determined\n   <strong>\n    by either one or three arbitrators, as may be agreed upon by the parties.\n   </strong>\n   With the exception in paragraph (b) below, if the parties are unable to agree upon the number of arbitrators and a claim or counterclaim involves at least $1,000,000, then three arbitrator(s) shall hear and determine the case.

The plain language of the AAA Rules\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   contains no requirement for three arbitrators to hear a matter where the amount in controversy exceeds one million dollars. Rather,\n   <em>\n    should the parties not agree on the number of arbitrators\n   </em>\n   , three arbitrators will be appointed for claims above one million dollars.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Counsel for Defendants readily concedes that the parties agreed to have this matter heard by one arbitrator; in fact, counsel notes\n   that he recommended as much to his client.

Accordingly, the portion of Rule L-2 cited by Defendants governing situations where the number of arbitrators is contested is inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   While Defendants argue that they would never have agreed to a single arbitrator if they had known that the amount in controversy could have exceeded one million dollars, this argument is likewise without merit. Solar's original demand for arbitration stated that its claim was for $500,000-$1,000,000, plus punitive damages. ECF No. [22-1] at 3; [23-2] at 2. Based on the damages specified in the demand, Defendants were on notice that, should Solar prevail, the award could exceed one million dollars. Accordingly, while Paparella and Defendants' counsel represented that they did not understand their exposure could exceed one million dollars at the time of arbitrator selection, the Court finds this assertion to be inconsistent with the record. ECF Nos. [17-1] \u00b6 11; [17-2] \u00b6 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Defendants also move to vacate the award of attorneys' fees under the theory that the Arbitrator exceeded his authority because he lacked jurisdiction. Defendants argue that the July Award, which included an unspecified amount of attorneys' fees, was a \"final award\" depriving the Arbitrator of jurisdiction to issue the October Award. ECF No. [17] at 24.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Defendants' Supplemental Motion to Vacate, they further argue that because the AAA administratively closed the matter after the Arbitrator issued the July Award, the \"AAA's November 1st email impeaches the Arbitrator's October 10th ruling and supports the conclusion that the Arbitrator may have misstated certain facts in order to achieve his desired outcome.\" ECF No. [29] at 5. This argument is equally specious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   In the July Award, the Arbitrator granted Solar attorneys' fees in an amount to be subsequently briefed per the parties' pre-hearing stipulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. [20-1]. Defendants appear to argue that under the parties' stipulation, the parties were required to move for prevailing parties attorneys' fees after the hearing but before the Arbitrator determined the prevailing party. However, the Arbitrator determined that Solar's motion for attorneys' fees was timely filed pursuant to the parties' stipulation, and the Court will not disturb that ruling.\n   <em>\n    Wiand v.
