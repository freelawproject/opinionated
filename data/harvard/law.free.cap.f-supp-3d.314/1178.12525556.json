But the Court has no such power. All the Court can do is answer the legal question central to this matter: is the United States Army Corps of Engineers (Corps)'s decision not to consult with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service regarding its Middle Rio Grande operations arbitrary or capricious? Plaintiff WildEarth Guardians (Guardians) thinks so, but, surprisingly, Guardians initially ignored a lengthy and detailed document Corps produced to explain its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Because one cannot simply ignore an agency's explanation when challenging the agency's decision, the Court\n   <strong>\n    denies\n   </strong>\n   most of Guardians's motion.

Corps's consultation with FWS.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In the early 2000s, Corps and Reclamation together voluntarily initiated \u00a7 7(a)(2) consultation with FWS regarding the effects of their Middle Rio Grande operations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 n.1.) That consultation yielded FWS's 2003 Biological Opinion, which expired in 2013.

As the 2003 Biological Opinion neared expiration, Corps sought to consult with FWS again. This time, however, Corps wanted to consult independently instead of combining the Middle Rio Grande actions of both Corps and Reclamation-that is, Corps wanted FWS to isolate and identify actions specific to Corps for which Corps is responsible. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   According to Corps, FWS initially agreed to consult solely on Corps-specific actions, and Corps and FWS consulted under that agreement.

(2014 Reassessment at 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   A.R. 000127.) In its letter to FWS withdrawing from consultation, Corps explained that it had received guidance from headquarters directing it to carefully review its legal requirements under \u00a7 7. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R. 000128.) As a result, Corps planned to reassess its actions and legal obligations in the Middle Rio Grande. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R. 000127.) Corps reserved the right to reinitiate consultation unless it found that its actions were wholly non-discretionary or part of the environmental baseline.

(2014 Reassessment at 11.) Corps believed the maximum safe channel capacity was the maximum safe flow at Albuquerque, meaning the \"maximum rate of flow that can be carried at the time in the channel of [the] Rio Grande through the middle valley without causing flooding of areas protected by levees or unreasonable damage to channel protective works ....\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12 (citing 1960 FCA \u00a7\u00a7 203(a) and (c) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Corps initially specified a maximum safe flow of up to 5,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) at Albuquerque. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12.) After experimentally increasing the flow and informally consulting with FWS, Corps increased the maximum channel capacity from 5,000 cfs to 7,000 cfs, which has remained the maximum safe channel capacity since 1996.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) As such, Corps determined that it has no discretion to deviate for environmental purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Flood Control Operation.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Another action Corps takes on the Rio Grande is flood control. This function was mandated by \u00a7 203 of the 1960 FCA, which states that \"Cochiti Reservoir, Galisteo Reservoir, and all other reservoirs constructed by the Corps of Engineers as a part of the Middle Rio Grande project will be operated solely for flood and sediment control ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14 (citing 1960 FCA \u00a7 203).) As mentioned, the 1960 FCA also provides that \"the outflow from Cochiti Reservoir during each spring flood and thereafter will be at the maximum rate of flow that can be carried ... without causing flooding of areas protected by levees or unreasonable damage to channel protective works.\" 1960 FCA \u00a7 203(a). Section 203(b) goes on to say that Galisteo and Jemez Canyon Reservoirs are to release water \"at the maximum rate practicable\" during summer floods \"or thereafter.\" 1960 FCA \u00a7 203(b). Additionally, releases from July through October should also be \"limited to the amounts necessary to provide adequate capacity for control of subsequent summer floods.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Corps interpreted the above provisions of the 1960 FCA-including the \"or thereafter\" language-to mean that the stringent flood control provisions outlined in \u00a7 203 apply year-round. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2014 Reassessment at 13-15.) This meant that Corps should always operate the dams for flood control and release water at the maximum safe and practicable rate that complies with all Congressional commands. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) Consistent with this interpretation, Corps repudiated its old practice of distinguishing between periods of summer storm floods and spring runoff for purposes of consulting with FWS, since, according to Corps, \"Congress has mandated the same requirements for flood operation throughout the year.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) Similarly, Corps turned away from its old practice of deviating from standard operations to prevent damage to\n   <em>\n    non-protected\n   </em>\n   works-specifically, to protect a historic railroad bridge crossing and the adjacent spoil bank levee. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.) According to Corps, Congress only allowed it to moderate water release to guard\n   <em>\n    protected\n   </em>\n   levees and channel protective works. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.) In conclusion, Corps determined that its Middle Rio Grande operations must be run only for flood and sediment control and are so strictly regulated that Corps does not have sufficient discretion to require consultation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Release of Carryover Storage.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   After studying \u00a7\u00a7 203(a) and (c) of the 1960 FCA, Corps determined that the questions of how it must retain water, when it must retain water, and how it can release retained water are all strictly regulated by the 1960 FCA. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   According to Corps, \u00a7 203(a) prevents Corps from releasing water from Cochiti during the months from July to October when there is more than 212,000 acre-feet (ac-ft) of storage space and the inflow of water is less than 1,500 cfs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16 (citing 1960 FCA \u00a7 203(a) ).) Corps says this provision is \"to prevent the diversion or depletion of water ... that would otherwise have been delivered downstream to the State of Texas, but was detained by flood-control operation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17.) Corps adds that this retention requirement typically applies when spring runoff water is still detained in Cochiti Lake into July and the flow at Otowi gage is less than 1,500 cfs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Corps claims that a similar retention provision in \u00a7 203(b) governs carryover storage in Galisteo and Jemez Canyon Reservoirs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) Section 203(b) limits the release from Galisteo and Jemez Canyon Reservoirs from July through October\n   to the amount necessary to leave sufficient space for subsequent summer floods.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1960 FCA \u00a7 203(b). Galisteo Reservoir, Corps adds, has an unregulated outlet structure, which is physically unable to retain carryover storage, so the flow and retention provisions in 203(b) apply only to Jemez Canyon Reservoir. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2014 Reassessment at 17 n.41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   After the July through October period, Corps posits that the carryover water should be released from all dams as expeditiously as allowed, pointing to \u00a7 203(c) of the 1960 FCA, which requires that \"all reservoirs will be evacuated completely on or before March 31 of each year ....\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17 (citing 1960 FCA \u00a7 203(c) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, the Rio Grande Compact Commissioner of either New Mexico or Colorado can require Corps to release carryover water at the maximum safe flow. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18 (citing 1960 FCA \u00a7 203(c) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   After considering and interpreting the above provisions, Corps concluded that it has insufficient discretion in its release of carryover storage to require consultation.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19 (citation omitted).) Accordingly, Corps's position is that it does not need to consult with FWS about the\n   <em>\n    fact\n   </em>\n   of maintenance. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, Corps acknowledges that it has discretion over the\n   <em>\n    manner\n   </em>\n   in which it conducts maintenance, and should consult with FWS if its current maintenance practices adversely affect endangered species. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   To maintain Abiquiu Dam, Corps conducts periodic inspections of the outlet tunnel. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During the inspection, Corps must suspend releases from Abiquiu for about an hour while personnel are physically present in the tunnel. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) These inspections usually occur during low flow periods in the winter, to minimize disruption, but could technically occur any time there is a structural or safety concern. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Since inspection of Abiquiu requires a decrease in discharge, the current maintenance practice potentially affects endangered species. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) Though Corps had previously determined that the temporary suspension of discharge does not affect endangered species, the 2014 Reassessment recommended that Corps \"verify or reevaluate the effects\" of the suspension. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) Only if the discharge suspension may affect endangered species or their critical habitats should Corps consult with FWS. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Flow Adjustment to Flush Jemez Canyon Dam Stilling Basin.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   There is a stilling basin downstream from the outlet of Jemez Canyon Dam. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.) Sediment collects in the basin, and Corps must flush the basin to prevent high flows from lapping over the basin's walls. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) To flush the basin, Corps detains inflow for up to four or five days before releasing the detained water at a rate of about 600 cfs to rinse sediment from the basin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This flushing operation is done when required, typically once or twice a year. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   As with the inspection of the Abiquiu Dam tunnel, Corps believes that maintenance of the stilling basin is a nondiscretionary responsibility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) But the manner of flushing the basin, which decreases and then subsequently increases discharge, could affect organisms downstream. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The 2014 Reassessment recommended that Corps verify or reevaluate the effects of the flushing operation, and only consult with FWS if the operation may affect endangered species or their critical habitats. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   6.\n   <em>\n    Flow Reduction to Install and Remove Irrigation Outlet Gates at Cochiti Dam.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   There are two bulkhead outlet gates in the walls of a stilling basin below Cochiti Dam. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The outlet gates prevent any water from entering the canals during the non-irrigation season, and the gates are removed during the irrigation season. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) When the gates are removed, fish sometimes enter the irrigation canal and die in the agricultural ditches and fields. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.) To prevent this, fish screens are installed when the bulkhead gates are removed during the irrigation season, and then the fish screens are swapped out for the gates during the non-irrigation season. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) The fish screens and bulkhead gates are submerged, so hydrostatic pressure prevents the exchange of the screens and gates unless Corps decreases the total release rate from Cochiti Dam from 150 to 100 cfs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In conducting the 2014 Reassessment, Corps unearthed a June 1967 Memorandum of Agreement that \"outlined the rights and responsibilities of the Corps, Reclamation, and [the MRGCD] regarding ... construction of new irrigation outlets in the Cochiti Dam stilling basin.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.) Corps claims that section four of the Memorandum of Agreement \"makes it apparent that Reclamation-not the Corps-is responsible for operation (removal / installation) of the two bulkhead gates to the irrigation canals.\" (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Reevaluating its legal obligations in light of the information above, Corps determined that its only action is the reduction in flow from Cochiti Dam to facilitate Reclamation or MRGCD's installation of fish screens or outlet gates. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22.) Since Corps only performs the flow reduction at Reclamation's request to assist with Reclamation or MRGCD's obligations, Corps maintains that either Reclamation or MRGCD should be responsible for consultation about the flow reduction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   7.\n   <em>\n    Delivery of Water to Offset Evaporation at Cochiti Lake.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Corps explains that the Flood Control Act of 1964 authorized a permanent pool of 1,200 acres (about 50,000 ac-ft) \"for conservation and development of fish and wildlife resources and for recreation ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24 (citing 1964 FCA).) The 1964 FCA authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to use San Juan-Chama Project water to fill the pool.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Corps construes the commands of the 1964 FCA as requiring it to maintain a permanent pool at Cochiti. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.) The manner in which the permanent pool is maintained, however, is subject to consultation if it affects endangered species or their critical habitats. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Since Reclamation is the proponent of sending San Juan-Chama water to Cochiti to replenish the permanent pool and is currently engaged in consultation with FWS, Corps says that it will \"coordinate with Reclamation ... so that they may re-characterize [the filling of Cochiti Lake with San Juan-Chama water] as a Reclamation action ... rather than as an interrelated and interdependent Corps action,\" as they had classified the action in previous years.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Corps, it \"has no independent ownership rights, authority, or discretion regarding release or water delivery,\" and, as such, does not need to consult over the storage or delivery of San Juan-Chama water.

In allowing Rio Grande water to pass unhindered through its dams, Corps does not need to take affirmative action for Jemez Canyon and Galisteo Dams, since those two dams \"lack any permanent water supply or recreation pools,\" and \"[s]treamflow simply passes through the open outlet works up to the discharge that invokes flood control operation.\" (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As for Abiquiu and Cochiti Dams, since they store San Juan-Chama water, the \"outlet gates at these dams must be adjusted, usually daily, to pass Rio Grande system water while still retaining the precise volume of [San Juan-Chama] Project water in storage.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Corps contends that the outlet gate adjustment is simply the necessary product of its concurrent duties to maintain a certain amount of San Juan-Chama water at Abiquiu and Cochiti Dams, and to pass through, unhindered, the maximum allowable amount of Rio Grande water.

Corps believes the remaining two actions, involving maintenance, are also non-discretionary.

As the Reassessment was the reason behind Corps's actions, whether Corps acted arbitrarily, capriciously, in abuse of its discretion, or in violation of the law depends heavily on the validity of the 2014 Reassessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     I. The 2014 Reassessment is not post-hoc rationalization.\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Inexplicably, Guardians did not even mention the 2014 Reassessment in its brief accusing Corps of reaching an arbitrary decision on its discretion in the Middle Rio Grande. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 120.) After Corps highlighted Guardians's omission, Guardians claimed that it did not need to consider the Reassessment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 126 at 6 n.2.) According to Guardians, since Corps broke off consultation with FWS in 2013 and did not issue the Reassessment until 2014, the Reassessment was not the real reason behind the termination of consultation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   But a review of Corps's letter to FWS terminating consultation undermines Guardians's argument. In its letter terminating consultation, Corps said that it was withdrawing from consultation because its headquarters had instructed it to scrutinize its ESA obligations, and because FWS was unwilling to identify Corps-specific actions in the Rio Grande. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R. 000127-28.) The letter explains that Corps was going to reevaluate its actions and legal obligations in the region. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   A.R. 000127.) If Corps found that it had discretion to deviate in its actions, it was willing to reinitiate consultation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Given Corps's letter, the Court concludes that the 2014 Reassessment is the real reason why Corps is not currently consulting with FWS. Corps clearly referenced an upcoming reevaluation of its actions and legal obligations when it terminated consultation, so the Reassessment was unlikely to have been created solely for purposes of litigation. And the Reassessment was also the source of many of Corps's arguments in this litigation, arguments that Guardians has been all-too-happy to dispute. Where did Guardians think those arguments came from? Finally, Corps held open the possibility of reinitiating consultation, so Corps's present, ongoing refusal to consult can fairly be attributed to the 2014 Reassessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     II.

For example, \u00a7 203(b) of the 1960 FCA sets a ceiling and a floor for the amount of water Galisteo and Jemez Canyon Dams can release during certain months:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   Releases of water from Galisteo Reservoir and Jemez Canyon Reservoir during the months of July, August, September, and October, will be limited to the amounts necessary to provide adequate\n   capacity for control of subsequent summer floods; and such releases when made in these months, or thereafter, will be at the maximum rate practicable under the conditions at the time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   1960 FCA \u00a7 203(b). This means that from July through October, Corps cannot release more water than necessary to control summer floods-a ceiling-and Corps cannot release less water than the maximum rate practicable-a floor. Corps basically has no discretion on water release at Galisteo and Jemez Canyon during those months. The ESA cannot implicitly raise the FCA's ceiling by forcing Corps to release more water than the amount necessary to control summer floods, just as the ESA cannot lower the floor by forcing Corps to release less than the maximum amount of water practicable under the conditions at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   As another example, the 1960 FCA mandates that Corps pass Cochiti Reservoir water downstream during each spring flood at the \"maximum rate of flow that can be carried at the time ... without causing flooding of areas protected by levees or unreasonable damage to channel protective works.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1960 FCA \u00a7 203(a). This, too, means Corps has no discretion on how much water to release: it cannot release less water than the maximum rate of flow that can be carried at the time-the floor-and it cannot release so much water that it causes impermissible flooding or damage-the ceiling. The ESA cannot implicitly rewrite this provision by either allowing Corps to release less water than the maximum rate of flow, or allowing Corps to release so much water that prohibited consequences occur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   A few more examples: the 1960 FCA tells Corps that it may run its Middle Rio Grande operations \"\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   for flood control and sediment control.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1960 FCA \u00a7 203 (emphasis added). The ESA cannot implicitly delete the word \"solely\" and rewrite the provision to allow Corps to operate for flood control, sediment control,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   fish and wildlife development. And while the 1960 FCA allows for deviations from the operating schedule, the enumerated permissible deviations-with the consent of the Rio Grande Compact Commission and in case of emergency-have nothing to do with the environment.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573372\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/644/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The ESA cannot implicitly repeal and rewrite the 1960 FCA to add another reason to deviate from the strict operating schedule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   It appears that\n   <em>\n    Home Builders\n   </em>\n   is directly on point, and Guardians does nothing to convince the Court otherwise. Rather than discussing ceilings, floors, or implicit modification of existing law, Guardians only attempts to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Home Builders\n   </em>\n   by offering an unhelpful, circular assertion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   In [\n   <em>\n    Home Builders\n   </em>\n   ], the substantive statute at issue divested the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   discretionary authority. In this case on the other hand, as explained in Guardians' Opening Brief and in this Reply Brief, the Corps does have discretionary authority to modify its MRG Project operations for the benefit of the minnow and flycatcher. Accordingly, those aspects of the [\n   <em>\n    Home Builder\n   </em>\n   ] decision which deal with circumstances where agencies have no statutory discretion whatsoever are not applicable here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   (Doc. 126 at 26.) Essentially, Guardians assures the Court that\n   <em>\n    Home Builders\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable because Corps has discretion, and Corps has discretion because\n   <em>\n    Home Builders\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable. Not compelling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Far from being arbitrary or capricious, the parts of the 2014 Reassessment that analyze the 1960 FCA are substantively persuasive. Though the Court found at the motion-to-dismiss stage that Corps \"retains some flexibility in its reservoir operations in the Middle Rio Grande,\" (Doc. 69\n   at 12), this conclusion was made while giving Guardians the benefit of the doubt at a macro-level, without diving into the specifics of the statutes or Corps's interpretations. Upon closer review, the Court finds that insisting on \u00a7 7(a)(2) consultation for Corps's flood control, carryover storage release, pass-through operations (including necessary adjustments to Abiquiu and Cochiti outlet gates), emergency operations, or determination of channel capacity would allow \u00a7 7(a)(2) to implicitly repeal and rewrite the 1960 FCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Creation and maintenance of pools at Abiquiu and Cochiti (Reassessment action numbers 7 and 8).\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Regarding Abiquiu, Congress allowed Corps to contract with parties who have San Juan-Chama water rights-pursuant to the San Juan-Chama Act-for storage of up to 200,000 ac-ft of that water in Abiquiu Reservoir.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P.L. 97-140. Reclamation releases the San Juan-Chama water to Corps for storage.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573372\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/644/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Parties with rights to San Juan-Chama water who contract with the Corps for storage may demand that Corps release their water to them at any time. (2014 Reassessment at 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Given the above, Corps believes it has insufficient discretion in the storage and release of San Juan-Chama water at Abiquiu Dam to require \u00a7 7(a)(2) consultation, and the Court agrees. Corps is merely holding water for people with rights to that water, and Corps must release that water on demand pursuant to its contracts. To say that Corps has discretion to store or release San Juan-Chama water at Abiquiu for environmental purposes would be to implicitly modify and repeal the San Juan-Chama Act or P.L. 97-140, in contravention of\n   <em>\n    Home Builders\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Regarding Cochiti Dam, the 1960 and 1964 FCAs authorized a permanent pool of 1,200 acres for \"conservation and development of fish and wildlife resources and for recreation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1960 FCA \u00a7 203(e); 1964 FCA. The 1964 FCA authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to use San Juan-Chama water to fill the pool, with the addition of \"sufficient water annually to offset the evaporation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1964 FCA. Guardians has not claimed that the pool is discretionary, and, given the 1960 and 1964 FCAs, the Court believes Corps is right in saying that the only action subject to consultation is the delivery of San Juan-Chama water to replenish Cochiti after evaporation-an action for which Reclamation is already consulting with FWS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     IV. The remainder of the 2014 Reassessment.\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Sediment Retention (Reassessment action number 13).\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Corps identified sediment retention as an incidental effect of its dam operations and its maintenance of the permanent pools at Abiquiu and Cochiti. (2014 Reassessment at 31.) Guardians does not challenge this factual assertion. Since, as explained above, Corps's dam operations are not discretionary, nor are its duties to maintain pools at Abiquiu and Cochiti, Corps is not arbitrary or capricious in deciding that it does not need to consult about incidental effects of those non-discretionary actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Inter-agency coordination (Reassessment action number 11).\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Corps notes that the water management agencies in the Rio Grande communicate and coordinate with each other. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29.) This communication, Corps points out, is just a necessary result of having multiple agencies regulate water in the same geographic area. To require consultation over communication, Corps adds, would cause even the \"mere scheduling of a meeting among agencies [to] require consultation.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573372\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/644/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Corps is reasonable,\n   not arbitrary or capricious, in believing that the referenced coordination and communication does not trigger consultation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Non-Corps actions.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Hydroelectric power (Reassessment action number 10).\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Corps says that the County of Los Alamos constructed, operates, and maintains a run-of-the-river hydroelectric power facility. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28.) Corps claims that it does not release any water specifically for the benefit of the power plant, and that the facility does not impact reservoir storage or releases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Accepting Corps's unchallenged factual assertions, the Court finds that Corps is not arbitrary or capricious in believing that there is no Corps action to require consultation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Flow reduction to install and remove irrigation outlet gates at Cochiti Dam (Reassessment action number 6).\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Corps says that it had decreased the release at Cochiti Dam to assist the installation and removal of fish screens and bulkhead gates at a stilling basin below Cochiti. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.) However, during its reassessment, Corps discovered a June 1967 Memorandum of Agreement between Reclamation, the MRGCD, and Corps that identifies Reclamation or the MRGCD as the party responsible for maintenance and operation of the outlet gates. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573372\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/644/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing A.R. 000101).) As such, Corps concluded that either Reclamation or the MRGCD is responsible for consultation over any necessary flow reduction. After reviewing the referenced memorandum, the Court finds that Corps reasonably believes there is no Corps action here to necessitate \u00a7 7(a)(2) consultation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Maintenance (Reassessment action numbers 4 and 5).\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Citing an internal memorandum, Corps explains its view that it has an inherent, non-discretionary responsibility to maintain civil works structures authorized by Congress. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.) Part of its maintenance operations includes inspecting Abiquiu Dam tunnel and clearing accumulated sediment in the Jemez Canyon Dam stilling basin. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20.) Corps believes that since there is no discretion in whether to maintain these structures, there is no need to consult over their maintenance. Guardians has not challenged the internal memorandum, and the Court finds Corps's reasoning to be reasonable-if Congress authorizes an agency to operate a structure, then absent any other guidance, a reasonable presumption is that the agency should maintain the structure as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Though maintenance may not be discretionary, there is discretion in how to conduct maintenance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.) If the\n   <em>\n    manner\n   </em>\n   in which maintenance is conducted may affect endangered species or their critical habitats, consultation over the manner of maintenance is necessary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The 2014 Reassessment recommended that Corps verify or reevaluate the effects of its maintenance operations to ensure that there is no effect on endangered species or their critical habitats. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   It is unclear whether Corps is consulting over its maintenance operations, and, if not, whether Corps has verified the effects of such operations, as the 2014 Reassessment suggested. Thus, on maintenance operations, the Court will withhold judgment and remand to Corps for explanation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Home Builders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573372\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/644/\">\n    551 U.S. at 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573372\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/644/\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2518\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that the proper course of action upon a finding of arbitrariness or capriciousness is to remand to the agency for explanation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     V.

So only affirmative actions, not actions that an agency declines to take, trigger \u00a7 7(a)(2) duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The 2014 Reassessment revealed, and the Court noted at the motion-to-dismiss stage, that Corps's Middle Rio Grande operations include many affirmative actions. (Doc. 69 at 10-11.) Guardians is free to argue that Corps has discretion over those actions. Guardians may not, however, lump all of Corps's actions together as \"operation of [the Middle Rio Grande] Project\" and then claim that because Corps has the ability to take unspecified actions, Corps must consult. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 126 at 20.) Apart from a vagueness problem, Guardians's approach also conflates action and discretion. One corollary of the Tenth Circuit's\n   <em>\n    Guardians\n   </em>\n   decision is that action comes before discretion: The analysis begins with an examination of whether there is an affirmative action. If so, then the parties analyze whether an agency has discretion over that action. If an agency has discretion to take an action but refrains from doing so, that does not count as both action and discretion under \u00a7 7(a)(2). Otherwise, the\n   <em>\n    Guardians\n   </em>\n   Court would have made the EPA consult.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Corps is thus correct on its decision not to consult about the storage of Rio Grande water in Abiquiu (Reassessment action number 9). As explained above, Corps may store up to 200,000 ac-ft of Rio Grande water at Abiquiu, to the extent that contracting parties no longer require Corps to store San Juan-Chama water there.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   P.L. 100-522. Since Corps currently only stores about 180,000 ac-ft of San Juan-Chama water at Abiquiu, Corps could still store about 20,000 ac-ft of Rio Grande water. But Corps has no plans to store Rio Grande water in Abiquiu, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2014 Reassessment at 28), and under\n   <em>\n    Guardians\n   </em>\n   , Corps cannot be forced to consult on its discretionary decision not to take an action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     VI. Guardians is not persuasive in arguing that Corps's decision on discretion is otherwise arbitrary or capricious.\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Guardians advances six arguments to support its contention that Corps's decision on its discretion in the Middle Rio Grande is arbitrary or capricious. None of them are persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   <strong>\n    (1) The plain language of the 1948 and 1960 FCAs do not \"make clear\" that Congress authorized Corps to conduct Middle Rio Grande operations for the benefit of the minnow and flycatcher.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Guardians contends that the \"plain language\" of the 1948 and 1960 FCAs \"makes clear\" that Congress authorized Corps to conduct operations for the benefit of the minnow and flycatcher. (Doc. 120 at 48.) This contention is based on\n   three premises: (1) Corps originally wrote in a report to Congress that authorized purposes of the Middle Rio Grande Project should include \"fish and wildlife development,\" (2) Congress relied on Corps's report in authorizing the Middle Rio Grande Project in the 1948 and 1960 FCAs, and (3) in the FCAs, Congress said that Corps could deviate from the operating schedule with the consent of the Rio Grande Compact Commission. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Unfortunately for Guardians-and despite its reference to the \"plain language\" of statutory text-the meat of its argument has little to do with the language of the 1948 and 1960 FCAs. The 1948 FCA says that except with the consent of the Rio Grande Compact Commission, \"\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   reservoirs constructed as a part of the project\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   be operated\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   for flood control ....\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1948 FCA (emphasis added). Though Congress passed the 1948 FCA to approve Corps's report, the approval was limited to the extent the 1948 FCA comported with the report. Any part of Corps's report that was inconsistent with the FCA was not approved.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Over a decade later, Congress in the 1960 FCA added sediment control-not fish and wildlife development-to the authorized purposes, saying the Middle Rio Grande facilities \"will be operated\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   for flood control and sediment control ....\" 1960 FCA \u00a7 203 (emphasis added). And to leave no doubt that it had considered the issue, Congress in the 1960 FCA also expressly addresses fish and wildlife development, saying that Corps may create permanent pools with non-native water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   To the extent Guardians believes that Corps has discretion in its operations because it may deviate from the operating schedule with the permission of the Rio Grande Compact Commission, that belief is misguided. Taking Guardians's argument to its logical conclusion would mean that every agency has \"discretion\" to take any constitutional action. After all, any agency could take any constitutional action if it just secured permission from Congress. The EPA in\n   <em>\n    Home Builders\n   </em>\n   could have, with Congressional approval, added a tenth criterion before transferring permitting power to Arizona. Should it have undertaken \u00a7 7(a)(2) consultation? This is not a case where a federal agency was granted unilateral discretion by statute, but chose to contract away that discretion to skirt \u00a7 7(a)(2) duties. Here, it was Congress that took away Corps's discretion by requiring Corps to seek permission before making any deviation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Simply put, the words of the 1948 and 1960 FCAs do not convince the Court that Corps's decision on its discretion is arbitrary or capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    (2) The Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958 and the 1986, 1990, and 1996 Water Resources Development Acts do not show that Corps's decision about its discretion over its operations is arbitrary or capricious.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Guardians posits that the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act of 1958 (FWCA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20662\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the 1986, 1990, and 1996 Water Resources Development Acts (WRDAs),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202294\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2316, and 2330(a), authorize Corps to deviate for the benefit of the minnow and flycatcher.

In light of these facts, language in the regulation that suggests fish and wildlife conservation is an authorized purpose is no more than an acknowledgment of the fact that at some-but not all-facilities, fish and wildlife conservation is an authorized purpose.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 124 at 34-35.) The Congressional authority has since expired. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35.) And the Court has explained that \"discretion\" that comes only with the consent of another body is not the requisite discretion that mandates \u00a7 7(a)(2) consultation when Congress imposes the consent requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   <strong>\n    (6) The minnow riders and subsequent Congressional enactments do not constitute endorsement of the idea that Corps has discretion over its Middle Rio Grande operations.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Congress enacted a series of laws regulating water in the Middle Rio Grande, including the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 2004, Pub. L. No. 108-137, \u00a7 208,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=117%20Stat.%201827\">\n    117 Stat. 1827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1849-50 (2003) (the \"2003 minnow rider\"), the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2005, Pub. L. No. 108-447, \u00a7 205,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=118%20Stat.%202809\">\n    118 Stat. 2809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2949 (2004) (the \"2004 minnow rider\"), and the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-103, \u00a7 121(b),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=119%20Stat.%202247\">\n    119 Stat. 2247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2256 (2005) (the \"2005 minnow rider\"). Guardians argues that these minnow riders constitute Congressional endorsement of the idea that Corps has discretion over its Middle Rio Grande operations. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 120 at 38-41.) But the text of the minnow riders belies Guardians's claim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-184\">\n   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Commissioner of the Bureau of Reclamation ... may not use discretion,\n   <em>\n    if any\n   </em>\n   , to restrict, reduce, or reallocate any water stored in Heron Reservoir or delivered pursuant to San Juan-Chama Project contracts, including execution of said contracts facilitated by the Middle Rio Grande Project, to meet the requirements of the Endangered Species Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   2003 minnow rider (emphasis added). The above quoted 2003 minnow rider was the result of joint consultation with FWS by Reclamation and Corps. The \"may not use discretion,\n   <em>\n    if any\n   </em>\n   \" language demonstrates that Congress does not endorse the idea that Reclamation (or Corps) has discretion to deviate from statutorily-mandated operations.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=119%20Stat.%202247\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The \"if any\" language remains in the subsequent minnow riders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2004 and 2005 minnow riders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Guardians next points to language in the 2005 minnow rider that provides \"[t]he Secretary of the Army may carry out and fund projects to comply with the 2003 Biological Opinion ....\" (Doc. 120 at 40.) Guardians also throws in the Water Resources Development Act of 2007, which commands, \"The Secretary shall select and shall carry out restoration projects in the Middle Rio Grande from Cochiti Dam to the headwaters of the Elephant Butte Reservoir in the State of New Mexico.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Pub. L. No. 110-114, \u00a7 3118(b),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=121%20Stat.%201041\">\n    121 Stat. 1041\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1137 (2007) (the \"2007 WRDA\") ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Neither provision Guardians highlights is persuasive. The 2003 Biological Opinion has expired, and the 2007 WRDA also carries the same caveat as the FWDA and other WRDAs. In particular, the 2007 WRDA clarifies that a \"restoration project\" is one that is \"consistent with other Federal programs, projects, and activities.\" 2007 WRDA \u00a7 3118(a). As explained, Corps reasonably believes that adding additional projects would be inconsistent with its Middle Rio Grande operations because such projects would clash with authorizing Flood Control Acts and disrupt the delicate balance of water rights in the region.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   For the reasons given, the Court withholds final judgment on the maintenance in the Abiquiu Dam tunnel and the Jemez Canyon Dam stilling basin and\n   <strong>\n    remands\n   </strong>\n   to Corps for clarification on those activities.
