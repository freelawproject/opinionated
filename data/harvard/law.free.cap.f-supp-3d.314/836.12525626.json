There is a pending motion for class certification. But, the injuries alleged by Plaintiffs arise from orders issued by state courts. And, this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider claims that are functionally appeals of state court decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The plaintiffs in this lawsuit were defendants in debt-collection lawsuits filed in state courts. In each state-court case, a\n   judgment entered, which granted the state-court plaintiff prejudgment interest at a rate of 13%. Subsequently, the defendants in this lawsuit submitted, to state court clerks, requests for writs of garnishment that included post-judgment interest. In the requests for writs of garnishment, the defendants signed an affidavit attesting to the amount of judgment interest accrued to date. The plaintiffs, the defendants in the underlying state-court actions, assert that interest requested in the request for writs of garnishment was calculated at a rate not authorized by law. The plaintiffs contend that by making false, inaccurate, or misleading representations in the requests for writs of garnishment, the defendants violated the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act. Assuming the plaintiffs' accusations are accurate, the defendants may have collected tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in interest to which they were not entitled. Plaintiffs, however, were injured by underlying judgment or the writ itself, not by the allegedly false statement in the request for the writ. The plaintiffs' remedy was to file an objection or an appeal, not a federal lawsuit. Federal district courts do not have the authority to review allegedly erroneous judgments and orders rendered in the state courts. Therefore, this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction and two motions to dismiss (ECF Nos. 60 and 61) must be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants have filed two motions to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant Mary Jane M.

Generally, when the judgment rendered is not on a written instrument that specifies an interest rate, the interest is calculated in six-month intervals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the complaint, Plaintiffs identify the amount of post-judgment interest requested on each request for a writ of garnishment, which is supported by the documents attached to the complaint. Plaintiffs have not pleaded the precise interest rate used to calculate the requested amount of post-judgment interest. In the summary of the factual bases for their claims, Plaintiffs do allege that the amount of post-judgment interest owed and communicated to them by Defendants \"exceeded the amount permitted by law.\" (\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 48, 75, 100, 133, and 167.) In the portion of the complaint where Plaintiffs outline their claims, Plaintiffs allege that the state-court judgments were not based on written instruments and the post-judgment interest identified on the requests for writs of garnishment was calculated at a rate higher than what the statute authorizes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 174-76.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For the violations of the FDCPA, Plaintiffs seek several remedies. First, Plaintiffs seek a declaration that each defendant violated a provision of the FDCPA. (Compl. \u00b6 213.) Second, Plaintiffs seek actual damages, statutory damages, costs and fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court finds that the\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine applies and this Court lacks jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' FDCPA claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   For its motion, Defendant Mary Jane M. Elliott is correct that the sources of Plaintiffs' injuries are the underlying judgments, not the writs of garnishment. The alleged error in the authorized interest rate is contained in the state-court judgments. Defendants contend, and Plaintiffs do not argue or offer evidence otherwise, that the interest requested in the writs of garnishment was calculated using the interest rate authorized by the underlying judgments, 13%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The legal error occurred in the underlying judgments, not in the request for writs of garnishment. Although the underlying judgments explicitly stated that they were not based on written instruments, the prejudgment interest rate granted in the judgments was entered in the section of the form for judgments based on written instruments. (ECF Nos. 5-2 PageID.62; ECF No. 5-11 PageID.83; ECF No. 5-18 PageID.99; ECF No. 24 PageID.113, and\n   ECF No. 5-24 PageID.135.) The interest rate for judgments on written instruments specifying an interest rate is the same for prejudgment interest and for post-judgment interest. Thus by law, meaning the state-court judgment and not the statute, the pre and post-judgment interest was set at 13%. Plaintiffs' injuries from the incorrect interest rate were produced by the state-court judgments.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Todd v. United States Bank Nat'l Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=685%20Fed.%20Appx.%20103\">\n    685 Fed.Appx. 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 106 (3d Cir. 2017) (\"The Plaintiffs argue that their injuries are the result of post-judgment activities-namely, the inclusion of attorney's fees and the anticipated interest in the reissued writs of execution. But, the default judgments provided for attorney's fees and interest through the date of the sheriff's sale, and a writ of execution is an enforcement mechanism for a default judgment tin Pennsylvania. The injuries complained of were therefore produced by the default judgments, which were neither stricken nor opened at the state court level. The Plaintiffs' federal claims are in effect appeals of the underlying default judgments.\").\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   bars federal district courts from reviewing claims of legal error in state court judgments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs' arguments to the contrary are not persuasive. First, the fact that only prejudgment interest was awarded in the underlying judgments ignores the portion of the judgment specifying the rate of interest. By checking the box for statutory interest for written instruments, the underlying state-court judgments established the interest rate for both prejudgment and post-judgment interest. The judgments might have authorized an amount of prejudgment interest only, but the judgment set the rate for both pre and post-judgment interest. Second, the holding in\n   <em>\n    In re FDCPA Cognate Cases\n   </em>\n   , No. 1:13cv1328,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201273349\">\n    2016 WL 1273349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.D. Mich. Mar. 28, 2016) is distinguishable. In that case, the requests for writs of garnishment included costs as the prevailing party in the garnishment proceedings. But, the prevailing party had not yet been determined in the garnishment proceedings. The underlying judgments did not establish which party prevailed in the garnishment proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201273349\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at *4-*5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Because it was only involved in a state-court lawsuit after a judgment issued, Defendant Berndt offers an alternative argument. Berndt argues the writs of garnishment themselves are state-court orders subject to\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Berndt is correct that Plaintiffs' injuries were caused by the writs of garnishment. If Plaintiffs' allegations are true, the writs authorized the defendants in this lawsuit to collect post-judgment interest calculated at a rate not authorized by Michigan law. Using Plaintiffs' theory, their actual damages would be the difference between the amount of post-judgment interest collected and the amount of post-judgment interest actually owed (calculated using the correct interest rate). Although artfully worded, Plaintiffs are, in fact, appealing the writ of garnishment, or at least the amount of post-judgment interest contained in writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The sources of Plaintiffs' injuries are not the false affidavits contained within the completed SCAO forms. Under their theory, Plaintiffs were injured when excess interest was authorized by the writ. The two federal opinions on which Plaintiffs rely are distinguishable. In both cases of the cases cited by Plaintiffs, the state-court plaintiffs filed false affidavits, or affidavits with false statements. But, in both cases, the state court orders that relied on the false affidavits were successfully challenged in the state court proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Stolicker v.
