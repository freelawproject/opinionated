In the motion, YEI seeks a revision of the Court's November 14, 2017, memorandum and order granting in part Defendants' motion for summary judgment and denying Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment [Doc. 453]. Crescent filed a response in opposition to the motion for revision [Doc. 463], and YEI filed a reply [Doc. 464]. This matter is now ripe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons stated below, YEI's motion will be\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED IN PART and DENIED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   . The Court's previous summary judgment order will be\n   <strong>\n    VACATED IN PART\n   </strong>\n   to the extent it dismissed Plaintiffs' claims arising after April 22, 2015, and to the extent it dismissed Plaintiffs' trade secret claims and Defendants' trade secret counterclaims. The post-April 22, 2015 claims and the trade secret claims will be\n   <strong>\n    REINSTATED\n   </strong>\n   . Further, the Court will set a new schedule, including a status conference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As detailed in many prior filings, this case arises out of a soured business relationship between Defendants and Plaintiffs. Crescent is a sock manufacturing company. Plaintiff Yoe was hired in 2000 to serve as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Crescent. Defendants Allen and Boyd are part owners of Crescent, and have worked there throughout their adult lives.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   They are members of the Burn family, which has owned and controlled Crescent since it began operations in the early 1900s. Yoe owns YEI, which holds intellectual property rights to sock brands developed by Yoe and manufactured by Crescent during Yoe's employment at Crescent, including the FITS and Game Knits brands at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In September 2012, Crescent and YEI entered into an agreement (the \"Business Agreement\") which memorialized prior agreements and the parties' business relationship in relevant part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Ownership of Intellectual Property.\n   </em>\n   Any and all new brands, and other intellectual property relating to such new brands, that are developed, registered, trademarked, invented, started, conceived or designed by Crescent, Yoe and/or YEI from January 1, 2009 through the termination of Yoe's employment with Crescent ('the Intellectual Property') shall be 100% owned by YEI....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Royalties as to \"Fits\" and \"Jack's\" Brands.\n   </em>\n   Crescent shall pay royalty payments to YEI relative to the\n   \"Fits\" brand ... [at a rate of $1.00 in 2013 and 2014, and beginning in 2015 and each year thereafter at a rate of] \"5% of Net Sales\"; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Licensing.\n   </em>\n   On or before 1 year after the execution of [the Business Agreement], YEI and Crescent will enter into an agreement for licensing/manufacturing/sourcing relative to the Intellectual Property which includes terms and conditions similar to the LIG contract [and which incorporates the royalty payment schedule].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [Business Agreement, Doc. 24-3, at Page ID # 110-11]. The Business Agreement is also at least part of the parties' licensing agreement, although the parties dispute whether there are additional terms to the licensing agreement not expressly written in the Business Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Yoe and five other Crescent employees who worked with the FITS brand were fired by Crescent on September 4, 2013. The day before, Crescent had filed a lawsuit in the McMinn County, Tennessee, Chancery Court (the \"Chancery Court Case\"), seeking a declaration that certain employment contracts between Yoe and Crescent (which provided for, among other things, a $2 million severance payment to Yoe upon termination without cause) and the Business Agreement were void and unenforceable. Yoe and YEI filed counterclaims and amended counterclaims in the Chancery Court Case, alleging,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Crescent breached the Business Agreement with YEI, and that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   22. Upon information and belief, since terminating Mr. Yoe, Crescent has eliminated certain SKUs of FITS\u00ae product[s], changed the names of certain FITS\u00ae products, changed the packaging of products, ceased research and development of the FITS\u00ae products, is failing to use pre-existing marketing practices including but not limited to preseason terms and conditions, sales collateral, and other sales support, is failing to maintain the proper levels of FITS\u00ae product[s] in the retail stores and proper inventory levels at Crescent, and is representing that Crescent is the owner of the FITS\u00ae brand. Each of these actions is causing irreparable damages to the FITS\u00ae bran[d] to Yoe Enterprises as owner of the FITS\u00ae brand and to Mr. Yoe as the CEO of Yoe Enterprises.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 453 at Page ID # 15551-52; Doc. 24-4 at Page ID # 221]. Plaintiffs also obtained an injunction that provided, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   It appearing to the Court that the parties to this cause have agreed on the terms of the Temporary Injunction, that because of the uniqueness of the brand of sock known as FITS\u00ae, and because the value of this brand of sock may be compromised and/or lost if this injunction is not granted, it is hereby:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   1. Crescent Sock Company, its agents, employees, successors, officers and directors, and all other persons in concert or participation with such entities, are enjoined from marketing the FITS\u00ae brand products ... unless each and every product has been manufactured using the proper materials, proper packaging, proper technology for manufacturing FITS\u00ae, proper manufacturing processes, and using all of the same specifications required to manufacture FITS\u00ae that were in place as of August 15, 2013 and using all of the same specifications as required by the patents held by Yoe Enterprises.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   2. Crescent Sock Company, its agents, employees, successors, attorneys, officers and directors and all other entities in active concert or participation\n   with such entities, are hereby enjoined and required to fulfill any and all orders for FITS\u00ae and Jacks\u00ae products in a timely and appropriate manner, all as required by orders for such products, to the extent that said orders do not exceed the operating capacity of the Company as it existed on September 4, 2013, using the correct and proper materials, packaging, technology, manufacturing specifications and specifications as set forth above. Further, the Company shall use its best faith efforts to maintain adequate levels of inventory and yarn on order and on hand to fulfill such orders....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   [Doc. 24-7 at Page ID # 272-73].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Court detailed the history of the Chancery Court Case in its summary judgment order [Doc. 453 at Page ID 15547-56] and will not repeat it herein. In that summary judgment order, the Court denied Defendants' motion for summary judgment on a number of issues, but granted summary judgment to Defendants on all Plaintiffs' claims that related specifically and exclusively to Defendants' production of the FITS brand socks (the \"FITS Claims\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) [Doc. 453 at Page ID # 15571]. The Court concluded that in light of the nature of the amended counterclaims and the injunction in the Chancery Court Case, the FITS Claims were barred in this case by application of res judicata. As Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment related only to their FITS trademark claims, the Court also denied Plaintiffs' motion on the grounds that such claims were barred by res judicata. The Court additionally granted summary judgment to Defendants Boyd and Allen on Plaintiffs' Count XIII (Boyd and Allen's inducement of breach of the Business Agreement) on res judicata grounds. This Count is also part of the FITS Claims, but the Court addressed it separately in the summary judgment order. The Court will refer to it as being part of the FITS Claims in this Order, except where necessary to address it separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Finally, there are FITS-only trade secret claims. The Court held that Count VII (injunctive relief-trade secrets), which concerned only FITS, was barred by res judicata. The Court found that the declaratory relief Plaintiffs seek in Counts VI (declaratory judgment-trade secrets) and XVI (trade secret misappropriation and unfair competition-Omni Wool Tactical and Hiwassee Trading Company Socks), was moot to the extent it concerned trade secrets that relate only to FITS socks [Doc. 453 at Page ID # 15571]. To the extent Plaintiffs seek monetary damages, costs or fees concerning Defendants' alleged use or misuse of the FITS-only trade secrets in Counts VI and XVI, the Court found that res judicata applied. The Court will address the FITS-only trade secret claims separately in this order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In the instant motion, Plaintiffs ask the Court to reconsider and revise its decision regarding res judicata pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [A]ny order or other decision, however designated, that adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties does not end the action as to any of the claims or parties and may be revised at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the claims and all the parties' rights and liabilities.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \"District courts have authority under both common law and Rule 54(b) to reconsider interlocutory orders and to reopen any part of a case before entry of final judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   YEI contends that the Court erred in finding the FITS Claims were part of the same series of transactions, in terms of their subject matter, that were adjudicated in the Chancery Court Case [Doc. 459 at Page ID # 15617-19; Doc. 464 at Page ID # 15720-21]. YEI also contends that the Court erred in dismissing on res judicata grounds any claims that arose after entry of judgment in the Chancery Court Case in December 2014\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   [Doc. 459 at Page ID # 15606-17; Doc. 464 at Page ID # 15713-29].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   After careful consideration, the Court finds it necessary to revise the summary judgment order. Plaintiffs' FITS Claims, including any inducement of breach of contract claims against Boyd and Allen, arising after entry of the \"Order Regarding Post Trial Motions\" in the Chancery Court Case on April 22, 2015, are not barred by application of the doctrine of res judicata. Based on YEI's representations concerning the FITS-only trade secret claims (addressed below), the Court finds that the FITS-only trade secret claims should be reinstated in their entirety. The Court further finds, however, that YEI has failed to show clear error in the Court's conclusion that any FITS Claim, including inducement of breach of contract claims against Boyd and Allen, arising on or before April 22, 2015, are barred. It is undisputed that Crescent stopped manufacturing FITS socks on February 28, 2016 [Doc. 377-6 at Page ID # 10872]. As a result, the Court's holding reinstates Plaintiffs' FITS Claims, including the inducement of breach of contract claims, arising between April 22, 2015, and February 28, 2016. In correcting this error, the Court notes that the issue of when the continuing claims arose vis-\u00e0-vis entry of the Chancery Court Case \"final judgment\" was only raised in passing, at best, in the Plaintiffs' response to Defendants' motion for summary judgment\n   [Doc. 382 at Page ID # 10991-92].

The FITS Claims in the third amended complaint in this case are largely if not entirely predicated on the idea that after Yoe was fired, Crescent exercised control over the FITS brand. This included making changes to the design of FITS socks and their branding or marketing, and representing that Crescent was the owner of FITS, when the true owner of the brand was actually YEI. Plaintiffs claim this caused damage to Plaintiffs and to the brand more generally. In previously dismissing the FITS Claims on Defendants' motion for summary judgment, the Court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   It is clear from Yoe and YEI's pleadings in the Chancery Court Case, in particular the January 2014 amended counterclaim and third-party complaint detailed above, that the allegedly infringing/unfair conduct with respect to FITS was occurring or had already occurred prior to the expiration of the injunction. The Court therefore rejects Yoe and YEI's characterization of the Chancery Court Case as having a \"singular\" purpose of \"invalidat[ing] the contracts that gave YEI ownership of FITS and Bob Yoe a severance package,\" and as \"deal[ing] with matters that existed before September 3, 2013, when Crescent sued Yoe.\" [Doc. 382 at Page ID # 10990-91]. The existence of the injunction, which is by nature forward looking, belies Yoe and YEI's characterization, as do the allegations in Yoe and YEI's January 2014 amended countercomplaint and third-party complaint in the Chancery Court Case:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   22. Upon information and belief, since terminating Mr. Yoe, Crescent has eliminated certain SKUs of FITS\u00ae product[s], changed the names of certain FITS\u00ae products, changed the packaging of products, ceased research and development of the FITS\u00ae products, is failing to use pre-existing marketing practices including but not limited to preseason terms and conditions, sales collateral, and other sales support, is failing to maintain the proper levels of FITS\u00ae product[s] in the retail stores and proper inventory\n   levels at Crescent, and is representing that Crescent is the owner of the FITS\u00ae brand. Each of these actions is causing irreparable damages to the FITS\u00ae bran[d] to Yoe Enterprises as owner of the FITS\u00ae brand and to Mr. Yoe as the CEO of Yoe Enterprises.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [Doc. 24-4 at Page ID # 221]. These assertions, along with the injunction, effectively expanded the scope of the lawsuit to include events and interactions between the parties that occurred after the filing of the initial chancery court complaint. The alleged acts of infringement, unfair competition, etc. [asserted in the federal court case], arise out of the same series of transactions that necessitated the injunction in the first place-once again, the disintegration of the parties' business relationship, and the division and protection of the FITS brand in the wake of Yoe's termination from Crescent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   [Doc. 453 at Page ID # 15567-68].

Indeed, the chancery court held that \"YEI is the owner of the respected brands in question, and by Crescent now claiming ownership of the brands, Crescent has in fact breached the [Business Agreement]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   ....\" [Doc. 382-3 at Page ID # 11115]. The chancery court also held that the filing of the Chancery Court Case did not, in and of itself, constitute a breach of the Business Agreement [Doc. 56-1 at Page ID # 617-18]. Moreover, whether Defendants were properly producing FITS during the time period following Yoe's termination was clearly at issue in the Chancery Court Case, as evidenced by Plaintiffs' allegations concerning Defendants' changing SKUs, changing marketing practices, etc., and also as evidenced by the chancery court injunction. Finally, the Business Agreement is an integral component of the parties' licensing agreement. Defendants contend the Business Agreement defines the entire scope of the licensing agreement; Plaintiffs contend there are additional \"terms\" or rights that YEI held.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   What the Court is confronted with in this case, versus the Chancery Court Case, are essentially claims for different types of breaches of the same contract (the Business Agreement, an integral component of the parties' licensing agreement), by the same parties, arising from conduct that was specifically prohibited by an injunction that was repeatedly affirmed in the Chancery Court Case. In both cases, Plaintiffs have asserted Defendants breached the Business Agreement, and therefore the licensing agreement. The specifications of FITS socks were at issue via the injunction and other allegations made by Plaintiffs in the Chancery Court Case, and they are at issue in this case through a host of claims as quoted above. In spite of the non-suit of certain claims, the injunction itself is a form of relief concerning Defendants' production of FITS in the wake of Yoe's termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In addition, the Court found that Plaintiffs' claim in this case for inducement of breach of contract against Boyd and Allen (Count XIII) was barred because: 1) it is based on Boyd and Allen's alleged inducement of Crescent's breach of the Business Agreement, with the breach being the filing the Chancery Court Case and the subsequent exercise of control over FITS without Yoe's input; 2) Crescent's breach of the Business Agreement was clearly part of the Chancery Court Case; 3) the injunction in the Chancery Court Case was directed to Boyd and Allen as employees and officers of Crescent; 4) Boyd and Allen were parties to the Chancery Court Case; and 5) it is beyond serious dispute that Boyd and Allen were at least partially, if not mostly, in control of Crescent at all relevant times [Doc. 453 at Page ID # 15565-66]. Clearly, the parties were litigating facts in the Chancery Court Case that would have strongly overlapped with any claim that Boyd and Allen induced Crescent's breach of the Business Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In support of their position that the Court's decision that the FITS Claims are not part of the same transaction or occurrence, Plaintiffs rely most heavily on\n   <em>\n    Acumed, LLC v.

In that case, Acumed first sued Stryker for patent infringement relating to a type of medical nail used to repair bone fractures. Stryker called its nail the T2 PHN.

For example, Plaintiffs' Count I alleges that Crescent \"has utilized the [trade]marks in connection with goods and products which have not been approved by YEI.\" [Doc. 201 at Page ID # 2881]. Plaintiffs' theory is that all FITS socks had to be approved by Yoe before they could be sold, which Defendants dispute. That fundamental issue, and any claims for relief that flow from its resolution (and which arose prior to April 22, 2015), could have and should have been raised in the Chancery Court Case. As discussed below, however, the Court now finds that any unapproved changes that occurred after April 22, 2015, gave rise to a new cause of action, and therefore a new opportunity for Plaintiffs to make this argument, and to seek damages for any post-April 22, 2015, conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Finally, the Court was careful to exclude from its res judicata holding any claims involving allegations that Defendants misappropriated Plaintiffs' intellectual property in FITS by incorporating it into the Hiwassee Trade Company or Omni Wool socks. For these reasons,\n   <em>\n    Acumed\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiffs also rely on\n   <em>\n    Grendene USA, Inc. v. Brady\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:14-cv-2955-GPC-KSC,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201499229\">\n    2015 WL 1499229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D. Cal. Apr. 1, 2015). In that case, the Bradys had filed a trademark infringement action against Grendene on March 9, 2012. Grendene then sued the Bradys on December 15, 2014, arguing the filing of the trademark suit constituted a breach of a 1995 settlement agreement that contained a covenant not to sue.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1. The Bradys argued in the later suit that Grendene's breach of contract claim should be dismissed because it was a compulsory counterclaim in the earlier trademark infringement case. The\n   court denied the motion to dismiss, finding in relevant part that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   In determining whether a counterclaim is compulsory, the Ninth Circuit applies the \"logical relationship test\" which analyzes whether the essential facts of the various claims are so logically connected that considerations of judicial economy and fairness dictate that all issues be resolved in one lawsuit. Applying the logical relationship test, the \"essential facts\" of the Bradys' causes of action in the Trademark Action differ from those of Grendene's breach of contract cause of action. The Trademark Action involves facts dealing with alleged infringement. This action involves facts dealing with the Bradys['] decision to file a lawsuit based on that alleged infringement. These are separate facts as the decision to bring a legal cause of action is separate from the elements of that cause of action. Accordingly, the Court finds that Grendene's breach of contract cause of action was not a compulsory counterclaim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201499229\">\n    2015 WL 1499229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (internal quotation marks, citations and alterations omitted). As Crescent points out, however, the court in\n   <em>\n    Grendene\n   </em>\n   offers little analysis and the decision is not binding on this Court. Moreover, as described above, facts underlying Plaintiffs' FITS Claims\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   involved in the Chancery Court Case. The breaches alleged by Plaintiffs in the Chancery Court Case involved actions allegedly taken by Defendants regarding FITS after Defendants filed the Chancery Court Case and terminated Yoe, not just Defendants' decision to take the action of firing Yoe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court finds Plaintiffs have failed to show any clear error with the Court's prior decision that the FITS Claims are part of the same transaction or occurrence (in the subject matter sense) as the claims involved in the Chancery Court Case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Final Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   YEI also argues that, even if the FITS Claims arose out of the same transaction or occurrence, any claims which arose after the date the chancery court rendered its judgment on December 23 (or the date the chancery court clerk\n   <em>\n    entered\n   </em>\n   the judgment on December 29, 2014), cannot be barred by res judicata. The Court did not discuss this issue as such in its prior summary judgment order except to note that the various amendments to and allegations in Plaintiffs' pleadings in the Chancery Court Case and the injunction expanded the scope of the lawsuit to include claims that arose after the filing of the complaint [Doc. 453 at Page ID # 15567-68].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In the pending motion, YEI originally argued that res judicata does not apply to any events occurring after the commencement of the Chancery Court Case on September 3, 2013 under a bright-line rule [Doc. 459 at Page ID # 15614]. In its reply, however, YEI seems to acknowledge that Tennessee has not adopted the bright-line rule and mainly argues that FITS Claims arising from actions \"occurring after the state court rendered its judgment on December 23, 2014, or after its entry on December 29, 2014, are not subject to\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   .\" [Doc. 464 at Page ID # 15713;\n   <em>\n    see also, e.g.,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201499229\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Page ID # 15724 (\"The language adopted by\n   <em>\n    Creech\n   </em>\n   -that claim preclusion can extend only to the facts in issue as they existed at the time the judgment was rendered-and its application, leads to the most practical result.\") ].

But again, both of those cases involved claims that arose prior to commencement of the second suit (even if the claims were not discovered until later). Plaintiffs argue that to deny them relief on their claims arising after the trial court rendered its December 23, 2014, judgment in the Chancery Court Case would \"reward Crescent for its continued, unabated, wrongful conduct.\" [Doc. 464 at Page ID # 15729].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   YEI cites federal court cases in its opening brief which hold that claims for continuing wrongs (like an ongoing trademark infringement), are not barred in a subsequent case if the claims arise after the\n   filing of a complaint in a prior case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   These cases do not appear to align with the broader application of res judicata under Tennessee law, which as even YEI appears to recognize in reply, bars claims arising prior to\n   <em>\n    judgment\n   </em>\n   , not the filing of the complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Keeping these principles in mind, the Court concludes that any FITS Claims, including any inducement of breach of contract claims arising after the chancery court entered (signed) the Order Regarding Post Trial Motions on April 22, 2015, are barred.

In light of the dismissal of these FITS-only trade secret claims/requests for relief and because Defendants were no longer producing FITS (and because Plaintiffs offered no proof Defendants planned to use FITS-only trade secrets in the future), the Court held that the declaratory relief Plaintiffs seek in Counts VI (declaratory judgment-trade secrets) and XVI (trade secret misappropriation and unfair competition-Omni Wool Tactical and Hiwassee Trading Company Socks) was moot to the extent it concerned FITS-only trade secrets [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Under the Tennessee Uniform Trade Secrets Act (\"TUTSA\"), \"misappropriation\" means:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   (A) Acquisition of a trade secret of another by a person who knows or has reason to know that the trade secret was acquired by improper means; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   (B) Disclosure or use of a trade secret of another without express or implied consent by a person who:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   (i) Used improper means to acquire knowledge of the trade secret; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   (ii) At the time of disclosure or use, knew or had reason to know that that person's knowledge of the trade secret was:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   (a) Derived from or through a person who had utilized improper means to acquire it;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   (b) Acquired under circumstances giving rise to a duty to maintain its secrecy or limit its use; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   (c) Derived from or through a person who owed a duty to the person seeking relief to maintain its secrecy or limit its use; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   (iii) Before a material change of the person's position, knew or had reason to know that it was a trade secret and that knowledge of it had been acquired by accident or mistake;\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2047-25-1702\">\n    Tenn.

In light of this representation, the Court finds that the FITS-only trade secret misappropriation claims, including the associated request for damages and injunctive relief, should not have been dismissed on res judicata grounds.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The Court previously held that the declaratory relief Plaintiffs sought for FITS-only trade secrets in Counts VI and XVI (a declaration that YEI is the owner\n   of the trade secrets) was moot.

Because the Court will allow YEI to proceed on its FITS-only trade secret misappropriation claims for injunctive relief and for damages, the Court must also necessarily allow Plaintiffs to seek declaratory relief that they are the owners of the FITS-only trade secrets (Counts VI and XVI). The Court will vacate the portion of its previous summary judgment order dismissing Plaintiffs' FITS-only trade secret claims, and the FITS-only trade secret claims will be reinstated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Court also previously held that any relief Defendants seek in their counterclaims concerning the FITS-only trade secrets was either moot or barred by res judicata [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 409 at Page ID # 11495-96;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 453 at Page ID # 15572].

Plaintiffs did not respond to these arguments in their reply [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 464]. Defendants raised these or similar arguments in their original motion for summary judgment, and the Court declined to address them at that time, because the Court dismissed all of the FITS Claims on other grounds (primarily res judicata). The Court also declined to rule on Plaintiffs'\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   motion for partial summary judgment, which related only to their FITS trademark infringement claims. The Court will address these issues now: first, Defendants' argument that the FITS Claims are barred by collateral estoppel, and second, the parties' respective arguments concerning the Business Agreement/FITS license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

The chancery court found the Business Agreement to be an unambiguous,\n   valid, and enforceable contract. It construed the agreement's terms, which were \"definite in scope\" and \"plain in language,\" to mean\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   that YEI owned the FITS mark, that Crescent would pay royalties under the schedule set forth in Paragraph 2, that Crescent had no obligations beyond its royalty payments under the license, and that the license was non-exclusive. By its own terms, the Business Agreement was fully integrated and required that any subsequent agreements relating to or modifying it be in writing. On appeal, the Tennessee Court of Appeals affirmed the chancery court's findings and also added that the Business Agreement was the only written contract between YEI and Crescent. Thus, the FITS license has already been actually litigated, previously adjudicated, and its interpretation was necessary to the judgment rendered in state court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   [Doc. 463 at Page ID # 15687-88 (citations to the record omitted) ].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Crescent overstates what was actually determined in the Chancery Court Case. As relevant here, the chancery court held in its Order Regarding Post Trial Motions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   The court finds, and noted at the hearing, that the trial of this case was tried over a period of several days, and the movant's attorneys had every opportunity to plead and to argue any issue pertaining to the licensing agreement that they chose to argue. However, they chose not to argue concerning the licensing agreement, and did not request any declaration from this court concerning the various essential terms of the agreement between the parties.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   [Doc. 56-1 at Page ID # 628]. Thus, contrary to Crescent's argument, it is clear that the chancery court did not \"previously determine\" all of the terms of the Business Agreement to the extent it operated as a license agreement. The chancery court did generally hold that all of the written agreements between the parties (including the Business Agreement) were \"definite in scope\" and \"plain in language\" [Doc. 24-8 at Page ID # 312], but given the statement from the chancery court quoted above, the chancery court did not address whether there are additional terms to the \"license.\" Nowhere did the chancery court expressly hold, as Crescent contends, that Crescent \"had no obligations beyond its royalty payments under the license.\" [Doc. 463 at Page ID # 15688]. What the chancery court did hold at the pages cited by Crescent is that, under the Business Agreement, YEI owned the socks brands Yoe developed, Crescent was required to pay royalties, and that there \"is nothing in the Business Agreement\" that required Plaintiffs to reimburse Crescent \"for the costs expended in the development, manufacturing and marketing of new brands\" or \"for any costs incurred or losses.\" [Doc. 24-8 at Page ID # 302-03]. The chancery court further held that Crescent did not have an exclusive license to produce FITS after terminating Yoe [Doc. 56-1 at Page ID 631], and finally that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   Mr. Yoe and YEI have established that the contracts in question in this case are enforceable contracts. The contracts in this case were written agreements executed by the officers and shareholders of Crescent acting in their capacity as members of the Executive Committee of Crescent's Board of Directors. The court finds that there is no question these actions were taken for the purpose of retaining Mr. Yoe's services as a key and/or vital employee. Their actions were supported by valuable consideration: Mr. Yoe's continued employment on the one hand, and increased compensation and benefits from Crescent on the other. The court finds that the terms of the contracts are definite in scope, plain in language and fair to all parties involved. The court specifically finds that\n   there has been no overt or implicit violation of Tennessee's public policy embedded in its provisions, and that there is no proof of fraud on the part of any parties to the contracts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   [Doc. 24-8 at Page ID # 312-13]. When combined with the chancery court's earlier statement about the licensing agreement, it appears the chancery court did not hold that the Business Agreement plainly defined the entire scope of the parties' FITS license. The chancery court left that question open because the parties did not request any declaration concerning the various essential terms of the licensing agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs are not collaterally estopped from arguing the merits of their FITS Claims in Count I (Federal Trademark Infringement-Crescent); Count II (Federal Trademark Infringement-Individual Defendants); Count V (Violation of the Lanham Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201125\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ); Count VIII (Unfair or Deceptive Trade Practices Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2047-18-101\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 47-18-101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , et seq. ); Count X (Unfair Competition); and Count XI (Breach of License Agreement). In other words, collateral estoppel is not an appropriate basis for denying YEI's motion for reconsideration, and Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on these Counts based on collateral estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <strong>\n    2. FITS License\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The remaining issues go to the heart of the parties' dispute over the FITS Claims. Plaintiffs argued in their motion for summary judgment that the Court should \"enter a judgment against Crescent for infringing the FITS trademark,\" and Plaintiffs \"will address the damages that Crescent's infringement caused\" at trial [Doc. 322 at Page ID # 6129]. Plaintiffs' \"Federal Trademark Infringement\" claims are asserted in Count I of the third amended complaint. Count I alleges:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   Crescent has exploited the Intellectual Property, more specifically, YEI's federally-registered \"FITS\u00ae\" and \"Game Knits\u00ae\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   trademarks, without authorization. Without authorization or approval by YEI, it has utilized the marks in connection with goods and products which have not been approved by YEI. Such unauthorized conduct includes, among other things, advertising, selling and marketing socks not manufactured pursuant to YEI's specifications or quality standards with the YEI Trademarks. In addition, Crescent has used advertising and other materials which display the YEI Trademarks which have not been approved or authorized by YEI.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   [Doc. 201 at Page ID # 2881].\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The Court pauses here to note that given the way Plaintiffs argue their motion, it\n   appears they are simply asking the Court to construe YEI's licensing agreement with Crescent; specifically, whether Crescent was permitted to make changes to FITS design and branding after terminating Yoe, without obtaining Yoe's preapproval. Plaintiffs describe the \"single, straightforward legal issue at the heart of [the] motion:\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   <strong>\n    Interference with control rights\n   </strong>\n   -Under federal law, a licensee commits trademark infringement if it sells unapproved goods under the licensor's mark. Here, Crescent changed the colors, patterns, design, raw materials, and packaging of YEI's FITS-branded socks without the approval of YEI and refused to allow YEI to supervise or control Crescent's use of the FITS mark. Did Crescent infringe YEI's FITS trademark?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   [Doc. 326 at Page ID # 6265]. Plaintiff seek summary judgment that \"Crescent infringed YEI's FITS trademark when it seized control over the FITS brand and [made alterations] without YEI's authority or approval between September 2013 and February 28, 2016.\" [Doc. 326 at Page ID # 6288].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Defendants' position, as mentioned above, is that \"[b]ecause the Business Agreement did not include approval or control provisions, Crescent is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law on YEI's claims for infringement, unfair competition, and breach of license.

This Executive Employment Contract does not discuss licensing. The Court brings this point up because in Count XI (Breach of License Agreement) of the third amended complaint (on which Defendants seek summary judgment), Plaintiffs seem to contend that the employment contracts form part of the licensing agreement [Doc. 201 at Page ID # 2890]. It is clear, however, that the February 2012 Executive Employment Contract is the controlling employment contract, and it does not discuss licensing. Moreover, YEI (the owner of the intellectual property) is not a party to any of the employment contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   YEI\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   a party to the Business Agreement [Doc. 24-3], which was executed on September 4, 2012, several months after the Executive Employment Contract. The Business Agreement provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   WHEREAS, Yoe and Crescent have from time to time entered into certain business agreements relative to branding and intellectual property rights that are not memorialized in the Employment Contract;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   WHEREAS, the Parties\n   <strong>\n    desire to memorialize the prior business agreements concerning branding and intellectual property rights in a single agreement\n   </strong>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration, ... the Parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Ownership of Intellectual Property.\n   </em>\n   Any and all new brands, and other intellectual property relating to such new brands, that are developed, registered, trademarked, copyrighted, invented, started, conceived or designed by Crescent, Yoe and/or YEI from January 1, 2009 through the termination of Yoe's employment with Crescent (the \"Intellectual Property\") shall be 100% owned by YEI.

The language of the Business Agreement indicates the parties intended to reduce all of their\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   agreements concerning their intellectual property into one agreement. It is clear that YEI would license FITS to Crescent, and that the parties intended to enter into a more detailed licensing agreement in the future. Unfortunately, they never did, and Yoe was eventually fired. Crescent continued to produce FITS after Yoe was fired (as it was required to do by the chancery court injunction), and it is undisputed that Crescent had a license to produce FITS during this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   On June 10, 2015, YEI notified Crescent that it was terminating the license, and on June 19, YEI notified Crescent that it was rescinding the termination temporarily (thereby temporarily reinstating the license) [Doc. 350-1]. On July 31, 2015, YEI notified Crescent that it would fully reinstate the license, and that \"Crescent should continue to comply with the temporary\n   injunction that was entered by the Chancery Court of McMinn County.\" [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at Page ID # 8506]. Crescent stopped manufacturing FITS on February 28, 2016, when YEI took over production [Doc. 377-6]. Although the Court has located nothing in the massive record showing that YEI formally terminated the license again, there is a letter from counsel for YEI to counsel for Crescent indicating that YEI would take over responsibility for producing and selling FITS beginning February 28, 2016 [Doc. 377-6].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Appealing to general principles of contract law, which undisputedly applies to license agreements, Crescent argues that the Business Agreement is plain and unambiguous, and did not require Crescent to seek YEI's (or Yoe's) approval before making changes to FITS after Yoe was fired [\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 321 at Page ID # 6032-36]. In effect, Crescent's argument is that by executing the Business Agreement without including any quality control provisions, YEI gave up the right to control Crescent's use of the FITS mark, other than by YEI terminating the Business Agreement. Plaintiffs argue that the Court must look beyond the Business Agreement to substantive trademark law and the parties' course of dealings, wherein Yoe himself controlled and oversaw the production, marketing and sales of FITS, to determine what was permitted under the license and whether Crescent breached the license when it sold socks that incorporated changes which YEI did not approve [Doc. 382 at Page ID # 10997-11002]. Crescent responds that the details of the parties' prior course of dealings amount to parol evidence, which should be not be introduced because the Business Agreement is unambiguous. Moreover, Crescent argues, \"[a]ny finding of a previously or later-executed, non-written agreement would eschew the Business Agreement's integration clause and prohibition against non-written amendments and modifications.\" [Doc. 463 at Page ID # 15688]. If YEI did not think the Business Agreement was an acceptable license, Crescent argues, it should have terminated the license or negotiated new terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   \"The cardinal rule for interpretation of contracts is to ascertain the intention of the parties and to give effect to that intention, consistent with legal principles.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Healthcare Corp. v.

Not only does the Business Agreement not contain design/branding control provisions (or other provisions one might typically find in a trademark license agreement), it expressly recognizes that silence by indicating the parties' intent to enter into a more detailed licensing agreement in the future.

App. 2003) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Regarding the parties' course of dealings, Defendants concede that during his tenure as CEO of Crescent, \"Mr. Yoe oversaw all of Crescent's business, including its creation, manufacture, marketing and sale of socks under the FITS brand and others. He supervised all Crescent employees, including those employees responsible for manufacturing, marketing, and selling FITS branded socks.\" [Doc. 377 at Page ID # 10842]. Defendants argue that Yoe was not acting on behalf of YEI at this time because he was an employee of Crescent, but they cite no authority to support their argument that Mr. Yoe's dual role is dispositive. Defendants chose to hire Yoe, the sole owner of YEI, to act as CEO of Crescent. Defendants also chose to allow YEI, Yoe's company, to retain ownership of all intellectual property associated with sock brands Yoe developed while working for Crescent. YEI acts through Yoe, its sole owner. Certainly Defendants do not point to any document indicating the parties agreed that any action Yoe took with regard to FITS was taken on behalf of Crescent rather than YEI. Indeed, the agreements between the parties seem to indicate that Yoe's creative work with regard to FITS or other socks would benefit both YEI and Crescent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that Yoe:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n   oversaw the development of the unique knitting machine programs required to manufacture the socks. He made decisions about the socks' colors and patterns. He chose what raw materials went into the socks. He approved the design of the socks' packaging. He decided what styles of socks to include in the FITS lineup. In essence, he and the small \"FITS Team\" working under his supervision made FITS work.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   [Doc. 382 at Page ID # 11001-02]. In his affidavit submitted in support of Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, Yoe states that, during his time at Crescent, \"I or a member of my FITS team under my direct supervision were the only people who could approve the packaging and advertising for FITS.\" [Doc. 326-4 at Page ID # 6373].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   It is unknown whether Yoe delegated any of his decision-making or quality control authority to the \"FITS team\" who apparently were all employed by Crescent. It does appear that Yoe (as the sole owner of YEI) played a significant role in the design and branding of FITS, and exercised quality control over use of the FITS trademark. Moreover, as discussed exhaustively\n   in this opinion, the parties agreed to entry of an injunction in the Chancery Court Case, which seemingly sought to preserve the status quo of operations about one month prior to Yoe's termination. This injunction required Crescent to use the \"proper materials, proper packaging, proper technology for manufacturing FITS\u00ae, proper manufacturing processes, and using all of the same specifications required to manufacture FITS\u00ae that were in place as of August 15, 2013 and using all of the same specifications required by the patents held by Yoe Enterprises.\" [Doc. 24-7 at Page ID # 272-73].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   Nevertheless, it is not entirely clear from the parties' course of dealings that they mutually agreed YEI (through Yoe) would have final approval rights over all aspects of FITS; that is, whether every design and marketing choice for FITS had to be made or approved by Yoe before the sock could be sold. Could other Crescent employees veto or insist on certain design choices based on business and market considerations, for example, provided the \"special bulbous heel and ... square toe\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   features are incorporated? Summary Judgment in favor of Plaintiffs on their infringement claims on this basis is therefore inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue in their motion for summary judgment that substantive trademark law grants them the right to control all aspects of the design and branding of FITS. They argue any FITS socks had to be made and sold pursuant to the specifications created by Yoe prior to his firing, and that any FITS socks which did not conform to those specifications constitute an infringement of the FITS trademark. McCarthy on Trademarks, a treatise cited by both parties, states that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Genuine Goods: The Trademark Owner is in Control\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . A trademark carries with it a message that the trademark owner is controlling the nature and quality of the goods or services sold under the mark. Without quality control, this message is false because without control of quality, the goods or services are not truly \"genuine.\" .... As has been remarked:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-176\">\n   One of the most valuable and important protections afforded by the Lanham Act is the right to control the quality of goods manufactured and sold under the holder's trademark....

How that fact affected the court's analysis is unclear; however, that fact does distinguish the\n   <em>\n    Trailers International\n   </em>\n   case from the case at bar, where the parties agreed to a continuing relationship as defined by the Chancery Court Case injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   The language regarding the right of a licensor to exercise quality control in the treatise and cases quoted above is influential. Nevertheless, after carefully considering the issues as presented by the parties, the Court remains unconvinced that general principles of trademark law can impose\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   quality control or approval provisions between the parties where they were not otherwise bargained for. While a licensor must exercise quality control to avoid abandoning a trademark under the concept of \"naked licensing,\" even Plaintiffs acknowledge \"total control is unnecessary.\" [Doc. 326 at Page ID # 6279]. Yet they ask the Court to read into their license a provision for YEI's total control such that preapproval from Yoe for any change to FITS was required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   At least one court has held that \"[t]he fact that a license does not condition use of a mark on the licensor's quality standards does not establish the issue of infringement if the licensee was in fact granted the right to produce products without the licensor's control.\"\n   <em>\n    Sleash, LLC v.

Ore. Aug. 6, 2014). In\n   <em>\n    Sleash\n   </em>\n   , a case not cited by the parties, the trademark owners argued in part that \"the principle of 'naked licensing' means that [the licensee's] production of the Sleash Pet Specialty Products that are inconsistent with Sleash's quality standards subjects [the licensee] to liability for trademark infringement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *13. The court found that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-194\">\n   [T]he mere fact that Sleash has an independent duty to maintain certain quality standards in order to avoid abandoning its mark does not establish trademark infringement. As a result, the resolution of Sleash's trademark infringement argument turns on whether the specific grant clause in the License Agreement conditioned [the licensee's] use of the Slinger\u00ae and Sleash\u00ae marks on Sleash's \"joint\" approval pursuant to Section 5.4 [of the license agreement].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *14 (citation omitted).

Whether and how\n   they exert that right and duty clearly varies from case to case. Plaintiffs ask the Court to find, as a matter of law, that: \"Crescent infringed YEI's FITS trademark when it seized control over the FITS brand and altered FITS products' packaging, colors, patterns, and designs without YEI's authority or approval between September 2013 and February 28, 2016.\" [Doc. 326 at Page ID # 6288]. The Court finds there are questions of fact concerning what changes (if any) Crescent was permitted to make, as well as what changes Crescent actually did make and when. Summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs on their trademark infringement claims is therefore inappropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   To summarize, the Court's holding is that: 1) Plaintiffs' FITS Claims arising after April 22, 2015, are not barred by res judicata and will be reinstated; 2) Plaintiffs' FITS-only trade secret claims should not have been dismissed and will also be reinstated; 3) Defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on Plaintiffs' remaining FITS Claims based on collateral estoppel or the absence of written control/approval provisions in the Business Agreement; and 4) Plaintiffs are not entitled to summary judgment on Count I of their third amended complaint (Federal Trademark Infringement-Crescent).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

During the conference, the Court will require the parties to inform the Court of the status of each of the pending motions, including whether any agreed resolutions have been (or are likely to be) made to narrow the issues presented or resolve the motion in its entirety. This includes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-215\">\n   1. Crescent's motion in limine (\"MIL\") to exclude opinions of D.

The Court's order states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-231\">\n   Defendants mainly seek a ruling preventing or limiting YEI's attempt to recoup any of its alleged $2 million in costs for recreating the FITS sock-related technology. Given the Court's contemporaneous ruling on the summary judgment motions, it is not clear to the Court how any such costs could be recovered in the claims that remain pending in this action, but the Court has insufficient information at this time and the parties have not been able to consider the summary judgment ruling yet. If Plaintiffs intend to attempt to pursue such costs given the Court's grant of partial summary judgment to Crescent in this action, the Court will hear from the parties at the final pretrial conference as to what, if any, non-monetary remedial measures are proper in light of this Order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-232\">\n   The Court will\n   <strong>\n    RESERVE\n   </strong>\n   ruling on the imposition of any monetary remedial measures until any post-trial motions are addressed so that the parties may be fully heard at an evidentiary hearing regarding the propriety and extent of any such measures without distracting either the Court from addressing the\n   numerous motions recently filed or the parties' trial preparations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   [Doc. 452 at Page ID # 15543].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   At the status conference, the Court will also hear from the parties on the remaining issues regarding spoliation sanctions. Specifically, the Court will hear from the parties regarding the legal basis for the $2 million damages request for the out-of-pocket expenses Plaintiffs allegedly incurred in having to recreate the FITS programs, how the spoliation order impacts Crescent's second motion in limine to preclude reference to discovery disputes [Doc. 413], and possible remedial measures for the spoliation [\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 452].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   In addition, the Court previously reserved ruling on any trade secret misappropriation claim relating to the three socks knitted on a 108-needle machine and the one sock knitted on an 84-needle machine [Doc. 453 at Page ID # 15582-83]. Defendants argued in their summary judgment motion that both of Plaintiffs' technical experts admitted Plaintiffs have no evidence that the alleged trade secrets were used to make these four types of socks [Doc. 325 at Page ID # 6187-88]. The Court noted that Plaintiffs' witness Mitchell Beckler testified his report did not contain an opinion that trade secret numbers 1, 2, 3, 6 and 21 were used in these four types of socks, but that his testimony was less clear regarding whether trade secret numbers 13, 14, and 16 were incorporated [Doc. 453 at Page ID # 15582]. The Court further noted that Plaintiffs' witness Oscar Nardi's testimony regarding whether the trade secrets were incorporated into these socks was even less clear than Beckler's [\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at Page ID # 15582-83]. If the parties have not otherwise resolved this issue prior to the status conference, Plaintiffs should be prepared to point out the record evidence concerning whether any trade secrets were incorporated into these four socks and the specific portions of the expert's reports addressing each sock and trade secret.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Finally, the parties must discuss bifurcation and/or trifurcation of the trial prior to the conference and come prepared to present their position(s) regarding same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-240\">\n    Plaintiff Robert H.

On this issue in the reply brief, YEI mainly argues that its claims arising \"after the state court rendered its judgment on December 23, 2014, or after its entry on December 29, 2014, are not subject to res judicata.\" [Doc. 464 at Page ID # 15713;\n    <em>\n     see also id.\n    </em>\n    at Page ID # 15722 (\"[A]ny claims accruing after the trial court's rendered judgment could not be barred ....\");\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at Page ID # 15724 (\"The language adopted by\n    <em>\n     Creech\n    </em>\n    -that claim preclusion can extend only to the facts in issue as they existed at the time the judgment was rendered-and its application, leads to the most practical result.\") ].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-244\">\n    The Court notes that it dismissed Count VI-Declaratory Judgment-Trade Secrets as moot, and found that any monetary damages Plaintiffs sought under that count were barred by res judicata [Doc. 453 at Page ID # 15571-72].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-245\">\n    Paragraph 32 of the third amended complaint describes how the individual Defendants owned warehouses which they leased to Crescent for \"substantial lease payments,\" and their own personal gain. It states that \"[i]f a plan advocated by Mr. Yoe to build Crescent's own warehouse and terminate the leases ... were implemented, Defendants Allen and Boyd ... would no longer receive the lease payments and suffer personally.\" [Doc. 201 at Page ID # 2876]. Paragraph 35 simply states that \"Crescent has failed and refused to abide by the terms of the Business Agreement, asserting that its terms are not binding upon [Crescent].\" [\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    at Page ID # 2877].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-246\">\n    Plaintiffs write in their memorandum in support of their motion to revise, \"[a] more stark contrast between what this Court has decided and what other courts have decided can't be better presented than in the\n    <em>\n     Acumed\n    </em>\n    case.\" [Doc. 459 at Page ID # 15618].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-247\">\n    On October 31, 2017, the Court granted Crescent leave to file an amended answer to assert the affirmative defense of res judicata over Plaintiffs' objections [Doc. 406]. Crescent claims it waited to assert the res judicata defense until after the Chancery Court Case appeal had been resolved and the case remanded to the chancery court to correct an issue concerning attorney's fees, which the parties eventually resolved by agreement, with the \"final order\" entered by the chancery court on August 23, 2017 [Doc. 300-4]. The Court found that because the \"final order\" was not entered until August 2017, Crescent acted diligently enough and satisfied the applicable requirements of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 15 and 16, even though Crescent sought leave to amend until almost a year after the deadline for amendments, and over a year after the Tennessee Court of Appeals entered its order largely affirming the chancery court's findings [Doc. 406 at Page ID # 11459-61]. It suffices to note here that the question of whether the Court should allow a party to amend its pleadings to assert a defense of res judicata is different from the question of whether claims are barred by res judicata.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-248\">\n    Another circumstance listed in the Restatement, although not discussed in\n    <em>\n     Creech\n    </em>\n    , is \"[f]or reasons of substantive policy in a case involving a continuing or recurrent wrong, the plaintiff is given an option to sue once for the total harm, both past and prospective, or to sue from time to time for the damages incurred to the date of suit, and chooses the latter course.\" Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 26(1)(e).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-249\">\n    Plaintiffs cite\n    <em>\n     Rawe v.

The Court's reinstatement of Plaintiffs' trade secret claims is based on YEI's representation in the instant motion for revision that such claims did not arise until \"over a year and a half after Crescent's filing of the Chancery Court lawsuit.\" [Doc. 459 at Page ID # 15616].

However, the motion for summary judgment is styled on the docket as having been filed by both YEI and Yoe. The Court previously referred to the motion for summary judgment as having been filed by \"Plaintiffs\" due to the styling on the docket; the Court will therefore continue to refer to the motion as having been filed by \"Plaintiffs,\" for simplicity's sake.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-254\">\n    The Court notes that Plaintiffs do not seek summary judgment on any claims relating to Game Knits.

In addition, the Lanham Act is only mentioned once in their 25-page brief filed in support in their motion, and then only in the context of Defendants' now-abandoned laches defense [Doc. 326 at Page ID # 6283].
