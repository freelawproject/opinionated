According to the County, because the scheme was and remains concentrated in heavily minority neighborhoods, Wells Fargo has violated\n   Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203601\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , more commonly known as the Fair Housing Act (\"FHA\").

Doc. 106 at \u00b6 26. Beginning in the late 1990s, in an effort to increase profits, Wells Fargo (and Wachovia, which Wells Fargo acquired in 2008,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30) developed a practice known as \"equity stripping.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3-7, 77, 92, 105-106, 275. Wells Fargo pooled and securitized the loans it originated while retaining fee-generating mortgage servicing rights, and it maximized its fees by imposing onerous loan terms without regard to borrowers' ability to repay the loans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 79-80, 89, 97, 103, 105, 109, 111, 274. From 2010 to 2013, for instance, Wells Fargo earned over $2.6 billion in late charges and ancillary fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 121. Wells Fargo's equity-stripping practice continues through the present day in the form of nonprime lending, mortgage servicing, and loan default and foreclosure-related\n   activities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 93, 120, 272, 276, 292, 385.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Equity stripping begins with the origination of \"high cost,\" \"subprime,\" or other \"nonprime\" mortgages, which permits Wells Fargo to charge substantially higher origination fees and then substantially higher service fees over the life of the loan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 86, 92, 102, 104. Those mortgages often allow the borrower to pay only the monthly interest accruing on the loan or to make only minimum payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 126. Equity stripping continues through loan servicing, as Wells Fargo receives income from both prepayment fees and late payment fees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 7, 91-92, 102. Equity stripping culminates in default and foreclosure, as borrowers pay additional fees and ultimately see their equity eliminated.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9, 91-92, 102.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Wells Fargo's equity-stripping practice targeted minority borrowers in Cook County.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 6, 54, 80-81, 166, 187-188, 229, 293-300, 311. Publicly available loan origination data indicates that the percentage of high-cost and other nonprime loans issued by Wells Fargo in Cook County to minority borrowers well exceeded the County's percentage of minority home owners-typically by a factor of two to three.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 297-309. Because minority borrowers \"provided the quickest and easiest path ... for [Wells Fargo] to originate as many loans as possible as rapidly as possible to borrowers most likely to accept ... less favorable terms,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 164, Wells Fargo subjected minority borrowers to equity stripping to a greater extent than it did nonminority borrowers with similar credit histories,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 80, 154. Minority borrowers were particularly susceptible to Wells Fargo's predatory practices because they were more likely than nonminority borrowers to lack access to low-cost credit, relationships with banks and other traditional depository institutions, and adequate comparative financial information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 162.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   As part of its equity-stripping practice, Wells Fargo granted employees discretion to steer prime-eligible minority borrowers into nonprime loans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 81, 150, 183-186, 197-199, 212, 227, 229, 231, 243-244, 435. Wells Fargo employees encouraged minority borrowers otherwise eligible for prime loans to limit the documentation they provided concerning their income and assets, to take out larger loans than they needed, and to avoid making down payments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 246-248. This resulted in minority borrowers paying \"materially higher costs, discretionary fees, [and] materially higher monthly mortgage payments ... than similarly situated non-minority borrowers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 266. Wells Fargo employees also failed to advise prime-eligible minority borrowers of their prime-eligible status.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 246.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Wells Fargo compensated employees with bonuses and commissions for offering minority borrowers higher than published loan rates and for approving them for loans for which they were not qualified based on their employment, income, or credit history.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 150, 183, 197-199, 205, 227, 229, 243-244. Wells Fargo reserved the right to discipline employees who failed to issue a certain quantity of nonprime loans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 184. In addition, Wells Fargo incorporated unfavorable terms, excessive fees, and prepayment penalties into mortgage loans to minority borrowers; based loans to minority borrowers on inflated or fraudulent appraisals; encouraged minority borrowers to inflate their stated income; fraudulently entered income data into the company's underwriting software; repeatedly refinanced loans to minority borrowers; and included loan terms and conditions that made it difficult for minority borrowers\n   to reduce their debt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 152, 255-256, 259-260.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   To further its equity-stripping practice, Wells Fargo maintained a \"Diverse Segments\" unit, whose responsibility was to increase the number of loans made to minority borrowers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 167-182. The unit had access to a wealth of relevant demographic data and typically worked closely with realtors and community organizations to target potential customers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 162-182, 187. The data enabled Wells Fargo to customize its marketing materials to African-Americans.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 188. Wells Fargo paid bonuses to employees in the Diverse Segments unit based on the number of loans they made to minority borrowers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 183.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Discrimination in administering Wells Fargo's equity-stripping practice continued into the loan-servicing process, including its evaluation and processing of loan modification requests and its handling of defaulted loans through default work-outs and foreclosure proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 272-273, 295. Wells Fargo retained the discretion to modify loans in default and to foreclose on properties with defaulted mortgages and, pursuant to that discretion, \"routinely charged marked-up fees to minority borrowers, including in connection with repayment plans, reinstatements, payoffs, bankruptcy plans, and foreclosures.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 273. Wells Fargo also discriminated against minority borrowers by failing to process requests for loan modifications; failing to notify borrowers of the documentation required to process such requests and of the reasons for denying them; wrongfully denying modification applications; failing to process borrower delinquencies or defaults, including failing to apply payments or maintain accurate account information; providing false information to borrowers during the loan modification process; and charging improper fees for default-related loan servicing and foreclosure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 276, 279-280. Upon foreclosure, Wells Fargo charged additional fees for post-foreclosure services, including inspection and maintenance of the property, whether or not it actually rendered those services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 393. Wells Fargo continues to the present day to discriminate against minorities in determining whether to make mortgage modifications and in the foreclosure process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 390-391, 439, 444-449, 462.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In sum, minority borrowers paid more for loans, were disproportionately subjected to prepayment penalties and other fees, and experienced default, vacancy, and foreclosure at higher rates than comparable nonminority borrowers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 80, 88, 234, 266-267. In 2007, for instance, Wells Fargo charged African-American borrowers approximately $2,000 and Hispanic borrowers approximately $1,200 more in fees than similarly situated white borrowers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 230. Moreover, Wells Fargo \"knew ... that the mortgage loan products they originated or funded, securitized and serviced, contained predatory terms, were underwritten in a predatory manner, and were targeted to and/or disproportionately impacted FHA protected minority borrowers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 140, 151;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 231.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Wells Fargo's equity-stripping practice has disproportionately and disparately impacted communities in Cook County with relatively higher concentrations of minority homeowners.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 285, 289, 319-320, 339-345, 381, 383, 385, 434, 437. Communities with higher rates of minority homeownership have been and remain more likely than areas with lower rates of minority homeownership to experience foreclosure, and the foreclosure rate in different neighborhoods increases as the percentage of minority homeowners increases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 10, 340-344. From November 2012 to November 2014, almost 70\n   percent of Wells Fargo's foreclosures in Cook County were in areas with more than 50 percent minority homeownership.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 342-343. From June 2015 to April 2017, that figure fell modestly to approximately 60 percent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 344.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Wells Fargo's equity-stripping practice has resulted in certain discrete harms to Cook County.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 269, 395. Among those harms are the direct costs to the Cook County Sheriff's Office of posting eviction and foreclosure notices; registering, inspecting, and securing foreclosed or abandoned properties; serving foreclosure summonses; and executing evictions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 23, 395, 404, 420. The County's harms also include the costs of administering an increased number of foreclosure suits in the Circuit Court of Cook County.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 23, 395, 404. There were approximately 131,000 more foreclosure filings in Cook County from 2006-2013 than over the prior eight-year period, a 68 percent increase.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. Additional harms to the County include increased demand for other services, including housing counseling; reduced property tax revenue and property transfer and recording fees; and a broad destabilization of minority communities that has deprived it of its racial balance and stability through the \"segregative effects of the increased foreclosures and vacant properties\" created by equity stripping.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 23, 376, 381, 386-388, 395, 406-409, 413, 420. Homeowners in majority-minority communities are more likely than homeowners elsewhere in Cook County to have negative equity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 381-82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Those harms were foreseeable, insofar as Wells Fargo steered borrowers toward loans that did not require verification of basic underwriting data, including employment or income, and thus that were \"destined to fail.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 52, 435. In particular, Wells Fargo knew that borrowers targeted under the equity-stripping practice would have difficulty repaying their loans and were, as a result, at greater risk of foreclosure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The operative complaint brings both disparate impact and disparate treatment claims under the FHA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 433-465.

Wells Fargo thus allegedly determined not only the number of homes in Cook County that would end up in default, but also the number that would end up in foreclosure-thereby triggering certain obligations on the County's part, including posting foreclosure and eviction notices, serving foreclosure summonses, executing evictions, and processing foreclosure suits.

Wells Fargo points to no other precedent, and the court is aware of none, suggesting that a stated policy of rewarding employees for exercising only certain forms of discretion may not ground disparate impact liability under the FHA. Moreover, the complaint alleges nothing to suggest that Wells Fargo employees ever directed minority borrowers into\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   favorable loans where it was possible to direct them into\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   favorable ones.

Even so, the complaint goes so far as to plausibly allege that Wells Fargo's equity-stripping practice-the relevant policy here-was facially race-neutral. As Cook County alleges, equity stripping relies primarily on charging borrowers higher fees at all stages of a loan's life cycle, and then preventing borrowers from getting out from underneath these onerous loan terms by denying their modification requests. Doc. 106 at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 7, 272-276. The County alleges further that minority borrowers were particularly \"susceptible\" to equity stripping, insofar as they were more likely to lack access to low cost credit, strong relationships with banks, and comparative financial information.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 162. Moreover, the complaint alleges that, due to \"historical housing patterns and segregation,\" communities with concentrated minority populations \"provided an efficient means for [Wells Fargo] to target potential borrowers.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 163. The complaint concludes that minority borrowers \"provided the quickest and easiest path ... for [Wells Fargo] to originate as many loans as rapidly as possible to borrowers most likely to accept the less favorable terms of [their] mortgage loan products.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 164.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Cook County thus presents the following plausible, coherent narrative. As the complaint alleges, Wells Fargo did not \"set out to discriminate\" against minority borrowers\n   in designing and implementing equity stripping, as would be the case in a disparate treatment claim.\n   <em>\n    City of Joliet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324323\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/827/#p830\">\n    825 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   829 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Inclusive Cmtys.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591002\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2507/\">\n    135 S.

Rather, to the extent that Wells Fargo sought out minority borrowers as part of the equity-stripping practice, it was pursuant to a facially neutral policy of identifying and targeting vulnerable borrowers-those that would be most likely to accept fee-generating, unfavorable loan terms. That is, minority status served for Wells Fargo, not as an explicit basis for discrimination, but as an easy heuristic to identify those borrowers that could most easily be channeled into the kinds of loans that maximized the fee revenue central to its profit model. In this way, the County plausibly suggests that the weight of the equity-stripping practice \"f[e]ll more harshly on one group than another,\" even if did not arise from a \"subjective intent to discriminate.\"\n   <em>\n    Raytheon Co. v.

And here, the County plainly advances two alternative theories of liability under the FHA-disparate treatment and disparate impact. Doc. 106 at \u00b6\u00b6 433-456 (alleging disparate impact), \u00b6\u00b6 457-465 (alleging that Wells Fargo's conduct was intentional and thus constitutes disparate treatment).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Third, as\n   <em>\n    Inclusive Communities\n   </em>\n   also requires, and as explained above, Wells Fargo's equity-stripping practice has the requisite causal connection to the statistical disparity. In particular, Cook County alleges that key aspects of the practice, including Wells Fargo's refusal to grant loan modification requests made by distressed borrowers, pushed borrowers into foreclosure in a manner resulting in statistical disparities. Doc. 106 at \u00b6\u00b6 334-345. Put otherwise, the County alleges that minority borrowers were disproportionately more likely, given their baseline rates of homeownership, to be subject to equity stripping than nonminority borrowers.
