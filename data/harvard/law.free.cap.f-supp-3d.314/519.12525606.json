Assuming President Trump's tweet is referring to the Post's article about a covert CIA program, his statement that the \"facts on [his] ending massive, dangerous, and wasteful payments to Syrian rebels fighting Assad\" were \"fabricated\" by the Journal is a far cry from an official statement on whether\n   or not the existence or non-existence of the program remains classified. Similarly, President Trump's comments to the Journal do not make any reference to classifying or declassifying information.

The D.C.

There is no suggestion that President Trump's tweet or statements to the Journal were sourced directly from the records requested by the Times. Though President Trump's statements need not exactly match the records requested per\n   <em>\n    New York Times Co.\n   </em>\n   , i.e., he does not need to read from the records to publically acknowledge them, there needs to be some evidence that his statements were based on the records requested for there to be an official acknowledgment under the\n   <em>\n    Wolf\n   </em>\n   line of reasoning. But, whether the facts resemble\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   is a closer question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   , the statements of public officials regarding drone strikes were unambiguous and specific. For example, President Obama stated that \"a lot of these strikes have been ... going after al Qaeda suspects,\" and then counterterrorism advisor John Brennan stated that \"the United States Government conducts targeted strikes ... sometimes using remotely piloted aircraft ....\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n    710 F.3d at 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, President Trump's tweet does not unambiguously state that there is a program to arm and train Syrian rebels; rather President Trump's tweet broadly alleges that the Post \"fabricated the facts\" regarding his ending such a program. Furthermore, his tweet does not specify which facts were fabricated, including whether a CIA program existed in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Plaintiffs ask the Court to infer from President Trump's description of the program as \"massive, dangerous, and wasteful\" that President Trump must be referring to a program that existed. Pls.' Mem. Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 13, ECF No. 13. But, these adjectives could just as easily be the President relaying what he believed to be the Post's \"fabricated\" characterization the program.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is sufficient ambiguity here that the specificity and matching requirements under\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   are not met. Even if a perfect match is not required, President Trump's tweet does not confirm the existence of the records being requested let alone the program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Next, President Trump's statements to the Journal are similarly ambiguous and lack the requisite specificity to be considered\n   an official acknowledgment. In his interview with the Journal, President Trump, while discussing his frustration with \"intelligence leaks,\" referenced (1) an article in the Post about Syria; (2) that a decision was made by \"people\"; (3) that it was something he was not \"involved in\"; and (4) that the weapons, presumably referenced in the article, were actually being given to al-Qaeda. The CIA argues that reading President Trump's statements here to mean that \"weapons intended for Syrian rebels had ended up in the hands of al-Qaeda,\" as the Times' asserts, requires the Court to impute to the President words that he did not say. Def.'s Reply Supp. Mot. Summ. J. 10, ECF No. 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court agrees that President Trump's statements did not confirm the existence of a program to arm Syrian rebels; he did not clarify what exactly a decision had to be made about or who made the alleged decision; and he did not clarify why there were weapons being given out, to whom the weapons were given, or the manner in which they were given.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n    710 F.3d at 429-431\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding official acknowledgement where the CIA Director's statements made assurances regarding the \"precision of targeted drone strikes, the level of collateral damage they cause, and their usefulness in comparison to other weapons and tactics.\"). As a result, his statements to the Journal do not constitute an official acknowledgement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Even accounting the Times' contention that President Trump's statements officially acknowledge the existence of a covert program to arm and train Syrian rebels, Second Circuit law still permits the CIA to issue a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response. In\n   <em>\n    Wilner\n   </em>\n   , the Second Circuit held that even if a program is officially disclosed in general,\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   responses may be invoked \"with respect to aspects of the program that have not been the subject of such disclosures.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5686855\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/592/60/#p71\">\n    592 F.3d at 70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, a general acknowledgment of the existence of a program alone does not wholesale waive an agency's ability to invoke\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   where certain aspects of the program remain undisclosed. In\n   <em>\n    Wilner\n   </em>\n   , plaintiffs sought records regarding any surveillance conducted under the widely officially acknowledged Terrorist Surveillance Program (\"TSP\"), but the court held that while the TSP was officially acknowledged, \"the specific methods used, targets of surveillance, and information obtained through the program [had] not been disclosed,\" and therefore a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response was permissible.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5686855\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/592/60/#p71\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5686855\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/592/60/#p71\">\n    at 69-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Plaintiffs' interpretation of the facts may generate a viable argument under the D.C. Circuit's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   , as in that case even the general acknowledgment that the U.S. engaged in drone strikes by government officials was sufficient for the court to hold there was official acknowledgment that overcame the CIA's\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response. Under\n   <em>\n    Wilner\n   </em>\n   , however, Plaintiffs would need to point to more than President Trump's general statements regarding a program to arm and train Syrian rebels; there would need to be official acknowledgment that the CIA operated said program for the Times's request for records from the CIA to be viable under Second Circuit law. As this was not the case here, i.e., the CIA's involvement if any was not officially disclosed, the Court holds that President Trump's statements do not overcome Defendant's\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    \"Public Disclosure\"\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Plaintiffs' final basis for summary judgment is that \"U.S. Special Operations Commander Tony Thomas independently confirmed the existence of the covert government program[,] ...

Shiner, an Information Review Officer for the CIA, in support of its claim under Exemption 1.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Antoinette B. Shiner, ECF No. 11 (\"Shiner Decl.\"); Supplemental Declaration of Antoinette B. Shiner, ECF No. 18 (\"Shiner Supplemental Decl.\"). The Court holds that the Shiner's declarations thoroughly demonstrate the information requested falls within Exemption 1 with reasonably specific detail. At the outset, Shiner, who has original classification authority and is authorized to conduct classification reviews, states that confirming the existence of responsive records related to a covert operation to arm Syrian rebels \"would confirm the existence and the focus of a sensitive Agency activity that is by definition kept hidden to protect U.S. government policy objectives,\" while denying their existence would \"confirm the absence of specific foreign policy objective ... or the Agency's inability to successfully carry out the purported operational activities ....\" Shiner Decl. \u00b6 15. Therefore, Shiner concludes, \"any substantive response would reveal sensitive information about the CIA's intelligence sources, methods, and activities that is protected from disclosure under Exemption 1.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In response to Plaintiffs' criticism that Shiner's Declaration in support of Exemption 1 is conclusory and lacks specificity, Pls.' Mem. Supp. Summ. J. 18, Shiner's Supplemental Declaration explains that disclosing the existence or nonexistence of responsive records would (1) \"reveal whether or not the United States Government exercised extraordinary legal authorities to covertly influence the political, economic, and/or military conditions in Syria[;]\" (2) \"compromise specific foreign policy goal[s] ... or serve as confirmation for U.S. adversaries that there was no such objective[;]\" and (3) assuming the CIA had a covert program, \"would tend to reveal the Agency's capabilities, intelligence and regional interests, accesses, funding, and relationships or lack thereof,\" which adversaries \"can exploit ... to build a more accurate picture of the CIA's activities ... impair[ing] the effectiveness of [the] CIA's intelligence operations.\" Shiner Supplemental Decl. \u00b6 5. Given the relative high degree of deference an agency is entitled to in this context, the Court finds that the reasons articulated in the Shiner Declarations justify Defendant's\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response to Plaintiff pursuant to the FOIA Exemption 1.
