The County claims that HSBC discriminatorily targeted minority homeowners in Cook County with high-priced predatory subprime mortgage loans and has serviced and foreclosed on those loans in a discriminatory manner. According to the County, these business practices harmed the County by imposing on it out-of-pocket costs for governmental eviction and foreclosure processes, as well as for various social services for evicted homeowners. The County also alleges it lost out on property tax income from foreclosed, abandoned, and vacant properties, as well as neighboring properties, and income from property recording taxes, intangible taxes, and transfer fees. The County also asserts that HSBC's practices injured the fabric of its communities and caused general urban blight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   HSBC moves to dismiss the County's Second Amended Complaint (\"Complaint\").

With these principles in mind, we turn to the County's claims in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The County's Alleged Injuries\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As HSBC sees it, the various injuries alleged by the County are too attenuated from HSBC's alleged discriminatory loan origination practices to satisfy the proximate cause requirement under the FHA. It is simply too \"speculative,\" HSBC argues, to believe that the purported predatory lending practices would inexorably lead to increased foreclosures, or that such foreclosures would lead to vacant lots and urban blight, much less result in additional costs to the County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   For its part, the County counters that HSBC focuses too myopically on its origination activities, while ignoring the other components of the alleged predatory lending program, such as HSBC's discriminatory servicing, loss mitigation, and foreclosure practices, which are more closely linked to the resulting foreclosures and alleged harms. And, where the relationship between the harms and the challenged conduct may be more attenuated, the County urges the Court to be mindful of the statutory purposes of the FHA, which are broader and more remedial than those of RICO and the Clayton Act. To HSBC, it is the County that engages in a sleight of hand, and HSBC argues that the Complaint lacks any allegations that it discriminated against minority borrowers in servicing loans and prosecuting foreclosures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   But the Complaint does assert that HSBC engaged in loan servicing and foreclosure-related practices that discriminated against minorities. For example, the County alleges that HSBC engaged in discriminatory loan servicing and loss mitigation practices that resulted in more foreclosures for minority borrowers as compared to nonminority borrowers.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 292. The County also claims that HSBC discriminated against minority borrowers in the way it handled the resulting foreclosure proceedings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046606\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/396/#p403\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, the County supports these claims with preliminary HMDA data indicating-at least in the County's eyes-that HSBC foreclosed on minorities at higher rates than similarly situated white homeowners.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 262-305.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   What is more, according to the County, HSBC's racially discriminatory loan servicing and loss mitigation practices were \"part and parcel\" of its overall predatory lending scheme directed at minority communities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d Am.

Ga. Sept. 25, 2013) (describing complaint as alleging that foreclosure and loan servicing were \"the last component\" of a discriminatory subprime lending program). In short, as portrayed in Counts I and II, HSBC engaged in a comprehensive equity-stripping program targeted at minority borrowers by engaging in predatory loan origination practices as well as discriminatory loan servicing practices (including less-favorable loss mitigation and race-based foreclosure practices), all of which resulted in more foreclosures for minority borrowers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d Am.

That left open the possibility that the foreclosures in Miami could have been caused by a wide array of factors outside of the lenders' control. In contrast, here, the County has pointed to HSBC's purportedly discriminatory loan servicing, loss-mitigation, and foreclosure practices, which the County contends are more directly linked to the greater number of foreclosures experienced by minority borrowers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   From this, the question becomes whether the County alleges a sufficiently direct relationship between HBSC's conduct and the various injuries it claims it has suffered. As explained below, the Court concludes that several of the County's claimed injuries are too attenuated from HBSC's challenged conduct to proceed, while others bear a sufficiently direct relationship to the alleged wrongs to survive HSBC's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Certain \"Out-of-Pocket\" Costs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The County asserts that it has suffered damages in the form of certain out-of-pocket costs, including the costs associated with serving eviction notices, conducting judicial and administrative foreclosure procedures, and registering and inspecting foreclosed homes. Assuming the truth of the County's allegations, the relationship between HSBC's discriminatory actions (such as its servicing and foreclosure practices related to minority borrowers' loans) and these additional costs is clear: HSBC's discriminatory conduct forced more minority borrowers into foreclosure proceedings, and this caused the County to incur more foreclosure-related costs than it would have otherwise.

Additionally, the County plausibly alleges that statistical analysis of data obtained from HSBC in discovery will allow it to prove which of HSBC's foreclosures were discriminatory and that it can tally its out-of-pocket expenses for those foreclosures.\n   <em>\n    Cf., e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Hartford Computer Grp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3119054\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/539/681/#p688\">\n    539 F.3d at 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that indirect injuries are likely to present difficulty in assessing and attributing damages). Of course, discovery may reveal otherwise, but the County's allegations as to these particular out-of-pocket damages are sufficient to survive the pleading stage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Costs of Social Services to Foreclosed Homeowners\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The County's claim for the costs of social services it provided to foreclosed minority homeowners is more complicated. Whether and to what extent the County needs to provide services to foreclosed homeowners presumably depends on a multitude of factors individual to each homeowner. For example, some borrowers may have had other assets, continuing employment, or access to funds that allowed them enough money for housing, food, and other necessities, even after foreclosure. Others may have decided to move out of the County altogether looking for better opportunities. Still others may have faced dire financial and personal hardship as a result of the discriminatory practices and required a great deal of County assistance. Whatever the case, to the extent that the County incurred additional costs for social services, such injuries are derivative of the injury that HSBC caused to the minority borrowers themselves and, therefore, insufficient to satisfy the directness requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mendelovitz v.

That said, the goal of deterring similar discriminatory conduct would be adequately served in this case, even if the County could not recover its costs of social services to foreclosed homeowners. The County has other viable claims of injury, and HSBC will be subjected to significant discovery, as well as the risk of significant financial loss and public disrepute. Therefore, expanding proximate cause beyond the traditional \"first step\" for this claim would only marginally, if at all, increase deterrence and would likely be outweighed by the difficulties of establishing causation as outlined above. Accordingly, HSBC's motion to dismiss as to the County's claim for increased social services costs is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Loss of Property Tax Revenue from Foreclosed Properties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The County's claim for lost property tax revenue on HSBC-foreclosed properties\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   fares no better. To the extent the County is alleging that it suffered because HSBC's conduct harmed minority borrowers by causing unnecessary foreclosures and, as a result, the minority borrowers no longer paid property taxes to the County, this claim falls squarely within the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Hemi\n   </em>\n   . The harms caused by HSBC to the minority borrowers were direct, while the injury of unpaid taxes to the County was indirect. Indeed, there could be a number of intervening factors that would need to be accounted for. For example, some homeowners may have been behind in paying their real estate taxes (due to financial difficulties) even before the foreclosures. There could be instances where the property was purchased soon after the foreclosure and any outstanding property taxes were then paid. There could be instances where the servicing company paid the outstanding property taxes post-foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   These are just a few illustrations of the indirectness of the County's harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   To the extent the County's claim of injury from lower tax revenue is predicated not on a homeowner's failure to pay, but rather on a diminishment in a property's value post-foreclosure, this introduces significant concerns about measuring the diminishment in value attributable to HSBC's conduct, as opposed to other external factors, such as the state of the general real estate market and the demand for houses on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    James Cape &amp; Sons Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046606\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/396/#p403\">\n    453 F.3d at 403-04\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[Plaintiff] cannot show what portion of its 'lost market share' is attributable to the bids lost to the bid-rigging scheme\");\n   <em>\n    Cty. of Cook v.

Loss of Property Tax Revenue from Abandoned and Vacant Properties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The County also seeks to recover lost tax revenue from abandoned or vacant properties. Because the County distinguishes these properties from foreclosed properties,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 321, the Court presumes that the County refers to abandoned or vacant properties in the vicinity of homes foreclosed upon by HSBC. The County's causation theory as to these properties is similarly unilluminated by the Complaint, and it is unclear how HSBC's conduct would be the but-for cause of the failure or inability of these homeowners to pay their property taxes. And, to the extent the County's claim of injury from lower tax revenue might instead be predicated on a diminishment in the value of these properties, this claim too raises a myriad of possible intervening causes. HSBC's motion to dismiss this claim of injury is accordingly granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    5. Loss of \"Various Revenue\" from Abandoned or Vacant Properties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Additionally, the County seeks to recover for a loss of unspecified \"various revenue\" (separate from property tax revenue) from abandoned or foreclosed properties.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362259\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/115/909/#p920\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But it is unclear from the Complaint exactly what the County means by \"various revenue,\" and the Court is unable to determine if this injury falls within the scope of proximate cause of HSBC's alleged conduct. Thus, HSBC's motion to dismiss this claim of injury is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    6. Diminution of Property Values of Other Homes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   If the administrative difficulty in measuring and apportioning to the County the damages from a reduction in property value on HSBC-foreclosed homes appears daunting, the difficulties with surrounding homes is all the more so.

Costs of Demolishing Foreclosed Homes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The County asks the Court to award it the costs it incurred in demolishing homes of minority borrowers that were subject to HSBC foreclosures. But the County's decision to demolish a home also may be dependent upon any of number intervening factors, such as the condition\n   of the house pre-foreclosure, whether the home was vandalized or otherwise in disrepair post-foreclosure while it was waiting sale, and the strength of the local housing market.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    James Cape &amp; Sons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046606\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/396/#p403\">\n    453 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   403-04 ;\n   <em>\n    Cty. of Cook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362259\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/115/909/#p920\">\n    115 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   920 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hartford Computer Grp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3119054\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/539/681/#p688\">\n    539 F.3d at 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, the Complaint does not provide any description of how HSBC's alleged conduct led to the demolitions. Accordingly, HSBC's motion to dismiss claims as to this injury is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    8. Urban Blight\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The County also seeks damages for the \"necessary reallocation\" of its resources and other injuries to the fabric of its communities arising from \"the resulting urban blight.\" 2d Am. Compl. \u00b6 33. But the line from HSBC's alleged discriminatory conduct to \"urban blight\" winds through too many other potential causes-such as the economic downturn in 2008, the general state of the communities before and after the foreclosures at issue, and the impact of the Great Recession on these communities-to satisfy the proximate cause requirement. HSBC's motion to dismiss this claim of injury is accordingly granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    9. Recording, Transfer, and Intangible Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Lastly, the County claims that it lost recording, transfer, and intangible fees due to HSBC's practice of using the MERS database to track, transfer and trade mortgage loans in furtherance of its discriminatory scheme.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 204-13. Assuming that HSBC's use of the MERS database was improper, the County states a squarely direct relationship between HSBC's use of the MERS database and the County's resulting loss of recording income. As such, HSBC's motion to dismiss as to these injuries is denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Summary of Proximate Cause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In sum, the Court holds that the County has plausibly alleged that the additional costs that it incurred to serve eviction notices, conduct judicial and administrative foreclosure procedures, and register and inspect foreclosed homes were proximately caused by HSBC's alleged discriminatory conduct. Additionally, the County has also plausibly alleged that its loss of recording, transfer, and intangible tax income were proximately caused by HSBC's allegedly improper use of MERS as part of its predatory lending program. HSBC's motion to dismiss the County's other alleged injuries is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The County's Disparate-Treatment Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   HSBC also seeks to dismiss the County's disparate-treatment claim. Defs.'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Mem. Supp. at 3 n.3. In doing so, HSBC asserts in a cursory footnote that the County's disparate-treatment allegations \"fail to meet applicable pleading standards.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   To find its argument, HSBC refers the Court to its motion to dismiss the County's Amended Complaint, ECF No. 49-1, which preceded the Complaint now before the Court. In that motion, HSBC argued that the County had not pleaded a disparate-treatment claim because it had alleged that HSBC's objective was to \"maximize profits\" rather than to render adverse effects upon an identifiable group. Defs.' Mem. Supp. Mot. Dismiss Am. Compl. at 19. In effect, HSBC asks the Court to import its argument from a prior motion to dismiss and apply it to the County's substantially revised 397-paragraph Complaint, which,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , includes a new, standalone disparate-treatment claim (Count III).

First, it contends that the County failed to identify any particular policy employed by HSBC that caused a disparate impact to minority borrowers. But the Complaint is replete with examples of HSBC policies that, according to the County, resulted in a disparate impact on minority borrowers. These include: HSBC's mortgage lending and services policies; pricing and marketing policies; various underwriting policies; loan servicing and loss mitigation policies; and foreclosure-related policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Undeterred, HSBC contends that much of the challenged conduct was \"discretionary\" and that \"[d]iscretion alone may not form the basis of a disparate impact claim.\" Defs.'

But the Complaint includes many policies that were not completely discretionary, and to the extent HSBC employees were given a degree of discretion to implement these policies in any individual instance, a uniform grant of discretion can form the basis of a disparate impact claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

But even assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that statistics from multiple mortgage lenders would be insufficient, HSBC's argument is incorrect.

R. Civ. P. 8(d)(2). Second, although a plaintiff is not required to explicitly allege, or, ultimately, to prove intent as part of a disparate-impact theory, a plaintiff is not precluded from doing so. In fact, one of the factors that a court considers to determine whether a plaintiff has made a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   disparate impact case is \"the presence of some evidence of discriminatory intent, even if circumstantial and less than sufficient to satisfy\" the standards required for disparate treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Metro.
