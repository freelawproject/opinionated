Welser (\"Welser\" or \"defendant\"), the man plaintiff hired to operate the restaurant during the summer 2017 tourist season.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   According to TIPC's six-count complaint, Welser improperly associated himself with plaintiff's unregistered trademark in violation of the Lanham Act and related state law when he offered for sale unauthorized merchandise bearing The Guzzle's name and logo. Plaintiff also alleges defendant breached various aspects of the parties' written agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Welser has moved to dismiss TIPC's Lanham Act claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\"Rule\") 12(b)(6). Plaintiff opposes and has moved under Rule 15 seeking leave to amend its complaint in the event defendant's motion is granted. Both motions were fully briefed and oral argument was heard on June 6, 2018 in Utica, New York. Decision was reserved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   TIPC owns and operates Thousand Island Park, a family-oriented summer community established nearly 150 years ago on Wellesley Island in Jefferson County, New York (the \"Park\"). Plaintiff maintains the Park's grounds and provides various services to the yearly guests who lease the 300 or so seasonal cottages located on the island.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Historically, TIPC's operations included an ice cream shop and candy store known as \"The Guzzle,\" which was located in a multi-use commercial building first erected on the island in 1913. After a fire consumed the original structure in the summer of 2014, plaintiff decided to rebuild and expand its operations to include a deli / restaurant, ice cream shop, candy store, and small grocery store (the \"Building\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 3, 2017, TIPC entered into a written concession agreement (the \"Agreement\") with Welser, a resident of nearby Watertown, New York, which granted defendant the right to use the newly reconstructed Building to operate an \"Ice Cream Soda Fountain/Lunchroom and Grocery Store ... [that] shall be known and advertised as\" The Guzzle. A copy of the Agreement is attached to the complaint as Exhibit A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In addition to a $6,000 concession fee, the Agreement imposed a variety of obligations on Welser-among other things, it required him to operate The Guzzle between certain dates and for certain hours, to maintain the cleanliness of the restaurant, and to pay for all gas and electricity bills incurred during the summer season. And while the Agreement contemplated a three-year period, it expressly provided that the parties would sit down and re-negotiate after the first year of operations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In addition, the Agreement permitted TIPC to terminate the parties' arrangement \"in the exercise of its sole discretion\" if Welser committed an \"egregious, unremedied misstep,\" created a nuisance \"not cured after written notice in 15 days,\" or was otherwise responsible for any failure to abide by Park rules and regulations that went \"unremedied after notice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   TIPC completed construction of the Building just in time for the summer, and Welser opened The Guzzle for Memorial Day Weekend of 2017. However, in early July plaintiff notified defendant in writing of certain \"feedback\" from Park residents that plaintiff wanted \"addressed as-soon-as [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] possible.\" For instance, plaintiff indicated defendant should start selling \"milk and other dairy products,\" offering \"full pizzas,\" and generally doing a better job cleaning the interior and exterior of the Building. A copy of this request for \"Concession Enhancements\" is attached to the complaint as Exhibit B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 10, 2017, Welser responded to TIPC's letter with one of his own. Defendant's letter indicated that he had already moved to accommodate certain requests (e.g., milk, eggs, and bread were now stocked on the shelves) and explained that some of the limitations imposed by the Building's design prevented him from taking immediate action on others (e.g., the kitchen's current layout made pizza a difficult item to add to the regular menu). Defendant's letter suggested that requests in the latter category would be better addressed during a sit-down meeting between the parties, which was slated to happen at the end of the first summer season anyway. A copy of defendant's written response is attached to the complaint as Exhibit C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Thereafter, the relationship between the parties soured. According to TIPC's complaint, in late August plaintiff received a letter from one of The Guzzle's former female employees accusing Welser of sexual harassment and other improprieties. Plaintiff also alleges defendant failed to pay for electricity and cleaning services, and reacted \"menacing[ly]\" when one of plaintiff's representatives approached him to discuss the issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After the Park closed for the season, the parties' attorneys engaged in some back-and-forth communications about whether or not Welser's operation of The Guzzle during 2017 amounted to a breach of the Agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the meantime, on December 16 defendant posted on his personal Facebook page a message and accompanying photograph:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Throw back from summer 2017 for those of you who left your extra pictures in our photo booth at the guzzle and who wanted to add to our collage. Tag a friend. Thanks for a great summer. We look forward to seeing you next year. Happy holidays.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A copy of Welser's Facebook post is attached to the complaint as Exhibit M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On December 22, 2017, TIPC's counsel sent Welser's attorney a letter entitled \"Termination of Contract\" informing defendant plaintiff had elected to terminate the Agreement \"effective January 3, 2018.\" A copy of this letter is attached to the complaint as Exhibit K.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Following receipt of this letter but before the January 3 termination date, Welser posted on December 25 a message and accompanying photograph on The Guzzle's own Facebook page:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Merry Christmas! .... Drink in the air of wonder and excitement, and let it fill your heart full of love.

According to this letter, defendant's conduct \"leads the general public to the mistaken belief that your merchandise is somehow affiliated with, offered, sponsored, or approved by\" plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The January 5 letter demanded Welser (1) immediately cease and desist his use of the tradename; (2) provide TIPC with \"a complete inventory of all product sold which bear the infringing mark,\" and (3) \"file a Certificate of Discontinuance of Assumed Name with the Jefferson County Clerk.\" Although the letter further demanded defendant \"provide written confirmation\" of these tasks within five days, plaintiff alleges defendant did not respond to, or comply with, these demands. Plaintiff also alleges \"[u]pon information and belief, defendant is still using the name The Guzzle in connection with the sale of merchandise.\" Compl. \u00b6 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"To survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the '[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ginsburg v.

May 27, 1997) (Sotomayor, J.) (\"The Lanham Act should not be used to transform a breach of contract dispute into a federal cause of action.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   This is essentially what TIPC attempted to accomplish in this case. At the outset, plaintiff's opposition memorandum suggests that the language of the disputed postings should be disregarded, at least for purposes of resolving Welser's motion to dismiss the Lanham Act claim.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Opp'n at 14-15 (characterizing as \"unsupported\" defendant's assertion that \"[h]e also offered left-over commemorative 2017 merchandise such as shirts, pint glasses and water bottles for sale\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This suggestion is rejected, since the example set forth above is drawn directly from the actual text of Exhibit L to the complaint. Of course, TIPC was not required to attach this (or any other) exhibit to its pleading. Plaintiff could have chosen instead to base this action on just the allegations recited in its complaint. But where, as here, a party chooses to attach documents to a pleading and relies on them in bringing suit, consideration of those exhibits become fair game on a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Turning to this material, the two social media posts in question were made on December 16 and 25, and both occurred before the Agreement's January 3 termination date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   At oral argument, TIPC's counsel invited the Court to infer the contract may have terminated at an earlier juncture, such as on December 22 when plaintiff transmitted to Welser's counsel the letter entitled \"Termination of Contract.\" Yet this letter, attached as Exhibit K to the complaint, clearly states plaintiff's intention to terminate the Agreement \"effective January 3, 2018.\" There is no reason to conclude plaintiff meant anything other than what it specifically chose to say in that correspondence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Further, a review of the Agreement gives force to Welser's contention that it contemplates no limitation on the time, place, form, or extent of any advertising that might occur during its effective period. To the contrary, the Agreement includes only broad, unrestricted language permitting defendant to operate a facility that shall be \"known and advertised as\" The Guzzle. Although it does not provide for any formal licensing or advertising arrangement, neither does it explicitly attempt to control defendant's usage of the tradename.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Even assuming otherwise, it is implausible that reasonably prudent consumers were likely to be confused by the two posts that TIPC finds so vexatious. The December 16 post on Welser's own, personal Facebook page is at best a backward-looking, generalized expression of gratitude toward\n   those customers who patronized The Guzzle during the summer 2017 season.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   To accept TIPC's assertion that this first post plausibly violated the Lanham Act; i.e., that this post probably confused numerous ordinary, prudent purchasers into forming the false impression defendant would be operating The Guzzle in 2018 because defendant stated that he \"look[ed] forward to seeing [customers] next year,\" risks transforming a whole range of hopeful comments made during failed business negotiations into Lanham Act claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The second posting presents a closer question simply by virtue of the fact that it purports to offer for sale \"\n   <em>\n    commemorative\n   </em>\n   2017 merchandise\" rather than just expressing gratitude to The Guzzle's summer patrons. But neither TIPC's complaint nor the attached exhibits offer any plausible\n   <em>\n    factual\n   </em>\n   basis on which to infer that Welser offered for sale any merchandise beyond the January 3 termination date. Indeed, nowhere is it even alleged that any transactions of any merchandise actually occurred.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 53-58. And upon questioning at oral argument, plaintiff's counsel was unable to offer any additional factual material that might be added to the complaint to shore up these deficiencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In essence, TIPC's Lanham Act claim is premised on a single social media post made before the Agreement's effective end date joined with a conclusory assertion that Welser might still be up to no good. Compl. \u00b6 57. These accusations do not give rise to a plausible Lanham Act claim.\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p679\">\n    556 U.S. at 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p679\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[D]etermining whether a complaint states a plausible claim for relief ...

First, Local Rule 7.1(c) requires that where, as here, \"a party makes a cross-motion, it must join its cross-motion brief with its opposition brief.\" Indeed, Local Rule 7.1(c) explicitly states that \"[a] separate brief in opposition to the original motion is not permissible.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   TIPC ignored this command. For whatever reason, plaintiff instead filed the same full-length brief twice: once in opposition to defendant's motion to dismiss (ECF No. 16) and once in support of a filing that it has labeled a \"cross-motion\" to amend (ECF No. 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Second, this cross-motion violates Local Rule 7.1(a)(4), which requires the moving party to \"attach an unsigned copy of the proposed amended pleading to its motion papers.\" TIPC's attorney's affidavit attached to the motion recognizes that this is ordinarily a requirement imposed when a party files a cross-motion to amend. Bloomberg Decl. \u00b6 6. And Welser's counsel was quick to point out in his own opposition that the Local Rules do not contemplate a pleading that is \"just available on request.\" Caughlin Aff. \u00b6 4. Yet to date, plaintiff has not submitted any revised pleading for consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \"Without doubt, this circuit strongly favors liberal grant of an opportunity to replead after dismissal of a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    Porat v.
