MCFADDEN, United States District Judge\n   Plaintiff Cassandra Fairbanks trolled the web through Twitter, releasing a photo of herself and a fellow journalist in the White House press room making a gesture widely recognized as the \"okay\" hand symbol but also speculated at the time to be a \"white power\" symbol. Defendant Emma Roller, also a journalist, retweeted the photo with the caption, \"just two people doing a white power hand gesture in the White House.\" Ms. Fairbanks sued Ms. Roller for defamation.

In short,\n    <em>\n     Mann\n    </em>\n    does not align the District's anti-SLAPP statute with the Federal Rules.

And\n     <em>\n      McCaskill\n     </em>\n     addressed the verifiability of plausible characterizations.

But neither party has briefed the issue well, and Ms. Roller's interpretation of the gesture's meaning involves at least somewhat more subjectivity than a simple description of the physical gesture.
