Marbley, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter is before the Court on the Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 41) of Defendant Nautilus Insurance Company. For the reasons set forth below, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sears, Roebuck and Co. hired Plaintiff Exel Direct, Inc., to install home appliances\n   such as dryers for its customers. Exel Direct, in turn, hired independent contractors to perform the installations. From 2004 to 2008, both Exel Direct and its independent contractors were insured by a policy issued by Nautilus Insurance Company. (ECF No. 1 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On July 5, 2006, Exel oversaw the delivery of a Sears dryer to Ingrid Gauer and arranged for an independent contractor to install the dryer. (ECF No. 1 at 4). Exel's expert later concluded that the independent contract's installation was flawed: the contractor made a modification to the exhaust duct during installation that resulted in \"reduced functionality\" and resulted in susceptibility to \"exaggerated accumulations of lint in the cabinet, a first fuel for dryer fires.\" (ECF No. 41-6 at 3). On April 30, 2014, the dryer caught fire and burned down the Gauer home as well as neighboring properties, one owned by Chris and Mary Jean Lem and one owned by Juan Lago. (ECF No. 1 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   State Farm General Insurance Company insured the Gauer home, the Lem home, and the Lago home. (ECF No. 41 at 2-3). In two separate subrogation suits in the Santa Barbara Superior Court, State Farm sued Exel Direct seeking recovery for the fire damage. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Exel Direct then sought liability coverage for these suits from Nautilus. Nautilus hired Vela Insurance Services to investigate and adjust the claim. Vela concluded that the \"damages did not occur until after the Nautilus policy had expired\" and that Nautilus therefore had no defense or indemnity obligation to Exel. (ECF No. 1 at 5; 44-8 at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

As a result, Nautilus may only succeed in its Motion for Summary Judgment if it establishes that a construction that obviates liability is the only construction the contract can reasonably bear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Here, the insurance contract covers property damage only if it \"occurs during a policy period.\" (ECF No. 41-7 at 18). The parties agree that the policy lapsed in 2008 and that the fire did not occur until April 2014. Nautilus argues that the policy therefore does not cover the April 2014 fire damage and that it had no duty to defend or indemnify Exel. Straightforward enough, or so it seems. Exel counters that the \"property damage\" at issue is not the fire itself, but instead the improper installation of the dryer: \"It is alleged that the contractor improperly installed the dryer and its venting, causing a gap that compromised the integrity, function and use of the dryer. From the installation forward, allegedly accumulating lint degraded the dryers function, and a fire ultimately resulted on April 30, 2014.\" (ECF No. 41-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Nautilus' Motion for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Nautilus' Motion for Summary Judgment advances several reasons why the contract cannot reasonably bear an interpretation that would lead to Nautilus' liability. First, it argues that the faulty installation did not create \"property damage\" that \"occurred during the policy period\" under Section I(b)(2) of the Insuring Agreement. At most, it created a \"\n   <em>\n    condition\n   </em>\n   for potential future fire damage-the accumulation of lint in the dryer-but did not create latent, continuing, and progressive fire damage that later manifested itself.\" (ECF No. 48 at 2). Second, even if the faulty installation constituted \"property damage,\" it is not \"property damage\" caused by an \"occurrence\" as contemplated by the contract, because Exel was itself responsible for the installation, and under Ohio law, commercial general liability contracts do not insure against an insured's own work. (ECF No. 41 at 12). Third, it argues that even if the fire stemmed from \"property damage\" caused by an \"occurrence,\" the \"impaired property\" exclusion under the insurance contract relieves Nautilus from the duty to defend and indemnify. (ECF No. 48 at 3). Ultimately, as discussed below, this Court concludes that the contract is unambiguous: the fire was not \"property damage\" that \"occurred during a policy period.\" Nautilus therefore has neither a duty to defend nor a duty to indemnify Exel,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Court need not and declines to address Nautilus' other liability-obviating arguments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   It is well-settled under Ohio law that \"where an insurance contract limits coverage to injuries that occur during the policy period, the relevant date for triggering coverage is the date of the injuries, not the date of negligence that caused the\n   injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Fid. &amp; Guar.

Just as in\n   <em>\n    Fidelity Insurance\n   </em>\n   , the damage to the dryer itself may have \"occurred continuously, including during the policy period,\" but the injuries that the homeowners alleged in the underlying case \"occurred in one fell swoop, well outside the policy period.\" Because the injuries alleged in the underlying cases did not occur during the policy period, they do not qualify as covered property damage under the policy, and Nautilus does not owe Exel a duty to defend or indemnify as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Moreover, contrary to Exel's urging, this case is not analogous to cases such as\n   <em>\n    Cincinnati Ins.

There is no requirement that the damages 'manifest' themselves during the policy period. Rather, it is the damage itself which must occur during the policy period for coverage to be effective.\"). Here, the claimed \"property damage\" is the fire damage-not merely ongoing lint accumulation. In other words, had the underlying complaints asserted damage to the dryer, Nautilus may have been obligated to defend and indemnify as to the impairment of the dryer.
