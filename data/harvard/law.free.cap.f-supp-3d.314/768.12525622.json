While defendants appear to complain that plaintiffs have abused the state court process by filing claims against them, this is not the equivalent of showing that defendants will be denied their civil rights by the state court itself. Defendants have not alleged that they will be denied their civil rights merely by being subject to suit in state court. Moreover, even assuming that plaintiffs brought these claims against defendants solely because of their race, that is still not enough to support removal. As the Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Peacock\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   It is not enough to support removal under \u00a7 1443(1) to allege or show that the defendant's federal equal civil rights have been illegally and corruptly denied by [the opposing party] in advance of trial, that the charges against the defendant are false, or that the defendant is unable to obtain a fair trial in a particular state court. The motives of the [opposing party] bringing the charges may be corrupt, but that does not show that\n   the state trial court will find the defendant guilty if he is innocent, or that in any other manner the defendant will be 'denied or cannot enforce in the courts' of the State any right under a federal law providing for equal civil rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   86 S.Ct. at 1812. Stated another way, defendants have no federally conferred immunity from having to defend the claims that plaintiff has brought against them in state court, and the civil rights statutes upon which they rely do not confer upon them the right to engage in the specific conduct of which plaintiffs accuse them (i.e., failing to surrender possession of property that plaintiff contends they no longer own). Since defendants have failed to show that there is anything about the very act of being brought to trial in the state court that will inevitably deny them their civil rights, they have failed to show either that removal is proper or that this court has federal question jurisdiction over this action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    David &amp; Taylor Custom Pools, Inc. v.
