Introduction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   This memorandum and order addresses a question raised by defendants: has Congress exceeded its authority granted by the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution in passing the portion of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act (\"FACEA\") that protects \"place[s] of religious worship.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20248\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   FACEA was adopted in 1994 primarily to protect women seeking access to abortion services. The abortion clinic part of FACEA has been upheld as constitutional by every circuit court of appeals that has considered the issue. Late in the legislative processes, FACEA was amended to protect \"any person lawfully exercising or seeking to exercise the First Amendment right of religious freedom at a place of religious worship.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20248\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). No court, so far as this court is aware, has considered whether this religion section is constitutional. This court now finds that FACEA is a constitutional exercise of congressional Commerce Clause power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Nevertheless, the court is dubious about whether the Commerce Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3. (\"The Congress shall have Power ... [t]o regulate Commerce ... among the several States\"), permits government protection of religion by FACEA because the First Amendment, U.S. Const. amend. I (\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof\"), requires a barrier between religion and government. A specific amendment to a statute or constitution should have more force than a generalized clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   It is an anomaly of our religious jurisprudence that the basic structure of the relationship between government and religion requires government to keep its hands off religion. Yet, carrying out the disestablishment rule has not prevented a strong economic relationship between the two: religion and government. Local, state, and federal governments grant religious exemptions and aid with economic advantages,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Burwell v.

It comprises a sizable portion of the United States economy. Houses of religious worship offer numerous valuable services to their congregates, support a large number of personnel, take in and expend considerable funds, own large tracts of land, and receive free municipal services, such as schooling assistance, roads, and police protection. Huge religious educational institutions\n   operating over the internet draw students and billions of dollars in revenue from all over the country. Religion substantially contributes to our gross national product. Congress could reasonably have concluded that violence and intimidation to keep people out of houses of worship would substantially adversely affect interstate commerce. FACEA is constitutional in its design to protect that national commerce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This case arises out of a religious and political dispute between adherents of Falun Gong-a Chinese religious group-and a group of their opponents-organized under the umbrella of the Chinese Anti-Cult World Alliance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zhang Jingrong v.

Apr. 23, 2018). The People's Republic of China (\"Chinese Government\") has allegedly suppressed the practice of Falun Gong in China and is attempting to do so abroad, including in the United States.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201916617\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The parties have debated and at times been violent with one another around a temple and tables used by Falun Gong members in Queens, New York for prayer, proselytizing, and protesting against the Chinese Government's position.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201916617\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The tables used by plaintiffs to proselytize have printed materials that are said to come from outside of the state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Yuebin Yu (\"Yu Decl.\") at \u00b6 2, ECF No. 171, Ex. 2(f).

That opinion concluded that Falun Gong is a religion for the purposes of the instant case and construed the scope of FACEA. Defendants then contended that FACEA is unconstitutional. Upon examination of the statute, briefing, argument, and research, the court finds that FACEA is constitutional; it is authorized by Congress' power over interstate and foreign commerce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   FACEA's constitutionality is not obvious. It was passed in 1994-one year before the Supreme Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudential shift-a time when Congress' commerce power was thought to be virtually limitless.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Section III(C)(1). Defendants make powerful arguments that the statute exceeds Congress' commerce power: (1) \"Acts of violence or intimidation at places of worship are not economic activity, and are plainly analogous to the acts of violence covered by the Violence Against Women Act that the Supreme Court expressly held in [\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Prudence dictates that this case not be tried with a substantial, dispositive question of constitutional law undecided by any appellate court.

Case Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   A comprehensive recitation of the facts is contained in the court's opinion of April 23, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zhang I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525312\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/514/\">\n    311 F.Supp.3d at 521-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201916617\">\n    2018 WL 1916617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-14. A condensed, excerpted version of the facts relevant to this opinion is set out below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiffs are members of a group, Falun Gong, developed in the second half of the twentieth century in China. The Chinese Government, they allege, has acted to suppress this group in both China and abroad, including in the United States, because it deems the group a threat to the hegemony of the Chinese State and Communist Party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Adherents of Falun Gong live in the United States. Some are citizens of this country. It is contended by them as plaintiffs that the Chinese Government has conspired with individuals to harm followers of Falun Gong in the United States by organizing and encouraging the Chinese Anti-Cult World Alliance (\"CACWA\") and individuals to inflict injuries on those who follow Falun Gong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Defendants oppose Falun Gong in Flushing, Queens, New York, and elsewhere. They deny that Falun Gong is a religion. Following the position of the Chinese Government, their opposition is based upon characterizing Falun Gong as a \"cult\" indoctrinating its followers with beliefs that are dangerous, unscientific, and offensive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   For purposes of this litigation, Falun Gong is found to be a religion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zhang I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525312\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/311/514/\">\n    311 F.Supp.3d at 558-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201916617\">\n    2018 WL 1916617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *34-35. Plaintiffs proselytize their religion and protest the Chinese Government's opposition to it from tables on Main Street in Flushing near what they consider to be one of their temples.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiffs set up the tables in a heavily pedestrian-traveled area. At the tables they verbally and with hand-outs, signs, and literature attacked the Chinese Government politically for, among other things, harvesting human organs. They also use the tables to proselytize for Falun Gong, through informative materials, and for meditation and exercise, forms of their worship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The parties have clashed with one another around the temple and tables. At times the debates became loud, spirited, and mildly physical, with occasional striking out and hitting. The plaintiffs brought this suit on the theory-in addition to others-that defendants' actions were violent and intimidating at a place of religious worship as prohibited under FACEA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   B. Prior Opinion on FACEA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The opinion of this court of April 23, 2018 addressed summary judgment motions of the parties and the court's\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zhang I\n   </em>\n   , 311 F.Supp.3d at ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201916617\">\n    2018 WL 1916617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It held that a broad interpretation of FACEA is necessary to avoid a serious constitutional question under the First Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   The Federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act protects plaintiffs \"lawfully exercising ...

So, a Commerce Clause challenge, like a First Amendment challenge, is a challenge to an action of Congress. Congress is the subject of the claim and the answer to the who question.
