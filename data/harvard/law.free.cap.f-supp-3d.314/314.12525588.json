The seriousness of the offense and the resulting punishment weigh in favor of finding cooperator confidentiality.

In his declaration, Mr. Hardy describes how the six pages were processed to determine if non-exempt information were segregable from that protected by an exemption. For the pages redacted in part, he explains that the \"pages comprise a mixture of material that would be segregated for release and material that was withheld as release would trigger foreseeable harm to one or more interests protected by the cited FOIA exemptions.\" Hardy Decl. \u00b6 54(A). As to the two pages withheld in full, he explains that any \"non-exempt information on these pages was so intertwined with exempt material, that no information could be reasonably segregated for release\" and that \"[a]ny further segregation of this intertwined material would employ finite resources only to produce disjointed words, phrases, or sentences, that taken separately or together, would have minimal or no informational content.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54(B). \"FOIA requires only separation of what is reasonably segregable, permitting the agency to avoid committing significant time and resources to the separation of disjointed words, phrases, or even sentences which taken separately or together have minimal or no information content.\"\n   <em>\n    Wadelton v.
