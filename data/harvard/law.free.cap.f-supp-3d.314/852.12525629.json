Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Michael Kilpatrick, the President of Eagle Research Group, Inc. (\"ERG\"), provided this background on the company and its mission:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   3. Eagle's principal business focus is to conduct security (and also safety) assessments for DOE's Office of Enterprise Assessments (\"EA\") to test the adequacy of the measures used by DOE to protect United States' classified matter at DOE's various research laboratories and production facilities. The mission of the EA is to provide feedback to internal and external stakeholders through independent evaluation of the effectiveness of safeguards and security policies and programs throughout DOE. Basically, Eagle provides independent oversight activities at DOE facilities that have classified operations, including facilities that assemble and disassemble nuclear weapons and store \"Special Nuclear Material.\" \"Special Nuclear Material\" refers to materials such as plutonium and enriched uranium that can be used for nuclear weapons. These security assessments ensure that the DOE, or its contractor operating the facility, is compliant with regulations and applicable national directives (for example, DOE security directives (Orders, Manuals and Guides); Director of National Intelligence, Intelligence Community Directives/Manuals/Guides; Director of Central Intelligence Directives; Executive Orders 12333 and 12356 ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Kilpatrick Decl.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 66-1, \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This matter arises out of Plaintiff, Steve Roshon's (\"Roshon\") employment with Defendant. Roshon asserts that he was employed by ERG from October 1, 2012 through May 15, 2016 as a Direct Labor Production Hourly employee who held two titles, one as a Protective Force Specialist\n   and later as an Information Security Specialist. There is no dispute that Roshon regularly worked in excess of forty hours in a workweek and that ERG compensated Roshon on a monthly basis at his hourly rate for all hours that he reported as worked, including those hours worked over 40 in a workweek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Roshon filed suit on October 6, 2016 seeking unpaid wages, specifically the overtime premium for all hours he worked over 40 in a workweek, asserting that ERG misclassified him as an employee who is exempt from the overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. and the Ohio Minimum Fair Wage Standard Act (\"the Ohio Wage Act\"), Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7 4111 et seq. On the other hand, ERG claims that it can avail itself of the FLSA's Highly Compensated Employee (\"HCE\") exemption to the FLSA, and that it does not owe Roshon payment for overtime premiums. Accordingly, ERG has filed this Motion for Summary Judgment (\"ERG's Motion\"). In turn, Roshon asserts that, inasmuch as the HCE exemption to the FLSA is an affirmative defense, it is ERG's burden to show that no genuine issue of material fact exists as to each of the three elements of the HCE exemption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff's Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff's Amended Complaint (\"Complaint\") alleges four causes of action: (1) unpaid overtime in violation of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; (2) unpaid overtime in violation of the Ohio Minimum Fair Wage Standards Act (\"the Ohio Wage Act\"), O.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4111;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) a violation of the Ohio Prompt Payment Act, O.R.C. \u00a7 4113; and (4) a violation of the recordkeeping provisions of the Ohio Wage Act, \u00a7 4111.08. (\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 18.) Plaintiff seeks to recover the alleged unpaid overtime compensation, and also seeks liquidated damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that \"[i]n or around August 2013, Defendant hired Roshon as a full-time, non-exempt Information Security Specialist. At all times relevant during Plaintiff's employment, Roshon worked over forty (40) hours per workweek.\" (\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 18, \u00b6 14.) Roshon \"was a contractor who traveled to DOE [Department of Energy] National Laboratories around the country to assist federal employees of the OSA (Office of Security Assessments) assess security and other classified matters. Roshon was responsible for collecting data, reading procedures and observing facilities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 18, \u00b6 16.) Moreover, the Complaint asserts that \"Roshon was not responsible for writing any of the assessment reports. The Team Lead is responsible for approving the final report. The Team Lead, a federal employee of the OSA is the only member of the team that has discretion and judgment with respect to findings of the team[;] the Contractors, including Roshon, do not exercise independent discretion or judgment-they simply complete paperwork based on the data they gather, interviews they conduct and their observations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 18, \u00b6 18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Roshon asserts that his \"primary duty was to provide support to the federal government in conducting assessments by fact gathering using well-established techniques,\n   procedures and specific standards set out by the Defendant and the OSA. Plaintiff's primary duty was not the performance of office or non-manual work directly related to the management or general business operations of Defendant or Defendant's customers.\" (\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 18, \u00b6\u00b6 26, 27.) Rather, \"Plaintiff's office time was limited to approximately one (1) to two (2) hours out of each ten (10) to twelve (12) hour day when he was conducting assessments.\" (\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 18, \u00b6 28.) \"Plaintiff's primary duty of conducting assessments involved the use of any methods necessary to trip up a sensor or penetrate a security procedure, including crawling, crouching, walking, running, climbing, and lifting his own body weight. He physically walked and crawled around buildings and on rooftops looking for vulnerabilities in security. The majority of Plaintiff's time was spent doing these activities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 18, \u00b6 31.) Additionally, \"[a]s part of his employment with Defendant, Plaintiff was required to pass a physical exam every year. Every year, Plaintiff was required to participate in a ten (10) day physical training session involving physical exertion, weapons, and protective gear.\" (\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 18, \u00b6\u00b6 32, 33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff further asserts that his primary duties were not exempted from FLSA coverage. He asserts that, in August 2016, Defendant contacted him and offered to pay him $32,000.00 in unpaid overtime that had been improperly withheld for the time period covering July 2014 to May 2016. When Roshon asked additional questions concerning the payment, Defendant's President, Dean Hickman, called him and rescinded the offer. (\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 18, \u00b6\u00b6 39, 42, 43.) Upon information and belief, Roshon asserts that unpaid overtime wages were paid to \"comparable employees in similar positions as Roshon.\" (\n   <em>\n    Compl.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 18, \u00b6 45.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendant agrees that Roshon was employed as an Information Protection Specialist (\"IPS\"). (\n   <em>\n    Def. Mot. S.J.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 66, at p. 7.) \"Throughout his almost three years of employment with Eagle, Roshon primarily worked as an IPS with some ancillary administrative duties as explained herein.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 8.) Defendant further asserts that \"[a]t all times during his employment with Eagle, Roshon was paid a salary in excess of $100,000.00 per year.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"Roshon's primary function was as [an] IPS. As an IPS, his principal duty was to conduct assessments of classified matter protection and control (CMPC), including at sensitive compartmented information facilities (\"SCIFs\") and special access programs (\"SAPs\") of the DOE.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 3.) \"Roshon spent approximately thirty weeks per year as an IPS conducting some phase of an assessment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 13.) \"Because of his physical security background, he would generally be assigned to assess CMPC at most of the contamination areas which required donning protective clothing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Defendant asserts that \"Roshon has extensive experience in physical security of classified information. He has been working with classified matter for twenty years, beginning in the military, and it transcended his entire career.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at pp. 13-14.) Defendant asserts:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Roshon observed the facility or the activity and determined, based on his expertise and judgment, whether the DOE regulations were met. He excelled at evaluating the nonconforming storage of classified material. That is very important to Eagle's assessment process because some forms of classified material are not conducive to traditional storage approaches. Classified material could include a part of a nuclear weapon or tooling to create one and too large to store in a traditional vault or safe. He was adept at evaluating non-conforming storage and applying his broad technical\n   expertise to determine if these storage requirements were acceptable in terms of DOE requirements.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 14, interior citations omitted.) \"When not conducting assessments, the other twenty-two weeks per year, it was 'other duties as assigned' which, according to Roshon, involved lots of 'reading policies and procedures, national requirements, directives, our protocols, our processes.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant states that the Employment Agreement provided that Roshon was paid on a monthly basis. In addition to his salary, Defendant asserts that \"Roshon was also paid a bonus for working additional hours over forty per week,\" and those hours were paid \"on a straight time basis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Def. Mot. S.J.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 66, at p. 9.) Defendant agrees that Roshon was not paid overtime at time and a half. Rather, at issue is whether Roshon was exempt from the overtime provisions of the FLSA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Roshon does not dispute that he worked enough hours in 2014 and 2015 to earn more than $100,000. However, in 2016 he only earned $49,254.25 because he left his employment on May 15, 2016.

Additionally, ERG asserts that, in 2016, Roshon was paid $49,254.25 for the time he worked for ERG until he voluntarily left the company in May, 2016, to take a position with DOE. (ECF No. 53-18, PAGEID 1675.) \"On an annualized basis, that is $140,920. (ECF No. 66-1, PAGEID 4086.)\" (\n   <em>\n    Def. Reply\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 78, at p. 3.)

However, he fails to apprize the Court that he was not formally employed on a full-time basis by Eagle until August 1, 2013.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Unwin held the contract with the U.S. Department of Energy (\"DOE\") from July 2007 to August 2013 to provide technical and administrative support services to the U.S. Department of Energy's\n   Office of Independent Oversight. (See \u00b6 1 of Declaration of Robert W. Johnson, attached hereto as Exhibit 1.) Mr. Roshon was employed by Unwin from July 2007 through July 2013, conducting assessments under the DOE contract regarding the adequacy of the measures used by DOE to protect \"Special Nuclear Material,\" classified matter, and other security interests at DOE's various research laboratories, production facilities and cleanup sites. (Id. at \u00b6 4.) Mr. Roshon was a permanent employee of Unwin (with benefits) and paid a monthly salary. (Id.) He was therefore expected to fully support Unwin's efforts under the DOE contract, as long as he was employed by Unwin. (Id.) Mr. Roshon was fully tasked by Unwin through the contract transition period in 2013, after the award of the successor contract to Eagle. (Id. at \u00b6 5.) Unwin Company is a separate entity unrelated to Eagle. (Id.) Mr. Roshon was tasked for 190 hours in June 2013 and 176 hours in July 2013. (Id.) His timesheets reflect that he actually worked 227 hours and 290 hours for those months, respectively. (Id.)

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mr. Roshon's time sheets attached thereto as Exhibit A to Exhibit 1.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Def.

Therefore, for those two years, the salary-level test is met. Additionally, ERG asserts that Roshon's pro rata pay met the salary level test in 2016 under the provision of the regulation at 29 C.F.R. 541.601(b)(3) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   (3) An employee who does not work a full year for the employer, either because the employee is newly hired after the beginning of the year or ends the employment before the end of the year, may qualify for exemption under this section if the employee receives a pro rata portion of the minimum amount established in paragraph (a) of this section, based upon the number of weeks that the employee will be or has been employed.

(\n   <em>\n    Kilpatrick Decl.\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 66-1, \u00b6 11.)

In reversing a decision of this Court, the Sixth Circuit analyzed the DOL regulations, and concluded that an exempt employee may be paid a \"day rate,\" but the employment arrangement must also guarantee that the minimum weekly rate will be paid on a salary basis regardless of the number of hours worked:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Under the governing regulations, an employee meets the salary-basis test \"if the employee regularly receives each pay period on a weekly, or less frequent basis, a predetermined amount constituting all or part of the employee's compensation, which amount is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of the work performed.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20541.602\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

However, ERG asserts that, \"for purposes of the highly compensated exemption, the employee need only perform one of these duties.\" (Def. Mot. S.J., ECF No. 66, at pp. 38-39.)

The only skill Plaintiffs have identified is 'the skill of engaging in physical activity to perform your job.' \" * * * The jobs expressly listed in \u00a7 541.601(d), however, all require more.
