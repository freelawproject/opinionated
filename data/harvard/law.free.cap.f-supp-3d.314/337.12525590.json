Effective April 24, 1996, in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\"AEDPA\"), Congress enacted a one-year period of limitations on the filing of \u00a7 2255 motions through Section 105 of the AEDPA, which amended\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to state that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under this section.

Here, Defendant's conviction became final in 2013. Defendant filed this motion on July 21, 2016-well past the one-year limitation period. Thus, Defendant's motion is untimely under \u00a7 2255(f)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   However, Defendant claims that his motion is timely under \u00a7 2255(f)(3) -\"the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(3). Consequently, the Court next considers the merits of this argument as it relates to application of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) in this case. Under the ACCA, a defendant convicted of violating \u00a7 922(g) is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of fifteen years' imprisonment if the defendant has three prior convictions for a \"violent felony,\" a \"serious drug offense,\" or both.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1). The ACCA defines \"violent felony\" as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, or any act of juvenile delinquency involving the use or carrying of a firearm, knife, or destructive device that would be punishable by imprisonment for such term if committed by an adult, that-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (i) has an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical\n   force against the person of another; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or\n   <em>\n    otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another[.]\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.
