Appellants are five asylum seekers who were apprehended shortly after entering into the United States with their minor children. Ultimately, they were separated from the children, prosecuted by the government for the misdemeanor offense of improper entry under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and found guilty by the Magistrate Court after separate trials. On appeal, Appellants challenge only their criminal convictions. Although Appellants' separation from their children is a cause of great concern not only for Appellants but also for many in public at large, the soundness of the government's policies regarding arriving asylum seekers and their minor children is not before the Court in this appeal. Because this Court finds no error in the proceeding below, the judgment of the Magistrate Court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellants are citizens of El Salvador and Honduras. Each was apprehended by agents from United States Customs and Border Protection (\"CBP\") in unrelated incidents between October 21 and October 23, 2017, moments after they crossed into\n   the United States from Mexico at a place that was not designated as a port of entry. At the time of their apprehension, Appellants were not alone; each was traveling with their minor child or grandchild.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During initial processing by CBP, Appellants sought asylum based on a fear of persecution in their home countries. Shortly after, Appellants were charged by complaint with improper entry of an alien under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). In addition, because Appellants did not possess documentation establishing a familial relationship with the minor children, CBP concluded that they were unaccompanied minors and transferred custody of the children to the Office of Refugee Resettlement (\"ORR\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At each of their initial appearances, the Magistrate Judge asked Appellants whether they were traveling with a minor child or sibling and, if so, whether the government had provided any information regarding the child's whereabouts or well-being. Initial Appearance Tr. at 7-8, ECF No. 14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellants responded that they had received little or no information regarding their children.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Concerned about the legal impact that Appellants' separation from the children could have on the criminal proceedings, the Magistrate Judge scheduled a status conference to discuss the issue with counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the status conference, the Magistrate Judge explained that he had noticed a marked increase in cases where migrants that claimed to have been accompanied by their minor children were charged with improper entry and separated from the children at their time of arrest. Status Conference Tr. at 2-3, ECF No. 54. Similar to Appellants, the defendants in those cases often told the Court that they were kept in the dark concerning their children's whereabouts and well-being.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Magistrate Judge went on to express concern that, should Appellants consider pleading guilty, their pleas might be susceptible to a future challenge as involuntary.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    at 4-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Given Appellants' inability to communicate with their children during the course of the criminal proceedings, the Magistrate Judge posited that Appellants might be induced to plead guilty based solely on their understandable desire to reunite with the children as quickly as possible.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In response to the Magistrate Court's request for briefing, counsel for Appellants informed the Court that he was already preparing a dispositive motion for each of Appellants' cases that would address the issues raised by the Court.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Agreeing that Appellants were similarly situated as to the Magistrate Court's concerns, the government consented to consolidate Appellants' cases for the purposes of the briefing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Following the status\n   conference, the Magistrate Court entered a briefing schedule, and Appellants filed a motion to dismiss several days later.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Appellants' motion essentially raised four arguments in support of dismissal. First, Appellants argued that the government's actions in these cases were inconsistent with previous expressions of governmental policy relating to families detained for violating immigration laws.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    at 3-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In essence, Appellants asserted that various federal entities have expressed a preference that families remain unseparated as they navigate immigration-related proceedings, and that this preference runs counter to \"the government's mechanism of separating the family unit and simultaneously charging and prosecuting [Appellants] with a \u00a7 1325 crime.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Second, Appellants argued that the government violated their right to due process by charging them with improper entry before resolving their asylum claims. Specifically, Appellants characterized the criminal charges as \"a violation of due process because [Appellants] are being deprived of an opportunity to explore and exhaust any administrative remedy they may have with respect to the issue of bond and possible refugee or asylum status.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Appellants further elaborated that the charges were \"premature\" because, should Appellants \"qualify for refugee or asylum status, they cannot be prosecuted for being illegally in this country.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Third, Appellants asserted an additional due process violation based on the conditions surrounding their potential guilty pleas.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    at 10-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Echoing the concerns expressed by the Magistrate Court, Appellants explained that they were \"extremely worried about the safety and well-being of their minor children and want to put these \u00a7 1325 charges behind them as quickly as possible.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Consequently, given that Appellants' children were being held \"in unknown places and under unknown conditions,\" Appellants asserted that they were being \"induce[d] ... to plead guilty while under duress.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   And fourth, Appellants argued that, taken together, the government's actions implicated the outrageous government conduct doctrine.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In Appellants' view, the steps taken by the government-i.e. separating Appellants from their children, prosecuting Appellants instead of allowing them to proceed with their asylum claims, and coercing them to plead guilty by withholding information about the well-being of the children-were so cumulatively egregious that the government forfeited its right to prosecute these cases.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After Appellants filed their motion to dismiss, the government filed a response.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Resp., ECF No. 17. In its response, the government asserted, inter alia, that the Magistrate Court lacked jurisdiction over issues unrelated to Appellants' criminal prosecution, that there was no basis to dismiss the indictments, that Appellants failed to demonstrate any violation of due process, and that the expressions of federal policy relied on by Appellants are applicable only in the context of civil removal proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Magistrate Court then held an evidentiary hearing where both sides largely re-urged many of the arguments made in their filings. That said, Appellants also appeared to raise two additional arguments touching on their right to due process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   First, after reiterating that they should be allowed to pursue their asylum claims prior to any criminal prosecution, Appellants asserted: \"So going to trial ... it's also a violation of due process. Why? Because we are missing the most important\n   thing, the material witnesses, the children. They don't have them here .... So even going to trial would be a violation of due process.\" Evidentiary Hr'g Tr. at 10, ECF No. 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   And second, while addressing the government's assertion that separating the children was lawful and consistent with the government's obligations, Appellants argued: \"They are using that mechanism to terminate parental rights .... Because these clients are going to plead guilty, they are going to be deported, and they are not guaranteeing to keep track of their children .... And that is terminating parental rights.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In response, the government maintained that Appellants' asylum claims were not relevant to their criminal prosecution, that \"pressures related to family concerns\" do not render a plea involuntary, that Appellants' remedy for any involuntary plea would be to go to trial rather than dismissal of their indictments, and that \"the government doesn't necessarily know\" whether the minors were, in fact, Appellants' children.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    at 15-18, 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The evidence at trial consisted entirely of facts and exhibits stipulated to by both sides. Stipulated Exs., ECF No. 47. After the government presented the evidence and rested, Appellants moved for a judgment of acquittal under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29. Bench Trial Tr. at 7, ECF No. 49.

That said, they do not ground their challenges in any particular ruling made by the Magistrate Court, nor do they specify when or how the Magistrate\n   Court erred. For example, Appellants do not argue that the Magistrate Court erroneously denied their motion to dismiss, motion for judgment of acquittal, or motion for reconsideration and new trial. Similarly, Appellants' attack neither the Magistrate Court's reasoning in ruling on those motions nor the sufficiency of the evidence presented at trial. Instead, Appellants simply raise the same challenges they made in the motions, albeit in a somewhat more refined fashion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Specifically, they assert: (1) that their right to a fair trial was violated by their inability to voluntarily plead guilty and by the government's failure to produce material witnesses in support of a duress defense; (2) that the government impermissibly placed a penalty on their right against self-incrimination; (3) that the conditions of their pretrial detention constituted a punishment; (4) that their sentences were cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment; (5) that the government committed a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation; and (6) that the steps taken by the government in prosecuting these cases implicates the outrageous government conduct doctrine.

Appellants do not argue to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Furthermore, the constitutional rights guarded by the voluntary-plea requirement were not violated in the proceedings below. Rather, Appellants exercised each of them. The Magistrate Court held five separate bench trials. At those trials, Appellants were not compelled to testify against themselves, and they had the opportunity to confront the evidence against them. Therefore, it would be counter-intuitive to conclude that Appellants were deprived of their right to a fair trial based on their inability to enter a voluntary plea when they were able to exercise each of the rights guarded by the voluntary-plea requirement, and Appellants do not otherwise specify how their trials were affected. Further, \"a defendant has no right to be offered a plea.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Missouri v.

Without an actual plea to evaluate or any basis in the record indicating that Appellants were deprived of their right to a fair trial, the\n   Court cannot find a due process violation on the ground advanced by Appellants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Appellants' second argument as to why they were deprived of a fair trial relates to their assertion that they were refused the opportunity to call their children as material witnesses. At the evidentiary hearing on their motion to dismiss, Appellants explained to the Magistrate Court that the children were missing material witnesses. Evidentiary Hr'g Tr. at 10. Appellants then expanded on that argument in their closing arguments during the bench trials, specifying that the children were \"exculpatory regarding the Defendants [sic] well-founded fear for leaving their countries.\" Bench Trial Tr. at 8.

The government likewise commits a due process violation when it hides witnesses or conceals their whereabouts.\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v. Estelle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1150758\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/674/313/#p315\">\n    674 F.2d 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 315 (5th Cir. 1981) ;\n   <em>\n    Lockett v.

The same is true when the government deports witnesses without considering the exculpatory value of their testimony or allowing the defendant an opportunity to interview them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Villanueva\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8953778\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/408/193/#p200\">\n    408 F.3d 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 200 (5th Cir. 2005) ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Tex. 2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Unsurprisingly, the applicable framework differs in these lines of cases. To show witness intimidation, the defendant must establish that the government used improper tactics to coerce a witness into refusing to testify.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

That framework is necessarily less applicable when the government hides or deports witnesses because, in those cases, the witness's unavailability is not premised on intimidation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Villanueva\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8953778\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/408/193/#p200\">\n    408 F.3d at 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Another difference concerns the available remedies. Unlike witness intimidation, which usually results in remand for a new trial, deportation of a material witness may warrant dismissal of the indictment.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Henricksen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"893657\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/564/197/#p198\">\n    564 F.2d at 198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9165066\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/347/375/#p386\">\n    347 F.Supp.2d at 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Setting aside any differences, however, there is a salient commonality in these cases; to establish a due process violation, the defendant must demonstrate that the witness's testimony is material. Indeed, when witnesses are deported, the defendant must offer \"some explanation of how their testimony would have been favorable and material.\"\n   <em>\n    Valenzuela-Bernal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636547\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/858/#p873\">\n    458 U.S. at 872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"636547\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/458/858/#p873\">\n    102 S.Ct. 3440\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, in the intimidation cases, the defendant must show \"that a prospective witness was intimidated or that he refused to testify,\" or that the \"testimony would have contained ... material exculpatory evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Viera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10547538\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/839/1113/#p1115\">\n    839 F.2d 1113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1115 (5th Cir. 1988).

The ICE directive, by its own terms, does not create any enforceable rights. Likewise, the remarks in the legislative history merely express concerns and encourage DHS to refrain from separating families when possible. Although the Flores Settlement is legally binding, as discussed above, the rights created under the agreement are applicable only to minors, and none of its provisions suggest that minors should be released to an adult who has been charged with, and is being detained for, an immigration offense.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bunikyte\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%201074070\">\n    2007 WL 1074070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *16. In short, nothing in these materials requires that the government cease or suspend Appellants' criminal prosecution, reunite them with their children, and allow them to press forward with their asylum claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   How these materials support Appellants' argument that their pretrial detention amounts to a punishment in violation of their right to due process is not readily apparent. More importantly, Appellants do not cite, and the Court has not found, any authority supporting dismissal of a criminal indictment under these circumstances. At bottom, Appellants' real claim is that their conditions of confinement are unconstitutional and that the government is abusing its prosecutorial discretion. Appellants take issue with their inability to communicate with their children while their criminal proceedings were pending, and with the government's decision to prosecute them for improper entry instead of allowing them to pursue their asylum claims. While these concerns of course merit thoughtful attention and consideration, they are the subject matter of a civil action, not a misdemeanor criminal case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Suggs v.

Appellants contend that the true punishment of their crime is not one year of non-reporting\n   probation but rather deportation to their home countries and the de facto termination of their parental rights. Appellants' Br. at 25-26. Appellants' parental rights were terminated, in their view, because \"[n]othing indicates that they left for their Central American countries in the company of their children\" and \"there is no guarantee to be reunited with them.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Court notes that some of Appellants' arguments on this point are difficult to square with the record. Although Appellants assert that the Magistrate Court entered a \"written judgment of guilt and deportation,\" that is simply not true.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply Br. at 15, ECF No. 16. The judgments entered after Appellants' trials say nothing of deportation, nor could they.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Judgment and Commitment, ECF No. 44. This is because \"[d]eportation, however severe its consequences, has been consistently classified as a civil rather than a criminal procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    Harisiades v.

The Magistrate Court did not sentence Appellants to deportation. Rather, as Appellants implicitly acknowledge in their supplemental memorandum, they were removed only at the conclusion of separate removal proceedings before the immigration court. And, to the extent Appellants suggest that their removal orders were cruel and unusual, that argument is foreclosed; it is well-established that the Eighth Amendment does not apply to removal proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reyes-Gomez v.

Consequently, it is clear that Appellants' criminal convictions did not terminate their parental rights. That is not to say, however, that the actions taken by the government did not at all interfere with Appellants' rights. Indeed, any time the government detains or imprisons a parent for criminal activity, that parent's rights as to her children are implicated.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aguilar v.

But if that kind of interference were actionable under the Eighth Amendment, every imprisoned parent would arguably have a claim.

The government also reasserted its contention that Appellants' parental rights are irrelevant to their prosecution for improper entry, and that Appellants had failed to offer any evidence substantiating their claims as to the relationship between them and the minor children. The Magistrate Court ultimately denied the government's motion on April 26, 2018, which was after these appeals became fully briefed.

Robert Moore,\n    <em>\n     Border Agents Are Using a New Weapon Against Asylum Seekers\n    </em>\n    , Texas Monthly (June 2, 2018), https://www.texasmonthly. com/politics/immigrant-advocates-question-legality-of-latest-federal-tactics/. Appellants have not made such an argument to the Court nor presented any evidence that Appellants had reason to believe that CBP agents would prevent them from presenting themselves at the border to United States agents. The Court does not consider this troubling possibility further.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    Appellants and the government both provide the same hyperlink to ICE's website in citing to the Parental Interests Directive. Although the Court previously reviewed the document by using the link provided by the parties, curiously, that link is no longer functional. The Policy Number associated with the Parental Interests Directive is 11064.1. On August 29, 2017, ICE promulgated a policy entitled \"Detention and Removal of Alien Parents or Legal Guardians.\" This new policy is numbered 11064.2, and it purports to supersede ICE policy 11064.1.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Detention and Removal of Alien Parents or Legal Guardians, ICE, https://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention-reform/pdf/directive DetainedParents.pdf. It is unclear why the previous policy was still available on ICE's website months after it was apparently superseded. More unclear is why the government never pointed out that Appellants were relying on an outdated policy. In any event, the outcome of this appeal does not turn on the validity of the Parental Interests Directive.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
