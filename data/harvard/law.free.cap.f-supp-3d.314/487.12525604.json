(Doc. 1, Ex. 2.) Respondents European Specialties, LLC and Bieber, LLC (collectively, \"Respondents\") seek to compel Petitioners to arbitrate, in their individual capacities, certain claims relating to\n   a distribution agreement. Because I find that Petitioners each signed the distribution agreement in their capacity as members of Bieber European Architectural Windows &amp; Storefronts NY, their limited liability corporation, and Respondents have failed to demonstrate that Petitioners (i) acted as the alter ego of their limited liability corporation or (ii) should be estopped from avoiding arbitration, the Petition is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 8, 2016, Respondents initiated an arbitration against Petitioners and Red Hook Windows, LLC, formerly known as Bieber European Architectural Windows &amp; Storefronts NY (\"BEAW\"), a New York limited liability company. (Pet. \u00b6 1, Ex. A.) Respondents seek to arbitrate various claims arising out of the Distribution agreement For Bieber Architectural Windows, dated March 12, 2013, between Respondent European Specialties, LLC and BEAW (the \"Agreement\") with Petitioners in their individual capacities. (Pet. Ex. B.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Respondents seek to arbitrate their claims that Petitioners and BEAW breached the Agreement by, among other things, \"directing their efforts towards creating and engaging in a competing business during the term of the [A]greement,\" and using the benefits and good will of Respondents' trade name, email address, trademark, website, and product samples to obtain customers for that competing business. (Pet. Ex. A at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The initial preamble of the Agreement states that: \"This Agreement is made on this date March 12, 2013 between 'European Specialties LLC' based in New York State and 'Bieber European Architectural Windows &amp; Storefronts NY' based in New York State.\" (Agreement at 1.) The Agreement goes on to state that BEAW could be called \" 'You' or 'Your' or 'Bieber European Architectural Windows &amp; Storefronts NY' or Sergey Boroditskiy or Anatoliy Koval or Aleksander Nester.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In the \"Definitions\" section, the Agreement states that the Agreement \"is solely made with [BEAW] and its current members or officers,\" and \"will not apply to new members or officers joining [BEAW].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.) In addition, the Agreement defines BEAW as a \"Limited Liability Company represented by Anatoliy Koval, Sergey Boroditskiy, and Aleksander Nester.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In the section titled \"Dissolution and termination of the agreement\" the Agreement enumerates the occurrences pursuant to which \"[e]ither party may voluntarily withdraw from this agreement,\" and one such occurrence is the \"change in management or ownership of [BEAW].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5(3)(b).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The arbitration provision set forth in the Agreement states, in its entirety: \"Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this contract or to the breach thereof shall be settled [by] arbitration to be held in New York, NY, in accordance with the law in this jurisdiction, and judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On the last page of the Agreement, above the signatures, the Agreement states: \"This agreement is set forth for 3\n   years, from the date of the fully executed agreement, signed by both parties.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) The lower half of the page provides space for the two parties to sign. \"European Specialties LLC\" is listed in the space provided for \"THE IMPORTER,\" and Benoit Luys electronically signed for European Specialties LLC as its \"duly authorized\" member. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Luys is the managing member of European Specialties LLC. (Luys Aff. \u00b6 1.) Below Luys's signature, BEAW is listed in the space provided for \"THE FACTORY REPRESENTATIVE,\" and each Petitioner electronically signed for BEAW, each as \"Its Member, duly authorized\". (Agreement at 17.) The signatures appear as follows:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Respondents believe Petitioners and BEAW breached the Agreement at least as early as spring of 2016 by establishing Open Architectural Windows and Doors (\"OAWD\") as a business that competes with Bieber SA and directing customers away from Bieber SA products and towards products of a competitor. (Luys Aff. \u00b6 4.) Respondents note that publicly available sources, including Facebook and LinkedIn, indicate OAWD \"claims to have been in business since 2009.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) In addition, Respondents note that OAWD appears to operate out of the same office and use the same telephone number that BEAW previously used. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Respondents state that Petitioners Boroditskiy and Koval were in communication with a German competitor in 2015 and visited Germany in 2015, \"apparently to speak to that and other competitors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.) Respondents assert Petitioners directed customers towards the products made by the German competitor and away from Bieber SA products. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In addition, Respondents state that Petitioners \"used the Bieber tradename, Bieber trademark, Bieber product samples, and Bieber shop drawings based on confidential proprietary business information from Bieber SA, in order [to] obtain contracts with customers, but the customers\n   were later instead apparently supplied with and/or will now soon be supplied with products manufactured by Bieber SA competitors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) Respondents claim email traffic and (lack of) order history demonstrate that, in more than one instance, Petitioners used the Agreement to obtain a customer but ultimately supplied that customer with the product of a competitor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Petitioners state that during the term of the Agreement they were not involved in the marketing, selling, or installing of windows or doors except through BEAW. (Boroditskiy Aff. \u00b6 2; Koval Aff. \u00b6 2; Nester Aff. \u00b6 2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petitioners Boroditskiy and Koval acknowledge that they are members of OAWD (Petitioner Nester is not a member of OAWD); however, OAWD \"did not exist in any form prior to its being registered with the New York Department of State in May 2016.\" (Boroditskiy Aff. \u00b6 3; Koval Aff. \u00b6 3.) In addition, Petitioners state that no business was done through OAWD before May 2016. (Boroditskiy Aff. \u00b6 3; Koval Aff. \u00b6 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On December 8, 2016, Petitioners received Respondents' Notice of Intention to Arbitrate. (Pet. \u00b6 1.) Petitioners filed the Petition to Stay Arbitration on December 27, 2016, in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pet.) Respondents removed the Petition to this Court on January 30, 2017. (Doc. 1.) On February 6, 2017, I issued a scheduling order directing Petitioners to serve any additional materials in support of the Petition by February 17, 2017. (Doc. 4.) In accordance with the scheduling order, Petitioners submitted their memorandum of law in support of the Petition on February 17, 2017. (Doc. 7.) On March 9, 2017, Respondents submitted their memorandum of law in opposition to the Petition, along with their supporting affidavits and exhibits. (Docs. 10-17.) On March 17, 2017, Petitioners filed their reply memorandum of law in support of the Petition, along with their supporting affidavits. (Docs. 21, 21-1, 21-2, 21-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On March 29, 2017, Respondents filed a letter motion requesting that the Petition be denied and also requesting an order compelling Petitioners to participate in the arbitration underlying the Petition. (Doc. 22.) On April 5, 2017, Petitioners filed a letter opposing Respondents' March 29 letter motion.

(Resp'ts Br. 8-9.) In support of their alter ego argument, Respondents point to the fact that during the pendency of the Agreement OAWD and BEAW shared a phone number, business address, and operated out of the same location. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Luys Aff. \u00b6 6.) Respondents also assert that Petitioners solicited customers through BEAW using Respondents' trademark\n   but later supplied those customers through OAWD with products of Respondents' competitor. (Resp'ts Br. 9; Luys Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.) In response, Petitioners point to the undisputed fact that OAWD did not even come into existence until May 31, 2016, after the Agreement expired. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Luys Aff. Ex. D.) Petitioners also state that during the term of the Agreement they were not involved in the marketing, selling, or installing of windows or doors except through BEAW. (Boroditskiy Aff. \u00b6 2; Koval Aff. \u00b6 2; Nester Aff. \u00b6 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Accepting Respondents' version of the facts as true, I find that Respondents' alter ego argument falls well short of what is required to sustain such a claim; therefore, there is no basis to determine that Petitioners acted as the alter ego of BEAW.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thomson-CSF\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7414732\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/64/773/#p780\">\n    64 F.3d at 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding veil piercing not appropriate \"in light of the totality of the circumstances\" despite finding of common ownership and control). Petitioners incorporated OAWD in 2016 after the Agreement terminated, (Luys Aff. Ex. D), and thereafter supplied customers with products from Respondents' competitors. The fact that two members of BEAW are now members of OAWD, and that OAWD now operates out of the same office space that BEAW occupied, without more, does not support a finding that Petitioners were the alter egos of BEAW during the pendency of the Agreement. In addition, Petitioners' trip to Germany, \"apparently to speak to ... competitors,\" (Luys Aff. \u00b6 7), is speculation that cannot form the basis of an alter ego finding. Moreover, Respondents do not allege, much less submit evidence, regarding inadequate capitalization, intermingling of funds, or self-dealing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Freeman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"199897\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/119/1044/#p1053\">\n    119 F.3d at 1053\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
