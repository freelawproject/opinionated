Hoyt, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Ker'sean Olajuwa Ramey, a Texas inmate incarcerated under a capital conviction and death sentence, filed a federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus on November 13, 2013. (Dkt. No. 7). Ramey alleges that constitutional error infected his trial with unfairness. Having considered Ramey's claims, the state court record, the pleadings, the evidence, and the applicable law, the Court now finds that Ramey is not entitled to federal habeas relief for the reasons provided herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 17, 2005, the State of Texas indicted Ramey for the offense of capital murder in the 24th Judicial District Court of Jackson County Texas. The four-count indictment charged Ramey for his role in the murders of Sam Roberts, Tiffany Peacock, and Celso Lopez. After a change of venue, Ramey stood trial in Victoria County, Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The State based its case against Ramey on testimony from those to whom he admitted involvement in the murders, as well as his co-defendant LeJames Norman's account of the crime. On direct appeal, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals summarized the trial testimony:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The bodies of Celso Lopez, Tiffany Peacock, and Sam Roberts were found in Roberts's residence by his parents on August 25, 2005. Lopez had been shot four times: once in the cheek and three times in the back of the head. Peacock was shot twice in the head. Roberts was shot five times: once in the chest, once in the neck, and three times in the back of the head. They had been killed on or about August 24.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Stacy Johnson, [Ramey's] former girlfriend, testified that he called her at 12:29 a.m. and 12:59 a.m. on August 25. He went to her house after their conversation, and slept there until shortly before 6 a.m. She said that he seemed \"distant.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Two days later, Johnson accompanied [Ramey] to his house where he dug up \"something\" from his backyard. Johnson drove him to a dam. While Johnson was driving, [Ramey] called his former step-father, Lonny Lyte. (Both Johnson and Lyte testified about this conversation.) [Ramey] asked Lyte, \"If you was to kill somebody, what would you do with the guns?\" Lyte responded by saying that he would throw them in the river.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   When they reached the dam, Johnson saw [Ramey] throw two pistols into the water. She later returned to the dam with the police and pointed out to the dive team the place where she remembered him throwing the pistols. They were found in the approximate location she indicated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   After he threw the pistols in the water, [Ramey] admitted to Johnson that he had committed a murder. He first said, \"You know what this is about,\" to which she responded in the affirmative. When they returned to her house, he admitted to everything in detail, and he threatened to kill her if she told anyone.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   A firearms examiner from the Department of Public Safety testified that markings on the bullets that were recovered from the victims' bodies were consistent with the bullets having been fired from the pistols that were recovered from the water at the dam.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The pistols had been stolen from [the Nairn family] residence on August 19, 2005. The owner of the pistols identified them, and one of the pistols was further identified by records of registration. Gerald Manzanalez and Christopher Times testified that, on August 19, they and [Ramey] had broken into a residence where they stole the pistols and some other firearms.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   LeJames Norman testified that, on August 24, he and [Ramey] had gone to the scene of the murders, Sam Roberts's residence. Their objective was to steal 100 kilograms of cocaine they believed to be inside.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   He said that he and [Ramey] prepared by stealing masks from a discount store. The jury saw the store's surveillance videotape which showed them stealing the masks at 9:22 p.m. on August 24.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Norman testified that they also prepared by wrapping tape around their shoes so as not to leave a trail. They donned their masks and cocked their guns before entering the house. They knocked on the door. Celso Lopez answered, and the two men forced their way inside. Norman held a gun on Lopez, while [Ramey] ran to the rear of the home, where he hoped to find the cocaine. As [Ramey] searched for the drugs, Norman accidentally shot Lopez in the cheek. [Ramey] quickly returned to the front room and forced Lopez, bleeding and begging for help, to move to a bedroom and lie on the floor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   At that point Roberts came home, accompanied by Peacock (his girlfriend). When she saw what was happening, Peacock panicked and tried to run away. Norman grabbed her and forced her to\n   her knees inside the house, near the front door. As she was bending down, he shot her in the back of the head. Seeing his girlfriend fall limp to the floor, Roberts attacked Norman. The two men \"tussled\" in the kitchen until [Ramey] shot Roberts, freeing Norman who immediately shot Roberts several more times while he lay on the floor. [Ramey] then returned to the bedroom and shot Lopez in the back of the head as he lay on the floor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [Ramey] and Norman left the house. As they walked away, Norman realized that he had left his police scanner inside the house. [Ramey] quickly returned to retrieve the scanner. While inside, he shot the victims several more times to ensure that they were dead.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [Ramey] and Norman did not find any cocaine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Eight other witnesses testified that [Ramey] had admitted to them that he had participated in the murders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Ramey v.

App. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The defense rested without calling any guilt/innocence witnesses or presenting any evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The jury instructions authorized Ramey's conviction: (1) for \"caus[ing] the death of Sam Roberts and/or Tiffan[y] Peacock and/or Celso Lopez by shooting them with a firearm\" in the course of a robbery or burglary or (2) for assisting Norman in the murders under Texas' law of parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Clerk's Record at 172-73. The jury found Ramey guilty of capital murder. The verdict form specified that the jury found Ramey guilty as the principal actor in the crime. Clerk's Record at 175.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A Texas jury decides a capital defendant's sentence by answering special-issue questions. In this case, the special issues asked: (1) will the defendant be a future danger to society; and (2) do sufficient circumstances mitigate against a death sentence?\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CRIM. CODE art. 37.071 \u00a7 2(b); Clerk's Record at 193-94. The State based its punishment-phase case on Ramey's escalating violent actions. The State presented testimony and evidence that, when Ramey stood trial at age twenty-one, he had already amassed a significant criminal history. Ramey began acting out in school at a young age. His first interaction with the legal system occurred when at age sixteen he coerced a seven-year-old boy into performing oral sex on him. Originally charged with aggravated sexual assault, the charge was reduced to assault and the court sentenced him to juvenile probation for one year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   At age seventeen, Ramey pleaded guilty to criminal mischief for breaking into a vending machine at his high school. Less than six months later, Ramey and another friend, broke into his alternative learning school and ransacked the principal's office. His probation for the two offenses was eventually revoked for failing to pay fees, perform his community service hours, and report to his probation officer. Ramey's subsequent stay in the county jail did not squelch his lawlessness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Jurors found out that Ramey had actually burglarized the Nairn residence three times. The State also presented evidence\n   that, after burglarizing a different location, Ramey attempted to run over the homeowner with his car. Witnesses testified that Ramey had planned other burglaries. Additionally, Ramey told friends that he had carried out various crimes for which he was never charged. Importantly, Ramey bragged that he had committed other murders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Ramey's behavior did not improve while incarcerated before trial. He armed himself with weapons, created disturbances, and threatened guards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The State's final witness was Dr. Richard Coons, a psychologist. Dr. Coons did not examine Ramey, but his review of relevant records led him to opine that an offender like Ramey would \"commit criminal acts of violence in the future which would constitute a continuing threat to society.\" Tr. Vol. 38 at 81.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The defense only called two witnesses in the penalty phase. Ramey's mother, Ms. Terral Stevens, provided an overview of Ramey's life. Ms. Stevens told jurors of Ramey's early emotional and mental problems, including a diagnosis of dyslexia and ADHD at age four. Early evaluations revealed emotional disturbances and a lack of social skills. Ramey told evaluators that his step-father had abused him. Ramey's mother, however, failed to seek the necessary help for her son's problems.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Dr. Mark Kunick, a psychiatrist, based his testimony on an interview with Ramey and Ramey's mother, his review of records, and his understanding of the facts of the case. Dr. Kunick opined that Ramey's nonviolence since incarceration, his close-knit family, and his lack of mental illness would make it unlikely that Ramey would be a future danger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The jury answered Texas' special issues in a manner requiring the imposition of a death sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Trial counsel represented Ramey on direct appeal. On February 11, 2009, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed Ramey's conviction and sentence in an unpublished opinion.\n   <em>\n    Ramey v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. AP-75,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%20335276\">\n    2009 WL 335276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Tex. Crim. App. 2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   During the pendency of his state appeal, Ramey filed a state application for a writ of habeas corpus. The same judge who presided over Ramey's trial adjudicated his state habeas application. After the submission of proposed factual findings and legal conclusions, the trial-level court entered an order recommending that the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals deny habeas relief. State Habeas Record at 145-61. The Court of Criminal Appeals filed Ramey's case and set it for submission.\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Ramey\n   </em>\n   , No. AP-76,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%201288284\">\n    2011 WL 1288284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (Tex.

Crim. App. 2012). The Court of Criminal Appeals issued a mandate on December 4, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On November 14, 2013, Ramey filed a skeletal federal petition for a writ of habeas corpus raising five claims. Ramey, however, did not provide any extensive legal or factual discussion of the issues raised by his petition. Instead, Ramey provided the following brief list of claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   1. The State violated Ramey's constitutional rights by failing to disclose favorable evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   2. Ramey is innocent of capital murder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   3.

Trial counsel provided ineffective representation in the penalty phase of trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   (Dkt. No. 7). Ramey also informed the Court that he \"incorporates into his claims for relief the claims filed in his direct appeal brief and in his state habeas application....\" (Dkt. No. 7 at 4, n.1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Ramey's attorneys believed that they had filed their petition outside the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act's (\"AEDPA\") limitations period. The Court appointed new counsel to represent Ramey throughout federal review. (Dkt. No. 11). Ramey amended his habeas petition on December 15, 2015. Ramey's amended petition raised eleven claims:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   1. The State violated Ramey's right to equal protection by systematically excluding jurors based on their race.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   2. Trial counsel provided ineffective representation during jury selection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   3. Ramey was denied a trial by an impartial jury when a juror was excluded for expressing reservations about the death penalty.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   4. The State violated Ramey's rights by knowingly presenting false testimony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   5.

(Dkt. No. 40). Respondent argues that (1) Ramey's skeletal petition was not timely; (2) any new claims in his amended petition are also not timely; (3) Ramey presents several claims in a procedurally inadequate manner; and (4) all claims lack merit. Ramey has filed a reply. (Dkt. No. 49). This matter is ripe for adjudication.

The specific question before the Court is whether, in a capital case set for submission, the Court of Criminal Appeals decision or its mandate is a final judgment that ends state review. The answer turns on whether the habeas action is \"pending\" under section 2244(d)(2) between the issuance of the appellate court's decision and its mandate. Because Ramey filed his initial federal petition on November 14, 2013, his pleading was timely only if state habeas review was tolled until the mandate issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The federal courts have not rendered a one-size-fits-all standard for when a state habeas case is no longer \"pending,\" but rather look to the \"state post-conviction procedures to determine...when state review ended....\"\n   <em>\n    Watts v.

For example, the convicting court may usually set an execution date when \"the court of criminal appeals denies relief.\" TEX CODE CRIM. PRO. art. 43.141(a)(1). If the case is \"filed and set for submission,\" however, statutory law prohibits the lower court from setting an execution date until \"the court of criminal appeals issues a mandate.\" TEX CODE CRIM.

The remaining claims fall into two categories. First, the amended petition contains several claims that Ramey did not raise in state court or in his skeletal petition. Specifically, Ramey did not exhaust portions of claim two and all of claims five, eight, ten, and eleven in state court. Those claims do not share a common core of operative facts with the skeletal petition. Ramey did not file them in a timely manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Second, Ramey's amended petition contains some claims that he exhausted in state court (part of claim two and claims one, three, and nine). Ramey's initial petition mentioned in a footnote that he intended to \"incorporate[ ]into his claims for relief the claims filed in his direct appeal brief and in his state habeas application....\" (Dkt.

The jury selection process in this case involved the questioning of individual jurors from two jury panels. The 135-member initial venire dire contained seven African-American individuals. Five of those potential jurors were dismissed for cause, and two were excused because they were distant relatives of Ramey. The parties did not select any African-American jurors from the first panel. When the trial court called a second panel, eight jurors were already seated. Of the forty-nine member second panel, six were African-American.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   When members of the second panel assembled in the courtroom, four African-American potential jurors sat toward the front of the courtroom. The prosecutor requested a jury shuffle,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   which left only two African-American prospective jurors among those who would eventually be questioned before the jury was selected. After the jury shuffle, African-American veniremember Cheryl Steadham-Scott was the second juror questioned. The State removed Ms. Steadham-Scott by peremptory strike. The next juror questioned was also African-American but she was dismissed for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   No African-American jurors served at trial.

Second, if the showing is made, the burden shifts to the prosecutor to present a race-neutral explanation for striking the juror in question. Although the prosecutor must present a comprehensible reason, the second step of this process does not demand an explanation that is persuasive, or even plausible; so long as the reason is not inherently discriminatory, it suffices. Third, the court must then determine whether the defendant has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination.

Ramey challenged her strike in the appellate and habeas proceedings. On appeal, Ramey claimed that the trial court did not properly engage in the\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   procedure and that the prosecution shuffled the jury for racial purposes. Ramey's habeas application faulted the State for not coming forward with a sufficient race-neutral explanation for striking Ms. Steadham-Scott.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Ramey raises a robust\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   claim in federal court. Ramey contends that he can show purposeful discrimination in the State's exercise of peremptory strikes. Relying primarily on inferences, Ramey (1) disputes the State's reason for striking Ms. Steadham-Scott; (2) argues that the prosecution used a jury shuffle to lessen the chance of receiving an African-American juror; (3) points to a purported history of discrimination in Jackson County criminal trials; and (4) asserts that the State questioned the African-American jurors differently. Ramey, however, only gave the state courts an opportunity to consider the first two arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Questioning of Ms. Steadham-Scott\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The prosecution used a peremptory strike against one black potential juror, Ms. Steadham-Scott. After extensive questioning, the prosecution concluded by asking her whether she could, as required by the future-dangerousness special issue, impose a death sentence when \"the only evidence was that it would be slightly more likely than not\" that \"he will be dangerous in the future.\" Tr. Vol. 29 at 77-78. Ms. Steadham-Scott said that she would \"need much more of a burden.\" Tr. Vol. 29 at 78. The State then passed her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Trial counsel began the defense's question by \"go[ing] over this last issue\" with her. Tr. Vol. 29 at 78. At that point, the prosecutor interrupted and said that he \"was not going to challenge [Ms. Steadham-Scott] for cause.\" Tr. Vol. 29 at 78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Trial counsel then passed her without asking any additional questions. Tr. Vol. 29 at 79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The prosecutor subsequently exercised a peremptory challenge against Ms. Steadham-Scott without explanation. Tr. Vol. 29 at 79. The defense did not raise a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   objection then, but asked for the trial court to include her questionnaire in the record. The trial court excused her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Three weeks later, and after the jury had been selected but not yet sworn in, trial counsel told the court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   just for a housekeeping matter, when we were doing the voir dire on the jury and the supplemental panel, juror number two, which is Cheryl Steadham-Scott, was peremptorily struck by the prosecution and we were just wanting to note that the prosecution did not give any race neutral explanations for that....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Tr. Vol. 30 at 9.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The prosecutor then said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   it was my understanding that if I would have continued to pursue the line of questioning, that juror would most likely been challengeable for cause, but I didn't do it because her questionnaire clearly indicated that she could not impose the death penalty and there were many other racially neutral reasons and, if the Court wants, I can try to go back and resurrect those notes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Tr. Vol. 30 at 10. In short, the prosecution provided two race-neutral reasons: (1) continuing the last line of questioning would have shown her to be challengeable for cause and (2) she was not strong on the death penalty. The trial court said that it \"was comfortable with the record reflecting what it did with respect to that juror\" and the defense did not make any further objection. Tr. Vol. 30 at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Because the prosecutor explained the peremptory strike of Ms. Steadham-Scott by providing reasons that were not inherently discriminatory, the state courts found that this process sufficiently complied with required\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   procedure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ramey now argues that the prosecutor's\n   explanation was a pretext for purposeful discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   This Court's review \"turns on factual determinations, and, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, [courts] defer to state court factual findings unless we conclude that they are clearly erroneous.\"\n   <em>\n    Snyder\n   </em>\n   , 552 U.S. at 477,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675742\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/472/\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotation omitted). Ramey assumes that, because of racial bias, the prosecutor framed his questioning in a way to disqualify Steadham-Scott from service. The state courts, however, found that Ms. Steadham-Scott \"was repeatedly unable to answer the State's questions regarding her ability to adjudge the death penalty, both in her jury questionnaire and during voir dire\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   When asked whether she understood the death penalty or whether she would change it, she replied, \"Yea. I don't know how I would change it, but-I don't know how I would change it.\" When asked if she believed in the death penalty, she responded, \"I mean, you're asking me stuff like do I believe in the death penalty. I don't know if I believe in it, you know.\" On the jury questionnaire, she left blank the question, \"Have you ever been opposed to the death penalty?\" and responded in another section on the questionnaire that she was \"not opposed or...in favor of it.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <em>\n    Ramey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%20335276\">\n    2009 WL 335276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The state habeas court also found that \"Steadham-Scott's standing on the death penalty was very questionable and the peremptory challenge by the State was based upon her inconclusive opinions on the death penalty and not upon her do identity as an African-American.\" State Habeas Record at 152. On that basis, the state habeas court found that \"the use of the State's peremptory challenge was not based on racial motivations.\" State Habeas Record at 152.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, the state habeas court commented that there was a \"complete failure to show that there was any basis for a claim that the challenge was racially motivated.\" State Habeas Record at 152.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   This is not a case where jury selection involved a definitive pattern of the prosecution striking black jurors. Of the nine African-Americans identified on the jury panels, six were dismissed for cause and two because they were relatives of Ramey. The record does not demonstrate a stark disparity in the percentage of blacks peremptorily struck as opposed to whites. The prosecutor provided race-neutral reasons for striking Ms. Steadham-Smith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   On their face, the State's reasons for dismissing Ms. Steadham-Smith are race neutral.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v.

First, questioning immediately before the peremptory strike raised serious concerns about Ms. Steadham-Smith's ability to impose the correct burden on the future-dangerousness issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Muniz v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9998365\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/851/238/#p250\">\n    851 S.W.2d 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 250 (Tex. Crim. App. 1993) (requiring the State only to prove that the defendant \"would, more likely than not, commit violent criminal\n   acts in the future\"). Second, some of Ms. Steadham-Scott's answers supported the prosecutor's belief that \"she could not impose the death penalty\": she did not know if she believed in the death penalty, she was ambivalent toward capital punishment, and was neither opposed to or in favor of it. Tr. Vol. 29 at 64-66. She also did not answer questions such as whether she had previously been opposed to the death penalty. Tr. Vol. 29 at 66. While elsewhere she said that she would \"have to be fair and open\" about reaching a decision, Tr. Vol. 29 at 65, the record reasonably supports the prosecution's belief that she would not be favorable to considering a death sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Even though the record does not strongly question the State's motives here, courts may consider relevant facts and circumstantial evidence to assess possible discriminatory intent. Ramey relies on other inferences to prove that the State engaged in purposeful discrimination: the use of a jury shuffle, an alleged history of discrimination in Jackson County, and disparate questioning.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Jury Shuffle\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Ramey argues that the State's use of the jury shuffle shows that it intended to keep African-Americans off the jury. A jury shuffle may suggest discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Snyder v.

Ramey argues that the State used a jury shuffle on the second panel because \"most of the African American veniremembers were seated towards the front of the panel.\" (Dkt. No. 30 at 52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Ramey argued to the state courts that the jury shuffle itself amounted to a\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   violation. Trial counsel asked for a race-neutral explanation when the prosecutor requested a jury shuffle. While Ramey did not make a classic\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   challenge, the trial court nonetheless required the prosecution to explain why it had asked for a jury shuffle. The prosecutor told the court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   I have individuals here in Victoria who have assisted me in going through the list and given me information about the prospective jurors....I have gotten that information from a number of different individuals. And in doing that I looked at this list and the overwhelming majority of the folks that they had suggested would be good State's jurors were towards the back of the panel. And so in light of that I requested a shuffle....I will tell the Court as an officer of the Court that those individuals, probably 75-80 percent of the ones they had told me would be good State's jurors were towards the back. And so that's why I asked for a shuffle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Tr. Vol. 21 at 20. The defense did not make any other argument, and the trial court recessed without making an express ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The Court of Criminal Appeals found that the trial counsel \"implicitly denied [Ramey] relief\" on his jury selection complaint which means that it believed that \"[t]he explanation proffered by the State\" was \"sufficiently race-neutral.\"\n   <em>\n    Ramey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%20335276\">\n    2009 WL 335276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. Ramey has not shown clear and convincing evidence to rebut the state court's finding that the State did not use the jury shuffle for racial reasons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Young v.

History of Exclusion and Comparative Juror Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   For the first time in federal court, Ramey also asks the Court to consider other factors to show that the State exercised its\n   peremptory strike against Ms. Steadham-Scott on the basis of race. Ramey particularly emphasizes historical discrimination in Jackson County and disparate questioning of African-American potential jurors by the prosecutor. Ramey's failure to raise these issues previously deprived the state courts from the opportunity to consider his arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   In arguing that prosecutors in Jackson county have historically excluded African-American jurors, Ramey relies heavily on\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v.

Ramey also says \"[u]pon information and belief, the racial discrimination present in this case is not an isolated incident and [the District Attorney] has employed similar discriminatory tactics throughout his tenure....\" (Dkt. No. 30 at 57). Ramey, however, has not provided any evidence of a systematic racism in jury selection by the prosecutor's office in recent years. Ramey's reliance on case from more than sixty years ago and his bare supposition about current racism cannot overcome the deference paid to state court adjudications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Without any other basis to support his\n   <em>\n    Batson\n   </em>\n   claim, Ramey tries to show \"a comparative analysis of the jurors-that is, 'side-by-side comparisons of some black venire panelists who were struck and white panelists allowed to serve.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Instead, Ramey's argument tries to show that the prosecution treated African-American jurors differently during questioning about the death penalty. In particular, Ramey points to two white jurors, Marjorie Jean and Carol Laza, who were selected to serve despite leaving some answers blank on their questionnaire and expressing that they did not understand the death penalty. (Dkt. No. 30 at 44-45). Despite some similarities in how they answered the jury questionnaire, questioning of both Jurors Jean and Laza confirmed that they would be able to return a death sentence. Tr. Vol. 29 at 90-120; Tr. 29 at 150-58. Even after questioning, Ms. Steadham-Smith could not say that she believed in capital punishment. Tr. Vol. 29 at 64-66. Ramey has not identified jurors who gave such ambivalent responses during questioning. Although he attempts to point out discrepancies in the State's questioning, his arguments about disparate questioning are not compelling. Ramey has simply not shown that the prosecutor's proffered reason for striking Ms. Steadham-Smith \"applies just as well to an otherwise-similar nonblack [panelist] who is permitted to serve, [thus]...tending to prove purposeful discrimination.\"\n   <em>\n    Miller-El II\n   </em>\n   , 545 U.S. at 241,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209132\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/231/#p251\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Not every attorney will conduct voir dire in the same manner.

Indeed, a defense attorney's method of voir dire is strategic, and thus it \"cannot be the basis for a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel unless counsel's tactics are shown to be so ill chosen that it permeates the entire trial with obvious unfairness.\"\n   <em>\n    Teague v.

App'x 300\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 306 (5th Cir. 2014). This Court's review will center on whether additional questioning by counsel would have made the four jurors subject to removal by cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   1. Ullman\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Ramey argues that two jurors (Ullman and Loredo) were biased because they would \"automatically impose\" a death sentence. (Dkt. No. 30 at 67). The prosecution engaged Ullman in wide-ranging questioning. When the prosecutor passed Ullman, trial counsel only asked for clarification on his jury questionnaire response that he was \"in favor in [sic] capital punishment except in a few cases where it may not be appropriate.\" Tr. Vol. 9 at 213. Ullman said: \"I would say that that would play towards the circumstances involved around the case. How could I be more specific? Cases where the person may have been legally insane or not mentally capable\n   of knowing what they were doing.\" Tr. Vol. 9 at 213. Afterwards, trial counsel told the trial court that \"after consultation with the client,...the Defense accepts this juror.\" Tr. Vol. 9 at 214.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Ramey faults trial counsel for not asking Ullman more questions. Ramey, however, does not acknowledge the State's earlier questioning that explored Ullman's opinions and ability to serve as a juror in a capital case. Ullman said that he would consider all of the evidence before deciding whether a death sentence was appropriate. Tr. Vol. 9 at 183. His answers showed that he understood the presumption of innocence and reasonable-doubt standard. Tr. Vol. 9 at 191-95 Nothing in Ullman's questioning by the State would give rise to a challenge for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   2. Loredo\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Trial counsel engaged Juror Loredo in much longer questioning. A full review of the defense questioning, however, shows that he was not necessarily an unfavorable juror. Pursuant to trial counsel's questions, Loredo said he was \"conservative\" on some issues and \"liberal on some issues\" such as being \"pro choice.\" Tr. Vol. 17 at 68. Loredo explained that he had a friend accused of a killing and the thought of being a witness in that case made him worry that he could not deal with being the one whose testimony \"is what actually sends him to prison.\" Tr. Vol. 17 at 71. Loredo told trial counsel that, on a scale of one to ten with one being against capital punishment and ten being positively in favor of it, he was a \"seven.\" Tr. Vol. 17 at 76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Ramey emphasizes an answer in which Loredo said he would \"favor\" the death penalty. Tr. Vol. 17 at 80. Even when Loredo said he \"favored\" the death penalty, he clarified that he only meant that he \"believed in it\" and his opinion on the death penalty would not affect his ability to consider the evidence. Tr. Vol. 17 at 80. Loredo, in fact, expressed a willingness to impose a life sentence \"if a single mitigating factor were presented to [him].\" Tr. Vol. 17 at 81. Given the exhaustive questioning by the defense, Ramey's emphasis on one answer misrepresents trial counsel's efforts and mischaracterizes the juror's ability to be impartial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   3. Reynolds\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Similarly, Ramey picks out some elements from Juror Reynolds' questioning that he says made her biased toward law enforcement. For instance, Juror Reynolds said that her favorite television program was \"Law &amp; Order\" and that she worked as a 911 dispatcher. Juror Reynold's discussion about her favorite television program did not reveal any pro-prosecution bias. Tr. Vol. 13 at 103. Trial counsel's questioning, also, revealed that her experiences through her employment would help her \"be a fair juror to both sides, you know, to listen to all that is said and see that everything that's being said.\" Tr. Vol. 13 at 100-01.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Ramey somewhat misconstrues Ms. Reynolds' answers to questions about the death penalty. For instance, he criticizes trial counsel for not striking for her \"pro death penalty ideation\" based on a statement\n   that \"inmates are on death row for too long,\" but does not quote her actual statement which reflected compassion for the inmates: \"it's, I would think, a very hard place to be, never knowing...how long you're going to be there or...if you're going to make it to your actual execution date...for being in the system. You hear of...people not actually making it to the execution date, you know. You live with that stuff every day.\" Tr. Vol. 13 at 99. Ms. Reynolds signaled compassion that a reasonable attorney could see as helping the defense. Ms. Reynolds' jury questionnaire showed that she was \"right in the middle\" and able \"to consider all the choices, albeit life or death, and let the facts of the case and the facts of the defendant decide it.\" Tr. Vol. 13 at 69. Ramey has not shown that counsel needed to ask any additional questions of Ms. Reynolds about the death penalty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   4. Wind\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Finally, Ramey contends that Juror Wind could not be impartial because of knowing information about the case. Juror Wind said she had close ties with Edna, Texas, the location of the murders. She read things in the paper about the case. She had discussed the murders with others. Tr. Vol. 24 at 36. Trial counsel did not ask Juror Wind if she had any bias, likely because Juror Wind had already told the prosecutor that her true knowledge of the murders was spotty and that she had not formed an opinion about the case. Tr. Vol. 24 at 33-34. Ramey has not shown that a reasonable attorney should have asked her more questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   In the end, Ramey has not shown that any of the challenged jurors harbored views that would have resulted in dismissal for cause. As the state habeas court found, Ramey's complaint \"simply reveals claims that [his] trial counsel did not conduct the voir dire in a manner in which [his] present counsel would conduct voir dire....[A]ll of these claims are simply based upon tactics....\" State Habeas Record at 155. Ramey has not shown that trial counsel provided deficient performance, or that actual prejudice resulted, from the questions he asked on voir dire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Agreement to Excuse by Consent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The parties agreed to dismiss thirty-nine veniremembers based on their answers to the written juror questionnaire, without any individual voir dire.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Without identifying which jurors he refers to, Ramey contends that \"[a]t least 15 of those prospective jurors who were 'excused by agreement' were clearly not challengeable for cause based on their answers to the questionnaire.\" (Dkt. No. 30 at 75). Ramey contends that trial counsel's failure to require adequate questioning of those jurors violated his rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   No authority requires all potential jurors to be questioned. Texas law allows excusal by the consent of parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CODE CRIM. PRO. art. 35.05. Here, Ramey does not allege that the summary excusals were based on race or any impermissible factor other than individual feelings about the death penalty. Ramey does not specify which potential jurors were removed by consent, but could have been rehabilitated with additional questioning. Even if trial counsel agreed to remove all jurors unequivocally opposed to or in favor of a death sentence, such an approach falls within an area reserved traditionally for strategic decision making.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Teague\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12048482\" index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/60/1167/#p1172\">\n    60 F.3d at 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ramey has not shown\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   deficient performance or prejudice with regard to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Dismissal of Mary Natividad\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Ramey argues that trial counsel allowed potential juror Mary Natividad to be excused without any voir dire. The parties agreed to dismiss Ms. Natividad based only on her questionnaire showing general opposition to the death penalty. Tr. Vol. 16 at 21. When the State observed that Ms. Natividad answered that \"she not only has been opposed to the death penalty now, but she has been opposed in the past,\" trial counsel responded, \"[a]s much as I would like for her to be here, she is really on absolutes.\" Tr. Vol. 16 at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Because Ramey did not exhaust this portion of his claim in state court, it is procedurally barred. The Court, however, alternatively finds that Ramey's briefing on this matter does not strongly show deficient performance or prejudice in trial counsel's choice to allow dismissal of Ms. Natividad. Trial counsel could tactically agree to her excusal for various reasons, none of which would questionably result from deficient legal performance. Ramey has not shown that he can overcome the procedural bar or that this argument merits relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   <strong>\n    E. The Prosecutor's Alleged Misstatements of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Finally, Ramey contends that trial counsel provided deficient performance by not objecting when the prosecutor misstated the law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The prosecutor repeatedly told jurors that the mitigation special issue was the only opportunity to give mitigating evidence any effect. Under Texas law, however, a jury can consider and give effect to some mitigating evidence through the future dangerousness special issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scheanette v. Quarterman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3865007\" index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/482/815/\">\n    482 F.3d 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 826 n.64 (5th Cir. 2007) (listing several categories of evidence that jurors can consider under the future-dangerousness issue). Ramey has shown that trial counsel probably missed a viable objection and an opportunity to provide jurors a correct understanding of the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Even if the prosecution misstated the law, a great deal of time had passed and much had happened before the jury deliberated Ramey's punishment. The jury had heard significant evidence and argument in both phases of trial, making it unlikely they remembered the complained-of statements. The Court is \"skeptical that, by the time their ...deliberations began, the jurors would have remembered the explanations given during voir dire, much less taken them as a binding statement of the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Penry v. Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302289\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/782/#p801\">\n    532 U.S. 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 801,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302289\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/782/#p801\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1910\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9302289\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/782/#p801\">\n    150 L.Ed.2d 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Jurors had a full ability to give effect his evidence under the mitigation special issue which ameliorated any harm from the prosecutor's misstatement.

At the beginning of her questioning, Ms. Warren said that she was \"definitely more opposed\" to the death penalty than for it. Tr. Vol. 22 at 279, 290. In subsequent questioning she said \"depending on the circumstances [she] could vote for a death penalty.\" Tr. Vol. 22 at 291. \"[B]ecause of [her] answers to the opposition to the death penalty,\" the prosecution then engaged Ms. Warren in questions about her ability to consider the evidence under the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard. Ms. Warren subsequently provided waffling opinions about how she would consider evidence in a capital case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   Ms. Warren told the prosecutor that she would hold the State to a higher standard in a death case. Tr. Vol. 22 at 299. After trial counsel's questioning rehabilitated her, Tr. Vol. 22 at 301, Ms. Warren again said she would require a \"greater quantum of proof\" in a capital case than another criminal action. Tr. Vol. 22 at 309. Trial counsel's subsequent questioning extracted that Ms. Warren \"hope[d] that she could follow what the Judge tells her to do\" regarding the reasonable-doubt standard. Tr. Vol. 22 at 310.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   The prosecution then challenged Ms. Warren for cause:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-172\">\n   The State: Now this is the classic vacillating juror.

Even though \"upon questioning by [Ramey's] trial counsel she testified she would follow the law and the evidence,\" after \"further questioning by the State the venireperson again stated she would require a greater burden of proof in a death penalty case.\" State Habeas Record at 148.

Ramey did not exhaust any of\n   these arguments in state court. The unexhausted nature of these issues bars federal review unless Ramey can show cause and prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dretke v.

No. 30 at 88). In reality, Ramey for the most part bases his procedural arguments on the merits of his claims. Before turning to his arguments, and alternatively the merits, the Court makes the following observations about Ramey's cause-and-prejudice briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   First, ineffective assistance by his prior attorneys cannot forgive the procedural bar of these issues. Ramey alleges that all his prior attorneys were ineffective for not raising the barred claims, but does not provide specific briefing on how their efforts did not comply with the deficient performance and actual prejudice prongs in\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 687,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). Ramey has not shown that his prior attorneys can even serve as cause in this case. Appellate counsel cannot raise extra-record claims on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whitehead v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9278394\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/130/866/#p872\">\n    130 S.W.3d 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 872 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004). The Supreme Court has said that ineffective assistance of habeas counsel can only forgive\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   claims involving trial counsel's representation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Davila v.

Ramey cannot show cause by blaming his prior attorneys for not raising these arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Second, Ramey largely briefs the \"cause\" component without providing any briefing specifically addressing the \"actual prejudice\" requirement. In this circuit, \"actual prejudice\" requires the petitioner to \"establish not merely that the errors at his trial created a possibility of prejudice, but that they worked to his actual and substantial disadvantage, infecting his entire trial with error of constitutional dimensions.\"\n   <em>\n    Moore v. Quarterman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066248\" index=\"250\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/534/454/#p463\">\n    534 F.3d 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 463 (5th Cir. 2008) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hernandez v.

Ramey simply assumes that the merits of the claim justifies finding cause and prejudice. Ramey, however, does not provide specific briefing on actual prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The Court will review whether Ramey has otherwise overcome the procedural bar or, alternatively, whether this claim has merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Ramey has developed evidence suggesting that Manzanalez had received a plea offer from the State, though he had not yet formalized the deal. Manzanalez has provided an affidavit in which he says that the State made him a plea offer for the charges stemming from his involvement in the Nairn robbery. (Dkt. No. 30, Ex. 65). He was \"sure that [he] knew\" of the deal before testifying or, in his words, \"I would not have testified against [Ramey] had I not understood that I would get a deal.\" (Dkt. No. 30, Ex. 65).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-194\">\n   Ramey supports this argument with criminal history records showing that the State indicted Manzanalez for several charges before trial, but he pleaded guilty fifty-one days after trial with a recommendation if he agreed \"to testify truthfully against co-defendants including...Ramey at any of Ramey's trials, including capital murder trial.\" (Dkt. No. 30, Ex. 62). Also, time records from Manzanalez's attorneys show they had engaged in plea negotiations six months before trial, though no contact with the prosecution resumed until Manzanalez pleaded guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-195\">\n   As an initial matter, Ramey has not shown cause or prejudice to overcome the procedural bar of this portion of his claim. Cause \"constitut[es] something external to the petitioner, something that cannot fairly be attributed to him, that impeded compliance with the State's procedural rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Maples v.

Ramey contends that the State's misconduct, ostensibly in suppressing evidence of the plea deal, and ineffective representation by his former attorneys forgives his failure to raise this claim. (Dkt. No. 30 at 88). The record, however, does not contain any evidence that the State suppressed the information serving as a basis for this claim. A diligent investigation could have uncovered Manzanalez's plea agreement, his attorneys' time records, and, presumably, his testimony as recorded in his affidavit. The record does not suggest that Ramey's prior attorneys could not have uncovered the material his current ones have discovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   He has also not shown actual prejudice. Manzanalez's testimony was important to connect Ramey to the murder weapons. But it was not the only testimony that did so. Norman and Times likewise testified about the robbery of the Nairn residence that put the murder weapon in Ramey's\n   possession.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ramey told Bradford Butler that he stole guns from the Nairn residence. Other witnesses testified about Ramey's disposal of the weapon after the murders, including the individual who led the police to the weapon. And, importantly, Ramey repeatedly told other people about his involvement in the crime. Ramey has not shown that any failure to disclose the pending plea deal harmed the defense. Ramey's\n   <em>\n    Napue\n   </em>\n   claim relating to Manzanalez's testimony is procedurally barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-197\">\n   Even if the Court could reach the merits of this issue, the Court would alternatively deny relief because Ramey has not shown that any false testimony from Manzanalez was material. Testimony is material if \"in any reasonable likelihood [it could] have affected the judgment of the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Giglio\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721534\" index=\"269\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/150/#p154\">\n    405 U.S. at 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11721534\" index=\"270\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/405/150/#p154\">\n    92 S.Ct. 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wearry v.

The evidence supporting Ramey's conviction was solid. Manzanalez provided incriminating details, but significant other testimony connected Ramey to the Nairn robbery and subsequent murders. Even if the existence of a deal may have allowed jurors to view Manzanalez's testimony with skepticism, trial counsel told jurors that Manzanalez's testimony \"has no bearing on the guilt or innocence on Mr. Ramey as to whether or not he committed the offense of capital murder.\" Tr. Vol. 35 at 29. Any false testimony about Manzanalez's plea agreement was not material to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   2. Santellana\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   Ramey also contends that Otis Santellana testified falsely. Santellana was incarcerated in a cell near Ramey before trial. Santellana testified that Ramey disclosed several details about the crime, including that Ramey shot one of the victims. Ramey argues that Santellana provided false testimony when he said that law enforcement officers did not ask him to talk to Ramey. Also, Ramey argues that the State fed Santellana details about the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   As an initial matter, Ramey has also not overcome the procedural bar of this issue. In addition to not showing any external impediment that would amount to cause, Ramey has not shown actual prejudice. Santellana was one of a parade of witnesses who described Ramey's incriminating admissions. Ramey told other witnesses, such as Stacey Johnson, about the murders in much greater detail than he did Santellana. Norman provided extensive testimony about Ramey's role in the killings. Ramey has not shown cause or actual prejudice to forgive the procedural bar of this portion of claim four.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   The Court observes, alternatively, that Ramey does not support his arguments relating to Santellana with competent evidence. Ramey relies on two documents to support this claim. First, Ramey relies on a document allegedly containing Santellana's account of jailors instructing him to secure information about the murders from Ramey. Ramey's federal habeas investigator apparently drafted the document as an affidavit, but Santellana would not sign it. (Dkt. No. 30, Ex. 69). While Ramey provides an affidavit from his investigator vouching for the contents of the document, the unsigned document still is not competent evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   Second, Ramey provides an affidavit from a jailor explaining events that happened soon after Ramey was incarcerated. The jailor saw Santellana, who had a reputation for being a \"snitch,\" in a long meeting with other jailors. Afterwards, \"it was obvious what was going on\" because Santellana\n   was heard asking Ramey questions about the murders. (Dkt. No. 30, Ex. 67). The jailor's affidavit, however, demonstrates that she lacks personal knowledge about any agreement. The jailor's statement that it was \"completely obvious...that [Santellana] was asked to get certain information from Ramey during that meeting,\" shows that she bases her opinion in conjecture, not knowledge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Ramey, therefore, provides no competent evidence to substantiate his claim that Santellana was an agent of the State when Ramey divulged details about the murder to him. Without anything more than his own speculation, Ramey cannot show cause or actual prejudice to overcome the procedural bar of this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   Alternatively, even considering his evidence, Ramey has failed to show that any falsity in Santellana's testimony was material. Ramey agues that \"Santellana's testimony provided details that supported the State's theory of the case, and was one of the few coherent hearsay narratives.\" (Dkt. No. 30 at 93). Santellana's testimony was not the only, and far from the most detailed, account of the crime. Ramey confessed to other witnesses in jail. Ramey detailed various elements of his role in the crime to others before his incarceration. And Norman provided a complete description of the killings. Even if he could show that the prosecution knowingly adduced false testimony from Santellana, Ramey has not shown that it was material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Brady\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   Ramey argues that the prosecution violated his due process rights by suppressing evidence. Specifically, Ramey argues that the prosecution suppressed: (1) prior criminal offenses committed by witnesses Christopher Times, Kevin Childs, Otis Santellana, Myron Hardaway, Jonathan Snyder, and LeJames Norman; (2) outstanding criminal charges against Childs; (3) a prior statement that Santellana gave to investigators but was turned over to the defense three days after his trial testimony; and (4) the fact that the prosecution coerced Norman into testifying against Ramey by threatening to prosecute his mother for aiding in his flight from prosecution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   \"There are three components to a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation.

Ramey, however, does not have any affirmative proof that the prosecution withheld information about witnesses' prior crimes. Ramey has not secured any affidavit in which trial counsel expresses surprise at the witnesses' criminal convictions and other information that was not discussed at trial. Instead, Ramey says that he reviewed trial\n   and habeas counsel's records and did not find any information about the criminal convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   The State had an open file policy in this case. Tr. Vol. 3 at 14. The State sent the defense a great deal of information, but also allowed the defense to visit and review the prosecutor's files. Tr. Vol. 4 at 4. Ramey has not shown that the prosecution kept information about criminal histories secret. Ramey's speculation does not give rise to a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   Moreover, the criminal convictions and charges at issue were matters of public record. \"\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   rights are not denied where the information was fully available to the defendant and his reason for not obtaining and presenting such information was his lack of reasonable diligence.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The fact that the witnesses were all currently jail inmates or had participated in criminal acts with Ramey would have alerted the defense to research their criminal histories.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State, in fact, referred to some of the allegedly undisclosed offenses during the inmates' testimony. Tr. Vol. 34 at 93, 143-44, 190. For those reasons, Ramey has not shown a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation regarding the witnesses' criminal records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   Next, Ramey argues that the police did not turn over a statement that Santellana gave until three days after his trial testimony. Santellana gave the police voluntary statements on December 13 and December 15, 2005. The defense had a copy of the second statement, but did not receive the first until after Santellana had been returned to TDCJ custody. Ramey, however, has not shown that the failure to turn over the December 13, 2005 statement was material. The parties discussed the issue and trial counsel said that, even though the defense did not have the statement, the prosecution had allowed the defense to review the notes an investigator had taken of the statement. (Dkt. No. 30, Ex. 16 at 5). Trial counsel also said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-212\">\n   I have looked at that statement, and everything else. There are some discrepancies between the first and the second statement of which, if we decide that there's enough of a discrepancy, we will address it with the Court in a motion for new trial, if we feel that there is enough of a discrepancy. If there's not enough of a discrepancy, there will be no issue with it at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   (Dkt. No. 30, Ex. 16 at 4-5). Trial counsel did not file a motion for new trial or otherwise describe what discrepancies exist between Santellana's statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Likewise, Ramey makes no effort to show what differences exist between Santellana's statement and the trial testimony. Indeed, the best Ramey can say is that \"the suppressed statement may constitute impeachment evidence.\" (Dkt. No. 30 at 102). Ramey, however, provides no description of the alleged differences, much less briefing on how that would have affected\n   the fairness of his trial. Ramey has not sufficiently briefed a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim regarding Santellana's prior police statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Finally, Ramey argues that the prosecution should have divulged that fact that it coerced Norman into testifying against Ramey by threatening to prosecute his mother for aiding in his escape. During his flight before arrest, Norman's mother traveled to \"the U.S. and Mexico border to get [Norman] to return to Edna, Texas.\" (Dkt. No. 30, Ex. 72). The district attorney later spoke with Norman's mother and, she recounts: \"I may also have been told that I might be in trouble for my trip to the border.\" (Dkt. No. 30, Ex. 72). Norman's mother then avers:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-216\">\n   Soon after the meeting with [the prosecutor] Mr. Bell and those other people, I went to see my son LeJames in the Jackson County jail. LeJames\n   <em>\n    told me\n   </em>\n   that Bobby Bell\n   <em>\n    told him\n   </em>\n   that he was going to\n   <em>\n    put me\n   </em>\n   , his mama, in prison for 10 years for that trip to the border if LeJames didn't cooperate and testify in the capital cases that LeJames and Ker'sean Ramey were charged with.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   (Dkt. No. 30, Ex. 72) (emphasis added). Respondent points out that Norman's mother provides only a hearsay recitation of the purported reason for which Norman chose to testify. Such hearsay is an insufficient basis to craft a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this case, Norman's own testimony does not suggest that he testified from coercion, and the hearsay laden affidavit is insufficient to show that prosecutorial coercion forced his cooperation. Ramey has not shown cause and prejudice to overcome the procedural bar. Alternately, this claim lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Delayed Signing of Santellana's Plea Deal and the Confrontation Clause\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   Ramey finally argues that the State violated the Confrontation Clause when it \"delayed the signing of Gerald Manzanalez's plea agreement until after [his] trial had concluded.\" (Dkt. No. 30 at 110). Ramey contends that not disclosing the proposed plea deal denied him the opportunity to cross-examine Manzanalez about its contents. This argument lacks a sturdy factual or legal foundation. Ramey builds this claim on an unproven factual premise, that the State intentionally halted Santellana's plea negotiations and then hid any information about them. The record instead suggests that Santellana had not yet agreed to the terms of that deal when he testified. Ramey also bases his argument on a false legal premise. Ramey concedes that \"a plurality of the Supreme Court has opined that the Confrontation Clause does not extend to a state's nondisclosure of evidence before trial.\" (Dkt. No. 30 at 110, n.41);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania v.

Trial Counsel Provided Ineffective Assistance During Pre-trial Investigation and in the Guilt Phase. (Claim Six)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   In a dense, meandering claim, Ramey faults numerous features of trial counsel's pre-trial investigation and guilt/innocence representation. Among arguments dealing with failures in the development and presentation of evidence and testimony, Ramey intersperses general criticism of his trial attorneys, and most particularly Willie. For instance, Ramey contends that Willie's schedule was overloaded and that he did not spend enough time developing Ramey's case. Federal law, however, does not require a specific quantum of hours before a capital investigation is constitutionally adequate. The Court's concern is on what counsel did not investigate, develop, or present, and how that would have made a difference.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   Ramey's sixth claims centers on three areas. First, Ramey contends that trial counsel should have interviewed certain trial witnesses better, more-intensely challenged Norman's testimony, shown that the State deliberately used Santellana to secure information against him, and sought exclusion of Myron Hardaway's testimony. Second, Ramey claims that trial counsel failed to use readily available impeachment evidence, particularly the criminal histories of witnesses Childs, Snyder, Times, Manzanalez, and Ceasar. Finally, Ramey argues that trial counsel should have relied on a ballistics expert to dispute the State's evidence against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Procedural Default Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   Ramey did not exhaust the allegations from his sixth claim in state court. The Court of Criminal Appeals would apply its abuse-of-the-writ doctrine to keep Ramey from raising those issues in a successive state habeas application, thus resulting in a federal procedural bar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coleman\n   </em>\n   , 501 U.S. at 736 n.1,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1108153\" index=\"285\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/501/722/#p729\">\n    111 S.Ct. 2546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Weaknesses in Ramey's Sixth Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Before turning to the question of habeas counsel's representation, the Court makes some observations about weaknesses in Ramey's federal claim. Lacking physical evidence at the crime scene, Tr. Vol. 31 at 173, 178-82, the State relied heavily on the testimony of those involved in crimes with Ramey and those to whom he confessed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relying on affidavits and other evidence, Ramey's sixth claim intends to chip away at the credibility of various trial witnesses. Ramey, however, overstates the effect his new evidence would have had.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   For example, Ramey claims that counsel failed to interview witnesses Childs, Manzanalez, Snyder, DeLeon, Santellana, Times, and Myron Hardaway. Ramey claims that interviewing Childs would have shown that he \"was coerced into giving a statement against Mr. Ramey.\" (Dkt. No. 30 at 143). Childs' affidavit, however, does not provide any evidence of coercion. Instead, Childs describes how during interviews after an escape attempt he \"was told to let the sheriff deputies know if I heard anything from Ramey or Norman about the triple homicide,\" which he subjectively took as \"they were saying that they had me on this escape, so I better cooperate.\" (Dkt. No. 30, Ex. 64). Childs' subjective perception of what the police meant does not necessarily prove coercion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   Also, as discussed previously, Ramey has not provided competent evidence for some of his allegations. Ramey relies on hearsay allegations and unsworn affidavits to impeach testimony by Manzanalez, Santellana,\n   and Times. Likewise, as previously discussed, if trial counsel called jailor DeLeon as a witness she could only say that it was her impression that Santellana had been told to get information from Ramey. (Dkt. No. 30, Ex. 67).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Ramey particularly emphasizes trial counsel's cross-examination of Norman, arguing he (1) failed to challenge Norman's testimony on the grounds that the State coerced him by threatening to prosecute his mother; (2) failed to cross-examine Norman about his long criminal record; and (3) failed to ask Norman about his violent escape from jail and his pending escape charges. The defense, however, extensively cross-examined Norman on other grounds, particularly his multiple statements to police and during the grand jury testimony which conflicted with trial testimony. Tr. Vol. 33 at 132-99, 211-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   Some of the evidence only would have made a marginal difference at trial. Ramey faults trial counsel for not using the criminal histories from Childs, Snyder, Times, Manzanalez, and Ceasar to dispute their testimony. The jury knew that each of those men had committed crimes. With the exception of Times, who testified that he was on deferred adjudication, each of those men were in state custody at the time of trial. Additional testimony about their crimes may not have undercut their testimony any more significantly than their obvious status as inmates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   Finally, Ramey does not verify all his allegations. For example, Ramey also faults trial counsel for not retaining an expert in ballistics. The State's expert could only say that the victims were shot by bullets sharing characteristics as those fired from the murder weapons, Tr. Vol. 33 at 97-126. Trial counsel, however, extensively cross-examined witnesses regarding issues relating to the weapons. Ramey has not shown what different conclusions an independent expert in ballistics would have reached. With extensive testimony linking Ramey to the weapons the police recovered, his various incriminating statements, and Norman's testimony, a reasonable attorney could choose not to employ a ballistics expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   With that understanding, the Court looks at the evidence from trial which Ramey does not challenge in this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Evidence Unaffected by Ramey's Sixth Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   This Court's inquiry into state habeas counsel's failure to raise the indicated\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   claim assesses not just the evidence counsel did not present, but the whole of the incriminating evidence from trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sears v. Upton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455290,3644230\" index=\"313\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/945/\">\n    561 U.S. 945\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 954-55,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455290,3644230\" index=\"314\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/945/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 3259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12455290,3644230\" index=\"315\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/561/945/\">\n    177 L.Ed.2d 1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) ;\n   <em>\n    Trevino v.

Even taking Ramey's\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   arguments into account, other witnesses whose testimony is unaffected by his federal claims provided testimony putting the events into a highly incriminating context. Without actually saying that he killed anyone, Ramey asked Lonny Lyte, \"If you was to kill somebody, what would you do with the guns?\" Tr. Vol. at 224-25. Lyte told him to throw them in a river. Tr. Vol. 31 at 225. Jessica Castro said that Ramey called her on the night of the murders and asked her to make up and alibi for her. Tr. Vol. 34 at 22. Ramey also asked Courtney Hardaway to form an alibi for him. Tr. Vol. 34 at 169. Ramey's cousin Bradford Butler testified that he saw Ramey and Norman with the murder weapons on the night of the crime. Tr. Vol. 34 at 41-75.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   Evidence unaffected by Ramey's habeas arguments show his involvement in the crime. Ramey told his girlfriend Stacey Johnson that he stole the murder weapons from the Nairn residence. Tr. Vol. 31 at\n   215.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ramey confessed to Johnson that the pistols he disposed of were used in the triple homicide. Tr. Vol. 31 at 205-06. She later helped the police recover the weapons. Tr. Vol. 31 at 202-03. Ramey repeatedly told others, such as Johnson, that he was involved in the murders and how they happened. Tr. Vol. 31 at 206-07. In particular, Ramey told Johnson that he shot all three victims. Tr. Vol. 31 at 205-210. Ramey told Courtney Hardaway about the murders, but said that the victims \"got shot\" without identifying whether he or Norman did the shooting. Tr. Vol. 34 at 172-74. While bragging, joking, and laughing about the crime, Butler heard Ramey say that he shot Tiffany Peacock in the head. Tr. Vol. 34 at 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   The State presented testimony that Ramey had confessed to numerous inmates. Ramey points to areas in which a trial attorney could have challenged much of that testimony, his arguments do not completely eviscerate their testimony, only create issues of credibility for jurors to resolve.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   With all that evidence, Ramey has not shown prejudice had counsel performed consistent with his federal arguments, particularly given the decision jurors had to make. Counsel faced an onerous task in crafting a guilt/innocence defense. The jury instructions made that task harder. The State prosecuted Ramey both as a principal and as a party to the murders. Clerk's Record at 173. The jury found that Ramey was the principal, so it did not have to answer whether or not the evidence would have allowed for his conviction even if he had not been the shooter. Clerk's Record at 176. Still, the jury instructions allowed for his conviction if \"acting with intent to promote or assist the commission of the murder or murders,\" he \"any solicited encouraged directed aided or attempted to aid LeJames Norman\" in them. Clerk's Record at 173. The State could have convicted Ramey without showing that he fired the killing shots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   With that strong evidence against his client, trial counsel rested without calling any witnesses. Ramey himself approved that decision on the record. (Dkt. No. 30, Ex. 16 at 6-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Martinez\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   Ramey now attacks numerous elements of the trial testimony against him through the prism of habeas counsel's representation. A competent state habeas attorney could reasonably forgo extensive investigation and argument challenging the guilt/innocence testimony in favor of expending resources in more productive areas. More to the point, the avalanche of evidence against Ramey would preclude the state habeas court from granting relief had habeas counsel raised the claims alleged in the federal petition. Given the overwhelming evidence in the guilt/innocence phase, and in light of the nature of the claims Ramey contends should have been raised, Ramey has not shown that he meets the\n   <em>\n    Martinez\n   </em>\n   exception to the procedural bar doctrine. And with a broad review of the trial evidence placed in the context of Ramey's federal allegations, he has not shown actual prejudice. Claim six is procedurally barred from federal review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Trial Counsel Provided Ineffective Representation in the Penalty Phase. (Claim Seven)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   Ramey argues that trial counsel provided prejudicial performance in the penalty phase. Ramey concedes that he exhausted this claim in state court, but acknowledges that his state habeas claim \"did not contain the level of detail or reflect the abundant investigation conducted by\" his federal attorneys. (Dkt. No. 30 at 191). The Court can only consider arguments and evidence that Ramey exhausted in state court. The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Cullen v.

Ramey argued that his trial attorney failed to \"investigate the life of the client, uncover any and all evidence tending to counsel for life, including appropriate diagnostic testing and evaluations, and present that evidence to the jury in a clear understandable manner.\" State Habeas Record at 49. Ramey criticized trial counsel for \"only present[ing] two witnesses,\" his mother and gerontological psychologist Mark Kunik. State Habeas Record at 49. Ramey particularly emphasized that trial counsel should have secured the services of a different, better-prepared punishment phase expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   Ramey, however, did not support his allegations with any evidence.

Similarly, the state habeas court found that Ramey \"fails to even suggest as to how [an] expert could have been successfully prepared to meet the successful cross-examination conducted by the prosecution.\" State Habeas Record at 156. The state habeas court denied relief because the \"record does not affirmatively demonstrate the alleged ineffectiveness of trial counsel and this claim of ineffective assistance of counsel should be denied.\" State Habeas Record at 156.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   Based on the information Ramey presented, the state habeas court's decision was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"328\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1). The defense's punishment-phase testimony and evidence was not extensive. Trial counsel called only two witnesses, Ramey's mother and Dr. Kunik. The decision to rely only on those witnesses, however, was not on the shoulders of trial counsel alone. Trial counsel said on the record that they had \"discussed the witnesses at length at both the guilt-innocence phase and the mitigation phase, the punishment phase, and we also discussed the potential witnesses with the client, including his own testimony, prior to the decision of being made to call only those two witnesses.\" (Dkt.

The punishment phase required the jury to answer whether \"there is a probability that [Ramey] would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society?\" State Habeas Record at 193. The prosecution sought to introduce expert testimony from Dr. Richard Coons, a psychiatrist, regarding Ramey's future dangerousness.

Vol. 38 at 71, 74. From the amount of information he reviewed, Dr. Coons felt that he could reasonably assess whether Ramey would be a future societal danger. In response to a hypothetical question, Dr. Coons testified that a person such as Ramey would \"commit criminal acts of violence in the future which would constitute a continuing threat to society.\" Tr.
