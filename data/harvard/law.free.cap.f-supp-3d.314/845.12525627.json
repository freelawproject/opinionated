(Doc #: 10.) Defendant asks the Court to dismiss the federal overtime claims of non-Ohio residents for lack of personal jurisdiction under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) and to dismiss the state and federal overtime claims for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6). The Court has reviewed the Motion, the Response brief (Doc #: 11), and the Reply (Doc #: 12), and is prepared to issue a ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant Reliable Reports of Texas, Inc. (\"Reliable\") is a company that is incorporated and headquartered in Texas. Through the employment of Field Reporting Specialists (\"Inspectors\"), Reliable provides residential and commercial property inspection services for the underwriting departments of insurance providers. Reliable employs approximately 438 individuals who reside in 34 states conducting business in 38 states. Of those 438 employees, only 14 work in the State of Ohio. Reliable employs 152 people in Texas, including its entire corporate office, as well as 64 members of the field team.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff Harold Maclin is a resident of Cuyahoga County, Ohio. He alleges that he worked as an Inspector for Reliable from July 2016 to 2017. He asserts that the day-to-day duties of an Inspector involve traveling to the property in question to conduct an inspection, completing a report, and then forwarding the report to his/her manager where it is reviewed for accuracy and completeness. Maclin asserts that it was common for him and others to work more than 50-60 hours per week absent\n   overtime pay. More specifically, Reliable would pay inspectors the piece-work rate for hours worked in a week over 40, and not the overtime premium. Additionally, Maclin alleges that Reliable failed to make and preserve accurate records of time worked, much less overtime worked\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Based on these allegations, Maclin filed a Complaint on December 15, 2017, purporting to bring a collective overtime action against Reliable under the Fair Labor Standards Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq. (\"FLSA\"), and a Rule 23 class action against Reliable under the Ohio Minimum Fair Wage Standards Act, O.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4111.01 et seq. (\"OMFWSA\"). Maclin defined the FLSA collective as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   All current and former property Inspectors employed by Reliable Reports of Texas, Inc. d/b/a Reliable Reports, Inc. at any time between December 13, 2014 and the present.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (Comp. \u00b6 25.) Maclin defined the OMFWSA class as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   All current and former property inspectors employed by Reliable Reports of Texas, Inc. d/b/a Reliable Reports, Inc. any time between December 13, 2014 and the present.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Id. \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 12, 2018, Reliable filed a Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Complaint arguing that Reliable is not subject to personal jurisdiction in Ohio with respect to the FLSA claims of non-Ohio plaintiffs, e.g., collective opt-in plaintiff Curtis Weber, who lives and works in Texas. (Doc #: 6-1 at 3-8.) Reliable also argued that the state and federal overtime claims fail to state a claim under the stringent\n   <em>\n    Iqbal/Twombly\n   </em>\n   standards. (Id. at 8-14.) On February 2, 2018, Maclin filed a Response brief and a First Amended Complaint that appeared to respond to Reliable's arguments. (Doc ##: 6, 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Amended Complaint contains more factual assertions, and Maclin now defines the FLSA collective as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   All current and former Inspectors employed by Defendant in the United States in the three years prior to filing this Complaint through the present.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Doc #: 7 (\"Am. Comp.\") \u00b6 42.) He defines the OMFWSA class as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   All current and former Inspectors employed by Defendant in Ohio at any time starting three years prior to the filing of this Complaint through the present.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Id. \u00b6 58.) It is clear that Maclin's OMFWSA Rule 23 class is now confined to Ohio Inspectors, while his FLSA claim still purports to represent a nationwide collective.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On February 16, 2018, Defendant filed the pending Motion to Dismiss Plaintiff's Amended Complaint. (Doc #: 10.) Defendant again argues that the Court does not have personal jurisdiction over the FLSA claims asserted by non-Ohio plaintiffs under Rule 12(b)(2) claim, and the additional state and federal overtime factual allegations still do not pass\n   <em>\n    Iqbal/Twombly\n   </em>\n   muster under Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   When personal jurisdiction is challenged, the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that personal jurisdiction exists. \"Federal courts apply the law of the forum state when determining whether personal jurisdiction exists.\"\n   <em>\n    Mid-West Materials, Inc. v.

The California Supreme Court ultimately concluded that general jurisdiction was lacking, but that California courts had specific jurisdiction over the claims of the non-California plaintiffs. The Supreme Court reversed, stating that the mere fact that non-California plaintiffs were prescribed, obtained, or ingested Bristol-Myers' product in California did not allow California courts to assert specific jurisdiction over the product liability claims of non-California plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604783\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1773/\">\n    at 1781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court finds that\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   applies to FLSA claims, in that it divests courts of specific jurisdiction over the FLSA claims of non-Ohio plaintiffs against Reliable.

Congress created a mechanism for employees to bring their claims on behalf of other employees who are \"similarly situated,\" and in no way limited those claims to in-state plaintiffs. 29 U.S.C. 216(b). Thus, our circumstances are far different from those contemplated by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Bristol-Myers\n   </em>\n   .

Reliable argues that it did not classify Maclin as exempt from overtime laws and that it did, in fact, pay Maclin for \"hundreds\" of overtime hours. This does not sound like a case where the defendant is in the dark and has no notice of the state and federal overtime claims against it. The same analysis applies equally to the state overtime claim. Accordingly, the Court declines to follow cases in other jurisdictions that require explicitly detailed factual allegations in order to state overtime claims and, thus, denies Reliable's Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the state and federal overtime claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the Court grants Defendant's Rule 12(b)(2) Motion to Dismiss the FLSA claims of non-Ohio plaintiffs, and denies Defendant's Rule 12(b)(6) Motion to Dismiss the state and federal overtime claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
