As another member of this Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Organic Consumers Ass'n v. Gen.

Accordingly, the Court concludes that neither the FDA's policy, nor its current consideration of comments, regarding the word \"natural\" on food labels \"necessarily raises\" a federal question because neither constitutes federal law, and therefore there is no federal law regarding the use of the term \"natural\" on food products that contain pesticides that must be applied or interpreted to resolve the OCA's claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gunn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p258\">\n    568 U.S. at 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407443\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/251/#p258\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Second, Bigelow argues that the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") \"governs the determination of the harmfulness of glyphosate in food products,\" Def.'s Opp'n at 17 (capitalization and emphasis removed), and the \"[p]laintiff's claim requires this Court to examine federal law related to the safety of glyphosate,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. Bigelow is mistaken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The legal issue that must be resolved based on the allegations in the Complaint is whether Bigelow's failure to disclose the presence of glyphosate in the Products it markets as natural or environmentally friendly constitutes an unlawful trade practice under the CPPA,\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Compl., and\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   whether glyphosate's presence in the Products is harmful or unsafe. This determination regarding unlawful trade practices will not depend on whether Bigelow has complied with the tolerance levels for glyphosate in food products set by the EPA, and therefore, EPA regulations do not necessarily raise a federal issue. In\n   <em>\n    Organic Consumers Ass'n v. Gen. Mills\n   </em>\n   , a strikingly similar case also brought by the OCA, another member of this Court held that the OCA's claim that General Mills's marketing of a food containing glyphosate as \"healthy\" violated the CPPA did not necessarily raise a federal issue because, among other reasons, the \"claim d[id] not depend on the allegation that glyphosate is unsafe\" under EPA regulations.\n   <em>\n    Organic Consumers Ass'n v.

In the Court's view, if the EPA regulations regarding glyphosate safety levels in food did not need to be interpreted or applied to determine whether marketing a food containing glyphosate as \"healthy\" violated the CPPA,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268075\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/235/226/#p230\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268075\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/235/226/#p230\">\n    at 231-32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , those regulations certainly do not need to be interpreted or applied in this case either, because a food product need not be unsafe in order to be unnatural or not environmentally friendly. Therefore, the EPA regulations are not necessarily raised by the OCA's claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Third and finally, Bigelow argues that \"[t]he FDA and EPA govern food labeling requirements,\" \"[t]he FDA has expressly addressed [the p]laintiff's claim ... [, and u]nder applicable FDA regulations, such incidental substances are expressly exempted from disclosure on food labels.\" Def.'s Opp'n at 18 (citation and emphasis omitted). According to Bigelow, the OCA's claim \"demands that the Court examine and interpret federal food labeling laws that address the 'disclosure of the presence and the health effects of ingesting glyphosate' in order to adjudicate\" the claim.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268075\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/235/226/#p230\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (first quoting Compl. \u00b6 96; then citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20101.100\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 101.100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3)(ii), (iii) (2017) ).

In that case, like Bigelow, General Mills \"argue[d] that [the OCA's] claim w[ould] require a court to\n   'assess the meaning and effect' of the[ ] federal regulations regarding what must be disclosed on food labels \"to avoid being 'misbranded' under federal law.\"\n   <em>\n    Organic Consumers Ass'n v.

The Court disagreed, stating that the OCA's\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   claim is that it is the undisclosed presence of glyphosate in conjunction with labels or advertisements of the products as \"natural\" and \"healthy\" that violates the [ ]CPPA. That claim does not require the application of existing federal disclosure regulations. Moreover, even if [the OCA's] claim were based entirely on [General Mills's] failure to disclose the presence of glyphosate, the fact that federal regulations do not require disclosure would be a defense, not a basis for [\"arising under\"] jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268075\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/235/226/#p230\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The Court finds this reasoning persuasive and adopts it here. The OCA's claim in this case, that Bigelow's marketing of the Products as natural or environmentally friendly violates the CPPA, \"does not require the application of existing federal disclosure regulations,\" and \"the fact that federal regulations do not require disclosure [of glyphosate] would be a\n   <em>\n    defense\n   </em>\n   ,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268075\" index=\"151\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/235/226/#p230\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added), not a basis for federal question jurisdiction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caterpillar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6214062\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/386/#p392\">\n    482 U.S. at 399\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6214062\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/386/#p392\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A]\n   <em>\n    defendant\n   </em>\n   cannot, merely by injecting a federal question into an action that asserts what is plainly a state-law claim, transform the action into one arising under federal law, thereby selecting the forum in which the claim shall be litigated. If a defendant could do so, the plaintiff would be master of nothing. Congress has long since decided that federal defenses do not provide a basis for removal.\"). Therefore, federal food labeling requirements do not necessarily raise a federal issue because those requirements will not need to be interpreted or applied in this case.
