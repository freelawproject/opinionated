First, he asserts that although\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   forecloses a vagueness challenge against the\n   <em>\n    advisory\n   </em>\n   Guidelines, he was sentenced in 2003, before the Guidelines were rendered advisory by\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Second, he claims that under\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   's reasoning, the mandatory Guidelines\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   subject to a vagueness challenge, and that under\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    United States v.

First, the government claims that Carr's motion is untimely.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Opp'n at 10-16. According to the government, the only right newly recognized\n   in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   was the right not to be sentenced pursuant to the ACCA's unconstitutionally vague residual clause; thus, because Carr asserts a different right here-the right not to be sentenced under the\n   <em>\n    Guidelines\n   </em>\n   residual clause-\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   did not trigger the running of a new one-year limitations period under \u00a7 2255(f)(3). Similarly, the government asserts that the instant \u00a7 2255 motion-Carr's second-is barred because it does not \"contain ... a new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that was previously unavailable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2255(h)(2);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Opp'n at 17-20. The government also claims that Carr procedurally defaulted his vagueness challenge,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Opp'n at 20-21; that the application of\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   to \u00a7 4B1.2(a) would not be retroactive on postconviction review under\n   <em>\n    Teague v.

Suppose a wealthy person enters a bank intending to withdraw some cash from her sizeable checking account. She is in a hurry, so when she reaches the teller counter, she says, \"I need $10,000 in cash-now!\" She then reaches into her back pocket for her wallet, anticipating that she will need to present some form of identification. The teller, who doesn't recognize the person as a customer, interprets her request as a robbery demand and reasonably believes that she is reaching for a weapon. Fearing that his life is in danger, the teller quickly hands over the cash and later calls the police. At the wealthy person's trial for federal bank robbery, if the jury concludes that the teller was reasonably intimidated by the wealthy person's words and actions but that the wealthy person did not subjectively intend the intimidation, could it return a conviction?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Under\n   <em>\n    McNeal\n   </em>\n   and the other cases cited above, the answer is no.

The first point made by these courts is immaterial, as the Supreme Court has expressly read \u00a7 2113(a) to contain an implied mental state requirement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Carter\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413657\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/255/#p267\">\n     530 U.S. at 268\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413657\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/255/#p267\">\n     120 S.Ct. 2159\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Nor do\n    <em>\n     Hopkins\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     Parnell\n    </em>\n    demonstrate that federal bank robbery does not categorically require a threat of violent force: neither case addresses the federal bank robbery statute or \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1) and, more importantly, both cases predate\n    <em>\n     Curtis Johnson\n    </em>\n    . Finally, although it is true that a conviction under the second disjunctive paragraph of \u00a7 2113(a) -which prohibits \"enter[ing] ... any bank ... with intent to commit in such bank ... any felony affecting such bank ... or any larceny\"-does not require the presence of a another person, Carr does not argue that he was convicted pursuant to this paragraph of \u00a7 2113(a).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     McBride\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325140\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/293/#p296\">\n     826 F.3d at 296\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (declining to perform a modified categorical analysis as to the second paragraph of \u00a7 2113(a) where the defendant did not raise the issue in his \u00a7 2255 motion).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Finally, Carr cites a third Western District of Washington case that read the phrase \"by force or violence or by intimidation\" in a different criminal statute \"to include intimidation through means\n    <em>\n     other\n    </em>\n    than force or violence.\"\n    <em>\n     Bolar v.

Wash. Apr. 28, 2017). As the Court has already explained, however, Carr has failed to demonstrate a \"realistic probability\" that a person could commit federal bank robbery by threatening some form of nonviolent reprisal.\n    <em>\n     Gonzales\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553841\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/183/#p193\">\n     549 U.S. at 193\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3553841\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/549/183/#p193\">\n     127 S.Ct. 815\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In short, this Court is unpersuaded by the reasoning of these three Western District of Washington cases, and it declines to follow them here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
