MOSS, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This case presents the question whether mandatory parole in the federal prison system is mandatory. It is not. That counterintuitive result understandably led Plaintiff Artie Dufur, a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   prisoner who is serving a parole-eligible federal life sentence, to challenge the decision of Defendant United States Parole Commission (\"the Commission\") denying him parole. Dkt. 1 at 2-3 (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, 5). As relevant here, there are two paths to parole for inmates in Dufur's position. First, the Commission applies a \"two-thirds\" rule for what it terms mandatory parole. Under that rule, the Commission is required to release an eligible prisoner, \"serving a sentence of five years or longer,\" after the prisoner has served two-thirds of his sentence or after serving thirty years of a sentence of \"more than forty-five years.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204206\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The mandatory parole rule, however, is subject to exceptions; among other things, it does not apply if the Commission determines \"that there is a reasonable probability that [the prisoner] will commit any Federal, State, or local crime.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204206\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Second, the Commission also possesses the discretion, subject to certain exceptions, to parole inmates who have served at least one-third of their sentence, or ten years in the case of a life sentence.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204205\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Dufur's principal claim is that the Commission's recent decision to deny him mandatory parole violated various statutory, regulatory, and constitutional\n   provisions. He also alleges that the Commission's earlier decisions denying him discretionary parole were unlawful. The Commission has moved to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons explained below, the Court agrees with Commission that Dufur has failed to state a claim. The Court will, accordingly,\n   <strong>\n    GRANT\n   </strong>\n   the Commission's motion, Dkt. 9, and will\n   <strong>\n    DISMISS\n   </strong>\n   the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Court may also consider the copies of Dufur's administrative appeal and amended administrative appeal, which are attached to the Commission's motion to dismiss. Although those latter documents were not attached to the complaint, they are referred to in it and are \"integral to [the plaintiff's] claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Banneker Ventures, LLC v.

After refusing to submit to a search by a United States Customs inspector, Dufur drew a firearm and shot the inspector to death. Dkt. 1 at 2-3 (Compl. \u00b6 4). Dufur was apprehended and, on September 17, 1979, found guilty of first-degree murder of the inspector and armed assault on another federal officer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1229812\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/648/512/#p513\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 5).

After his apprehension, Dufur pleaded guilty to further charges, including escaping\n   custody while awaiting sentencing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3 (Compl. \u00b6 5). He was sentenced on October 17, 1979, on these new charges and the prior murder and assault charges to a minimum of ten years and a maximum of life with the possibility of parole.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 22, 2004, the Commission calculated that Dufur would become eligible for mandatory parole on September 24, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.

After that hearing, the Commission concluded that Dufur should not be paroled because of the risk that he would commit a crime in the future,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4 (Compl. \u00b6 6), one of the enumerated exceptions in the mandatory parole statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204206\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). Specifically, the Commission determined that \"there [was] a reasonable probability that [Dufur would] commit [a] Federal, State or local crime.\" Dkt. 1 at 3-4 (Compl. \u00b6 6). It \"still viewed\" Dufur \"to be a high risk for violent crime on the basis of [ (1) ] the evidence that[,] while serving a prison sentence[,] [he] coordinated [an] [e]scape from prison custody for [himself] and other inmates[,] which resulted in the death of an inmate and injury to a law enforcement officer,\" and (2) the evidence that he previously \"murder[ed] a U.S. Border Patrol Agent ... after ... escap[ing] from California [s]tate [c]ustody while serving another sentence for murder.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204206\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (Compl. \u00b6 6).

Over time, the D.C. Circuit came to interpret what lies at the \"core\" of the writ more capaciously in cases brought by federal prisoners than in cases brought by state prisoners. With respect to cases brought by state prisoners, the court adopted a relatively narrow \"channeling\" rule requiring a claim to \"first be brought in habeas only when, if successful, it would 'necessarily imply,' or automatically result in, a speedier release from prison.\"\n   <em>\n    Anyanwutaku v.

Consistent with the post-\n   <em>\n    Razzoli\n   </em>\n   rule, Dufur at times states that he \"is not requesting this Court to order his release on parole\" and, instead, is asking only that the Court order the Commission to hold a further \"hearing to decide if he can be released to his California detainer to begin serving [his state-law] life sentence.\" Dkt. 11 at 3 (emphasis omitted). But, at other times, he seems to press claims that, if successful, would \"necessarily ... shorten [the] duration\" of his sentence. He asserts, for example, that his \"federal sentences have been satisfied and by law the [Bureau of Prisons] must process the [California] detainer.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This lack of clarity is resolved, in part, by contours of the Commission's motion to dismiss, which does not invoke the channeling defense and which makes only glancing reference to the habeas venue rules. As an initial matter, the Court concludes that the habeas channeling rule is not jurisdictional in the sense that the Court has a duty to consider the defense\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   . Rather, the rule is a prudential one, which was established by the courts to\n   ensure that prisoners do not evade the procedural requirements that Congress has enacted to govern habeas proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Preiser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9981\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/475/#p498\">\n    411 U.S. at 489-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9981\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/411/475/#p498\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1827\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Aamer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4323898,4073006\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/742/1023/\">\n    742 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1031-32 ;\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3664257,3569870\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/716/660/\">\n    716 F.3d at 662-63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The relevant habeas procedural rules, moreover, are either inapplicable in this case or are themselves subject to waiver. Were the Court to treat this case as an action sounding in habeas, two procedural hurdles would likely apply. First, the immediate custodian rule requires that a habeas petitioner name as the respondent \"the person who has custody over him.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202242\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rumsfeld v.

Here, Dufur has named the Commission and not the warden of the prison where he is held. Second, the territorial jurisdiction rule requires \"that the court issuing the writ have jurisdiction over the custodian.\"\n   <em>\n    Padilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527700\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/426/#p434\">\n    542 U.S. at 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2527700\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/542/426/#p434\">\n    124 S.Ct. 2711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted). Neither of those requirements, however, limits the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal district courts, and both requirements-like venue and personal jurisdiction-are subject to waiver, at least where the named respondent \"is fully capable of granting the requested relief.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lane v.

The question, then, is whether the Commission has waived the channeling rule and, by implication, the immediate custodian and territorial jurisdiction rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Commission's motion to dismiss makes no mention of the channeling rule or of the immediate custodian rule. For the most part, moreover, it does not challenge venue (or, in other words, territorial jurisdiction) and, indeed, expressly disavows that venue is at issue. Dkt. 13 at 3-4. But, despite that concession, and seemingly at odds with it, the Commission also states the following in both its opening and reply briefs: \"[T]o the extent that Dufur's substantive due process claim rests upon his misinterpretation of mandatory parole as requiring his release by September 24, 2016, ... that is a claim that sounds in habeas because it seeks to shorten the duration of his confinement for a life sentence,\" and \"[t]his Court ... is an improper venue for any habeas claim because Dufur is not in custody in this District.\" Dkt. 9 at 5; Dkt. 13 at 3-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court concludes, however, that considerations of venue do not deprive the Court of its ability to dismiss this case for failure to state a claim.

In support of this contention, Dufur argues that \"[t]he meaning of 'relevant information' \" in the regulation,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%202.19\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), and statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204207\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \"is analogous to the definition of 'relevant evidence' found in\" the Federal Rules of Evidence.

He then posits that the submissions he\n   challenges did not have \"any tendency to make a fact more or less probable,\" as required by Rule 401(a), and that the submissions relied on convictions that were too stale to have probative value, as delineated by Rule 609(b).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204207\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%204207\">\n    at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That argument fails on two grounds. First, nothing prevents the Commission from\n   <em>\n    receiving\n   </em>\n   submissions from any and all interested people and groups. Indeed, the Commission cannot know whether a submission contains \"relevant information\" until the Commission receives and considers it. The relevant limitation, instead, is on how the Commission uses the information it receives, and, here, there is no allegation that it improperly relied on any information contained in the challenged submissions. To the contrary, Dufur challenges only the fact that submissions from these organizations were considered at all. Dkt. 1 at 6-7. Second, Dufur's reliance on the Federal Rules of Evidence is misplaced. Not only are the Rules of Evidence inapplicable to parole proceedings,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ash v.
