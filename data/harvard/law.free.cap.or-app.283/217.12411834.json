In 2015, following urbanization studies and public hearings, the City of Coburg and Lane County coadopted two ordinances to amend the city\u2019s urban growth boundary (UGB) and to revise the city\u2019s transportation system plan. Respondents, Land Watch and Kersten, appealed to LUBA, contending that the amended UGB was not supported by an adequate factual basis and that the county did not comply with Oregon statutes, statewide planning goals, and administrative rules.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> LUBA remanded both ordinances because the local findings were insufficient to satisfy ORS 197.298 and factors pertaining to Goals 9 and 14. The city and county seek review of LUBA\u2019s order. Land Watch cross-petitions, contending that the city used two mutually exclusive ways of calculating its employment-based land need and that the city had \u201cdouble-counted\u201d future employment growth. We affirm on the petition and cross-petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"an-dedup-0\">A. <em>Local Government Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">In 2010, the City of Coburg conducted an urbanization study, as part of a periodic review, to evaluate its land needs in light of future employment and residential growth over a period of 20 years. <em>See </em>ORS 197.628 - 197.644 (periodic review requirement). The study concluded that the city would need to expand its UGB to meet its projected growth.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The urbanization study was updated in 2014 with an addendum, reflecting changes between 2010 and 2014. Generally, the addendum concluded that there was a \u201cneed for a UGB expansion * * * based on forecast need for large industrial sites within Coburg and the Central Lane County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>region.\u201d The addendum concluded that the \u201cscenarios,\u201d which the city council had selected in 2010, remained the recommended sites for expansion. In 2014, the city also conducted a Regional Economic Analysis (REA), prepared by an economic and development services company, E.D. Hovee. The REA considered \u201cscenarios,\u201d each of which would require expansion of Coburg\u2019s UGB.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\u201c[WJhen a city amends its comprehensive plan, including any amendment to its UGB, the city must justify the change as being consistent with the [Land Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC)] goals, except to the extent that compliance with a goal is excused by an exception to its application.\u201d <em>1000 Friends of Oregon v. LCDC, </em>244 Or App 239, 243, 259 P3d 1021 (2011) (McMinnville); <em>see also </em>ORS 197.175 (requiring cities and counties to exercise land planning and zoning responsibilities in accordance with state land use statutes and goals approved by LCDC).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">In this case, 11 discrete areas of land were considered as sites for the UGB expansion. Of those areas, Areas 1, 6, 7, and 8 were predominantly agricultural land that had been zoned for exclusive farm use (EFU). Maps of the UGB were employed, illustrating alternative arrangements to address the city\u2019s projected land needs. The city considered a map that illustrated growth using \u201cexception lands.\u201d They are lands outside the UGB in which the city or county can take an \u201cexception\u201d to the application of a goal to particular property that is regulated by LCDC substantive standards. <em>See Waste Not of Yamhill County v. Yamhill County, </em>240 Or App 285, 287-89, 246 P3d 493 (2010), <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>241 Or App 199, 255 P3d 496 (2011) (explaining the relationship between goals and exception process). Other alternatives illustrated growth using EFU land.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>The city considered alternatives that proposed using those 11 areas for residential and employment-based expansions. The urbanization study noted that \u201c[a] 11 employment land expansion alternatives show expansion occurring on the east side of 1-5 in order to take advantage of the excellent transportation opportunities presented at this location.\u201d The study recommended, for employment-related growth, an expansion of 106 acres using the entirety of \u201cStudy Area 8.\u201d That area, comprised of EFU land, \u201cwould require the City to expand further across 1-5 * * * as well as extend\u00ed] water and sewer services to the areas.\u201d With regard to residentially-related growth, the study recommended an expansion that included \u201cStudy Areas 1, 2, 5 and 6.\u201d The city, however, determined that Areas 5 and 7 were unavailable or unsuitable for employment-based development, despite its recognition that those areas were, in fact, \u201chigher-priority\u201d lands under the applicable land use standards for inclusion in an expansion of the UGB.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">The study\u2019s recommendations were based, in part, on an analysis of estimated future population and employment growth (population and employment forecast). In 2010, the urbanization study had explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">\u201cBased upon State forecasted employment growth, employment growth within Coburg\u2019s UGB is anticipated to yield an additional 615 new jobs, for an employment total of 4,035 in 2030. This projection is <em>based upon one of the Safe Harborfs], </em>Safe Harbors were established in OAR 660-024-0040(8)(a), and adjusted based on local knowledge and/or community vision. As part of this process, the employment growth rates are based on the trends at the County level, which have been estimated by the Oregon Employment Department. As a result, Coburg\u2019s employment is projected to grow at a rate equal to the County or Regional job growth rate provided in the most recent forecast published by the Oregon Employment Department. The employment growth rate has been evaluated by applying the annual average growth rate (AAGR) percentages from OED\u2019s 10-year Lane County employment sector forecast (2006-2016) to Coburg\u2019s industry sectors (2008-2030).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">(Emphasis added.) In the 2014 addendum, the city explained that it was relying on the 2010 data for its analysis \u201cbecause the long-term forecast is expected to be realized, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>therefore the calculation of employment change requires a starting figure reflecting Coburg\u2019s existing employment capacity and redevelopment potential.\u201d (Underscoring omitted.) The 2014 addendum added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-4\">\u201cIf Coburg\u2019s job growth rate were adjusted upwards to reflect the updated overall growth expectations for Lane County ***, the employment gain within Coburg\u2019s UGB would double from the previous projection of an added 615 jobs to 1,292 net added jobs over a 20-year planning horizon. It is noted * * * that a truly sector specific forecast was not possible given the information that economist Eric Hovee was provided [for the REA].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The projected employment-based land need, as determined by Hovee in the REA, would become a contested issue before LUBA and again before this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Coburg\u2019s city council held public hearings and adopted the UGB expansion. The Lane County Planning Commission recommended to the Board of County Commissioners that it approve an ordinance and coadopt the city\u2019s plan. On December 8, 2015, the Board of County Commissioners coadopted two ordinances: (1) ordinance PA 1314, coadopted by the city, which permitted a city transportation system plan beyond the city limits, within the future growth areas, and (2) ordinance PA 1315 amending and coadopting the city\u2019s plan to extend its UGB \u201cby adding and redesignating 105.72 acres of land for Light Industrial use, 2.0 acres for High Density Residential use, 15.0 acres for Medium Density use, and 131.84 acres for Traditional Residential use.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">B. <em>LUBA Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">Land Watch appealed both ordinances to LUBA, based on legal standards and the factual basis for the decisions. Before we address those arguments, we summarize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>the legal framework which is applicable to this case, and which was described in <em>McMinnville, </em>244 Or App at 242-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">The priorities for the types of lands that may be included within a UGB are established in ORS 197.298. In relevant part, \u201cexception lands\u201d have higher priority for inclusion in the UGB than EFU lands. When a local government must choose between agricultural lands, it must generally choose the agricultural lands with less productive soil. These priorities are reflected in ORS 197.298 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">\u201c(1) In addition to any requirements established by rule addressing urbanization, land may not be included within an urban growth boundary *** except under the following priorities:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">\u201c(a) First priority is land that is designated urban reserve land under ORS 195.145, rule or metropolitan service district action plan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">\u201c(b) If land under paragraph (a) of this subsection is inadequate to accommodate the amount of land needed, second priority is land adjacent to an urban growth boundary that is identified in an acknowledged comprehensive plan as an exception area or nonresource land. Second priority may include resource land that is completely surrounded by exception areas unless such resource land is high-value farmland as described in ORS 215.710.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">\u201c(c) If land under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection is inadequate to accommodate the amount of land needed, third priority is land designated as marginal land pursuant to ORS 197.247 (1991 Edition).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">\u201c(d) If land under paragraphs (a) to (c) of this subsection is inadequate to accommodate the amount of land needed, fourth priority is land designated in an acknowledged comprehensive plan for agriculture or forestry, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-10\">\u201c(2) Higher priority shall be given to land of lower capability as measured by the capability classification system or by cubic foot site class, whichever is appropriate for the current use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-11\">\u201c(3) Land of lower priority under subsection (1) of this section may be included in an urban growth boundary if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>land of higher priority is found to be inadequate to accommodate the amount of land estimated in subsection (1) of this section for one or more of the following reasons:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-3\">\u201c(a) Specific types of identified land needs cannot be reasonably accommodated on higher priority lands;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-4\">\u201c(b) Future urban services could not reasonably be provided to the higher priority lands due to topographical or other physical constraints; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">\u201c(c) Maximum efficiency of land uses within a proposed urban growth boundary requires inclusion of lower priority lands in order to include or to provide services to higher priority lands.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Closely related, Goal 14, OAR 660-015-0000(14), establishes the goal for urbanization is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-7\">\u201cTo provide for an orderly and efficient transition from rural to urban land use, to accommodate urban population and urban employment inside urban growth boundaries, to ensure efficient use of land, and to provide for livable communities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">In addition, Goal 14 provides standards of \u201cLand Need\u201d that involve setting or changing a UGB:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-9\">\u201cEstablishment and change of urban growth boundaries shall be based on the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-10\">\u201c(1) Demonstrated need to accommodate long range urban population, consistent with a 20-year population forecast coordinated with affected local governments, or for cities applying the simplified process under ORS chapter 197A, a 14-year forecast; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-11\">\u201c(2) Demonstrated need for housing, employment opportunities, livability or uses such as public facilities, streets and roads, schools, parks or open space, or any combination of the need categories in this subsection (2). * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">Goal 14 describes factors for \u201cBoundary Location\u201d that involves changes to the UGB. Those factors are introduced by the statement that \u201c[t]he location of the urban <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>growth boundary and changes to the boundary shall be determined by evaluating alternative boundary locations consistent with *** ORS 197.298\u201d as well as the factors related to Goal 14. OAR 660-015-0000(14).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">As we explained in <em>McMinnville, </em>\u201cORS 197.298 supplements the Goal 14 criteria used to justify a UGB change. The statute requires that land be added to a UGB in a priority sequence.\u201d 244 Or App at 244. Therefore, ORS 197.298(1)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\">\u201crequires that the statutory priorities be applied to UGB amendments \u2018[i]n addition to any requirements established by rule addressing urbanization,\u2019 <em>i.e., </em>Goal 14 and its implementing administrative rules. The priority statute directs the application of different, but somewhat analogous, factors in approving UGB changes than those mandated by Goal 14.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">We have interpreted ORS 197.298 and Goal 14 to work harmoniously, even if in tension. <em>Id. </em>at 260-65. Accordingly, we have outlined a three-step process \u201cto justify the inclusion or exclusion of the sorted lands and any remaining choices about what land to include [within a UGB].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 254. We need not revisit here the process outlined in <em>McMinnville.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>For this case, it suffices to say that the \u201capplication of all of the provisions in Goal 14 to the resulting UGB change <em>is required </em>***. The application of Goal 14 to the land that results from the prioritization of ORS 197.298 allows the <em>separate and full use of both policies </em>in justifying a UGB change that is contemplated by the priorities statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">For our review, we summarize Land Watch\u2019s two contentions before LUBA that are pertinent here. First, Land Watch contended that the city had impermissibly excluded higher-priority lands from inclusion in the UGB (exception lands and EFU land with Class 4 soils). Land Watch disputed the city\u2019s conclusions that Areas 5 and 7 were \u201cinadequate\u201d or \u201cunusable.\u201d Second, Land Watch contended that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>the city had not properly based a UGB decision on the 2010 urbanization study or 2014 addendum, because the study had impermissibly calculated its REA employment forecasts. As its premise, Land Watch assumed that there are two, mutually exclusive options for calculating an employment projection\u2014a safe harbor method and a stand-alone approach. Therefore, Land Watch contended that the city had used the safe harbor method but then impermissibly augmented that calculation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In a related subassignment of error, Land Watch contended that the city had \u201cdouble-count[ed] large-lot industrial jobs.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">In its order, LUBA agreed with some of Land Watch\u2019s contentions. LUBA observed that the county\u2019s brief \u201cneither acknowledged] nor directly respond [ed] to\u201d Land Watch\u2019s arguments on a number of issues. LUBA concluded, among other things, that there was no substantial evidence for the exclusion of Areas 5 and 7 because the city and county had not properly applied the three-step process outlined in <em>McMinnville, </em>244 Or App at 239. LUBA ruled that the city and county had not satisfied the requirements under ORS 197.298 and under the Goal 14 factors. That is, the city and county did not properly justify their decision to exclude areas of inferior agricultural quality while including better agricultural lands within an expanded UGB.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">With regard to Land Watch\u2019s argument that the city had \u201cdouble-counted\u201d its employment-based forecast in the REA, LUBA concluded that the \u201cOAR 660-024-0040(9)(a) safe harbor does not preclude taking into account additional demand for employment land that may be generated by regional forces that may have little or nothing to do with the city\u2019s population growth. *** [T]he Goal 9 rule, OAR 660-009-0015 (1) and (2) expressly permit such considerations.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>LUBA also concluded that Land Watch had had \u201cthe burden of demonstrating error,\u201d and that Land Watch had \u201cfailed to demonstrate that [the city and county] improperly double-counted large-lot industrial jobs.\u201d LUBA issued a final order remanding the ordinances reflecting the proposed UGB expansion and transportation system plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AgH\">A. <em>Petition for Judicial Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">In its petition for judicial review, the city and county make three assignments of error. We reject, without discussion, the county\u2019s second and third assignments. We write briefly to explain our rejection of the county\u2019s first assignment. In the first assignment, the city and county assert that LUBA erred in concluding that the county had erroneously construed ORS 197.298 and misapplied the analysis outlined in <em>McMinnville. </em>The city and county rejoin that \u201cLUBA ignored the established standards of review and dismissed substantiated local findings that supported Coburg\u2019s conclusions regarding the inclusion of lower priority land pursuant to ORS 197.298.\u201d The city and county stress that they had substantial evidence for their reasoning. The city and county posit that so long as a city \u201cconsiders the actual appropriate factors as determined * * <em>* </em>[under <em>McMinnville], </em>and makes its decision based on how those permissible elements work to form a decision set concerning the inclusion or exclusion of available land,\u201d then a review of other applicable factors should not \u201cinvalidate\u201d the city\u2019s decision-making process.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">We reject those arguments. Our task on judicial review is to determine whether LUBA\u2019s order is \u201cunlawful in substance.\u201d ORS 197.850(9)(a). Initially, we are persuaded, on this record, that LUBA correctly ruled that the city and county failed to follow the McMinnville analysis. That is, the city and county failed to adhere to the priorities required by statute and goal. It does not suffice to say that the city and county merely considered them. <em>McMinnville, </em>244 Or App at 266 (\u201c[Application of all of the provisions in Goal 14 to the resulting UGB change is required ***.\u201d). Moreover, to the extent that the parties argue about substantial evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>we have reviewed the record and LUBA\u2019s decision, and we are persuaded that LUBA properly understood and applied its substantial evidence standard. <em>See Barkers Five, LLC v. LCDC, </em>261 Or App 259, 348, 323 P3d 368 (2014) (\u201c[O]ur role is not to review * * * for evidentiary support. Instead, we determine whether [the board] understood and applied the substantial-evidence standard correctly.\u201d). Therefore, we do not disturb LUBA\u2019s determinations that the city and county had not satisfied the requirements under ORS 197.298 and under the Goal 14 factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">B. <em>Cross-Petition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">We turn to Land Watch\u2019s cross-petition and address LUBA\u2019s rulings, both concerning the city\u2019s REA and future employment projections or \u201cforecasts.\u201d Land Watch characterizes LUBA\u2019s ruling as concluding that \u201cCoburg could use two methods of calculating the city\u2019s industrial land needs and add them together to determine its need for a UGB expansion for industrial land, when the methods are legally mutually exclusive.\u201d We address the cross-petition in two parts, as LUBA did. First, we consider LUBA\u2019s interpretation of OAR 660-024-0040(9)(a) to determine whether LUBA\u2019s interpretation of that \u201csafe harbor\u201d rule was unlawful in substance. Second, we consider LUBA\u2019s ruling that there was substantial evidence supporting the city\u2019s employment forecast\u2014that is, the issue of so-called \u201cdouble-counting\u201d of large-lot industrial jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">1. <em>OAR 660-024-0040(9) (a)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">LUBA ruled that the OAR 660-024-0040(9)(a) \u201csafe harbor\u201d does not preclude a city from considering additional demand for employment land, when completing an \u201cemployment forecast.\u201d As we will explain, we conclude that the ruling was not unlawful in substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Goal 9 provides that urban planning in comprehensive plans must \u201c[i]nclude an analysis of the community\u2019s economic patterns, potentialities, strengths, and deficiencies as they relate to state and national trends.\u201d OAR 660-015-0000(9); <em>see also </em>ORS 197.712(2) (codification of Goal 9 requirements for urban comprehensive plans). Several other administrative rules direct and focus the analysis under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>that Goal 9 requirement. At issue here is the city\u2019s application of the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provision, OAR 660-024-0040(9), which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-4\">\u201cThe following safe harbors may be applied by a local government to determine its employment needs for purposes of a UGB amendment under this rule, Goal 9, OAR chapter 660, division 9, Goal 14 and, if applicable, ORS 197.296.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-5\">\u201c(a) A local government may estimate that the <em>current number of jobs in the urban area </em>will grow during the 20-year planning period at a rate equal to either:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">\u201c(A) The county or regional job growth rate provided in the most recent forecast published by the Oregon Employment Department; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">\u201c(B) The population growth rate for the urban area in the appropriate 20-year coordinated population forecast determined under Rules in OAR 660, div 32.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">That rule cannot be read in isolation. As LUBA explained, OAR 660-024-0040(9) finds context in relation to another rule, OAR 660-009-0015, which addresses \u201ceconomic opportunities analyses\u201d (EOA). Cities and counties must engage in economic opportunities analyses, and those analyses must contain information required by that rule. The analyses should include the following information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-10\">\u201c(1) Review of National, State, Regional, County and Local Trends. The economic opportunities analysis must identify the major categories of industrial or other employment uses that could reasonably be expected to locate or expand in the planning area based on information about national, state, regional, county or local trends. This review of trends is the principal basis for estimating future industrial and other employment uses as described in section (4) of this rule. A use or category of use could reasonably be expected to expand or locate in the planning area if the area possesses the appropriate locational factors for the use or category of use. Cities and counties are strongly encouraged to analyze trends and establish employment projections in a geographic area larger than the planning area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>and to determine the percentage of employment growth reasonably expected to be captured for the planning area based on the assessment of community economic development potential pursuant to section (4) of this rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-4\">\u201c(2) Identification of Required Site Types. The economic opportunities analysis must identify the number of sites by type reasonably expected to be needed to accommodate the expected employment growth based on the site characteristics typical of expected uses. Cities and counties are encouraged to examine existing firms in the planning area to identify the types of sites that may be needed for expansion. ***.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-5\">\"****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">\u201c(4) Assessment of Community Economic Development Potential. The economic opportunities analysis must estimate the types and amounts of industrial and other employment uses likely to occur in the planning area. The estimate must be based on information generated in response to sections (1) to (3) of this rule and must consider the planning area\u2019s economic advantages and disadvantages. ***.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">OAR 660-009-0015.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">Read in that context, we agree with LUBA that the safe harbor set out under OAR 660-024-0040(9) does not preclude a city, in its EOA analysis or an \u201cemployment forecast,\u201d from considering other employment-based needs for a UGB expansion. A city is not precluded from projecting a need that considers additional employment opportunities from outside the urban area. A city may have many relevant considerations when estimating employment-based growth needs and is not bound by the safe harbor of OAR 660-024-0040(9) to consider the prescribed growth rate in isolation. Rather, as noted in OAR 660-009-0015(1), for example, \u201c[c]ities and counties are <em>strongly encouraged </em>to analyze trends and establish employment projections in a geographic area <em>larger </em>than the planning area and to determine the percentage of employment growth reasonably expected to be captured for the planning area based on the assessment of community economic development potential\u201d outlined under that rule. (Emphases added.) Therefore, OAR <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>660-024-0040(9) may limit a calculation of the 20-year projected growth of the \u201ccurrent number of jobs <em>in </em>the urban area.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The rule, however, does not prohibit a city from considering, as part of its overall analysis, growth from larger projected employment trends outside that urban growth area.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">2. <em>\u201cDouble-Counting\u201d in REA Employment Forecasts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Before LUBA and now again before this court, the parties disputed how Hovee arrived at the particular calculations in the REA for Scenarios Bl, B2, and B3, and whether those projections were permissibly calculated. At the heart of this argument is a chart titled, \u201cCoburg Industrial Scenarios with Regional Large Site Industrial Capture,\u201d prepared by Hovee. That chart is described as \u201cdepict [ing] results of alternative regional capture rates that might be considered in terms of resulting 20-acre land demand <em>added to </em>existing local industrial need as previously indicated for [Scenario A].\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">Land Watch challenges that, in determining a final employment-based land need, the city took a subset of the \u201cScenario A\u201d calculation and reused it in calculating \u201cScenario B.\u201d Relying on that understanding of the urbanization study, Land Watch asserts that, because the analysis reused the same subset of projected employment-based need, the analysis impermissibly \u201cresulted in a double-counting of employment need.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> That is, Land Watch contends that the projected land need was inflated, because both \u201cScenario A safe harbor and the add-on \u2018regional\u2019 Scenario Bl land need determinations identified 20+ acre parcel sizes as a necessary special site characteristic for industrial land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">In its response brief to LUBA, the city and county contended that Land Watch had misunderstood \u201cthe basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>behind\u201d the REA. They proposed a different understanding of the calculations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-4\">\u201c [T]he REA *** recognizes that an EOA based simply on anticipated economic growth derived strictly from expected population growth does not capture all the types of economic growth that can and will normally occur in a region. A regional analysis is based on the fact that there are types of industries that will seek to locate substantial facilities in a region and that have a tremendous flexibility as to where they can locate. Once the decision is made to locate in a region, the employers are opportunistic shoppers, seeking immediately available properties and will turn their attentions elsewhere if, for example, assembly of smaller parcels or major land use procedures need to occur before development can happen. <em>See, </em>R.753 (discussing approach of large-site industrial regional employers).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The city and county asserted that the REA did not double-count projected employment growth, because the REA considered \u201cadditional large site employers that might otherwise locate somewhere else on the west coast but may locate in Coburg if the conditions are right.\u201d (Underscoring in original.) Therefore, they maintained, the REA did not reuse the same subset of employment-based need, but rather included additional regional need that had not already been included in the EOA calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">LUBA reviewed for substantial evidence and concluded that Land Watch failed to demonstrate that there had been a \u201cdouble-counting of large-lot industrial jobs.\u201d We reiterate that the scope of our review is not to reexamine evidence or the strength of that evidence but rather review to ensure that LUBA understood and applied the substantial evidence standard correctly. Here, LUBA understood the city to assert another explanation for its projected employment-based land need. The city responded that it was not \u201cdouble-counting\u201d employment needs or jobs that had already been accounted for in the REA. The city\u2019s calculation anticipated a different source of jobs\u2014jobs that had not already been included in the EOA. LUBA concluded that Land Watch did not demonstrate that the calculations reflected the error that Land Watch had asserted. Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>our standard of review, we conclude that LUBA did not misapply the substantial evidence standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">For all those reasons, we affirm as to the petition and cross-petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Affirmed on petition and cross-petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b245-8\"> Land Watch and Kersten are jointly represented by counsel and did not file separate briefing.
