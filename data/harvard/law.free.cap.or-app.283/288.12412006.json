J.</author>\n<p id=\"b316-3\">Claimant was injured while working for Wend Magazine in part as an unpaid intern and in part on commission. Because Wend was a noncomplying employer, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Board reasoned that it could not determine a weekly wage for claimant, and it therefore awarded her the statutory minimum temporary disability benefit of $50 per week. <em>See </em>ORS 656.210 (specifications for temporary total disability benefits). The board rejected claimant\u2019s contention that claimant\u2019s benefits should be calculated based on Oregon\u2019s legal minimum wage. Although we agree with the board that Oregon\u2019s minimum wage does not provide the wage on which to base claimant\u2019s benefits in this case, we nonetheless conclude that the board erred in awarding weekly benefits of only $50, and we therefore reverse and remand for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">We summarize the relevant facts, which are largely undisputed, as reflected in the record and as found by the administrative law judge and adopted by the board. In July 2008, claimant began working part time as an unpaid intern for Wend Magazine, a magazine for sports enthusiasts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Claimant\u2019s work at Wend involved graphic design, selling advertising, and modeling sports clothing for photo shoots. Wend and claimant agreed that she would be paid a commission on the sale of advertising but that she would not be paid for her other work. After working approximately one month at Wend, claimant was injured on the job when she fell and broke her wrist while modeling skateboard clothing for a photo shoot. Claimant\u2019s wrist injury required surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Claimant filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim. A dispute arose about the amount of compensation to which claimant was entitled for temporary disability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At the time of her injury, claimant had not finalized any advertising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>sales and thus had not earned a commission. The board found that, although claimant had not received any compensation for her work at Wend at the time of her injury, she had an expectation of receiving compensation for advertising sales.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-4\">Workers\u2019 compensation benefits for temporary disability are based on the worker\u2019s weekly wage. <em>See </em>ORS 656.210; OAR 436-060-0025(5)(a). Because of Wend\u2019s noncomplying status, the board reasoned that it was unable to determine a weekly wage for claimant. In the absence of a weekly wage, the board determined that claimant was entitled to the statutory minimum benefit for temporary disability of $50 per week. <em>See </em>ORS 656.210(1). In rejecting claimant\u2019s contention that the wage rate on which to base claimant\u2019s benefits was the statutory minimum wage set forth in ORS chapter 653, the board explained in an order on reconsideration that its authority to determine claimant\u2019s benefits depended on the requirements of ORS chapter 656 and the administrative rules of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Division of the Department of Consumer and Business Services, and that the board had no authority to consider the requirements for payment of the minimum wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Claimant challenges that determination on judicial review, contending that, in the absence of an agreement between claimant and Wend as to claimant\u2019s wages, she was entitled to be paid the statutory minimum wage set forth in ORS chapter 653, and her benefits should be determined accordingly. Sedgwick responds that the board was correct in concluding that, as distinct from any entitlement that claimant might have under ORS chapter 653 to receive a minimum wage for the work that she performed for Wend, claimant\u2019s benefits for temporary disability are to be determined as provided in ORS chapter 656 and OAR 436-060-0025. Claimant\u2019s petition presents a question of statutory construction that we review for legal error. <em>Baker v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>257 Or App 205, 210, 305 P3d 139, <em>rev den, </em>354 Or 597 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>An injured worker is entitled to benefits for temporary disability under ORS 656.210, which provides, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-4\">\u201c(1) When the total disability is only temporary, the worker shall receive during the period of that total disability compensation equal to 66- 2/3 percent of wages, but not more than 133 percent of the average weekly wage nor less than the amount of 90 percent of wages a week or the amount of $50 a week, whichever amount is less. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">\u201c(2)(a) For the purpose of this section, the weekly wage of workers shall be ascertained:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">\u201c(A) For workers employed in one job at the time of injury, by multiplying the daily wage the worker was receiving by the number of days per week that the worker was regularly employed!.]\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">A worker\u2019s \u201cwage\u201d is \u201cthe money rate at which the service rendered is recompensed under the contract of hiring in force at the time of the accident.\u201d ORS 656.005(29).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">The department has promulgated OAR 436-060-0025(5), which describes methods for computing benefits for workers who, like claimant, are \u201cemployed with unscheduled, irregular or no earnings.\u201d OAR 436-060-0025(5) provides, as relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-9\">\u201cThe rate of compensation for workers regularly employed, but paid on other than a daily or weekly basis, or employed with unscheduled, irregular or no earnings shall be computed on the wages determined by this rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-10\">\u00ab* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-11\">\u201c(i) Covered workers with no wage earnings such as volunteers, jail inmates, etc., must have their benefits computed on the same assumed wage as that upon which the employer\u2019s premium is based.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>\u201c(j) For workers paid by commission only or commission plus wages insurers must use the worker\u2019s average commission earnings for previous 52 weeks, if available. For workers without 52 weeks of earnings, insurers must use the assumed wage on which premium is based. Any regular wage in addition to commission must be included in the wage from which compensation is computed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">For workers, like claimant, who have no wages, or who are paid on a commission and have less than 52 weeks of earnings, benefits must be calculated on \u201cthe assumed wage\u201d on which the employer\u2019s premium is based. OAR 436-060-0025(5)(i), (j). But the rule does not explicitly apply to claimant\u2019s circumstance because, as a noncomplying employer, Wend did not have an \u201cassumed wage\u201d at the time of claimant\u2019s injury. In the absence of an assumed wage, the board reasoned that it could not calculate claimant\u2019s wage rate and that claimant\u2019s weekly wage therefore was zero.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">ORS 653.025 specifies the minimum wage that Oregon employers must pay workers who are subject to that law. Claimant contends that, in the absence of an assumed wage on which to base claimant\u2019s benefits, the minimum wage to which she was legally entitled under ORS 653.025 must apply. Claimant bases her contention on <em>United Airlines v. Anderson, </em>207 Or App 493, 498, 142 P3d 508 (2006), in which we held that a collective bargaining agreement executed after the claimant\u2019s injury that included a retroactive wage increase was binding as of the date of the claimant\u2019s injury and was therefore the \u201ccontract of hiring in force at the time of the accident.\u201d Claimant contends that, analogously, in the absence of wages, the statutory minimum wage became the \u201ccontract of hiring in force at the time of the accident,\u201d and that is the wage on which her benefits must be based. Claimant disputes the board\u2019s rationale that it lacked the authority to apply the minimum wage, contending that, ancillary to its authority to determine claimant\u2019s benefits, the board had authority to determine whether the minimum wage applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">We need not decide whether the board was authorized to address minimum-wage issues in the context of its determination of claimant\u2019s entitlement to benefits for temporary disability. That is because we agree with Sedgwick that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>there is no textual support, in either ORS chapter 656 or ORS chapter 653, for claimant\u2019s view that, in the absence of an agreement by an employer to pay wages, the statutory minimum wage applies to the determination of a worker\u2019s benefits. There is no indication in the text or context of the pertinent statutes or administrative rules that minimum-wage laws have any bearing on the calculation of a worker\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\">But we nonetheless conclude that the board erred in applying a temporary disability rate of $50 per week. As noted, the board reasoned that it could not determine a weekly wage for claimant because Wend, as a noncomplying employer, had not paid a premium and therefore did not have an assumed wage on which its premium was based. <em>See </em>OAR 436-060-0025(5)(i), (j) (for workers with no wages, or who are paid on commission with less than 52 weeks of earnings, benefits must be calculated on \u201cthe assumed wage\u201d on which employer\u2019s premium is based.) The board\u2019s rationale is inconsistent with ORS 656.054(1), which provides that \u201c[a] compensable injury to a subject worker while in the employ of a noncomplying employer is compen-sable to the same extent as if the employer had complied with this chapter.\u201d Claimant\u2019s benefits for temporary disability should not be less than they would have been had Wend complied with its obligation to provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage. Had Wend complied with the workers\u2019 compensation law, claimant\u2019s benefits would have been calculated under OAR 436-060~0025(5)(i) or (j) using the \u201cassumed wage\u201d on which Wend\u2019s premium was based. Under OAR 436-080-0040, in determining the civil penalty to be assessed against a noncomplying employer, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Division is required to calculate the amount of \u201cpremium the employer would have paid during the noncomplying period if insurance had been provided.\u201d In the absence of insurance premiums actually paid by Wend at the time of the injury, we conclude that claimant\u2019s benefits should be calculated based on the assumed wage on which Wend\u2019s premium would have been based had Wend provided insurance. We therefore remand the board\u2019s order for reconsideration of temporary disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-6\"> As noted, Wend Magazine was a noncomplying employer; thus, the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services referred the processing of the claim to Sedgwick CMS, as the assigned claims agent. <em>See </em>ORS 656.054.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b316-7\"> Sedgwick also disputed claimant\u2019s employment status and the compensa-bility of the claim. In <em>Sedgwick v. </em>Rehfeld, 255 Or App 512, 298 P3d 68 (2013), we affirmed without opinion the board\u2019s order determining that claimant was a subject worker and that the claim was compensable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b317-6\"> Claimant also received the skateboard clothing that she had modeled for the photo shoot, valued at $300, but there is no contention that the clothing constituted compensation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b318-12\"> The record shows that claimant also worked part time as a server at a restaurant. We note that, under ORS 656.210 (2)(a)(B), the weekly wage of a worker employed in more than one job at the time of injury is to be determined by adding all earnings that the worker was receiving from all subject employment, if the employer receives timely notice and verification of the second employment as required by ORS 656.210(2)(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b318-13\"> The \u201caverage weekly wage\u201d is the Oregon average weekly wage in covered employment for the last quarter of the calendar year preceding the fiscal year in which the injury occurred.
