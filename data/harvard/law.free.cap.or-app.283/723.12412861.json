The trial court merged the guilty verdicts on Counts 1 and 2 into a single conviction, and entered a separate conviction on Count 3. On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to give a \u201cweaker and less satisfactory evidence\u201d jury instruction. We reject that assignment without written discussion. Defendant also assigns error to the entry of two first-degree sexual abuse convictions, arguing that the trial court should have merged the guilty verdict on Count 3 with the guilty verdicts on Counts 1 and 2; thus, the court should have entered a single conviction for first-degree sexual abuse for Counts 1 to 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">We agree with defendant that our recent decision in <em>State v. Nelson, </em>282 Or App 427, 386 P3d 73 (2016), supports merger of the guilty verdicts for Counts 1 to 3 into a single conviction. First, we rejected the argument in <em>Nelson </em>that the state makes here\u2014that ORS 161.067(3) does not apply because defendant\u2019s separate but successive acts of sexual contact do not constitute the \u201csame conduct or crim-, inal episode\u201d within the meaning of that statute. <em>Id. </em>at 442. Similarly, the state\u2019s argument on that point fails here.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Second, applying ORS 161.067(3) in <em>Nelson, </em>we determined that the record in that case did not contain sufficient evidence from which a trier of fact could have concluded that there was a \u201csufficient pause\u201d between the separate but successive acts of unlawful sexual contact. 282 Or App at 446-47. That is, the evidence did not support a nonspeculative inference that \u201csomething of significance\u201d occurred between the successive acts of sexual contact, and there was no evidence of a pause in the defendant\u2019s aggression sufficient to support a \u201cnonspeculative inference that each crime was separated from the others by a sufficient pause in defendant\u2019s conduct to afford him an opportunity to renounce his criminal intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447. In the absence of such evidence, the trial court erred in failing to merge multiple guilty verdicts for first-degree sexual abuse into a single conviction. The record in this case is similarly <em>deficient\u2014i.e., </em>there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>insufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding of a \u201csufficient pause.\u201d Accordingly, we reverse and remand for the trial court to enter a single conviction for first-degree sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">Reversed and remanded for entry of a single conviction for first-degree sexual abuse; remanded for resentenc-ing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
