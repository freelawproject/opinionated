Defendant raises six assignments of error. We write only to address defendant\u2019s first, third, and fifth assignments of error, and we reject the remainder without further discussion. In his first assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred when it overruled his objection to \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s staging of an emotional statement\u201d by the victim. In his third assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on the second count of first-degree rape. In his fifth assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred in imposing $16,000 in attorney fees without proof of his ability to pay them. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the portion of the judgment requiring defendant to pay attorney fees and otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">We state separately the facts pertinent to each of defendant\u2019s assignments of error. We begin with defendant\u2019s third assignment of error\u2014that the trial court erred by denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the second count of first-degree rape. We state the facts in the light most favorable to the state and review those facts to determine whether a rational trier of fact could have found defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>320 Or 47, 63, 880 P2d 431 (1994), <em>cert den, </em>514 US 1005 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">In December 2012, the victim and two of her close friends attended a meeting with a visiting counselor at their high school. During that meeting, one of the victim\u2019s friends disclosed that she had been sexually abused, and the counselor told a similar story involving one of the counselor\u2019s relatives. The victim then disclosed that, when she was younger, she had been the victim of similar abuse by defendant, her uncle. A few days after the victim\u2019s disclosure to the counselor, Officer Lundervold interviewed the victim. The victim told Officer Lundervold that, when she was younger, her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>mother would drop her off at defendant\u2019s residence so that defendant could babysit her while her mother went to work. The victim told Officer Lundervold that defendant \u201ctouched her everywhere on her body,\u201d used his hands to touch her breast area, put his fingers into her vagina on more than one occasion, put his penis into her mouth several times, and attempted to put his penis into her vagina \u201cat least twice.\u201d The victim explained that, during one of defendant\u2019s attempts of putting his penis into her vagina, she did not think that defendant put his penis \u201call the way in\u201d because she did not remember it hurting.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">As part of the state\u2019s investigation, the victim visited the Children\u2019s Center, where she was interviewed and physically examined. During the interview, the victim stated that defendant had touched her \u201cboobs\u201d underneath her clothing, put his fingers inside her vagina, and, on two occasions, tried to put his penis inside her vagina. The victim told the Children\u2019s Center interviewer that \u201cshe wasn\u2019t sure if [defendant\u2019s penis] went in all the way the first time, because it didn\u2019t hurt, but the second time [the victim] said it did hurt.\u201d The physical examination at the Children\u2019s Center revealed that the victim had a transected hymen, leading the evaluator to find that the victim\u2019s statements were consistent with the diagnosis of sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">At trial, the victim testified and reiterated her previous allegations. When asked whether defendant \u201center [ed] [her] vagina with his penis,\u201d the victim responded, \u201che wouldn\u2019t do it all the time, but I remember one time he did.\u201d Later, the prosecutor used a paper cup to analogize a vagina and asked the victim to distinguish between \u201ctouching on top\u201d and \u201cinsertion.\u201d The victim testified that both\u2014 touching and insertion\u2014happened \u201cat least twice.\u201d The prosecutor tried to clarify the victim\u2019s inconsistent testimony by asking how the victim knew that defendant\u2019s penis was inside of her. The victim testified that she knew it was not defendant\u2019s fingers inside of her because \u201cit would hurt more,\u201d defendant was lying on top of her, and that she was \u201ccertain it [happened] only once.\u201d Officer Lundervold testified regarding his interview with the victim. The Children\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Center nurse also testified regarding her physical examination of the victim and the interview she had witnessed the victim give at the Children\u2019s Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">At the close of the state\u2019s case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the second count of first-degree rape. As to that motion, the following arguments were made:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-5\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: First, I think there is one that we can\u2019t dispute, which is that [the victim] stated on the stand that she had only * * * had sexual intercourse once. As the Court is well aware, there are two charges of rape in the first degree that are charged as separate and distinct acts from each other. I think the record was abundantly clear. I made sure on cross-examination she said only once. She said it very, very clearly. \u2018Yes, I am sure it was only once.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAj\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: [The victim] clearly unequivocally said once. That\u2019s inconsistent with what she told the [Children\u2019s Center nurse] in some fashion. Or is it? Because the [Children\u2019s Center nurse] clarified that only one time it hurt. My interpretation of [the victim\u2019s] testimony was she clearly remembers one time, because it really hurt. The other one she seemed to be backing off of, disengaging from, stressing not so much.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-8\">\u201cThere is evidence there from the testimony from [the Children\u2019s Center nurse] that there were two times. This prosecutor is not going to be stressing that evidence. In my closing argument, I will be getting up and telling the jury that they can only find one rape, because I don\u2019t think there is sufficient evidence to prove beyond a reasonable doubt two. That\u2019s what I intend to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-9\">\u201cI think that would take care of this problem. There is, in the light most favorable to the State, evidence that suggests that this fact finder could believe that there are two, and the testimony of [the Children\u2019s\u2019 Center nurse], because that evidence is just as admissible as the direct testimony and witnesses are inconsistent all the time. Child witnesses are inconsistent all the time. There is evidence in the record that this is not uncommon. This is a matter of discretion for the jury; that the fact finder could find from this evidence that there were two.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal. During the prosecution\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-4\">\u201cThere were two rape in the first degree charges, and they relate, if you recall, [the Children\u2019s Center nurse], the fact as she testified, the interview at the Children\u2019s Center, [the victim] talked about two times. One time she wasn\u2019t sure it went all the way in, but the second time it hurt more, and she was sure about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">\u201cYou heard [the victim] on the stand say once; only once. That is a conflict in testimony. She said, according to [the Children\u2019s Center nurse], at one point it happened twice. She said on the stand it happened once. There is a way to wrestle with that and make truth of it, if you believe [the victim], which is that her uncertainty about whether it went in or not when she was talking at the Children\u2019s Center is what she has crystallized in her mind as not being a fair assumption that it may have in fact been completed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-7\">\u201cSo [the victim] has rested on one, but I am going to tell you something right off the bat. As a prosecutor, as an officer of the Court, sworn to do justice, I do not think that you should deliberate on two counts of rape. I think you should find not guilty on one of them immediately, because there is a conflict in this testimony where she says it happened twice at the Children\u2019s Center, and on the stand she says it happened once and only once.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-8\">\u201cI am inviting you. You don\u2019t have to follow my lead. This is merely argument. You decide. I am inviting you to deliberate on one count, because I don\u2019t believe in good faith I can argue to you that I can prove beyond a reasonable doubt two rapes\u2014penetration of the vagina. If you want to spend time finding that evidence, it is there, but it is more tenuous. * * * But that is up to you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">Before submitting the case to the jury, the court instructed the jury that, \u201cthe lawyers\u2019 statements and arguments are not evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-10\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal on the second charge of first-degree rape. Defendant contends that, because the victim testified that it \u201conly [happened] once,\u201d and the only other evidence was statements made by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>Officer Lundervold and the Children\u2019s Center nurse, there was insufficient evidence to support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant actually penetrated the victim\u2019s vagina on two occasions. Moreover, defendant argues that the trial court erred in submitting the second charge of first-degree rape to the jury after the state conceded that it had failed to prove that charge. In response, the state argues that the evidence was sufficient to allow a guilty verdict on the second charge of first-degree rape, especially in light of the Children\u2019s Center nurse\u2019s testimony. The state also contends that it did not concede that a judgment of acquittal should be granted; rather, from the prosecutor\u2019s statements \u201cit can be inferred that the prosecutor believed the charge should not be taken from the jury, but at the same time, he did not intend to press the issue in closing argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">ORS 163.375(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-5\">\u201cA person who has sexual intercourse with another person commits the crime of rape in the first degree if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-6\">\u00ab\u2021\u215c\u2021\u2021 \u215b</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b109-7\">\u201c(b) The victim is under 12 years of age.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">ORS 163.305(7) defines \u201csexual intercourse\u201d as having \u201cits ordinary meaning and occurs upon <em>any penetration, however slight[.]\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">We conclude that the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal. The victim testified that defendant \u201centered\u201d her vagina with his penis \u201cone time,\u201d that he \u201cinsert [ed]\u201d his penis into her vagina \u201cat least twice,\u201d and that, as to those two occasions, it hurt only one time. Officer Lundervold testified that the victim initially reported that defendant attempted to put his penis into her vagina \u201cat least twice,\u201d but that, as to one occasion, she was not sure that defendant\u2019s penis was \u201call the way in\u201d because she did not remember it hurting. Similarly, the Children\u2019s Center nurse testified that, during the interview at the Children\u2019s Center, the victim told the interviewer that \u201cshe wasn\u2019t sure if [defendant\u2019s penis] went in all the way the first time, because it didn\u2019t hurt, but the second time [the victim] said it did hurt.\u201d The Children\u2019s Center nurse also testified that the physical examination of the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>revealed that she had a transected hymen, consistent with the victim\u2019s reports of sexual abuse. The victim consistently reported and testified that defendant attempted to insert his penis into her vagina \u201cat least twice,\u201d but that on one of those occasions, she was unsure that his penis was completely inside of her vagina. This presents a question of degree of penetration, not whether penetration actually occurred. Thus, despite the victim\u2019s inconsistent testimony regarding the degree of penetration, because \u201csexual intercourse\u201d is defined in ORS 163.305(7) as <em>\u201cany penetration, however slight\u201d </em>(emphasis added), there was sufficient evidence for a rational trier of fact to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed two counts of first-degree rape. <em>See State v. Wolfe, </em>56 Or App 795, 800, 643 P2d 404 (1982) (holding that there was sufficient evidence of penetration to sustain conviction for first-degree rape even though testimony of the victim was equivocal and fraught with inconsistencies).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\">As part of defendant\u2019s argument concerning the denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal, defendant contends that the trial court erred in submitting the second charge of first-degree rape to the jury \u201cafter the state conceded that it had failed to prove [that] charge.\u201d We reject that contention. While the prosecutor stated <em>in arguments </em>during the motion for judgment of acquittal that the victim stated penetration occurred only one time, he also reiterated in those same arguments that there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find that defendant committed two counts of first-degree rape. In any event, the prosecutor\u2019s arguments, made outside the presence of the jury during the motion for judgment of acquittal, and later during closing argument, were not evidence that the jury could consider in its deliberations. Furthermore, the trial court instructed the jury that the lawyers\u2019 statements and arguments were not evidence. <em>See State v. Washington, </em>355 Or 612, 660-61, 330 P3d 596, <em>cert </em>den, _ US _, 135 S Ct 685 (2014) (\u201cabsent an overwhelming probability that they would have been unable to do so, jurors are presumed to have followed their instructions,\u201d including the instruction that the \u201clawyer\u2019s statements and arguments are not evidence\u201d) (citing <em>State v. Smith, </em>310 Or 1, 26, 791 P2d 836 (1990)). Thus, because the prosecutor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>arguments were not evidence that the jury could consider in deliberations, and because the jury was properly instructed on that point, the trial court did not err in submitting the second charge of first-degree rape to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">In his first assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court erred by overruling his objection to \u201cthe prosecutor\u2019s staging an emotional statement by\u201d the victim. Defendant argues that the victim improperly vouched for her own credibility when, in response to the prosecutor\u2019s question, she looked defendant in the eye and told defendant \u201cthis is the truth.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state responds that the victim\u2019s testimony was not impermissible vouching, because the victim was stating that she <em>herself was </em>telling the truth during her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Defendant\u2019s assignment of error stems from the following colloquy between the prosecutor and the victim during the victim\u2019s direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">\u201cQ: Now, [victim], I don\u2019t want to make you uncomfortable. But can you look your uncle [defendant] in the eye and tell him that this is the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-7\">\u201cA: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-8\">\u201cQ: Would you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-9\">\u201cA: In Spanish or in English?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-10\">\u201cQ: Whichever [.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-11\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Judge, I would object. This is vouching.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: Vouching for whom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-13\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: She is vouching for her own credibility. It is kind of a dramatic presentation where she is just promising again that this is the truth, and it is being done * * * kind [of] for the drama of it. I object. It is not appropriate for her to promise that this is the truth to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>\u201cTHE COURT: I\u2019m going to allow it. Go ahead.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-4\">\u201c [THE VICTIM]: (Speaking Spanish) Este es la verdad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-5\">\u201c [PROSECUTOR]: Can we have that interpreted back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">\u201cTHE INTERPRETER: \u2018This is the truth.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">\u201cIt is settled in Oregon that one witness may not testify about the credibility of another witness.\u201d <em>State v. James, </em>279 Or App 612, 622, 379 P3d 626 (2016) (citing <em>State v. Sanchez-Jacobo, </em>250 Or App 621, 630, 282 P3d 880 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 280 (2013)). \u201c[A] witness *** may not give an opinion on whether he believes [another] witness is telling the truth.\u201d <em>State v. Middleton, </em>294 Or 427, 438, 657 P2d 1215 (1983). However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-8\">\u201c[a] witness\u2019s assertion under oath that *** she is being truthful simply is not the type of evidence that a jury might improperly view as a \u2018guarantee of the witness\u2019s veracity.\u2019 *** Stated differently, a witness does not impermissibly \u2018vouch for\u2019 or \u2018bolster\u2019 * * * her <em>own </em>testimony by proclaiming truthfulness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-10\"><em>Sanchez-Jacobo, </em>250 Or App at 631 (emphasis in original; citations omitted). Here, the victim\u2019s testimony did not amount to impermissible vouching. As noted, vouching is improper when one witness testifies as to the credibility of another witness. In this case, the victim, in response to the prosecutor\u2019s question, proclaimed that she was telling the truth. By proclaiming her own truthfulness, the victim did not impermissibly \u201cvouch for\u201d her own testimony. Accordingly, the trial court properly overruled defendant\u2019s objection to the challenged testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">We turn to defendant\u2019s remaining assignment of error. In his fifth assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred when it imposed $16,000 in attorney fees. Defendant acknowledges that his claim of error is unpreserved but asks us to review and correct the error as \u201can error of law apparent on the record,\u201d ORAP 5.45(1), or \u201cplain error.\u201d In response, the state argues that any error is not plain. The state argues that the record contains some evidence that defendant may be able to pay the fee, and, thus, no error by the trial court is obvious.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>\u201cThere are three requirements for plain error review under ORAP 5.45(1): (1) the error must be an error of law; (2) it must be apparent, in that the legal point is obvious, not reasonably in dispute; and (3) it must appear on the record such that we need not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences to find it, and the facts that comprise the error are irrefutable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-5\"><em>State v. Coverstone, </em>260 Or App 714, 715, 320 P3d 670 (2014) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">Here, defendant contends that the trial court lacked the statutory authority to impose court-appointed attorney fees in the absence of any evidence of defendant\u2019s ability to pay, citing ORS 151.505(3) and ORS 161.665(4). \u201cEach of those statutes provides that a court may not order a defendant to pay the fees unless the defendant \u2018is or may be able\u2019 to pay them.\u201d <em>Coverstone, </em>260 Or App at 715. The state bears the burden of proving that that requirement has been satisfied. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>State v. Kanuch, </em>231 Or App 20, 24, 217 P3d 1082 (2009)).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">Here, the state argues that the record contains sufficient evidence of defendant\u2019s ability to pay the court-appointed attorney fees. The state points to defense counsel\u2019s direct examination of defendant where defendant discussed his employment history. Defendant testified that he worked as a store manager from 2001-2005, in a restaurant in Mexico in 2006, as a lot attendant at Premier Ford from 2007-2008, and as a lot attendant at Gresham Ford from 2009-2012, when this case began. During sentencing, however, the state did not request that court-appointed attorney fees be imposed. In sentencing defendant to 600 months\u2019 imprisonment, the trial court stated, \u201cI will impose the court-appointed attorney fees as well, given that [former appointed defense counsel] was involved in this case and received compensation.\u201d However, \u201cthere is no evidence that, as of the time of sentencing, defendant possessed assets sufficient to satisfy the award of fees or that he would receive income during his lengthy incarceration that could be applied toward that obligation.\u201d <em>State v. Mejia-Espinoza, </em>267 Or App 682, 684, 341 P3d 180 (2014), <em>rev den, </em>357 Or 164 (2015) (evidence that defendant had worked in the past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>as a field worker and firefighter was insufficient to support a finding that defendant had the ability to pay attorney fees because the record contained no information about defendant\u2019s historic earnings or his future employability).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">\u201cWhen a plain error is established, we still must determine if it is appropriate to exercise our discretion to correct the error[.]\u201d <em>Coverstone, </em>260 Or App at 716 (citing <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382, 823 P2d 956 (1991)). In determining whether to exercise our discretion, we consider, among other things,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b114-5\">\u201cthe competing interests of the parties; the nature of the case; the gravity of the error; the ends of justice in the particular case; how the error came to the court\u2019s attention; and whether the policies behind the general rule requiring preservation of error have been served in the case in another way[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b114-6\"><em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6. Here, the error is grave. Defendant was ordered to pay $16,000 and sentenced to consecutive mandatory-minimum sentences totaling 600 months\u2019 imprisonment. Defendant\u2019s earliest release date would occur when defendant is in his 80s, and the record contains no evidence that defendant could or would be able to pay that substantial sum. <em>See Coverstone, </em>260 Or App at 717 (exercising discretion to correct error where the record contained no evidence of the defendant\u2019s financial resources and the defendant was sentenced to 375 months\u2019 imprisonment); <em>Mejia-Espinoza, </em>267 Or App at 685 (exercising discretion to correct error under similar circumstances). Thus, the trial court plainly erred in imposing court-appointed attorney fees without sufficient evidence that defendant was or might be able to pay those fees, and we exercise our discretion to correct that error.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Portion of judgment requiring defendant to pay attorney fees reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b111-14\"> Defendant also argues that the prosecutor asking the victim to make the statement amounted to improper vouching of the victim\u2019s credibility. However, we do not address that argument, as defendant did not preserve it nor did he request plain error review. ORAP 5.45.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
