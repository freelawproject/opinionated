J.</author>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">Petitioner, an inmate at respondent Two Rivers Correctional Facility, challenges the temporary and permanent amendments to OAR 291-130-0016(3), in which the telephone service provider of respondent Department of Corrections (the department) is authorized to impose a \u201cservice fee\u201d in the event that an inmate participates in a three-way call or any form of call forwarding. Petitioner also challenges the associated rule posted by the department\u2019s telephone service provider, Telmate, which declares a fine of $25 for participating in call-forwarding or a three-way call. According to petitioner, the amended rules constitute an unlawful delegation of authority to Telmate and, thus, exceed the department\u2019s statutory authority under the Administrative Procedures Act (the APA), ORS chapter 183. Because we conclude that the challenged rules are \u201crules of conduct,\u201d ORS 183.310(9)(f), and not \u201crules\u201d for the purposes of APA review, ORS 183.400, we dismiss the petition for judicial review.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The department updated its inmate telephone system and adopted temporary and permanent rules to accommodate the update in 2012. One of those rules, OAR 291-130-0016(3), forbids inmates from participating in three-way calls or call forwarding as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">\u201cInmates shall not participate in three-way calls or any form of call forwarding. An inmate may be assessed a service fee from the inmate telephone service provider if it is verified he/she has participated in a three-way call or any form of call forwarding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Formerly, OAR 291-130-0016(3) prohibited participation in three-way calls or call forwarding without mention that the telephone service provider could assess a service fee. Telmate has furnished \u201cFacility Telephone Rules,\u201d which relevantly provide that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>\u201c[a]ny attempt to make a 3-way call will result in $25 fine by Telmate, even if the 3-way call was made by another inmate\u20143-way calls are never allowed. If you make a 3-way call and your account has insufficient funds, this will result in a negative balance. A deposit will be required to bring your account positive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">(Boldface in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">OAR 291-130-0016 is authorized and adopted under ORS 179.040, which permits the department to enter into service contracts and to make and adopt rules in accordance with those contracts as part of its duty to \u201c [g] overn, manage and administer\u201d prisons. <em>See also </em>ORS 276.222 (allowing the Department of Administrative Services (DAS) to contract for telephone services); ORS 179.065 (granting the department the same power as DAS to contract for telephone services).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Under ORS 183.400(1), petitioner seeks to have us determine the validity of OAR 291-130-0016(3) and Telmate\u2019s $25 fine as set out in the Facility Telephone Rules, raising three assignments of error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He first contends that the department\u2019s amendment of OAR 291-130-0016(3) constitutes an unlawful delegation of its rulemaking authority to a nongovernmental agency. In his remaining assignments, petitioner argues that, if the rule amendment was not an unlawful delegation, it violated rulemaking procedures, namely, that the department failed to comply with ORS 183.355(l)(b)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that the department\u2019s fiscal-impact statement was inadequate. All of petitioner\u2019s assignments presuppose that OAR 291-130-0016(3) and the Facility Telephone Rule are \u201crules\u201d subject to our review under ORS 183.400. The department argues otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">The department contends that the challenged rule is a \u201crule of conduct\u201d excepted from the APA. Under ORS 183.310(9), a \u201crule\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>\u201cany agency directive, standard, regulation or statement of general applicability that implements, interprets or prescribes law or policy, or describes the procedure or practice requirements of any agency. The term includes the amendment or repeal of a prior rule. The term includes the amendment or repeal of a prior rule, but does not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-4\">\u2021 \u2021 \u215c \u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">\u201c(f) Rules of conduct for persons committed to the physical and legal custody of the Department of Corrections, the violation of which will not result in:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">\u201c(A) Placement in segregation or isolation status in excess of seven days.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">\u201c(B) Institutional transfer or other transfer to secure confinement status for disciplinary reasons.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">\u201c(C) Disciplinary procedures adopted pursuant to ORS 421.180.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANjn\">We have addressed previously a number of rule challenges in which we concluded that the challenged rules were rules of conduct and, thus, not subject to our review. In <em>Smith v. OSP, </em>113 Or App 386, 387, 832 P2d 1270 (1992), we held that a directive prioritizing inmate access to the law library was \u201ca rule of conduct\u201d under what is now ORS 183.310(9)(f). In <em>Smith v. Dept. of Corrections, </em>251 Or App 775, 777, 284 P3d 1244 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 533 (2013), we similarly concluded that a \u201cNotice of Rights,\u201d which announced that an inmate could be excluded from participation in disciplinary hearings for \u201cinappropriate behavior,\u201d was a \u201crule of conduct.\u201d Further, in <em>Smith v. TRCI, </em>259 Or App 11, 17-18, 312 P3d 568 (2013), we concluded that an announcement in a department newsletter that possession of nude images would be confiscated was not reviewable because the confiscation of nude images was a rule of conduct that could not \u201cresult in disciplinary sanctions or procedures specified in ORS 183.310(9)(f).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">OAR 291-130-0016 likewise regulates inmate conduct. The rule forbids inmates from participating in three-way calls or any form of call forwarding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> If it is verified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>that an inmate has done so, then Telmate may consequently assess a \u201cservice fee.\u201d OAR 291-130-0016. Such a rule (with Telmate\u2019s associated rule providing for the $25 fine) is a \u201crule of conduct\u201d that does not result in the disciplinary sanctions or procedures set out in ORS 183.310(9)(f) and, accordingly, is not a \u201crule\u201d subject to our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-3\">Petitioner\u2019s arguments to the contrary are unavailing. First, petitioner asserts that the \u201crules of conduct\u201d exception does not apply because the exceptions to the definition of \u201crule,\u201d ORS 183.310(9), including the \u201crules of conduct\u201d exception, \u201capply only if the rule is not an amendment or repeal of a prior existing rule.\u201d In petitioner\u2019s view, the second sentence of ORS 183.310(9)\u2014the \u201cterm [\u2018rule\u2019] includes the amendment or repeal of a prior rule, but does not include the following exceptions\u201d\u2014\u201cconditionally\u201d provides for six exceptions, and the \u201ccondition\u201d is that exceptions are not an \u201camendment or repeal of a prior rule.\u201d We disagree. The two clauses independently expand or limit the meaning of \u201crule\u201d: The first clause clarifies that the definition of \u201crule\u201d includes amendments and repeals, and the second clause provides that a \u201crule\u201d does not include the exceptions set out in subsections (a) - (f).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">Second, petitioner argues that OAR 291-130-0016(3) is not a rule of conduct because it affects members of the public who are not inmates. Petitioner posits that, because an inmate cannot on his or her own forward a call or make a three-way call, such conduct necessarily involves a third party. Further, in petitioner\u2019s view, enforcement of the rule could affect the third party because that person\u2019s prepaid account could be charged the service fee. The rule, however, specifically prohibits <em>inmates </em>from participating in call forwarding or three-way calls. Further, petitioner\u2019s argument that third parties could be assessed a service fee is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>also inconsistent with the text of the rule, which states that <em>\u201cinmates </em>may be assessed a service fee.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Finally, petitioner contends that the \u201cservice fee\u201d is equivalent to a fine sanction that may be imposed, and that has actually been enforced, by way of disciplinary proceedings authorized by ORS 421.180 and ORS 421.105. Even if that is correct, that OAR 291-130-0016(3) is enforced by additional measures does not mean that the rule of conduct falls under one of the sanctions or procedures specified in ORS 183.310(9)(f). Specifically, ORS 183.310(9)(f)(C) provides an exception for \u201c [disciplinary procedures <em>adopted pursuant </em>to ORS 421.180.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Here, OAR 291-130-0016(3) is authorized and adopted under ORS 179.140 (the department\u2019s authority to contract) and not under ORS 421.180.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In sum, OAR 291-130-0016(3) and the related Facility Telephone Rule are rules of conduct that are not subject to our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Petition for judicial review dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b452-8\"> Petitioner initially filed his petition for review challenging the temporary rule and Telmate\u2019s rule, and later filed an amended petition to challenge the superseding permanent rule. Because the temporary rule was replaced by the permanent rule, the challenge to the temporary rule is moot. See <em>Reid v. DCBS, </em>235 Or App 397, 401, 232 P3d 994 (2010) (stating same). We note that the temporary rule described the assessment by the telephone service provider as a \u201cfine\u201d rather than a \u201cservice fee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b453-8\"> ORS 183.400(1) provides, in relevant part, that the \u201cvalidity of any rule may be determined upon a petition by any person to the Court of Appeals in the manner provided for review of orders in contested cases.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b453-9\"> ORS 183.355(l)(b) requires that an agency adopting a rule incorporating published standards by reference must file with the Secretary of State a certified copy of the adopted rule. If the rule is \u201cunusually voluminous\u201d and \u201ccostly to reproduce,\u201d the agency must identify the \u201clocation of the standards so incorporated and the conditions of their availability to the public.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b454-11\"> Inmates\u2019 use of telephone services implicates safety and security concerns. <em>See </em>OAR 291-130-0016(13) (\u201cOther inmate telephone services or restrictions, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>specifically addressed in this rule, may be implemented for safety and security reasons[.]\u201d); OAR 291-130-0016(11) (\u201cThe department may prohibit an inmate from calling a particular person or phone number when requested by the person, or in the case of a minor child, by the child\u2019s parent or legal guardian.\u201d); OAR 291-130-0016(2) (\u201cThe functional unit manager or designee has the authority to restrict telephone calls by an inmate if the safety of the public would be involved, or the security of the facility, or safety and welfare of any person would be jeopardized.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b456-7\"> Petitioner\u2019s argument is without support in the record, and, even if there were such evidence, it would be error for us to consider it because \u201cour review in a rule challenge brought under ORS 183.400 is limited to an examination of\u2018[t]he rule under review,\u2019 \u2018[t]he statutory provisions authorizing the rule,\u2019 and \u2018[c]opies of all documents necessary to demonstrate compliance with applicable rulemak-ing procedures.\u2019\u201d <em>Rivas v.
