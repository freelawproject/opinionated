Defendant appeals, challenging the court\u2019s designation of the crime as a crime \u201cconstituting domestic violence\u201d and the court\u2019s imposition of attorney fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">The state concedes that the \u201ctrial court\u2019s insertion of the phrase \u2018constituting domestic violence\u2019 in Count 1 of the judgment of conviction appears to be a clerical error,\u201d noting that \u201cthe record appears to reflect a stipulation not to pursue [the domestic violence] element.\u201d We agree with the state\u2019s assessment and remand for entry of a corrected judgment that deletes all references to the \u201cconstituting domestic violence\u201d element from the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The state also concedes that the trial court plainly erred by imposing the court-appointed attorney fees and that we should exercise our discretion to correct that error. We accept the state\u2019s concession and, for reasons similar to those expressed in <em>State v. Baker, </em>278 Or App 327, 328, 372 P3d 656 (2016), exercise our discretion to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Remanded for entry of a corrected judgment deleting all references to the \u201cconstituting domestic violence\u201d element; portion of the judgment requiring defendant to pay attorney fees reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b515-7\"> ORS 132.568 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-8\">\u201c(2) When a crime involves domestic violence, the accusatory instrument may plead, and the prosecution may prove at trial, domestic violence as an element of the crime. When a crime is so pleaded, the words \u2018constituting domestic violence\u2019 may be added to the title of the crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b515-9\"> Defendant also challenges an evidentiary ruling by the court and its imposition of an upward departure sentence.
