In light of that conclusion, we dismiss as moot Warrenton\u2019s cross-appeal, which assigns error to the denial of Warrenton\u2019s petition for attorney fees under ORS 183.497(1)\u2014a provision that applies only \u201cif the court finds in favor of the petitioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">We begin by explaining the statutory context out of which the parties\u2019 dispute arises. Under Oregon\u2019s biomass tax credit program, an \u201cagricultural producer\u201d or \u201cbiomass collector\u201d is allowed a tax credit for the \u201cproduction\u201d or \u201ccollection\u201d of \u201cbiomass in Oregon that is used, in Oregon, as biofuel or to produce biofuel.\u201d ORS 315.141(3)(a). The legislature has charged the ODOE with the task of establishing procedures and criteria for determining the amount of the credit, and with providing \u201cwritten certification to taxpayers that are eligible to claim the credit[.j\u201d ORS 315.141(5)(a). As pertinent to this appeal, the legislature has defined \u201cbiomass,\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>\u201corganic matter that is available on a renewable or recurring basis and that is derived from:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-4\">\u201c(A) Forest or rangeland woody debris from harvesting or thinning conducted to improve forest or rangeland ecological health and reduce uncharacteristic stand replacing wildfire risk[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">ORS 315.141(1)(d). At the time that Warrenton sought the disputed certification, OAR 330-170-0040(1) provided, as pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">\u201cFor the purposes of these rules biomass does not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">\u00ab* * * * \u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-8\">\u201c(c) Sawdust or other residual wood waste from mill operations [.] \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Warrenton purchased pulp logs, which it hauled to its facility, stripped off the bark, and turned the remaining portion of logs into wood chips. Warrenton sold some of the stripped bark as \u201chog fuel\u201d and sought a biomass tax credit certification from ODOE for $97,690.70 against the taxes due for its sale of the hog fuel. ODOE denied the application on the basis of OAR 330-170-0040(l)(c). Warrenton sought review in the circuit court pursuant to ORS 183.484, which provides for judicial review of an order in other than a contested case. Warrenton alleged that ODOE improperly denied the application because OAR 330-170-0040(l)(c), was invalid or, alternatively, because ODOE misinterpreted the rule when it applied it to Warrenton\u2019s application. The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment, and the trial court agreed with Warrenton\u2019s claim that the rule is invalid.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As to that claim, the court granted Warrenton\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied ODOE\u2019s motion. The court remanded to ODOE for a determination of whether Warrenton\u2019s application met the other requirements for the biomass tax credit. On appeal, ODOE assigns error both to the denial of its motion for summary judgment and to the granting of Warrenton\u2019s motion on the claim that the rule is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">In reviewing an agency order, the court is authorized by ORS 183.400(4) to declare the rule invalid only if the court determines that the rule \u201cviolates constitutional provisions, exceeds the statutory authority of the agency that adopted the rule, or was adopted without complying with rulemaking procedures.\u201d <em>Assn. of Acupuncture v. Bd. of Chiropractic Examiners, </em>260 Or App 676, 678, 320 P3d 575 (2014). Here, Warrenton does not contend that the rule is unconstitutional or that ODOE adopted the rule without complying with rulemaking procedures, so we consider whether the rule exceeds ODOE\u2019s statutory authority. In this context, our review of the rule\u2019s validity is limited to \u201cthe wording of the rule itself (read in context) and the statutory provisions authorizing the rule.\u201d <em>Wolf v. Oregon Lottery Commission, </em>344 Or 345, 355, 182 P3d 180 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">There is no dispute that ODOE is generally authorized to \u201c[a]dopt rules and issue orders to carry out the duties of the director and the State Department of Energy,\u201d and those duties specifically include certifying biomass tax credits. ORS 469.040(l)(d); <em>see also </em>ORS 315.141 (designating ODOE responsibility for biomass tax credits and certification). Warrenton argues, however, and the trial court agreed, that the rule exceeds ODOE\u2019s authority because it excludes from the definition of \u201cbiomass\u201d material to which the legislature intended to extend the tax credit. We disagree.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">The parties\u2019 dispute primarily turns on whether the rule is consistent with ORS 315.141(l)(d)(A), which\u2014as quoted above\u2014defines \u201cbiomass\u201d to include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">\u201corganic matter that i's available on a renewable or recurring basis and that is derived from:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-8\">\u201c(A) Forest or rangeland woody debris from harvesting or thinning conducted to improve forest or rangeland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>ecological health and reduce uncharacteristic stand replacing wildfire risk[.]\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-3\">As construed by ODOE, that definition is consistent with OAR 330-170-0040(l)(c) because the statute identifies woody debris biomass according to the direct source of the debris, and \u201cresidual wood waste from mill operations\u201d describes a different source than \u201c [f] orest or rangeland woody debris from harvesting or thinning.\u201d Warrenton urges us to construe the statutory definition as reaching woody residue created from mill operations if the trees used in those mill operations originally came \u201cfrom harvesting or thinning conducted to improve forest or rangeland ecological health and reduce uncharacteristic stand replacing wildfire risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">A. <em>Standard of Review\u2014Exact, Inexact and Delegative Terms</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">When an agency\u2019s construction of a statute is at issue, our standard of review depends upon whether the phrase at issue is an exact term, an inexact term, or a del-egative term. <em>Coast Security Mortgage Corp. v. Real Estate Agency, </em>331 Or 348, 353, 15 P3d 29 (2000) (citing <em>Springfield Education Assn v. School Dist., </em>290 Or 217, 223, 621 P2d 547 (1980)). Exact terms \u201cimpart relatively precise meaning,\u201d for example, \u201c21 years of age, male, 30 days[.]\u201d <em>Springfield Education Assn, </em>290 Or at 223. Inexact terms are less precise but still \u201cembody a complete expression of legislative meaning.\u201d <em>Coast Security Mortgage Corp., </em>331 Or at 354. The court reviews the agency\u2019s construction of inexact terms \u201cfor consistency with legislative intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, delegative terms \u201cexpress incomplete legislative meaning\u201d and leave to the agency the task of completing \u201cthe general legislative policy decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court has cited terms such as \u201cgood cause,\u201d \u201cfair,\u201d \u201cundue,\u201d and \u201cunreasonable\u201d as examples of \u201cdelegative terms.\u201d <em>Springfield Education Assn, </em>290 Or at 228. Only when the legislature has used a delega-tive term does the court defer to the agency\u2019s determination of the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Id. </em>at 229.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>ODOE contends that the phrase at issue\u2014\u201c[f] orest or rangeland woody debris from harvesting or thinning\u201d\u2014is a delegative term, but we conclude that it is an inexact term. The term at issue is \u201cinexact\u201d because it reflects the legislature\u2019s intent to define the organic material that is \u201cbiomass.\u201d It is not simply a general policy decision regarding biomass, but it is susceptible to competing interpretations. <em>See Coast Security Mortgage Corp., </em>331 Or at 354 (concluding that the phrase at issue was \u201can \u2018inexact term\u2019 because, although parts of that phrase are defined by statute and embody a complete expression of legislative meaning, the phrase is open to various interpretations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">B. <em>Statutory Construction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">As indicated above, the question for the court when reviewing an agency\u2019s construction of inexact statutory terms is whether that construction is consistent with the legislature\u2019s intent. <em>Coast Security Mortgage Corp., </em>331 Or at 354. Determining the meaning of the statute is a question of law, ultimately for the court. <em>Springfield Education Assn, </em>290 Or at 224. As with other questions of statutory construction, in determining the scope of an agency\u2019s statutory authority, \u201cwe seek to discern the legislature\u2019s intent by examining the text and context of the relevant statutes and, if useful to the analysis, pertinent legislative history.\u201d <em>Assn. of Acupuncture, </em>260 Or App at 678 (citing <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009)). Here, the text and context of ORS 315.141(1)(d)(A) lead us to conclude that the legislature intended to make the biomass tax credit available when woody debris is removed from the forest <em>as debris </em>and sold for biofuel.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">1. <em>Textual analysis of ORS 315.141(1) (d) (A)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">First, we agree with ODOE that the text\u2014 \u201c[f] orest or rangeland woody debris from harvesting or thinning\u201d\u2014suggests a legislative intent to identify woody biomass according to the method by, and location at which, the debris is created. Rather than extend the definition of biomass to all woody debris, the legislature limited the category according to the location of the debris\u2014\u201c[f] orest or rangeland\u201d-\u2014-and the process by which the debris is created\u2014\u201cfrom harvesting or thinning.\u201d The legislature did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>not define the term \u201cdebris,\u201d and it is not a legal or technical term, so we look to the plain and ordinary meaning of the term. <em>See State v. Dickerson, </em>356 Or 822, 829, 343 P3d 447 (2015) (\u201cWhen the legislature does not provide a definition of a statutory term, we ordinarily look to the plain meaning of the statute\u2019s text to determine what particular terms mean.\u201d). The ordinary meaning of \u201cdebris\u201d is \u201cthe remains of something broken down or destroyed.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>582 (unabridged ed 1993). The qualification that this woody debris (or remains) must be \u201cforest or range-land\u201d debris suggests that the location of the debris must be a forest or rangeland. And the further qualification that the remains must be \u201cfrom harvesting or thinning\u201d suggests a direct connection to those activities. <em>See Webster\u2019s </em>at 913 (as pertinent, defining \u201cfrom\u201d as \u201ca function word\u201d used \u201cto indicate the source or original or moving force of something\u201d). Thus, the text suggests a legislative intent to allow a biomass tax credit for woody remains that are located in the forest or rangeland and directly related to a harvesting or thinning operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">2. <em>Statutory context</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">That construction is also suggested by the context, which can include other provisions of the bill originally approved by the legislature, although codified in different chapters or sections of the Oregon Revised Statutes. <em>See, e.g., State v. Ortiz, </em>202 Or App 695, 699-700, 124 P3d 611 (2005) (considering other provisions of the \u201csame mammoth\u201d legislation that produced the statute at issue). When the legislature adopted the biomass tax credit, it also specified the credit rates for each type of biomass. Or Laws 2007, ch 739, \u00a7 5. That provision described the credit for \u201cwoody biomass\u201d in terms of the location from which the biomass is collected:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">\u201cFor woody biomass <em>collected from </em>nursery, orchard, agricultural, forest or rangeland property in Oregon, including but not limited to prunings, thinning, plantation rotations, log landing or slash resulting from harvest or forest health stewardship, $10.00 per green ton.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">Or Laws 2007, ch 739, \u00a7 5 <em>(Former </em>ORS 469.790 (2007); <em>renumbered as </em>ORS 469B.403(6) (2011)) (emphasis added). None of the other tax credit rates would cover wood waste <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>collected from a mill. <em>See </em>ORS 469B.403.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The legislature\u2019s description of the woody biomass credit rate with reference to the location from which it has been collected, in combination with the text of ORS 315.141(l)(d)(A) persuades us that the legislature intended \u201cforest or rangeland woody debris\u201d to mean debris collected, as debris, from the forest or rangeland.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">Warrenton argues that extending the tax credit to mill waste would be consistent with a general statement of legislative policy, adopted in 2005, which encourages the Department of Forestry to promote biofuel in conjunction with forest health. <em>See </em>ORS 526.277(3) (2005), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2011, ch 276, \u00a7 4 (\u201cThe development of biomass markets, including energy markets, that use forest biomass unsuitable for lumber, pulp and paper products as a primary source of raw material may assist in the creation of a sustainable, market-based model for restoring complexity and structure to Oregon\u2019s forests.\u201d). Warrenton may be correct that a broader range of woody biomass would be consistent with the general policy described in ORS 526.277, but that does not persuade us that the 2007 legislature intended a meaning for ORS 315.141(l)(d)(A) other than what the text <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>and closely related statutory context suggest.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Burke v. DLCD, </em>352 Or 428, 441, 290 P3d 790 (2012) (\u201c[A] statement of legislative findings, without more, is a slim reed on which to rest an argument that the operative provisions of a statute should be taken to mean something other than what they appear to suggest.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">3. <em>Legislative history</em></p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Neither party has identified legislative history that resolves the narrow question of statutory construction at issue in this case, and we have found none. However, the limited history regarding the language of ORS 315.141 (l)(d)(A) is consistent with the construction we have identified. ORS 315.141 was enacted in 2007 as part of House Bill (HB) 2210, a comprehensive biofuel bill. Or Laws 2007, ch 739, \u00a7 5. As originally drafted, the definition of \u201cbiomass\u201d in HB 2210 included \u201corganic matter * * * that is derived from wood, forest, or field residues,\u201d a definition that might have reached wood waste from mill operations. Bill File, HB 2210, Nov 30, 2006 (initial draft). The ultimate language used in ORS 315.141(l)(d)(A) is the product of amendments added by the House Energy and the Environmental Committee. Minutes, House Energy and Environment Committee, HB 2210, Feb 5, 2007,1-2. While the bill was pending before the House Energy and the Environment Committee, the committee received written testimony from Ronald Suppah, Tribal Council Chair for the Confederated Tribes of the Warm Springs Reservation of Oregon, in support of the tax credit. Exhibit H, House Energy and Environment Committee, HB 2210, Jan 29, 2007 (accompanying statement of Tribal Council Chair Ronald Suppah). Suppah described the tribe\u2019s existing biomass operation, and emphasized that \u201ca significant purpose of the biomass project is to improve forest health by providing a market for the small diameter biomass by-product from forest health projects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>he explained that \u201c[f] orest health projects will typically be a more expensive source of biomass than urban wood or mill wood waste residuals because of transportation costs and because it involves intensive hand and mechanical treatments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As a result, Suppah explained, \u201c[i]f the Project were operated to maximize profit, the Project would use exclusively sawmill residuals and urban wood which would mean that there would not be any forest health benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, to allow projects \u201cto operate profitably and at the same time maximize the forest health benefits,\u201d the Tribe recommended \u201cmarket incentives in the form of tax credits, grants, green market credits which help to lower the overall cost of the Project.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We recognize that this legislative history represents the testimony of only one committee witness, but we highlight Suppah\u2019s testimony because it may explain why the legislature intended to extend the tax credit only to woody debris collected in the forests and rangelands.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Thus, we conclude that the legislature intended the biomass category of \u201c[f] orest or rangeland woody debris from harvesting or thinning\u201d to mean organic material that is debris when collected from the forest or rangeland. That definition is consistent with the challenged rule, which categorizes \u201cresidual wood waste from mill operations\u201d as not biomass.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Warrenton argues, however, that the rule has the effect of denying a tax credit for some biofuel from \u201c[f] orest or rangeland woody debris\u201d simply because the debris was transported to a mill before being converted to hog fuel. That possibility is beyond the scope of Warrenton\u2019s challenge to the validity of the rule. <em>See Wolf, </em>344 Or at 355 (court\u2019s review of whether a rule exceeds the agency\u2019s statutory authority \u201cis limited to the wording of the rule itself (read in context) and the statutory provisions authorizing the rule.\u201d) <em>See also Oregon Newspaper Publishers v. Dept. of Corrections, </em>329 Or 115, 118-19, 988 P2d 359 (1999) (if \u201crules on their face comply with applicable constitutional and statutory requirements *** any further challenge to them must be made on an \u2018as applied\u2019 basis\u201d). We understand that Warrenton\u2019s petition for review, in the circuit court also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>alleged that ODOE misinterpreted OAR 330-170-0040(l)(c) (2009) when it applied it to Warrenton\u2019s application for a tax credit, but that issue is not before us on appeal. The only rulings assigned as error are the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Warrenton and denial of summary judgment to ODOE on the claim that the rule is invalid. Because we conclude that the rule is valid, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">Reversed and remanded on appeal; cross-appeal dismissed as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b298-6\"> The parties agree that \u201chog fuel\u201d generally describes woody residue, such as wood chunks and bark processed through a wood chipper or grinder into a mix normally used as fuel by burning it to produce bioenergy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b298-7\"> ODOE amended OAR 330-170-0040(1) effective January 1, 2014, but Warrenton\u2019s application for a 2011 tax year credit is governed by the rules in effect for that tax year.

To the extent that Warrenton is correct about the effect of ODOE\u2019s statutory construction, Warrenton\u2019s concern is a policy matter that does not persuade us to construe the statute in a manner other than that suggested by the text and closely related statutory context.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
