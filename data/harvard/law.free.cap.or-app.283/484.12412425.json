Defendant did not preserve his claim of error but asks us to review and correct the error as plain error. ORAP 5.45(1); <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382, 823 P2d 956 (1991).

Coverstone, </em>260 Or App 714, 716, 320 P3d 670 (2014) (it is plain error for a trial court to impose court-appointed attorney fees where the record is silent as to the defendant\u2019s ability to pay them). Because the amount is substantial in light of defendant\u2019s family obligations and circumstances, the error is sufficiently grave to warrant the exercise of our discretion to correct it. <em>See State v. Ramirez-Hernandez, </em>264 Or App 346, 349, 332 P3d 338 (2014) (exercising discretion because $400 was a substantial amount to pay for the defendant in his circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Portion of judgment requiring defendant to pay attorney fees reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-7\"> Defendant was convicted of reckless driving, ORS 811.140, in Case Number 14CR2328 and failure to appear, ORS 162.195, in Case Number 15CR0215.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
