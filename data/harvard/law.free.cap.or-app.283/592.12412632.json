The juvenile court determined that, despite reasonable efforts by the Department of Human Services '(DHS) to reunify L with mother, mother had not made sufficient progress to make it possible for L to safely return home. <em>See </em>ORS 419B.476(2)(a) (requiring that inquiry when a child\u2019s case plan is reunification at the time of the permanency hearing). The court also determined that there were no compelling reasons under ORS 419B.498(2)(b) for DHS to delay filing a petition to terminate mother\u2019s parental rights. On appeal, mother challenges both determinations. First, mother argues that the court erred in determining that she had made insufficient progress, because she had completed all required services and had improved her parenting skills. Second, mother asserts that the juvenile court erred in determining that no compelling reasons to defer termination proceedings were present. Mother made those same arguments with regard to L\u2019s half-sister, A, in a companion case, <em>Dept. of Human Services v. S. J. M., </em>283 Or App 367, 369, 388 P3d 417 (2017) <em>(S. J. M. I).</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In that case, we concluded that the juvenile court had not erred in determining that mother had made insufficient progress for A to return home, but that the court had erred in its compelling-reasons determination. In light of our conclusions in <em>S. J. M. I, </em>and for the reasons that follow, we likewise conclude in this case that the juvenile court did not err in determining that mother had not made sufficient progress for L to safely return home, but that the court erred in concluding that compelling reasons under ORS 419B.498(2)(b) were not present. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">We begin with our standard of review. Mother has not asked us to exercise our discretion to review this case <em>de novo, </em>nor is this an exceptional case warranting <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See </em>ORS 19.415(3)(b) (providing court with discretion to conduct <em>de novo </em>review in equitable cases); ORAP 5.40(8)(c) <em>(de novo </em>review is appropriate only in exceptional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>cases). Accordingly, we view the evidence, as supplemented and buttressed by permissible derivative inferences, in the light most favorable to the juvenile court\u2019s disposition and assess whether, when so viewed, the record is legally sufficient to permit the outcome. <em>See Dept. of Human Services v. N. P., </em>257 Or App 633, 639-40, 307 P3d 444 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-3\">In <em>S. J. M. I, </em>we described the statutory framework governing permanency hearings and set forth in some detail the relevant facts and procedural history of this case. <em>See </em>283 Or App at 371-78. We restate those matters here only to the extent necessary to provide context for our analysis, and provide supplemental details specific to L as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">Mother gave birth to L in June 2011.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In September 2013, mother began dating Bosch, and the two later began living together. In September 2014, while caring for L, Bosch punished L by striking him on the buttocks hard enough to cause significant bruising. As a result of that incident, DHS petitioned the juvenile court to take jurisdiction over L, alleging (1) that mother lacked the parenting skills to safely parent L, (2) that she had failed to adequately supervise L, and (3) that she had failed to protect L despite being aware that he had been physically abused by mother\u2019s live-in partner. Following a contested hearing in December 2014, the juvenile court took jurisdiction as to the first and third allegations, placed L in relative foster care with his maternal aunt, and ordered reunification with parent as the primary case plan for L.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">In January and February 2016, approximately 15 months after placing L in foster care, the juvenile court held a permanency hearing in accordance with ORS 419B.470(2). At the hearing, DHS asked the court to change L\u2019s case plan from reunification to adoption. Mother objected to the change.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">As we explained in greater detail in <em>S.J.M. I, </em>by the time of the permanency hearing, mother had engaged in various services that the juvenile court had ordered and had succeeded in improving her parenting skills. <em>See </em>283 Or App at 371-72. The evidence at the permanency hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>also showed that mother had consistently engaged in weekly therapy with L and had attended supervised visits with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">As we also noted, however, mother still exhibited signs that she was not yet ready to safely parent her children. <em>See id. </em>at 372. Among other things, mother had married Bosch since her children had been removed from her care and was living with him at the time of the permanency hearing. <em>See id. </em>at 374. According to DHS, mother continued to prioritize her relationship with Bosch over the best interests of her children, by, for example, advocating for therapeutic contact between Bosch and L despite the recommendation against such contact by L\u2019s therapist, Schnabel, and by expressing her desire to coparent with Bosch. <em>See id. </em>at 372. In DHS\u2019s view, those inclinations suggested that mother still did not fully understand her protective role. <em>See id. </em>Significantly, at the time of the permanency hearing, Bosch continued to struggle with anger issues and had not fully accepted responsibility for his treatment of L. <em>See id. </em>at 373-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">While in substitute care, L had engaged in both individual therapy and family therapy with mother and his foster parents. Schnabel testified at the hearing that L had been traumatized by Bosch and that, although L had shown improvements and was beginning to recover, L remained a sensitive and vulnerable child who suffered from anxiety. According to Schnabel, L would bring up his abuse without prompting and mention \u201cbeing scared that he got spanked.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Schnabel also testified that L had a positive connection with his foster mother, which had \u201creally helped him feel safe,\u201d but acknowledged that mother was also making progress in her relationship with L, by showing \u201cmore patience with him, more ability to self-reflect, more ability to kind of wonder with him about his feelings and work on, on supporting him and managing his feelings.\u201d Schnabel believed that L felt safe with mother and that he could go to her for comfort. Schnabel also believed that mother was L\u2019s primary attachment figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">As for L\u2019s relationship with Bosch, Schnabel testified that he did not believe that it would be in L\u2019s best interests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>to have contact with Bosch until Bosch gained control over his own emotions. Schnabel explained that he had met with Bosch to explore the possibility of having Bosch work with L in therapy, but that he had decided that such contact between the two was not advisable. Schnabel reached that conclusion after observing that Bosch continued to exhibit a \u201csignificant amount of emotional [lability],\u201d and \u201ca significant degree of anger,\u201d which caused Schnabel concern regarding Bosch\u2019s capacity to work with L positively. Schnabel testified that, although he had advised mother of those concerns, she had advocated for contact between Bosch and L.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\">Evidence at the hearing showed that L was happy in foster care but that he had special needs. For example, L struggled with behavioral issues, had a significant speech impediment, and had a medical condition that required regular doctor visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">The juvenile court entered a permanency judgment changing the permanency plan for L from reunification with parent to adoption. The judgment reflected the court\u2019s determination that DHS had made reasonable efforts to reunify mother with L, but that mother had made insufficient progress to allow L to safely return to her care. The judgment also reflected specific findings as to mother\u2019s progress, including findings that she continued to prioritize her relationship with Bosch over the best interests of L, that she lacked an awareness of the risks posed by Bosch, and that she had yet to recognize the role her own conduct had played in causing L to come into care. The court further determined that there were no compelling reasons under ORS 419B.498(2)(b) to defer filing a petition to terminate mother\u2019s parental rights. Mother now appeals that judgment and assigns error to the court\u2019s determinations that she had made insufficient progress for L to safely return home and that compelling reasons to defer termination did not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">We first address mother\u2019s challenge to the juvenile court\u2019s determination that she had made insufficient progress. As in <em>S. J. M. I, </em>mother asserts in this case that she participated in all recommended services and that the evidence at the hearing showed that her parenting skills had improved. <em>See </em>283 Or App at 381. As a result, she contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>that the record does not support the court\u2019s determination that she had made insufficient progress. DHS likewise adheres to its arguments from <em>S.J.M. I. See id. </em>DHS\u2019s response is that the evidence shows that, even though mother had made meaningful progress, she remained unable to protect L from Bosch and did not have a home separate from Bosch to which L could safely return. Thus, in DHS\u2019s view, the court correctly determined that mother had not made sufficient progress under ORS 419B.476(2)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\">As we explained in <em>S.J.M. I, </em>mother\u2019s participation in services and corresponding progress as a parent are not dispositive\u2014what matters under ORS 419B.476(2)(a) is whether, after giving the highest priority to a child\u2019s health and welfare, the juvenile court could reasonably conclude that the child\u2019s parent has (or has not) ameliorated the bases of jurisdiction such that the child can safely return home. <em>See </em>283 Or App at 381-82 (a parent\u2019s completion of all required services does not compel the conclusion that the parent has made \u201csufficient progress\u201d under ORS 419B.476(2)(a)). Here, the evidence presented at the permanency hearing regarding mother\u2019s progress as to L\u2014and the insufficiency of the progress mother had made\u2014is the same as the evidence of mother\u2019s progress as to A.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, for the reasons that we rejected mother\u2019s argument in <em>S. J. M. I </em>regarding her progress as to A, we reject mother\u2019s argument that the court erred in determining that she had not made sufficient progress as to L. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">We turn to mother\u2019s argument that the juvenile court erred in determining that there were no compelling reasons for DHS to delay filing a termination petition and proceeding with adoption efforts. Again, both mother and DHS reprise the arguments that they made in <em>S.J.M. I. See id. </em>at 382-83. In brief, mother argues that, because she had made meaningful progress as a parent and was willing to engage in any necessary additional services, the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>establishes the presence of a compelling reason under ORS 419B.498(2)(b)(A),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which, mother contends, deprived the juvenile court of its authority to change L\u2019s permanency plan to adoption. Mother alternatively argues that, under ORS 419B.498(2)(b)(B), her bond with L constituted a compelling reason with the same effect. And, as in <em>S. J. M. I, </em>DHS\u2019s response is twofold. <em>See </em>283 Or App at 383. DHS\u2019s first contention is that the record does not support the determination that either mother\u2019s progress or the bond she shares with L is a compelling reason within the meaning of ORS 419B.498(2)(b). Stated differently, DHS argues that there <em>is </em>evidence to support the court\u2019s determination that there were <em>no </em>compelling reasons to defer termination proceedings. Second, DHS raises the argument that we rejected in <em>S. J. M. I, </em>that the determination that the juvenile court must make under ORS 419B.476(5)(d)\u2014as to whether there is a compelling reason under ORS 419B.498(2)(b) to defer termination proceedings\u2014does not constrain the court\u2019s authority to change a child\u2019s case plan from reunification to adoption. <em>See id. </em>at 383-92 (construing ORS 419B.476(5)(d) and ORS 419B.498(2)(b) in light of their respective texts, contexts, and legislative history). Our conclusion in <em>S. J. M. I, </em>that a compelling reason to defer filing a termination petition precludes a change of plan to adoption, controls here. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Turning our attention, then, to DHS\u2019s first argument\u2014that the evidence supports the juvenile court\u2019s compelling-reasons determination\u2014we agree with mother that the court erred in determining that her participation and progress in services was not a compelling reason to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>defer termination proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Like the court\u2019s determination under ORS 419B.476(2)(a), the court\u2019s compelling-reasons determination under ORS 419B.498(2)(b) relied on essentially the same record as to each child. It is true that L is several years older than A and was removed from his mother\u2019s care as a toddler rather than as an infant. It is also true that, unlike A, L exhibited direct and ongoing consequences of his abuse, such as anxiety and lingering fear. Finally, unlike A, L had special behavioral, therapeutic, and medical needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">As in A\u2019s case, however, the record is devoid of evidence connecting L\u2019s circumstances or needs to a desirable permanency timeline or to any projected timeline for mother to become a safe resource for L. As with A, there is no evidence to support the conclusion that, given L\u2019s specific permanency concerns, it would be unreasonable to give mother additional time to participate in services before moving forward with termination proceedings and adoption efforts. <em>See S. J. M. </em>I, 283 Or App at 392-94. Nor is there evidence showing that mother faced any specific barriers\u2014such- as incarceration, significant substance-abuse or mental-health issues, or anything else\u2014that would unreasonably prolong L\u2019s stay in foster care in light of his particular permanency needs. <em>See id. </em>Thus, despite any arguable differences between L\u2019s and A\u2019s circumstances, the record in L\u2019s case is equally insufficient to support the juvenile court\u2019s implicit determination that mother\u2019s successful participation in services would not enable L to return home within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In light of the foregoing, the record does not support the juvenile court\u2019s determination that there were no compelling reasons for DHS to defer filing to terminate mother\u2019s parental rights as to L\u2014or the court\u2019s corresponding decision to change the permanency plan for L from reunification with parent to adoption\u2014and the court, therefore, erred in changing that plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-6\"> The juvenile court held A\u2019s permanency hearing together with the hearing for L.

That is because, unlike A, L was the direct victim of abuse by Bosch. Thus, mother\u2019s inability to recognize and prevent the risk that Bosch presented arguably exposed L to a greater threat than A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b625-5\"> That statute requires DHS to file a petition to terminate parental rights under certain circumstances unless,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-6\">\u201c(b) There is a compelling reason, which is documented in the case plan, for determining that filing such a petition would not be in the best interests of the child or ward.
