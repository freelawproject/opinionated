The circuit court ruled that an administrative law judge (ALJ) had improperly excluded evidence of a urinalysis of a sample that petitioner gave the morning after her arrest for driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII). Going further, the circuit court concluded, after taking the urinalysis into consideration, that there was no substantial evidence to support the order suspending petitioner\u2019s license. DMV contends that the circuit court erred because the urinalysis evidence is inadmissible and, in any event, there is still substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s credibility findings and, therefore, to support the suspension order.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">We first conclude that the circuit court correctly determined that the ALJ erred when excluding the urinalysis evidence. We next conclude that the circuit court erred by re-evaluating the competing credibility of petitioner and the arresting officer. To do so was error because the court\u2019s proper role was a limited role of reviewing an agency decision. We reverse and remand so that the ALJ, on behalf of DMV, may make a credibility determination after consideration of all the evidence, including the improperly excluded urinalysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">Our review and that of the circuit court is limited to the record of the agency\u2019s hearing. ORS 813.450(2). Neither we, nor the circuit court, are the finders of fact. The role of both courts is to review the DMV order for any errors of law and to determine whether there is substantial evidence in the record to support the order. <em>Bianco v. DMV, </em>257 Or App 446, 448, 307 P3d 470 (2013); <em>see </em>ORS 813.450(4) (providing standards for review). We begin with the undisputed historical facts found by the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">In March 2013, Officer Scott arrived at the scene of an accident. A witness reported having seen petitioner\u2019s car \u201csuddenly veer across the lanes of travel and strike\u201d a parked car. The witness said that petitioner looked impaired. Scott testified that petitioner showed signs of impairment: she was unsteady on her feet, her pupils were constricted, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>had facial tremors, her movements were slow, her speech was slurred, and she appeared dazed and disoriented.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-3\">Scott asked petitioner if she would perform field sobriety tests, and she initially refused. Scott told petitioner about the tests and that her refusal to take those tests could be used against her. Petitioner refused again. Scott arrested her, and, on the way to the police station, he observed that she was \u201cnodding off\u2019 in the back of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">At the police station, petitioner used her phone. When she was done, she told the officer that she would agree to perform the field sobriety tests. Scott administered them. Petitioner exhibited six out of six possible clues for impairment during the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, eight out of eight possible clues for impairment during the walk-and-turn test, and two out of four possible clues for impairment during the one-leg stand test.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">During his discussion with petitioner, Scott relied on the department\u2019s Implied Consent Combined Report (ICCR). That document contains the admonitions that the implied consent law requires police to give to a DUII suspect. According to Scott, his usual practice is to use the ICCR during discussions with DUII suspects because there is a \u201clong list\u201d of admonitions to give and it is \u201ceasy to skip one.\u201d Scott testified that he usually will put a check mark next to each paragraph that he has read to a suspect. In this instance, the document he used has check marks next to each paragraph in Section I, the section that contains admonitions relevant to breath tests for impairment. There are no check marks next to the paragraphs in Section II, the section with admonitions relevant to urine tests. Scott asked petitioner to take a breath test. She cooperated, and the results indicated a blood alcohol content of 0.00 percent alcohol by volume. Scott also asked petitioner to take a urine test, but she refused. As a consequence, Scott told petitioner that her license would be suspended. Using the ICCR, Scott reported to DMV that petitioner had refused the request for a urine sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">DMV proposed to suspend petitioner\u2019s license for a year. To challenge the suspension, petitioner requested a hearing. It was conducted live, albeit by telephone. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>hearing, the parties disagreed about the events that led to petitioner refusing to take a urine test. According to the DMV, Scott informed petitioner of all the \u201crights and consequences\u201d provided by Oregon\u2019s Motorist Implied Consent Law. Scott testified that he told petitioner that, if she refused to submit to either a breath test or a urine test, her refusal to the tests could be used against her in subsequent court proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">Petitioner agreed that Scott told her of the consequences of refusing a breath test, but she contended that Scott did not tell her of the consequences of refusing a urine test. Petitioner testified that, after she was released from custody, she went to an emergency care clinic to see if it could perform a urinalysis. Reportedly, the clinic refused, because petitioner did not have any acceptable identification, given that the police had confiscated her driver\u2019s license. Later, petitioner found a lab that would perform the test, and, at around 8:00 a.m. the following morning, she provided the lab with a urine sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">During the hearing, petitioner attempted to have the results of her privately-obtained urinalysis admitted as evidence. The ALJ concluded that the belated urinalysis was not relevant to any issue and refused to allow it to be admitted into evidence. The ALJ rejected petitioner\u2019s argument to the effect that the test results were relevant because they made more likely her testimony that she was not told that a refusal to take a urine test would result in a license suspension. Rejecting petitioner\u2019s rationale, the ALJ observed that \u201cthe issue is not whether there was actually something in her system, it is just whether she refused the urine test.\u201d The ALJ reasoned that the issue of whether Scott recited the admonitions about a urine sample would be resolved through the direct testimony of Scott and petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">As for that competing testimony, the ALJ had observed that there are \u201cfactors that cut both ways regarding the witnesses\u2019 credibility.\u201d On one hand, the ALJ noted that Scott\u2019s ICCR lacked check marks next to Section II concerning a urine test. According to the ALJ, the lack of check marks indicated that, \u201cif [Scott] followed his usual practice, he did not read those required paragraphs to petitioner prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>to asking her to submit to the urine test.\u201d On the other hand, the ALJ acknowledged that Scott testified under oath that \u201che did, in fact, read those paragraphs to petitioner.\u201d Taken together, the ALJ found Scott to be credible. The ALJ reasoned that Scott\u2019s sworn testimony about his specific interaction with petitioner outweighed the doubt from deviation from his usual practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">When evaluating both witnesses\u2019 credibility, the ALJ relied on the factors discussed in <em>Tew v. DMV, </em>179 Or App 443, 449, 40 P3d 551 (2002). The ALJ found that, according to petitioner\u2019s own testimony, she was \u201cdazed and disoriented from the accident\u201d; that she \u201cexhibited several indicia of impairment\u201d; that petitioner had a substantial personal interest in the outcome of the case; that Scott had no personal interest in the case; and that Scott was a \u201ctrained observer.\u201d The ALJ found that, although petitioner \u201csincerely believed that her testimony was truthful,\u201d Scott\u2019s testimony was more credible than hers. Consequently, the ALJ found that Scott had read \u201cSection II of the ICCR in its entirety to petitioner prior to asking her to submit to a urine test.\u201d The ALJ concluded that DMV had \u201cestablished all of the requirements for a valid suspension.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Petitioner sought judicial review of that order and argued, among other things, that the ALJ erred when he excluded evidence of the results of the privately obtained urinalysis and that there was no substantial evidence to support the ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations. The circuit court ruled that the urinalysis results were relevant and that the ALJ should have admitted the evidence. The circuit court reasoned that petitioner\u2019s clean results were relevant because \u201cwhether petitioner was under the influence is probative of her ability to accurately recall whether the officer gave her implied consent warnings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Going further, the circuit court concluded that the suspension order, which turned on the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination, was not supported by substantial evidence. To reach that conclusion, the circuit court criticized several of the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact. First, the court accepted petitioner\u2019s argument that Scott\u2019s credibility was impeached by the results of the breath test. Scott had testified at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>hearing that he could smell alcohol on petitioner\u2019s breath. The breath test, however, was negative for alcohol. Next, the circuit court accepted petitioner\u2019s argument that the ALJ\u2019s finding that petitioner felt \u201cdazed and disoriented\u201d may have overstated her testimony. Petitioner argued that she felt dazed around the time of the accident, not necessarily that she felt dazed around the time that Scott purportedly gave her the implied consent warnings. Finally, the circuit court questioned the <em>Tew </em>consideration that petitioner had an interest in the outcome of the case. In the court\u2019s view, that point alone could not be a basis for determining petitioner\u2019s credibility because, \u201c[otherwise, no petitioner would ever be found credible.\u201d Adding the clean urinalysis to the circumstances, the circuit court concluded that Scott\u2019s testimony could not be found more credible than petitioner\u2019s, and, all in all, no substantial evidence supported the suspension order. The court set aside petitioner\u2019s license suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">The court\u2019s reasoning implicates two aspects of our review of the ALJ\u2019s order. Our review of the evidentiary issue calls upon our responsibility to determine whether \u201cthe department has erroneously interpreted a provision of law and that a correct interpretation compels a particular action.\u201d ORS 813.450(4)(a). Our review of the issue of competing credibility calls upon our more limited responsibility to review for \u201csubstantial evidence in the record.\u201d ORS 813.450(4)(c). The latter responsibility means that \u201ca judge may not substitute his or her opinion for that of the hearings officer on a finding of fact if there is substantial evidence in the administrative record to support that fact, even though there also might be substantial evidence to support a contrary finding.\u201d <em>Wood v. MVD, </em>93 Or App 575, 577, 763 P2d 190 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Under Oregon\u2019s implied consent law, \u201c[a]ny person who operates a motor vehicle upon premises open to the public or the highways of this state\u201d and who is arrested for DUII, \u201cshall be deemed to have given consent * * * to a chemical test of the person\u2019s breath,\u201d ORS 813.100(1), and to \u201ca chemical test of the person\u2019s urine,\u201d ORS 813.131(1). Police are required to confiscate a person\u2019s driver\u2019s license if the person refuses to consent to those tests and several other conditions, set by statute, are present. ORS 813.100(3)(a); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>ORS 813.131; ORS 813.132. One of those conditions is that police must inform the person that a refusal to take either of those tests will result in the suspension of driving privileges. ORS 813.130(2)(c); ORS 813.132(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">A person may request a hearing to contest a proposed license suspension. ORS 813.410. The scope of that hearing is prescribed by ORS 813.4HK6).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the ALJ observed, a person who refuses a breath or urine test may have their driver\u2019s license suspended regardless of whether they actually drove under the influence of an intoxicant. <em>See </em>ORS 813.100(3) (refusal of a breath or urine test required by the implied consent law is an independent basis for a license suspension).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">On appeal, DMV argues that the ALJ correctly excluded the results of petitioner\u2019s urinalysis and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>circuit court erred by concluding otherwise.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In an administrative proceeding, the law of evidence is governed generally by ORS 183.450, which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-4\">\u201cIrrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded but erroneous rulings on evidence shall not preclude agency action on the record unless shown to have substantially prejudiced the rights of a party. All other evidence of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in conduct of their serious affairs shall be admissible. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">ORS 183.450(1). The Oregon Administrative Procedures Act does not define the term \u201cirrelevant\u201d or its antonym \u201crelevant.\u201d But we may refer to the related provisions of the Oregon Evidence Code. <em>See PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 611, 859 P2d 1143 (1993) (when interpreting the meaning of a statutory term we consider \u201cthe context of the statutory provision at issue, which includes other provisions of the same statute and other related statutes\u201d); <em>see also Arlington Ed. Assn. v. Arlington Sch. Dist. No. </em>3, 177 Or App 658, 663, 34 P3d 1197 (2001), <em>rev den, </em>333 Or 399 (2002) (defining a term in ORS 183.450 with reference to a related term in the evidence code). Under OEC 401, evidence is relevant if it has any \u201ctendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>According to the ALJ, petitioner\u2019s urinalysis was not relevant because the validity of the suspension of petitioner\u2019s driver\u2019s license does not depend on whether she was under the influence of an intoxicating substance while she was driving. It is certainly true that, in relevant part here, the state was only required to prove that (1) petitioner was under arrest for driving under the influence, (2) petitioner\u2019s breath test disclosed a blood alcohol content of less than 0.08 percent, (3) police had a reasonable suspicion that she had been driving under the influence, (4) she was informed that her license would be suspended if she refused a urine test, and (5) she refused the test. <em>See </em>ORS 813.410(6); ORS 813.132(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">We conclude, however, that, due to the way that this case developed, the question of petitioner\u2019s sobriety became relevant because her sobriety became a factor in the determination about the reliability of her memory and, thus, to her credibility and, in turn, to that of the officer. In <em>Tew, </em>we identified several factors \u201cother than the manner of testifying\u201d that may be used to assess a witness\u2019s credibility: \u201cthe inherent probability of the evidence, internal inconsistencies, whether or not the evidence is corroborated, and whether human experience demonstrates that the evidence is logically incredible.\u201d 179 Or App at 449. As important here, we recognized in <em>Tew </em>that the consumption of intoxicating substances \u201ccan affect a person\u2019s ability to perceive and remember.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 450. In this case, the ALJ\u2019s assessment of petitioner\u2019s credibility expressly relied on the finding that, while there was little to indicate that petitioner\u2019s testimony was meant to be intentionally deceptive, her memory of the events was suspect because she \u201cexhibited several indicia of impairment\u201d around the time of the events in question. If she was <em>not </em>under the influence, then her memory would not be suspect for that reason. Because her memory was at issue, her sobriety was relevant, after all.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">In addition, petitioner\u2019s urinalysis is relevant for another reason. The test results tend to corroborate petitioner\u2019s testimony about what she did after she was released from custody and, therefore, to reflect on her relative willingness or resistance to have given a sample if actually advised. She testified that as soon as she was released from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>custody she tried to find a facility that would perform a urinalysis for her. The urinalysis provides some probative support for the suggestion that petitioner was willing to provide a urine sample to maintain her driver\u2019s license\u2014consistent with her testimony that she asked Scott, after her refusal and his announcement of her suspension, to take the test, after all. The urinalysis provides probative support for the argument that, if petitioner had actually been told that it would result in a driver\u2019s license suspension, she would not have refused the urine test. Put in petitioner\u2019s terms, the urinalysis shows that she had \u201cno motive\u201d to refuse cooperation because she had nothing to hide. Therefore, the urinalysis has a tendency to make more likely that she was <em>not </em>informed of the consequences of refusal. For all of those reasons, we conclude that it was indeed error for the ALJ to exclude petitioner\u2019s belated, privately-obtained urinalysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">We conclude that the ALJ\u2019s decision to exclude that evidence \u201csubstantially prejudiced\u201d petitioner. ORS 183.450(1). The hearing on petitioner\u2019s license suspension was primarily a credibility battle between petitioner and Scott, who were the only two witnesses to testify about the events leading to petitioner\u2019s refusal to submit to a urine test. The results of petitioner\u2019s urinalysis go to the heart of that case because, as we have explained, those results would have bolstered petitioner\u2019s credibility by reducing the probability that petitioner was intoxicated and by increasing the probability that she was not provided the requisite warnings. <em>See OR-OSHA v. Tom O\u2019Brien Construction Co., Inc., </em>148 Or App 453, 462, 941 P2d 550 (1997), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>329 Or 348, 986 P2d 1171 (1999) (where excluded evidence had the tendency to rebut testimony of a witness for opposing party on which the ALJ expressly relied, the exclusion was prejudicial).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Although we agree with the circuit court on the evidentiary issue, we disagree with the circuit court in its \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d review of the suspension order. Our disagreement is based on the limited role of a reviewing court of an agency decision and the effect of a legal error on substantial evidence review. Under ORS 813.450(2) and (4), both the circuit court and this court serve a review function that is \u201climited to the record of the department\u2019s hearing.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number><em>See Bianco, </em>257 Or App at 448 (the DMV order is the focus of the two courts\u2019 appellate-style review); <em>Shakerin v. DMV, </em>101 Or App 357, 360, 790 P2d 1180 (1990) (explaining statute). In its review of a suspension order, the circuit court is not a <em>trial </em>court in the typical sense of making findings of fact. As noted above, a court\u2019s review function is not to substitute a court\u2019s findings of fact for an ALJ\u2019s findings of fact, when there is substantial evidence in the record for the ALJ\u2019s finding. This is true even when there is also substantial evidence to the contrary. <em>Wood, </em>93 Or App at 577. When in a review role, a court does not review for the better evidence. A \u201csubstantial evidence review does not entail or permit the reviewing tribunal to reweigh or to assess the credibility of the evidence that was presented to the fact-finding body.\u201d <em>Golliher v. DMV, </em>173 Or App 586, 590, 22 P3d 780 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Review for substantial evidence is \u201creview to determine whether a reasonable person could have made the findings supporting the decision, not whether a reasonable person could have made different findings.\u201d <em>Shakerin, </em>101 Or App at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">After concluding that the ALJ committed legal error, the circuit court proceeded to assess the relative credibility of Scott and petitioner. However, the consequence of legal error in this circumstance is that the court must remand the case to DMV for the ALJ to assess the record in the first instance. Therefore, we remand the matter to DMV in order that the ALJ may reassess credibility in light of all admissible evidence. <em>See Bianco, </em>257 Or App at 460 (reversing judgment of the circuit court and remanding to DMV \u201cso that the ALJ, on behalf of DMV, can reconsider the issue\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Reversed and remanded with instructions to remand to DMV for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b844-6\"> In relevant part, ORS 813.410(6) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-7\">\u201cThis subsection shall be narrowly construed so as to effect the legislative purpose of limiting the scope of hearings under this section.

Specifically, DMV asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b845-7\">\u201cThere is no evidence in this record showing what was tested for, or how, or whether the lab was certified to do any testing.
