We reject without written discussion defendant\u2019s first assignment of error, and the assignment of error raised in defendant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>supplemental brief. In his remaining assignment of error, defendant contends that the trial court plainly erred when it failed to merge the guilty verdicts on Counts 1 and 2 as required by ORS 161.067(1). <em>See State v. Villarreal, </em>266 Or App 699, 700, 338 P3d 801 (2014) (correcting plain error where verdicts for delivery of cocaine and delivery of cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school should have merged into a single conviction). The state concedes that the trial court plainly erred. We agree, accept the state\u2019s concession, and, for the reasons expressed in <em>State v. Valladares-Juarez, </em>219 Or App 561, 564-65, 184 P3d 1131 (2008), exercise our discretion to correct the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Convictions on Counts 1 and 2 reversed and remanded for entry of judgment of conviction for one count of unlawful delivery of cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
