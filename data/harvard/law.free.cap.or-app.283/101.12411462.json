J.</author>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Defendant was convicted following a jury trial of one count each of first-degree assault with a firearm, ORS 163.185 and ORS 161.610 (Count 2), second-degree assault with a firearm, ORS 163.175 and ORS 161.610 (Count 3), and unlawful use of a weapon (UUW) with a firearm, ORS 166.220 and ORS 161.610 (Count 4), all arising from a single act of domestic violence against her partner, T.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, defendant raises three assignments of error, with the first two challenging the trial court\u2019s preclusion of evidence of T\u2019s purported prior conduct, and the third asserting that the court committed an \u201cerror of law apparent on the record,\u201d ORAP 5.45(1), in failing to merge defendant\u2019s guilty verdicts for first-degree assault with a firearm and UUW with a firearm. For the reasons that follow, we decline to review defendant\u2019s first two assignments of error as unpreserved, but we agree with defendant that the trial court\u2019s failure to merge the verdicts on Counts 2 and 4 constituted \u201cplain error\u201d and warrants the affirmative exercise of our discretion under <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382 n 6, 823 P2d 956 (1991). <em>See State v. Ryder, </em>230 Or App 432, 216 P3d 895 (2009). Accordingly, we reverse and remand defendant\u2019s convictions on Counts 2 and 4 with instructions to enter a single conviction of assault in the first degree with a firearm and for resentencing, but otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Because our grounds of disposition are, essentially, procedural, our preliminary description of the facts is summary. We relate the circumstances pertinent to each assignment of error, in turn, separately below.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Defendant and T lived together in defendant\u2019s home in Roseburg beginning in early 2012. Their relationship was, almost from the beginning, contentious and occasionally abusive, including assaultive behavior that did not result in criminal charges. Ultimately, on the afternoon of June 11, 2012\u2014after another contentious and perhaps abusive encounter\u2014defendant seized a loaded handgun, and, in the ensuing altercation, T sustained a gunshot wound to his left chest and lung.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Based on that incident, defendant was, as noted, charged by indictment with one count each of attempted murder with a firearm, first-degree assault with a firearm, second-degree assault with a firearm, and UUW with a firearm. As pertinent to our consideration below of defendant\u2019s claim of \u201cplain error\u201d regarding failure to merge the guilty verdicts for first-degree assault with a firearm (Count 2) and UUW with a firearm (Count 4), the indictment alleged each of those offenses as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-4\">\u201c[Defendant], on or about June 11, 2012 *** did unlawfully and intentionally cause serious physical injury to [T], by means of a deadly or dangerous weapon, to-wit: a firearm * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-5\">\"*****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-6\">\u201c[Defendant], on or about June 11, 2012 * * * did unlawfully attempt to use unlawfully against [T], a firearm, a dangerous or deadly weapon * * * \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Thus, the indictment alleged the \u201c[ajttempts to use unlawfully against another\u201d variant of UUW, and not the alternative and disjunctive \u201cor carries or possesses with intent to use unlawfully against another\u201d variant of that offense, ORS 166.220(1)(a).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Compare Ryder, </em>230 Or App at 435 (accepting, as \u201cwell founded,\u201d state\u2019s concession that failure to merge second-degree assault and UUW charged under \u201c[a]ttempts to use unlawfully against another\u201d variant constituted \u201cplain error\u201d) <em>with State v. Alvarez, </em>240 Or App 167, 171-74 &amp; n 1, 246 P3d 26 (2010), <em>rev den, </em>350 Or 408 (2011) (concluding that trial court did not err in failing to merge attempted first-degree assault and UUW charged under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>\u201ccarries or possesses with intent to use unlawfully against another\u201d variant; distinguishing <em>Ryder </em>on that difference in UUW charging allegations).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\">At trial, the state presented evidence, consistently with T\u2019s account, that defendant, without provocation, had intentionally shot T. Conversely, the theory of defense, to which defendant testified, was that, over the course of their relationship, T had been abusive and periodically violent; that T had been physically abusive towards her on the day of the shooting; that she had armed herself out of fear, in self-defense; and that the gun had accidentally discharged as she and T had struggled for its possession. As described immediately below, defendant unsuccessfully attempted to present evidence of T\u2019s conduct involving one of his former wives, R, including the contents of cross-petitions for restraining orders that R and T had filed in a Washington court proceeding. The jury found defendant guilty of all charges except attempted murder, and the court entered separate convictions on each of those counts, imposing concurrent sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">On appeal, defendant first assigns error to the trial court\u2019s preclusion of evidence of T\u2019s conduct towards his ex-wife R\u2014conduct that defendant asserts was relevant to her claim of self-defense. Specifically, defendant asserts <em>on appeal </em>that such putative evidence was relevant to establish \u201ca general plan (by T) to commit, and get away with, acts of violence\u201d\u2014and invokes <em>State v. Leistiko, </em>352 Or 172, 187-88, 282 P3d 857, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>352 Or 622, 292 P3d 522 (2012), in support of that \u201cplan\u2019-based contention. In that regard, defendant contends on appeal as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-5\">\u201cIn both relationships <em>(viz., </em>with defendant and R), [T] kicked the women in the buttocks, verbally berated them, accused them of demanding sex from him, and, most significantly, when the women reached out to law enforcement for help, he greeted the responding officers and accused the women of abuse. * * * That [T] accused his abuse victims of domestic violence is more than mere repeated conduct!;] it is evidence of a specific plan and method of covering up his own acts of abuse. That is, IT\u2019s] other acts were individual manifestations of a general plan to commit, and get away with, acts of violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>\u201cAs such, the details in both 2006 restraining order petitions and the resulting restraining order were relevant for the noncharacter purpose of proving a plan * * *.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">That challenge is utterly unpreserved. Before the trial court, defendant <em>never </em>asserted that the evidence relating to R was admissible as substantiating a \u201cplan\u201d for purposes of OEC 404(3). Rather, defendant\u2019s sole contention\u2014 which she does not renew on appeal\u2014was that the evidence pertained to an asserted \u201cabsence of mistake or accident,\u201d which is, of course, a distinct, disjunctive basis of admissibility of evidence of \u201cother crimes, wrongs or acts\u201d under OEC 404(3).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Before the trial court, defense counsel repeatedly referred to \u201cabsence of mistake or accident,\u201d asserting that evidence of T\u2019s conduct towards other domestic partners, including R, was admissible because T\u2019s conduct towards defendant corresponded to a \u201cpattern of behavior that he has done before\u201d and, thus, demonstrated that \u201c[t]his is not a mistake on his part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u201cPlan\u201d was never mentioned. Nor, notwithstanding defense counsel\u2019s generic, conclusory references to \u201cpattern,\u201d does the record disclose any effort to demonstrate why, or how, the proffered evidence satisfied the requisite, exacting \u201cconcurrence of common features\u201d of a \u201cspurious plan.\u201d <em>Leistiko, </em>352 Or at 188, 188 n 13; <em>see also State v. Pitt, </em>352 Or 566, 579 n 7, 293 P3d 1002 (2012) (\u201c[Something more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>is required than mere repeated conduct to establish that a defendant acted pursuant to a plan.\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">In sum, defendant raises a new, and qualitatively different, ground of admissibility for the first time on appeal. The matter is unpreserved.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Defendant\u2019s second assignment of error is similarly deficient. On appeal, defendant contends that, under the analysis of <em>State v. LeClair, </em>83 Or App 121, 130-31, 730 P2d 609 (1986), <em>rev den, </em>303 Or 74 (1987), defense counsel was entitled to impeach T\u2019s credibility by cross-examining him regarding allegations he made in his 2006 cross-petition for a domestic restraining order against R. In that regard, defendant asserts that, because the Washington trial court granted R\u2019s petition and denied T\u2019s cross-petition, that disposition either necessarily demonstrated that T\u2019s prior accusations were false, entitling defense counsel to cross-examine T regarding the substance of those allegations, or, at least, constituted \u201csome evidence\u201d that they were false, compelling the trial court to allow cross-examination unless the court determined that the \u201cprobative value [of such cross-examination was] substantially outweighed by the risk of prejudice, confusion, embarrassment or delay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130; <em>see also State v. Taylor, </em>275 Or App 962, 965-67, 365 P3d 1149 (2015), <em>rev den, </em>360 Or 26 (2016) (affirming preclusion of impeachment of victim, based on purported falsity of prior allegations of domestic abuse, where \u201cthe record permit [ted] the trial court\u2019s finding that it was not persuaded that the victim had made prior false accusations against [the] defendant,\u201d and the trial court\u2019s further, ultimate determination that the putative cross-examination \u201cwould not be helpful to the jury\u201d was not an abuse of discretion); <em>State v. Arellano, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>149 Or App 86, 90-91, 941 P2d 1089 (1997), <em>rev dismissed as improvidently allowed, </em>327 Or 655 (1998) (refining standards of review of LeCZair-based determinations; affirming trial court\u2019s preclusion of evidence of purported falsity of the victim\u2019s prior allegations of sexual abuse).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">Here, defendant never invoked <em>LeClair </em>or its progeny before the trial court\u2014or even, regardless of specific citation, frame an argument for admissibility comporting with LeClair\u2019s prescribed methodology governing admissibility. That is, defendant never argued either, or both, that (1) the court was obligated to render a finding as to whether defendant had \u201cdemonstrate [d] to the court\u201d that some or all of the allegations in T\u2019s 2006 cross-petition were false, <em>LeClair, </em>83 Or App at 130, or, failing that, (2) that defendant had adduced at least \u201csome evidence that [T] had made accusations that were false,\u201d requiring the trial court to engage in OEC 403 balancing with respect to putative impeachment, <em>id. </em>Indeed, and to the contrary, to the extent that defendant posited a cogent theory of relevance before the trial court, it was that the allegations of the Washington pleadings, including T\u2019s cross-petition, were admissible as <em>substantive </em>evidence corroborating the purported \u201cpattern\u201d of a \u201clack of accident or mistake\u201d in T\u2019s interactions with defendant, <em>see </em>283 Or App at 105-06\u2014and not (as in <em>LeClair, et al) </em>for purposes of <em>impeaching </em>T as an alleged serial purveyor of false accusations of abuse.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">In sum, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s failure to render determinations relating to admissibility for purposes of impeachment that, as defendant framed the matter before the trial court, were inapposite. The trial court was never called upon to undertake a <em>LeClair </em>assessment. Consequently, again, defendant\u2019s appellate contention is unavailing as unpreserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">We turn, finally, to defendant\u2019s third assignment of error, which challenges the trial court\u2019s failure to merge defendant\u2019s guilty verdicts for UUW with a firearm (Count <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>4) and first-degree assault with a firearm (Count 2), resulting in a single conviction for the latter crime. Defendant acknowledges that that matter is unpreserved, but contends that, consistently with <em>Ryder, </em>the failure to merge constituted \u201cplain error\u201d and that, for the same reasons expressed in <em>Ryder, </em>we should exercise our discretion under <em>Ailes </em>to remedy that error.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\">The state does not dispute the substance of defendant\u2019s \u201cplain error\u201d contention. Rather, the state\u2019s sole response is that the asserted error is unreviewable because defendant either \u201cinvited\u201d or \u201cwaived\u201d any error.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">We agree with defendant. As the state asserts, invited error generally precludes \u201cplain error\u201d review and correction. <em>See, e.g., State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. S. P., </em>346 Or 592, 606, 215 P3d 847 (2009) (\u201cThis court has determined that it will not exercise its discretion to review an asserted plain error if the party seeking review encouraged commission of the error in question * * *.\") <em>State v. Berndt, </em>282 Or App 73, 80, 386 P3d 196 (2016) (declining to review alleged \u201cplain errors\u201d: \u201cDefendant thus invited the errors of which he now complains, and we therefore do not consider them.\u201d). However, the record here contradicts the state\u2019s claim of invited error. To be sure, defense counsel informed the trial court that he did not believe that the verdicts for first-degree assault with a firearm <em>and second-degree assault with a firearm </em>were \u201cappropriate for merger.\u201d But counsel made no comment pertaining to potential merger of the verdicts for first-degree assault with a firearm <em>and UUW with a </em>firearm\u2014and his comments pertaining to the first- and second-degree assault counts did not, by necessary implication, endorse failure to merge the UUW and assault verdicts. Thus, defense counsel was not \u201cactively instrumental in bringing about\u201d the alleged error. <em>Anderson v. Oregon Railroad Co., </em>45 Or 211, 216-17, 77 P 119 (1904).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">Nor can defense counsel\u2019s silence in that respect be deemed to have somehow preclusively waived \u201cplain error\u201d review. <em>See, e.g., State v. Page, </em>197 Or App 72, 79, 104 P3d 616 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 673 (2006) (rejecting state\u2019s assertion that purported waiver, by failure to object, precluded \u201cplain error\u201d review: \u201c [I] f failure to object to a ruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>or make an argument amounts to a waiver that this court is powerless to disregard, then there will never be an occasion to review unpreserved error.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">As to the merits, it suffices to say that, given the manner in which UUW was charged in this case <em>(viz., </em>as predicated on the \u201c[a]ttempts to use unlawfully against another\u201d variant) and the analyses and dispositions of <em>Ryder </em>and <em>Alvarez, </em>including <em>Alvarez's </em>distinction of <em>Ryder, </em>230 Or App at 173 n 1, <em>see </em>283 Or App at 103-04, it was \u201cplain error\u201d not to merge the verdicts on Counts 2 and 4. Although this case involves a conviction for first-degree assault, and not (as in Ryder) second-degree assault, the state identifies no principled distinction in the merger analysis and disposition, and we perceive none. <em>See also State v. Zolotoff </em>250 Or App 376, 377-78, 280 P3d 396, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 666 (2012) (accepting, as \u201cwell founded,\u201d state\u2019s concession that trial court erred in failing to merge guilty verdicts for attempted first-degree assault and UUW, where both arose from the defendant\u2019s \u201cconcurrent conduct\u201d in domestic violence episode and the UUW charge was predicated on the \u201c[a]ttempts to use unlawfully\u201d variant). Finally, for the reasons expressed in <em>Ryder, </em>230 Or App at 435, we exercise our discretion under <em>Ailes </em>to correct that error.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Convictions on Counts 2 and 4 reversed and remanded for entry of a judgment of conviction for one count of assault in the first degree with a firearm; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b128-7\"> The jury acquitted defendant of attempted murder with a firearm, ORS 163.115, ORS 161.610, and ORS 161.405 (Count 1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b129-8\"> The indictment also alleged, with respect to each of those counts, that \u201cdefendant used or threatened the use of a firearm during the commission of this felony.\u201d <em>See </em>ORS 161.610(2) (\u201cThe use or threatened use of a firearm, whether operable or inoperable, by a defendant during the commission of a felony may be pleaded in the accusatory instrument and proved at trial as an element in aggravation of the crime as provided in this section.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b129-9\"> ORS 166.220 reads, in part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-10\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of unlawful use of a weapon if the person:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b129-11\">\u201c(a) Attempts to use unlawfully against another, or carries or possesses with intent to use unlawfully against another, any dangerous or deadly weapon as defined in ORS 161.015[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b131-6\"> Although defendant\u2019s appellate brief also refers to evidence of domestic violence by T against another of his former wives, F, it appears that the trial court admitted most, and perhaps all, of that evidence. In all events, defendant advances no argument on appeal as to the exclusion of evidence pertaining to T\u2019s conduct toward F.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">Further, although the trial court did not allow defendant to present evidence pertaining to the substance of the allegations of the cross-petitions in the 2006 restraining order proceedings involving R, it did allow defense counsel, for impeachment purposes, to refer to the Washington court\u2019s order granting R\u2019s petition\u2014specifically, to impeach T\u2019s testimony that he had had no domestic violence issues since 2003, when he had been convicted of domestic violence against F and had been required to engage in domestic violence counseling.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b131-8\"> OEC 404(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-9\">\u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show that the person acted in conformity therewith.
