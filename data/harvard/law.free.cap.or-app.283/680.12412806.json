ORS 656.298(1), (4). The issue presented is whether claimant raised his requests for various penalties and attorney fees in connection with employer\u2019s premature closure of his workers\u2019 compensation claim in a procedurally proper manner. The board concluded that claimant had not properly raised some of his requests for penalties and fees but had properly raised others. On review, claimant assigns error to the board\u2019s denial of those penalties and fees that the board concluded were procedurally barred, while employer assigns error to the board\u2019s award of some of the penalties and fees that the board determined were not procedurally barred. We conclude that the board erred to the extent that it concluded that claimant had not properly raised his requests for penalties and fees. For that reason, we remand to the board to reconsider the fee and penalty requests that it denied, but otherwise affirm the board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The facts pertinent to the questions before us are procedural. In February 2010, claimant was working in the library at Portland Community College when he was violently attacked by an assailant. The attack caused claimant to suffer a traumatic brain injury. Employer accepted claimant\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim for the conditions resulting from the workplace attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">A year and one-half later, on August 29, 2012, employer issued a notice of closure for the claim. The notice of closure found that claimant was stationary as of August 20, 2012, that temporary total disability was authorized from the date of injury to the date of closure, and that claimant was entitled to permanent partial disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">On September 10, 2012, claimant sought reconsideration of the notice of closure with the Appellate Review Unit (ARU) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Division under ORS 656.268(5)(c) (2011),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which requires a party objecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>to a notice of closure to seek reconsideration with the director of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Division before seeking a hearing. He contended that the notice of closure was premature and should be rescinded.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\">Also on September 10, claimant filed a hearing request with the board. The request indicated that claimant was seeking a hearing on entitlement to a penalty under ORS 656.268(5)(d)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and attorney fees under ORS 656.382(1)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because of the premature claim closure, and on entitlement to a penalty and fees under ORS 656.262(ll)(a)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for employer\u2019s failure to pay temporary disability after August 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">On October 2, 2012, the ARU issued its order on reconsideration. The ARU agreed with claimant that the notice of closure was premature and ordered that it be rescinded.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">On October 29, 2012, claimant filed a second hearing request with the board. On that request, which claimant submitted using a board form, claimant checked the box <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>indicating that the order on reconsideration was one of the reasons he was seeking a hearing. Claimant also indicated that he was seeking fees and penalties based upon employer\u2019s failure to pay attorney fees and other amounts due as a result of the order on reconsideration but did not reassert the entitlements to fees and penalties that he raised in his first hearing request. Instead, claimant requested consolidation of the first and second hearing requests. Consistent with claimant\u2019s request, the hearings division consolidated the two requests for hearing before an administrative law judge (ALJ). <em>See </em>OAR 438-006-0065 (allowing for consolidation of hearing requests).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Following the hearing, the ALJ issued an order in which she denied all of the fees and penalties that claimant sought as a result of the premature notice of closure. That is, the ALJ denied the penalties and fees that claimant requested in his first hearing request: the ORS 656.268 (5)(d) penalty for the allegedly \u201cunreasonable\u201d notice of closure; the ORS 656.382(1) attorney fees for employer\u2019s allegedly unreasonable resistance to payment of compensation in issuing the premature notice of closure; and the penalty and fees under ORS 656.262(ll)(a) for employer\u2019s allegedly unreasonable failure to pay temporary disability from August 20 to August 29. The ALJ determined that those requests were barred by claim preclusion because claimant did not raise them in the reconsideration proceeding before the ARU. She explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">\u201c[Claimant] could have raised and preserved his penalty and attorney fee issues at the reconsideration proceeding and then sought a hearing before the Hearings Division and argued that he was entitled to penalties and fees based on the incorrect Notice of Closure. Thus, I conclude that his argument, stemming from the Notice of Closure, that he is entitled to penalties and attorney fees under ORS 656.268(5)(d) and ORS 656.382(1) for the carrier\u2019s incorrect Notice of Closure could have been raised in the earlier action and is therefore now barred by claim preclusion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">She stated further that the same reasoning applied to claimant\u2019s request for a penalty and fees under ORS 656.262(ll)(a) for employer\u2019s failure to pay temporary disability between August 20 and August 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Claimant then sought review before the board. He argued, among other things, that the ARU would not have had the authority to grant his fee and penalty requests and, for that reason, the ALJ erred in concluding that he was barred by claim preclusion from raising the penalty and fees issues at the hearings division.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">The board affirmed the ALJ\u2019s order in part, and reversed it in part. As to claimant\u2019s request for an ORS 656.268(5)(d) penalty, the board concluded that claimant was not required to raise that issue before the ARU on reconsideration because the ARU would not have had the authority to award a penalty under that statute. However, observing that ORS 656.268(5)(d) requires closure to \u201cbe a viable issue at a hearing before a penalty is assessed under ORS 656.268(5)(d),\u201d the board concluded that claimant could not obtain a penalty under that statute because neither claimant nor employer had \u201crequested a hearing from the reconsideration order.\u201d The board further determined that, because no party had requested a hearing from the reconsideration order, \u201cthere has been no finding that the August 2012 Notice of Closure was unreasonable,\u201d and that, accordingly, claimant was not entitled to an attorney fee award under ORS 656.382(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The board reached a different conclusion regarding claimant\u2019s request for a penalty and fees under ORS 656.262(ll)(a) for employer\u2019s allegedly unreasonable failure to pay temporary disability between August 20 and August 29. As to that request, the board again determined that the ARU would not have had the authority to address the issue and that, as a result, \u201cclaimant\u2019s decision not to raise this issue during the reconsideration proceeding did not preclude him from raising it at the hearing level.\u201d Implicitly concluding that claimant\u2019s hearing requests had raised the issue for hearing, the board then proceeded to determine whether employer had unreasonably terminated claimant\u2019s temporary disability as of August 20, and ultimately awarded claimant a penalty and fees under ORS 656.262(ll)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">On review, claimant assigns error to the board\u2019s denial of his request for an ORS 656.268(5)(d) penalty and ORS 656.382(1) attorney fees. He contends that \u201cclaimant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>consolidated [hearing] requests were sufficient to raise and put at issue before the Hearings Division his entitlement to an ORS 656.268(5)(d) penalty for employer\u2019s unreasonable and incorrect closure,\u201d and that the board erred in concluding that he had not requested a hearing in a way that would permit him to raise the penalty and fee issue. In response and in the cross-petition, employer argues that claimant\u2019s hearing requests did not properly raise the issues regarding the penalties and fees that claimant seeks to litigate. Although employer acknowledges that claimant raised the issues in his first hearing request, employer asserts that that request was \u201cpremature and legally void.\u201d Employer further contends that claimant\u2019s second hearing request did not properly raise the issues because it did not reiterate the issues identified in the first hearing request but, instead, focused on issues arising after the order on reconsideration issued. Employer argues that, for those reasons, the board correctly rejected claimant\u2019s requests for the ORS 656.268(5)(d) penalty and ORS 656.382(1) fees but incorrectly concluded that claimant had properly raised his request for a penalty under ORS 656.262(ll)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Our review of board proceedings is \u201cas provided in ORS 183.482(7) and (8).\u201d ORS 656.298(7). Here, the parties\u2019 arguments raise an issue of procedure: Did claimant properly request a hearing in connection with his fee and penalty requests? Under ORS 183.482(7), we review to determine whether \u201cthe fairness of the proceedings or the correctness of the action may have been impaired by a material error in procedure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Applying that standard, we conclude that the board erred in determining that claimant\u2019s hearing requests did not properly raise the issue of his entitlement to a penalty under ORS 656.268(5)(d) and fees under ORS 656.382(1) at the hearing before the ALJ and that, to raise such issues, claimant (or employer) was required to separately request a hearing from the order on reconsideration. We reach this conclusion for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\"><em>First, </em>claimant\u2019s first hearing request made clear that he was seeking the ORS 656.268(5)(d) penalty and ORS 656.382(1) fees. In other words, this is not a situation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>in which employer was unaware that claimant was seeking a hearing on those issues or was somehow blindsided by claimant\u2019s request for the penalty and fees. Claimant has been steadfast in his position that the premature notice of closure was unreasonable and should give rise to an array of penalties and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\"><em>Second, </em>contrary to employer\u2019s argument that claimant\u2019s first hearing request was \u201clegally void\u201d because it was filed before the completion of the reconsideration process, no statute or rule of which we are aware prohibited claimant from filing an early hearing request seeking a penalty and fees under ORS 656.268(5)(d) and ORS 656.382(1). To be sure, it would have been premature to adjudicate claimant\u2019s requests for fees and penalties in a hearing before the completion of the reconsideration process. ORS 656.268(5)(c) is clear that a party objecting to a notice of closure must first seek reconsideration with the director and, as employer notes, permitting a claimant simultaneously to move forward with a hearing on penalties while reconsideration was pending would risk inconsistent results as to whether a notice of closure was properly issued. However, nothing in the statute prohibits an objecting party from <em>filing </em>a hearing request before the reconsideration process has been completed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">Relatedly\u2014and of greater concern\u2014the hearings division did not treat claimant\u2019s first hearing request as premature because it was filed before the completion of the reconsideration process. Instead, the hearings division consolidated the request with claimant\u2019s later hearing request and held a hearing on both of them. As a result, claimant was not on notice of the need to file another hearing request \u201cfrom the order on reconsideration\u201d in order to pursue the penalty and fee issues that he had identified in his first hearing request. Had the hearings division dismissed the initial request as premature rather than consolidating it with claimant\u2019s post-reconsideration hearing request, claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>would have been aware of the need to file a new hearing request addressing the penalty and fees issues or to amend the second hearing request.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><em>Third, </em>the board\u2019s rules of procedure for hearings call for flexibility, rather than rigidity, in this area. Although a party requesting a hearing must identify the issues for hearing early on, the board has provided that leave to amend the issues for hearing should be freely allowed. Specifically, OAR 438-006-0031(2) (May 1, 2003)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">\u201cAmendments shall be freely allowed up to the date of the hearing. If during the hearing, the evidence supports an issue or issues not previously raised, the Administrative Law Judge may allow the issue (s) to be raised during the hearing. In such a situation, the Administrative Law Judge may continue the hearing upon motion of an adverse party pursuant to OAR 438-006-0091.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Thus, even if employer is correct that claimant\u2019s first hearing request was void because it was premature, the board\u2019s rules would entitle claimant to amend his second hearing request to assert the issues identified in the first request. Perhaps that is why the hearings division simply consolidated the two requests, rather than adopting the more cumbersome procedure of dismissing the first hearing request and requiring amendment of the second. In other words, claimant, for all practical purposes, did exactly what the board concluded claimant was required to do to raise the issue of an ORS 656.268(5)(d) penalty and ORS 656.382(1) fees. Claimant filed a hearing request \u201cfrom\u201d the order on reconsideration and, by consolidating it with the previous request, raised for hearing the issues identified in that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-7\">For these reasons, we conclude that claimant\u2019s hearing requests put his entitlement to the requested penalty and fees at issue in the hearing before the ALJ, and that the board erred in concluding that those issues were not presented because neither claimant nor employer had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>requested a hearing from the order on reconsideration.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As to employer\u2019s contention that the board erred by awarding penalties under ORS 656.262(ll)(a), that contention is predicated on the assertion that claimant\u2019s first hearing request was void and, therefore, that penalty issue, along with the others, was not properly presented for hearing. Because we have concluded that claimant\u2019s hearing requests adequately presented for hearing the penalty and fees issues identified in the first hearing request, we reject that argument without further discussion. As a result, we remand to the board to reconsider claimant\u2019s ORS 656.268(5)(d) penalty request and ORS 656.382(1) fees request, but otherwise affirm the board\u2019s order.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-3\">Reversed and remanded on the petition; affirmed on the cross-petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-8\"> ORS 656.268 was amended in 2015, some of the provisions cited in this opinion were modified, and others were renumbered.

In particular, we express no opinion as to whether and in what circumstances a hearing to consider penalty and fee requests stemming from an incorrect notice of closure is one in which \u201cthe correctness of that notice of closure <em>* * * </em>is at issue in a hearing on the claim\u201d for purposes of ORS 656.268(5)(d). The parties have not addressed that statutory construction issue before us, and have focused instead on whether claimant\u2019s hearing requests properly raised his requests for penalties and fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b714-5\"> In a memorandum of additional authorities, claimant argues that we should award attorney fees on appeal.

In the same memorandum, claimant argues that we should remand to the board for an award of attorney fees for services before the board under ORS 656.262(ll)(a). As claimant did not assign error to the board\u2019s denial of those fees, we decline to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
