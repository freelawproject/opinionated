J.</author>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">Defendant appeals his judgment of conviction for five counts of identity theft, ORS 165.800. For part of his sentencing hearing, defendant was not represented by counsel, and he argues that his waiver of his right to counsel was invalid because it was not voluntarily and knowingly made, thus violating Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Reviewing the validity of defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to counsel as a legal question in light of the circumstances of his particular case, <em>State v. Erb, </em>256 Or App 416, 420, 300 P3d 270 (2013), we conclude that the record is insufficient to show that defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel was made with awareness of the risks of doing so. We remand for resentencing on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The circumstances of defendant\u2019s lack of attorney representation at the sentencing hearing are as follows. In July 2013, defendant was represented during a bench trial in which he was convicted of the five identity theft counts at issue in this appeal. The following month, defendant appeared at his sentencing hearing with his attorney. Two other cases were at issue: one was in the same circuit court, Clackamas County, for which other charges of identity theft had been filed and were pending (the other Clackamas County case),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a second was in Multnomah County Circuit Court, in which charges against defendant were yet to be filed. Defendant and the state were in discussions contemplating a global plea for all three cases. Defendant, however, insisted that his sentence should include an alternative incarceration program (AIP); he believed that treatment for his methamphetamine addiction was of utmost importance.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The prosecutor told the court that the state would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>not agree to anything other than 96 months\u2019 imprisonment without AIP. Defendant\u2019s counsel, wanting an assurance that Multnomah County would not pursue its case against defendant, suggested that defendant enter a plea to the other Clackamas County case and that the court postpone sentencing. The prosecutor responded that the state wanted the court to sentence defendant on his convictions that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">The court sided with the prosecutor, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-5\">\u201cI can only move forward. * * * I\u2019m trying to work in a way that\u2019s going to move this matter forward, * * * the State is entitled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">\u201cWe\u2019ve set the sentencing today and if [the state] is saying, \u2018By golly, we\u2019re going to do sentencing,\u2019 we\u2019ll do the sentencing. I don\u2019t know if [the state is] going to get [its] plea in [its] second case if that happens and I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s really where we want to go, but like I said, that\u2019s not in [the state\u2019s] control.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">\u201cThat\u2019s not in my control. I can\u2019t make him plea. So all I can do is sentence him on the first case today. I\u2019m *** willing and able to do that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">The trial court directed the parties to take a break so that they could discuss further the possibility of reaching a plea agreement for all of the cases against defendant. The parties did so and returned to the court, where the prosecutor announced that a plea deal had been reached: Multnomah County would not pursue charges against defendant, defendant would enter a plea on the other Clackamas County case, and the sentence for both Clackamas County cases would be 96 months\u2019 imprisonment without AIP. The prosecutor stated that defendant was eligible for drug treatment even if he did not receive AIP. At that point, defendant spoke up:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-9\">\u201cI\u2019m confused. Your honor, * * * I\u2019ve been to prison before. [The] program that I want to get into is the program out at Powder River. It\u2019s an intensive inpatient drug treatment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>program. It\u2019s 14 hours a day, seven days a week for approximately six months. I did a drug treatment program when I went to prison before. It\u2019s like\u2014they call it drug treatment light. It was held at Columbia River. It wasn\u2019t all that different than what I would say outpatient drug treatment is on the streets. The only way to get into [the Powder River] program is if the Court provides me AIP eligibility. And I believe that\u2019s my best chance for success.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">After the parties discussed drug treatment with and without AIP, defendant agreed to the plea deal but, after reiterating his desire for the Powder River AIP program, changed his mind and said that there would be no deal. The prosecutor did not budge on the state\u2019s position that defendant serve 96 months without AIP.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The following exchange occurred when defendant again addressed the court directly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-6\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: I know I probably threw a major wrench in the engine today, Your Honor. I would like to ask for different counsel. My lawyer smells like she drank about a half a bottle of vodka over lunch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">\u201c [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Oh, hogwash.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-8\">\u00ab* \u2021\u2021\u2021\u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-9\">\u201c[THE COURT]: \u2014but I don\u2019t think [defense counsel] needs to start defending herself. You say what you want to say.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-10\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I have no problem with\u2014 with withdrawing from this case, Your Honor, given his statement today, also given the difficulties I\u2019ve had and all of my staff have had in dealing with his issues and his change of mind and his\u2014his other problems.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-11\">\u201cSo I think it\u2019s appropriate for me to withdraw and I\u2019ll file a motion to that effect.

I\u2019m sorry that\u2014I don\u2019t know what else to do, all right? I\u2019ve got a lawyer who I\u2019ve had a great amount of difficulty with. I have done everything <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>I could to try to support the efforts of our defense team.

I will not sentence you on the second case today. If you want to take a plea, do that, but I don\u2019t have to sentence you today. I can set sentencing over. I can set it in my court or I can set it in somebody else\u2019s court, \u2018cause I\u2019m just taking a plea.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">\u201c [DEFENDANT]: Your Honor, I\u2019m\u2014as a judge, I think you\u2019re outstanding. I have got a very good feel for you and I have no problem with you sentencing me and I would to be sentenced by you. I discussed quite a bit with my attorney about this sentencing over the last few days and nothing has gone the way that it was supposed to have gone. I\u2019m obviously in a lot of trouble. I\u2019m fighting for my life or at least a large chunk of it and I don\u2019t feel that I\u2019m being adequately represented by her. And I figure if I don\u2019t speak up now, I\u2019m not going to ever\u2014you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: Do you want to request another attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-10\">\u201c[DEFENDANT]: Your Honor, yes, I would very much like to request a different lawyer, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-11\">\u201c[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor, motions to withdraw are heard in front of Judge Herndon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-12\">\u201cTHE COURT: I know.

So all I can do right now and all I\u2019m going to do right now is I\u2019m going to sentence him on the first case. We\u2019re going to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>have to set the plea and the sentence over on the second case, because I have reservations about him pleaing [sic] without representation when he\u2019s asking for a new attorney.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahs\">\u00ab\u215c \u2021\u2021\u2021\u2021</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: *** [Defense counsel], if you\u2019d like to take a seat in the jury box or step away from counsel table or whatever you need to do.

Thank you, Your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The trial court then asked defendant if he understood that his lawyer was withdrawing, that he would be sentenced on the five counts of identity theft of which he had been convicted, and that he would be appointed counsel for the other Clackamas County Case, which would be heard at a later date. Defendant affirmed that he understood and asked if he and his mother could make statements to the court before it sentenced him. The court heard those statements, their crux being that defendant\u2019s crimes were the result of his longstanding methamphetamine addiction. (Defendant also expressed remorse and explained some personal circumstances.) The court sentenced defendant, imposing a total of 80 months\u2019 imprisonment with AIP.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">We begin our analysis with the state\u2019s contention that defendant\u2019s claimed error was unpreserved because he did not object after his attorney stepped away from counsel\u2019s table.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Regardless of whether defendant preserved his claim of error, the Supreme Court has provided a limited exception to the preservation requirement in these circumstances. \u201cA defendant whose waiver of counsel is accepted without first being apprised of the risks of self representation cannot be expected to object to acceptance of that waiver on the ground that he or she was not apprised of those risks.\u201d <em>State v. Cole, </em>323 Or 30, 36, 912 P2d 907 (1996); <em>see also State v. Morrow, </em>192 Or App 441, 444-45, 86 P3d 70, <em>rev den, </em>337 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>282 (2004) (\u201cWhen a defendant who appeared <em>pro se </em>at trial contends, for the first time on appeal, that his or her <em>waiver of counsel </em>was invalid, that argument is preserved without the need for an objection at trial.\u201d). Here, defendant was not apprised of the risks of self-representation and is therefore excused from our preservation requirements. Accordingly, we proceed to the merits of defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Defendant asserts that his waiver of his right to counsel violated Article I, section 11, because it was not made knowingly.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The constitutional right to counsel may be waived, \u201cbut the waiver must be voluntarily and knowingly made.\u201d <em>State v. Easter, </em>241 Or App 574, 583, 249 P3d 991 (2011) (citing <em>State v. Meyrick, </em>313 Or 125, 132, 831 P2d 666 (1992)). The right to counsel exists for \u201ccritical stages\u201d of a criminal proceeding, including sentencing. <em>Id. </em>(\u201c\u2018[CJounsel cannot be excluded from any stage of the criminal prosecution at which a defendant is to be \u201cheard,\u201d including the sentencing stage, whether this is wholly performed by the judge or shared with non-judicial persons.\u2019\u201d (Quoting <em>State ex rel Russell v. Jones, </em>293 Or 312, 315, 647 P2d 904 (1982).)); <em>Russell, </em>293 Or at 315 (\u201cThe term 'criminal prosecution\u2019 includes sentencing, a stage at which a judicial decision affecting a defendant\u2019s future liberty is made. Obviously, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>then, a defendant is entitled \u2018to be heard by himself and counsel\u2019 at sentencing.\u201d (Quoting Article I, section 11.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">\u201cTo knowingly waive the right to counsel, a defendant must be aware of the right to counsel and also understand the risks inherent in self-representation.\u201d <em>Easter, </em>241 Or App at 584 (citing <em>Meyrick, </em>313 Or at 132-33). An on-the-record colloquy is the preferred method of establishing that a defendant knowingly waived the right to counsel. \u201cThe obligation rests with the court to determine whether the waiver of counsel is made knowingly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582. The \u201cfailure to even mention any of the risks of self-representation, or put on the record any facts indicating that defendant understood the risks, is akin to the circumstances that we have described as <em>prima facie </em>error.\u201d <em>State v. Todd, </em>264 Or App 370, 380, 332 P3d 887, <em>rev den, </em>356 Or 401 (2014) (citing <em>Erb, </em>256 Or App at 423).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Under the totality of the circumstances, however, if the record reflects that the defendant understood the risks of proceeding without counsel\u2014that is, a defendant \u201csubstantially appreciates the material risks of self-representation in his or her case\u201d\u2014we will affirm a trial court\u2019s acceptance of a defendant\u2019s waiver. <em>State v. Jackson, </em>172 Or App 414, 423, 19 P3d 925 (2001). The circumstances that can support a determination that a defendant understood the risks of self-representation include a defendant\u2019s prior experience with the criminal justice system, <em>State v. Reynolds, </em>224 Or App 411, 419, 198 P3d 432 (2008), <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 158 (2009); a defendant\u2019s firsthand experience of \u201csome of the basic things that an attorney could do,\u201d <em>id.\u2018, </em>and a defendant\u2019s request for retained counsel, <em>State v. Brown, </em>141 Or App 156, 163, 917 P2d 527, <em>rev den, </em>323 Or 691 (1996). Yet, a \u201cdefendant\u2019s abstract knowledge that there may be risks or disadvantages of self-representation, without any appreciation of what those risks may be, is insufficient.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>172 Or App at 423.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Here, the state concedes that the court failed to inform defendant of the risks of self-representation but argues that defendant nevertheless understood the risks of self-representation during the sentencing stage of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>criminal trial because defendant knew that \u201cthere were undesirable sentencing decisions and outcomes that an attorney would be better prepared to help avoid.\u201d The state notes that defendant had experience with the criminal justice system prior to his sentencing and points to, in particular, defendant\u2019s statements regarding his prior sentence in 2008. In the state\u2019s view, defendant\u2019s criminal justice experience and his acceptance of counsel for the other Clackamas County case overcomes the trial court\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>error of failing to warn defendant of the risks of self-representation or determine that defendant understood those risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">For that proposition, the state relies on <em>Easter. </em>In that case, we concluded that, under the totality of the circumstances, the record reflected that the defendant understood the risks of proceeding without counsel when he waived that right for the closing portions of his trial. 241 Or App at 584. The defendant in that case had had nine prior convictions, and at least one of them had gone to trial. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, we noted that it was relevant that the defendant had the opportunity to observe his attorney\u2019s conduct up until the point that he waived his right to counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 584-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Two of the circumstances in <em>Easter </em>distinguish that case from this one. First, in <em>Easter, </em>we noted that the court \u201cwarned defendant that proceeding without counsel was a \u2018bad idea.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 585. Second, after the trial court specifically warned the defendant that, \u201cin light of the fact that defendant had no legal training, he likely was not aware of the legal contours that he would have to navigate during closing argument,\u201d the court offered, and the defendant accepted, to retain the defendant\u2019s attorney as a legal advi-sor and to allow the attorney to remain in the court room. <em>Id. </em>Here, the trial court neither gave any kind of warning nor suggested that defendant\u2019s counsel could remain during sentencing in an advisory role. Indeed, the judge stated, after declaring that he would sentence defendant, that he had \u201creservations\u201d about defendant \u201cpleaing [sic] [the other Clackamas County case] without representation when [defendant] is asking for a new attorney,\u201d implying that he had no such reservations regarding proceeding to sentence defendant on the case that had already been tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>Moreover, in our recent decision, <em>State v. Guerrero, </em>277 Or App 837, 850, 373 P3d 1127 (2016), we concluded that the defendant\u2019s familiarity with the criminal justice system alone was insufficient to support a finding that the defendant \u201cadequately understood the risks of self-representation.\u201d We noted that many \u201cdefendants are repeat offenders, and we have previously recognized that more than a history of criminal offenses is necessary to establish a basis for a knowing waiver of counsel, even for a defendant with prior valid waivers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 849 n 7. In this instance, the record does not indicate that defendant\u2019s 2008 experience with sentencing after a plea deal with the state provided him with the experience of viewing the benefits that counsel could provide in a case such as this in which sentencing was imposed for crime for which he was convicted after a bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">The state also contends that defendant\u2019s choice to retain his right to counsel for the other Clackamas County case supports an inference that he understood the risks of self-representation. <em>See Easter, </em>241 Or App at 584 (\u201c[A] defendant\u2019s request for retained counsel supports an inference that the defendant understands the risks of self-representation.\u201d). We disagree. Although the request for counsel for the other Clackamas County case indicates that defendant understood the need for a lawyer to assist him with a plea or to try those charges, or the general importance of attorney representation, it does not necessarily follow that defendant understood that there were risks of self-representation specific to the sentencing stage of his criminal proceeding. Indeed, after the judge informed defendant that he would appoint counsel for the other Clackamas County case and that he would proceed with sentencing, defendant\u2019s response to the state\u2019s sentencing recommendation was merely to provide personal statements from him and his mother. There is nothing in the record to indicate that defendant understood that an attorney could provide arguments to the court that went beyond testimony imploring the court to take into consideration defendant\u2019s remorse, personal circumstances, or desire for drug rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the record does not reflect that defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel during his sentencing was made with an understanding of the risks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>of self-representation and, thus, were made knowingly. The trial court never provided any colloquy about the risks of self-representation. The court stressed the importance of counsel for defendant\u2019s other Clackamas County case without any indication that counsel would similarly benefit him at his sentencing. Defendant\u2019s familiarity with the court system and desire for counsel in another proceeding, although sufficient to indicate that defendant may have had a general understanding of the risks of self-representation, were insufficient to overcome the trial court\u2019s failure to warn defendant that self-representation for defendant\u2019s <em>sentencing proceeding </em>would be risky or to establish that defendant understood those risks.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">The state argues that, nevertheless, any error by the trial court was harmless. The Supreme Court has stated that such an error is not harmless if, on review, we are \u201cunable to determine\u201d what the outcome would have been if the defendant had been represented by counsel. <em>State v. Cole, </em>323 Or 30, 36, 912 P2d 907 (1996). We have characterized the court\u2019s \u201cwe can\u2019t tell\u201d principle as \u201ctranscendent.\u201d <em>State v. Richardson, </em>159 Or App 592, 602-03, 978 P2d 435, <em>rev den, </em>329 Or 479 (1999) (in concluding that a defendant\u2019s unknowing waiver of counsel was not harmless, stating that \u201clike the Supreme Court in <em>Cole, </em>given the breadth of the issues implicated by defendant\u2019s motions, including the motions to quash and the motion for a bill of particulars, we cannot say with confidence that the development and disposition of the challenges to the indictment would not have been different if defendant had been represented by counsel\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Here, the state asserts that any sentencing error was harmless because defendant would not have received a more favorable sentence had he continued to be represented by an attorney. That is, the state asserts that, because defendant \u201creceived the favorable type of sentence that he wanted, within the range of expected sentences, and with a provision making him eligible for AIP,\u201d his self-representation made no difference to his sentence and defendant has not advanced \u201cany persuasive argument\u201d to suggest otherwise. The record, however, does not support the state\u2019s assertion that attorney representation of defendant would not have made any difference. Under the standard articulated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number><em>Cole, </em>reiterated in <em>Richardson, </em>we conclude that, because there were outstanding sentencing issues\u2014both legal and discretionary\u2014we are unable to determine what the outcome would have been had defendant been represented by counsel. Defendant did not have the benefit of an attorney arguing the merits of what defendant, or his mother, said to the court. Nor did defendant have the benefit of an attorney answering the arguments the state raised or raising other arguments advancing defendant\u2019s interests for the entire sentencing proceeding. Accordingly, the court\u2019s error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">Remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-6\"> In defendant\u2019s other assignment of error, he requests that we review as plain error the sentencing court\u2019s imposition of separate convictions because the record was insufficient to establish that there were separate victims of the identity theft counts. Our disposition of the first assignment obviates the need to address that assignment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b471-7\"> Case Number CR1300513.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b471-8\"> Defendant desired the AIP at Powder River Correctional Facility, which offers residential drug treatment.

Cross, </em>264 Or App 205, 206 n 1, 331 P3d 1073, <em>rev den, </em>356 Or 400 (2014).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b475-8\"> In defendant\u2019s view, his two requests for a new attorney preserved his claim of error. Defendant\u2019s requests, however, were made prior to the court\u2019s decision to sentence defendant on his convictions in the first case and set over the other Clackamas County case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b476-5\"> Article I, section 11, provides, in part, that, \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right <em>* </em>* * to be heard by himself and counself.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Defendant also asserts that his waiver violated ORS 135.045(l)(c), which provides that, if a \u201cdefendant wishes to waive counsel, the court shall determine whether the defendant had made a knowing and voluntary waiver of counsel.\u201d Ordinarily, if both subconstitutional and constitutional arguments are raised, we \u201cbegin our analysis by determining whether a case may be disposed of on subconstitutional grounds.\u201d <em>State v. Phillips, </em>235 Or App 646, 651, 234 P3d 1030, <em>modified on recons, </em>236 Or App 465, 236 P3d 789 (2010). However, we have noted that \u201c[n]either the Oregon Supreme Court nor this court have previously interpreted the current text of [ORS 135.045], which appears to impose on the trial court obligations congruent to those imposed under the state and federal constitutions when a defendant wishes to waive the right to counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Phillips, </em>because of the \u201capparent congruence and the absence of any argument by defendant regarding an interpretation of the statute under which he would be provided with broader protection or more complete relief than that provided by the constitutional provisions,\u201d we considered the defendant\u2019s constitutional arguments and \u201cexpressed no further opinion on the interpretation of ORS 135.045.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We do the same here.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">We also note that defendant argues that his waiver was made involuntarily. We need not address that argument because we conclude that defendant\u2019s waiver was not made knowingly.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
