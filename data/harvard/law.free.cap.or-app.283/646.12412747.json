On appeal, in her first assignment of error, appellant contends that the trial court plainly erred when it failed to advise her of her rights in accordance with ORS 426.100(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state concedes that the court\u2019s failure constitutes plain error and requires reversal. We agree, and accept the state\u2019s concession. <em>See State v. R. D. S., </em>271 Or App 687, 688, 352 P3d 84 (2015) (\u201cA trial court\u2019s failure to advise a person as required is not only error, but it is plain error that we exercise our discretion to consider despite an appellant\u2019s failure to raise and preserve it at the hearing.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.)); <em>State v. M. L. R., </em>256 Or App 566, 570, 303 P3d 954 (2013) (observing that \u201cplain error review of violations of ORS 426.100(1) is justified by the nature of civil commitment proceedings, the relative interests of the parties in those proceedings, the gravity of the violation, and the ends of justice\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Furthermore, for the reasons set forth in <em>M. L. R., </em>we exercise our discretion to correct the trial court\u2019s error in this case. See <em>also State v. T. L.
