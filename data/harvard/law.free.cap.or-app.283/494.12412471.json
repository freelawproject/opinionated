On direct appeal, we reversed the conviction on one of those counts and remanded for entry of a corrected judgment reflecting a conviction on a single count of aggravated murder. <em>State v. Garner, </em>194 Or App 268, 279, 94 P3d 163, <em>rev den, </em>337 Or 616 (2004) <em>(Garner I). </em>After an unsuccessful appeal from the judgment on remand, petitioner sought post-conviction relief, which the court granted in part and denied in part. Two aspects of that ruling are pertinent here. First, the post-conviction court rejected petitioner\u2019s claim that his appellate lawyer in the underlying criminal case performed inadequately by not assigning error to the criminal trial court\u2019s mid-trial dismissal of a juror. Second, the post-conviction court granted relief on a different claim of inadequate assistance of appellate counsel, determining that competent counsel would have sought reconsideration of our opinion in <em>Garner I </em>on the ground that we should have remanded the entire case for resentenc-ing, instead of simply remanding for entry of a corrected judgment. Both petitioner and defendant, Superintendent of the Oregon State Penitentiary, have appealed from the resulting post-conviction judgment. For the reasons set out below, we affirm on appeal and on cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The facts are largely undisputed. Petitioner was charged with two counts of aggravated murder for killing a person in 1998. <em>Garner I, </em>194 Or App at 273. The first count was premised on petitioner having intentionally maimed the victim, resulting in her death. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The second count was premised on petitioner having caused the victim\u2019s death in an effort to conceal evidence of other crimes. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The case was tried to a jury. At some point during the guilt phase of that trial, a juror, to whom we refer as \u201cJuror B,\u201d sent the trial court a note stating that he \u201ckn[e]w [he could] never sentence anyone to death.\u201d The court decided to speak with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Juror B individually, outside the presence of the remaining jurors. Toward the end of the discussion that followed, Juror B said that he did not \u201cbelieve that [he] could sentence someone to death\u201d; he had determined during the days leading up to writing the note that he \u201cjust personally [did not] think it\u2019s for [him] to make that decision.\u201d The court excused Juror B and an alternate juror took his place.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-3\">The jury convicted defendant of the two charged counts of aggravated murder. The jury declined to impose a death sentence and, instead, voted to impose a sentence of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The trial court entered a judgment that did not merge the guilty verdicts on the two aggravated-murder counts, but that purported to merge the counts \u201c[flor purposes of sentencing.\u201d <em>Garner I, </em>194 Or App at 273.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On petitioner\u2019s direct appeal, we held that the record did not include evidence that petitioner \u201charbored a separate intent to maim the victim apart from his intent to cause her death,\u201d and the trial court therefore erred when it denied petitioner\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal on the first count of aggravated murder. <em>Id. </em>at 279. We accordingly reversed the conviction on that count and remanded; our opinion included the following disposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\">\u201cJudgment of conviction for aggravated murder on count one reversed; judgment of conviction for aggravated murder on count two affirmed; remanded for entry of corrected judgment; otherwise affirmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-5\"><em>Id. </em>That opinion issued in July 2004. <em>Id. </em>at 268. Petitioner petitioned for review in the Oregon Supreme Court, making arguments that are not relevant here. The court denied review. <em>State v. Garner, </em>337 Or 616, 103 P3d 639 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">On remand, petitioner requested a new sentencing hearing on the theory that, absent the conviction based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>on intentional maiming, \u201cthe jury might well have voted to give [him] life instead of life without parole.\u201d The trial court denied that request and, in 2005, entered a judgment convicting petitioner of only one count of aggravated murder and again imposing a sentence of \u201clife without parole.\u201d On direct appeal from that judgment, petitioner argued that the trial court erred by denying his request for a resentencing hearing because resentencing was required under ORS 138.222(5)(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Indeed, petitioner argued that, upon reversing the first count of aggravated murder in the 2004 appeal, this court \u201cwas required to remand the case for re-sentencing.\u201d He suggested that this court\u2019s tag line in the 2004 opinion\u2014remanding for entry of a corrected judgment\u2014was incorrect because \u201cORS 138.222(5)(b) *** clearly directs the court to remand for re-sentencing in such cases.\u201d In response, the state asserted, among other things, that petitioner had not sought reconsideration of the tag line in <em>Garner I </em>or petitioned for review regarding the remedy that we had ordered in that case. Accordingly, the state argued, petitioner\u2019s complaint about the limited remedy was barred by preclusion principles. Moreover, the state argued, the trial court could not err on remand by carrying out what this court had ordered in <em>Garner I. </em>This court affirmed the 2005 judgment on remand without opinion, and the Supreme Court again denied review. <em>State v. Garner, </em>214 Or App 571, 166 P3d 606, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 467 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>Petitioner then initiated this post-conviction proceeding. In his second amended petition for post-conviction relief, he asserted several claims, only two of which are pertinent here. First, petitioner claimed that he was denied adequate assistance of appellate counsel in <em>Garner I </em>because his appellate lawyers did not \u201cassign as legal error and present sufficient arguments regarding the wrongful dismissal\u201d of Juror B from the jury in the aggravated-murder trial. Second, petitioner claimed that he was denied adequate assistance of appellate counsel, again in <em>Garner I, </em>because his appellate lawyers did not \u201c[f]ile a timely motion for reconsideration and request a remand for resentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">In a memorandum opinion, the post-conviction court granted petitioner\u2019s petition in part and denied it in part. As pertinent here, the court rejected petitioner\u2019s claim related to his appellate lawyers\u2019 failure to assign error to the mid-trial dismissal of Juror B. The court ruled that \u201cthe judge\u2019s decision to replace the juror was correct\u201d because the juror\u2019s \u201cinability to sentence someone to death would substantially impair him in performance of his duties as a juror in the case.\u201d Accordingly, the court concluded, petitioner\u2019s appellate lawyers \u201cdid not err by failing to assign the dismissal of [Juror B] from the jury\u201d as error in <em>Garner I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The post-conviction court granted relief, however, on petitioner\u2019s claim that his appellate lawyers were inadequate for having failed to file a petition for reconsideration in <em>Garner I </em>seeking a remand for resentencing, instead of (as we had ordered) remand for entry of a corrected judgment\u2014 one that would retain the originally imposed sentence of life imprisonment without parole. The court concluded on the basis of ORS 138.222(5) (2003) that \u201cpetitioner was entitled to a resentencing proceeding before a jury upon remand from the Court of Appeals\u201d\u2014a hearing at which his lawyer could advocate for a sentence of life <em>with </em>the possibility of parole, as the state would not have been \u201cable to argue that petitioner should receive true life * * * because he had maimed the victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The court subsequently entered findings of fact and conclusions of law consistent with its memorandum opinion. With respect to the claim that petitioner\u2019s appellate lawyers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>should have advocated for a resentencing hearing, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-4\">\u201cA competent appellate attorney would have moved the Oregon Court of Appeals for reconsideration of [its] decision remanding Petitioner\u2019s case for entry of a \u2018corrected judgment.\u2019 If this had occurred, it is more probable than not that the result of the proceedings would have been different. Petitioner is entitled to remand to the Clatsop County Circuit Court for a resentencing proceeding before a jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The court granted relief under both the state and the federal constitutions on that claim. It entered a general judgment that ordered a new \u201csentencing proceeding before a jury\u201d and otherwise denied the petition for post-conviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Petitioner appeals from that judgment and the superintendent cross-appeals. We review the post-conviction court\u2019s grant or denial of relief for legal error. <em>Green v. Franke, </em>357 Or 301, 312, 350 P3d 188 (2015). We are bound by the post-conviction court\u2019s factual findings if they are supported by evidence in the record. <em>Everett v. Premo, </em>279 Or App 470, 477, 380 P3d 1099 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">We begin by addressing petitioner\u2019s appeal, in which he argues that the post-conviction court erred by denying his claim \u201cthat he was deprived of his state and federal constitutional rights to adequate assistance of appellate counsel when his appellate counsel failed to assign error to the trial court\u2019s excusal of [Juror B] from the jury during the guilt phase of trial.\u201d In that regard, petitioner argues that a \u201creasonable appellate attorney\u201d would have noted what petitioner characterizes as the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d surrounding Juror B\u2019s examination and dismissal by the criminal trial court. He points to ORS 136.280, which authorizes a trial court to dismiss a member of the jury \u201cbefore the final submission of the case\u201d if the juror \u201cis unable to perform the duty because of illness or other cause which the court deems sufficient.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Petitioner contends that what he characterizes as Juror B\u2019s \u201cuncertainty over his ability to impose the death penalty\u201d did not establish \u201cthat his opinions would substantially impair his ability to follow the law.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>He argues that a reasonable appellate attorney would have argued that the trial court erred in excusing Juror B and asserts that \u201c[t]here is a reasonable probability that this court would have reversed and remanded for a new guilt phase trial\u201d had such an argument been made.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-3\">Petitioner\u2019s argument is governed by settled legal principles. A post-conviction petitioner who claims a deprivation of rights under Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution must prove \u201c(1) that his lawyer failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment, and (2) that petitioner suffered prejudice as a result.\u201d <em>Everett, </em>279 Or App at 478. A court considering whether a petitioner has met that burden must evaluate the adequacy of the lawyer\u2019s representation \u201cfrom the lawyer\u2019s perspective at the time, without the distorting effects of hindsight.\u201d <em>Lichau v. Baldwin, </em>333 Or 350, 360, 39 P3d 851 (2002). A lawyer has performed inadequately, for purposes of the constitutional analysis, only if the lawyer\u2019s decisions \u201creflect an absence or suspension of professional skill and judgment.\u201d <em>Gorham v. Thompson, </em>332 Or 560, 567, 34 P3d 161 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">The Supreme Court has explained how those standards apply when a post-conviction claim is based on an appellate lawyer\u2019s failure to make a particular assignment of error on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">\u201cA plaintiff seeking post-conviction relief stemming from a claim of inadequate assistance of appellate counsel for failing to assert a claimed error must establish (1) that a competent appellate counsel would have asserted the claim, and (2) that had the claim of error been raised, it is more probable than not that the result would have been different.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-6\"><em>Guinn v. Cupp, </em>304 Or 488, 496, 747 P2d 984 (1987).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>The mere fact that an attorney could have raised an argument does not establish that the attorney is inadequate for having failed to raise it; nor can the petitioner prevail simply by establishing that there was no evident downside to the attorney making such an argument. <em>Green, </em>357 Or at 314. Rather, the pertinent question remains whether the lawyer\u2019s failure to make the argument \u201cconstituted inadequate assistance, especially when viewed in light of the strategy that the petitioner\u2019s counsel did pursue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, at least in some circumstances, when an appellate lawyer \u201creasonably could have concluded that * * * assigning error to [a particular] ruling would have had little chance of success,\u201d the decision not to make that assignment of error does not amount to a suspension of professional skill and judgment. <em>Hempel v. Palmateer, </em>187 Or App 70, 74, 66 P3d 513 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">In this case, then, the questions regarding the trial court\u2019s mid-trial dismissal of Juror B are (1) whether petitioner proved that every appellate attorney exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment would have assigned error to that dismissal, and (2) whether petitioner established that it is \u201cmore probable than not that the result would have been different\u201d had petitioner\u2019s appellate attorney raised that argument. <em>Guinn, </em>304 Or at 496. In this case, the answer to the second question is dispositive. As explained below, petitioner has not established a likelihood that the result would have been different had his appellate lawyers argued in <em>Garner I </em>that the trial court erred by excusing Juror B.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The Supreme Court has repeatedly addressed the circumstances in which a trial court conducting an aggravated murder trial in which the state seeks a death sentence may excuse a prospective juror for cause because of that individual\u2019s views on the death penalty. A person\u2019s moral opposition to the death penalty does not, itself, disqualify the person from jury service in such a case. <em>State v. Turnidge (S059155), </em>359 Or 364, 411, 374 P3d 853 (2016). Rather, the question is whether the person\u2019s views on capital punishment \u201cwould prevent or substantially impair\u201d the person\u2019s performance as a juror in accordance with the instructions and the juror\u2019s oath. <em>Id. </em>at 407. Thus, if \u201ca juror\u2014whether in favor of or against the death penalty on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>principle\u2014holds such strong ethical or moral views that the juror\u2019s conclusion is effectively foregone, no matter the law or the evidence in the case, that juror may be appropriately excused for cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 411. A trial court\u2019s \u201cjudgment as to a prospective juror\u2019s ultimate qualifications is entitled to great weight.\u201d <em>State v. Lotches, </em>331 Or 455, 473, 17 P3d 1045 (2000), <em>cert den, </em>534 US 833 (2001). Accordingly, an appellate court reviews those decisions\u2014including decisions regarding whether a juror\u2019s ability to serve is impaired by his or her views on the death penalty\u2014for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 473-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-3\">Nothing in the record of this post-conviction case suggests that the trial court presiding over petitioner\u2019s aggravated murder trial abused its discretion in excusing Juror B. As discussed above, by the end of his conversation with the trial court, Juror B stated unequivocally that he did not \u201cbelieve that [he] could sentence someone to death.\u201d That statement, which followed a thoughtful discussion between Juror B and the trial court, supports the post-conviction court\u2019s finding that Juror B had an \u201cinability to sentence someone to death.\u201d Neither the trial court nor the post-conviction court was required to view Juror B\u2019s statements in the light that petitioner suggests, that is, as merely expressing \u201cuncertainty\u201d and a \u201cstruggl[e] with the moral responsibility of deciding whether a person should be sentenced to death.\u201d Because the trial court had a basis for concluding that Juror B\u2019s personal beliefs would substantially impair his performance of his duties as a juror, it did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Juror B and replacing him with an alternate. It follows that petitioner was not prejudiced by the absence of a challenge to that ruling on direct appeal; we would have rejected any such challenge had it been made.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The post-conviction court correctly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>denied petitioner post-conviction relief on his claim that his appellate lawyers should have argued that the trial court erred in dismissing Juror B from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">We turn to the superintendent\u2019s cross-appeal, which relates to our disposition in <em>Garner </em>I, where we reversed the aggravated-murder conviction that was premised on intentional maiming of the victim, affirmed the other aggravated-murder conviction, \u201cremanded for entry of corrected judgment,\u201d and otherwise affirmed. 194 Or App at 279. As noted, the post-conviction court granted relief on petitioner\u2019s claim that his appellate attorneys should have sought reconsideration in <em>Garner I </em>on the ground that he was entitled to a remand for resentencing on the single remaining count of aggravated murder, not just to remand for entry of a corrected judgment incorporating the already-imposed sentence of life without parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In challenging that grant of post-conviction relief, the superintendent argues that, at the time we issued <em>Garner </em>1, the appellate courts had interpreted ORS 138.222(5) (2003) in a way that did not require remand for a resen-tencing hearing after \u201creversal of one of the [two] theories supporting [petitioner\u2019s] conviction for aggravated murder.\u201d Accordingly, the superintendent concludes, \u201ccompetent counsel would not, in 2004, have requested reconsideration of this court\u2019s decision in that first direct appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Before analyzing the merits of that argument, we pause to note its narrow focus. The superintendent does not ask us to reverse the grant of post-conviction relief on the ground that the post-conviction court erred in determining that petitioner was prejudiced by his appellate lawyers\u2019 failure to seek reconsideration. Nor does the superintendent argue that the post-conviction court\u2019s determination of inadequacy erroneously took into account its assessment that reconsideration was worth seeking because a resen-tencing hearing might have benefited petitioner. Rather, the superintendent argues only that competent counsel would not have had reason to know, when <em>Garner I </em>issued in April <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>2004, that a reconsideration petition seeking a remand for resentencing might have been viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\">We turn to that question: whether an appellate attorney who was exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment would have sought reconsideration in <em>Garner I, </em>arguing that petitioner was entitled to a resentencing hearing on remand under ORS 138.222(5) (2003). In answering that question, we must consider ORS 138.222(5) (2003) and related case law \u201cas a lawyer would have seen it at the time.\u201d <em>Burdge v. Palmateer, </em>338 Or 490, 498, 112 P3d 320 (2005). That the law was not then settled in petitioner\u2019s favor is not dispositive. Rather, we must consider whether an argument under ORS 138.222(5) (2003) would have \u201cso obviously offer [ed] possible benefits to [petitioner] that any lawyer exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment\u201d would have raised it. <em>Burdge, </em>338 Or at 500. As part of that determination, we assess whether a lawyer whose \u201cpreparation on the law\u201d was \u201cappropriate to the nature and complexity of the case\u201d would have recognized the argument. <em>Walraven v. Premo, </em>277 Or App 264, 278, 372 P3d 1 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">When we issued <em>Garner I </em>in 2004, ORS 138.222(5) (2003) provided, as it had for a decade:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-5\">\u201cThe appellate court may reverse or affirm the sentence. If the appellate court concludes that the trial court\u2019s factual findings are not supported by evidence in the record or do not establish substantial and compelling reasons for a departure, it shall remand the case to the trial court for resentencing. If the appellate court determines that the sentencing court, in imposing a sentence in the case, committed an error that requires resentencing, the appellate court shall remand the entire case for resentencing. The sentencing court may impose a new sentence for any conviction in the remanded case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-6\"><em>See </em>Or Laws 1993, ch 692, \u00a7 2 (adding subsection (5) to ORS 138.222). By then, we routinely had remanded for resentenc-ing under the statute in cases in which we had, on appeal, determined that the trial court had committed a <em>sentencing </em>error, that is, when the trial court \u201cin imposing a sentence in the case, committed an error that requires resentencing.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>ORS 138.222(5) (2003); <em>see, e.g., State v. Beltran, </em>127 Or App 238, 241, 872 P2d 983 (1994) (reversing because of error in imposing a fine; declining to address another sentencing argument \u201cbecause the entire case must be remanded for resentencing. ORS 138.222(5).\u201d); <em>State v. Dvorak, </em>124 Or App 578, 580, 863 P2d 1314 (1993), <em>rev den, </em>318 Or 351 (1994) (where the trial court had erred in sentencing one of two counts of conviction, we concluded \u201cthat the statute requires us to remand \u2018the entire case/ <em>i.e., </em>both counts, for resentencing * * *\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\">But we had not remanded for resentencing under ORS 138.222(5) <em>only </em>when we reversed because of errors in sentencing. In April 2003, more than a year before we decided <em>Garner I, </em>we issued our opinion in <em>State v. Rodvelt, </em>187 Or App 128, 66 P3d 577, <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 17 (2003), in which we explained that the then-existing version of ORS 138.222(5) required remands for resentencing in at least some cases where we were reversing for other reasons. The <em>Rodvelt </em>defendant had been convicted of two counts of first-degree criminal mistreatment and two counts of fourth-degree assault. <em>Id. </em>at 130. He argued on appeal that the trial court had erred in failing to merge the guilt determinations on all four of those counts into only two convictions for first-degree criminal mistreatment. We agreed. <em>Id. </em>We then considered whether we should remand only for the merger for which the defendant had advocated or whether, instead, we should remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">We concluded in <em>Rodvelt </em>that a failure to merge was \u201can error that requires resentencing\u201d within the meaning of ORS 138.222(5) and, therefore, remanded for merger <em>and </em>for resentencing. 187 Or App at 130-31. In doing so, we acknowledged that the reversible error on appeal related to a conviction, not directly to a sentence. However, we rejected the argument \u201cthat sentencing errors that flow from erroneous convictions are not the type of \u2018sentencing errors\u2019 addressed by ORS 138.222(5).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 135. Our decision focused on the complexity of felony sentencing under the sentencing guidelines and noted that \u201cthe way that one conviction is sentenced affects how the remaining convictions are classified on the sentencing guidelines grid for purposes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>of determining what sentences may be imposed on those convictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">Thus, by 2003, we had held that at least some errors <em>not </em>related to sentencing required remand for resentenc-ing under ORS 138.222(5). Nonetheless, the superintendent argues here that a reasonable appellate lawyer who was familiar with <em>Rodvelt </em>still would not have advocated a remand for resentencing in <em>Garner I </em>because <em>Rodvelt </em>dealt only with the complexity of sentencing under the guidelines and emphasized how difficult it can be, in that context, for an appellate court to determine \u201cwhether, and to what extent, an error has affected the actual sentences on the remaining convictions.\u201d 187 Or App at 135. The superintendent concludes that, because this aggravated-murder case involved life sentences, not guidelines sentences, <em>Rodvelt </em>was inapposite. For the following reasons, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">First, as we have explained, the question is not whether the meaning of ORS 138.222(5) (2003) was completely settled in petitioner\u2019s favor at the time we issued <em>Garner </em>I, but whether \u201cthe statute * * * so obviously offer [ed] possible benefits to a defendant that any lawyer exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment would raise it.\u201d <em>Burdge, </em>338 Or at 500. In other words, even though the law was unsettled, we must consider whether \u201cthe benefits of raising an issue [were] so obvious that any lawyer exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment would do so.\u201d <em>Ross v. Hill, </em>235 Or App 340, 344, 231 P3d 1185, <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 56 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number><em>Rodvelt </em>was a significant case in the world of criminal appellate practice, given its expansion of the circumstances under which this court will remand for resentenc-ing. Reasonably competent appellate criminal lawyers would have been familiar with that case in 2004 or at least, when faced with a limited remand like that ordered in <em>Garner I, </em>would have discovered it through doing research \u201cappropriate to the nature and complexity of the case.\u201d <em>Walraven, </em>277 Or App at 278. Moreover, despite its emphasis on sentencing under the guidelines, <em>Rodvelt </em>was based on a more fundamental principle\u2014that errors leading to reversals of some, but not all, of a defendant\u2019s convictions can sometimes have affected the sentences that were imposed on the remaining convictions. It would have taken no great imagination for an appellate lawyer to have argued that, under <em>Rodvelt, </em>the disposition in <em>Garner I </em>should include a remand for a resentenc-ing hearing at which the jury would not take into account an \u201cintentional maiming\u201d theory of aggravated murder\u2014a theory that could have affected the decision of the original sentencing jury. Thus, the possibility of seeking remand for resentencing in <em>Garner I </em>under ORS 138.222(5) (2003) and <em>Rodvelt </em>would have been obvious to any appellate lawyer exercising reasonable professional skill and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">And <em>Rodvelt </em>was not the only precedent pointing in that direction when we issued <em>Garner I </em>in 2004. Nearly two years earlier, we had issued our initial opinion in <em>State v. Sanders, </em>185 Or App 125, 57 P3d 963 (2002) <em>(Sanders I), adh'd to as modified on recons, </em>189 Or App 107, 74 P3d 1105 (2003) <em>(Sanders II), rev den, </em>336 Or 657 (2004). The <em>Sanders </em>defendant had been convicted of multiple counts of assault arising out of an incident involving a single victim. <em>Sanders I, </em>185 Or App at 127. He argued that some of the counts should have merged, and we agreed. <em>Id. </em>We remanded with instructions to merge certain of the counts, and we otherwise affirmed. <em>Id. </em>at 131. The state petitioned for reconsideration, asserting, among other things, \u201cthat we erred * * * in failing to remand the entire case for resen-tencing\u201d under ORS 138.222(5). <em>Sanders II, </em>189 Or App at 109. We agreed and, in a 2003 opinion on reconsideration, remanded for resentencing. <em>Id. </em>Relying on <em>Rodvelt, </em>we held that \u201cwhen one conviction in a multiple-conviction case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>reversed,\u201d ORS 138.222(5) required \u201cremand of the entire case\u201d for resentencing. <em>Id. </em>at 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">True, <em>Sanders II </em>was another sentencing-guidelines case. But it, like <em>Rodvelt, </em>emphasized that the need for resentencing when fewer than all convictions are reversed is based on the fact that the \u201creversal may affect the correctness of other sentences imposed in the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That is precisely the principle that petitioner asserts his appellate lawyers in <em>Garner I </em>should have advocated\u2014that resentenc-ing on his affirmed aggravated-murder conviction was necessary because the original sentence of life without parole may have resulted, in part, from the jury\u2019s incorrect determination that petitioner had intentionally maimed the victim. Moreover, <em>Sanders II </em>also demonstrated that a petition for reconsideration can be an appropriate mechanism for requesting a different disposition on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Our April 2004 decision in <em>State v. Randant, </em>192 Or App 668, 87 P3d 688 <em>(Randant I), adh\u2019d to as clarified on recons, </em>196 Or App 601, 103 P3d 1134 (2004) <em>(Randant II), aff\u2019d, </em>341 Or 64 (2006), <em>cert den, </em>549 US 1227 (2007), also would have informed the decision of a reasonable appellate attorney who was considering what options remained available after we issued <em>Garner I </em>a few months later. The <em>Randant </em>defendant was found guilty of multiple crimes based on the kidnapping and killing of a single victim, including two counts of aggravated murder that were based on different theories of aggravation (murder committed in the course of committing first-degree kidnapping and murder committed in the course of committing second-degree kidnapping), as well as a count of felon in possession of a firearm (FIP). <em>Randant </em>I, 192 Or App at 669. \u201cThe trial court had intended to enter convictions only on [one aggravated-murder count and the FIP count] and to merge the remaining counts\u201d into the single conviction for aggravated murder, but \u201cit actually entered separate convictions\u201d on all counts, \u201cmerging them only for purposes of sentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On appeal, we agreed that the trial court erred by entering convictions beyond those for a single count of aggravated murder and for FIP. Accordingly, we vacated the convictions that should not have been entered and \u201cremanded for merger of convictions <em>and for </em>resentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>The state petitioned for reconsideration <em>o\u00ed Randant I, </em>arguing that \u201cwe should have modified the judgment instead of remanding the case for resentencing.\u201d <em>Randant II, </em>196 Or App at 603. It asserted that, \u201cbecause the actual sentence that petitioner received was not affected by the error, we should modify the judgment only to reflect the single conviction for aggravated murder instead of remanding the entire case for resentencing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606. We disagreed, stating in an opinion on reconsideration that ORS 138.222(5) (2003) always required a remand for resentencing following a determination that the trial court erred in failing to merge certain counts. <em>Id. </em>at 606-07. We cited <em>Rodvelt </em>and <em>Sanders II </em>in support of that conclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 607.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">The superintendent acknowledges that our opinion in <em>Randant II </em>\u201ctreated <em>Rodvelt </em>as creating a <em>per se </em>rule requiring full resentencing under <em>former </em>ORS 138.222(5), even in non-guidelines cases\u201d and that subsequent cases have followed that rule. The superintendent points out, however, that <em>Randant II </em>issued \u201cfive months after the decision in petitioner\u2019s appeal\u201d and he asserts that reasonable appellate counsel would not have anticipated that opinion. The difficulty with the superintendent\u2019s argument is that the original decision in <em>Randant I </em>issued <em>before </em>our decision in <em>Garner I, </em>establishing (albeit without explanation at that point) that remand for resentencing was the proper disposition following reversal (or vacation) of fewer than all convictions, even in cases involving nonguidelines sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">Thus, when <em>Garner I </em>issued, this court\u2019s opinions in <em>Randant I, Sanders II, </em>and <em>Rodvelt </em>all would have obviously supported a petition for reconsideration asserting that petitioner was entitled to a remand for resentencing, rather than only to remand for entry of a corrected judgment reflecting a single aggravated-murder conviction. Nonetheless, the superintendent argues that reasonable appellate counsel would not have recognized the availability of remand in this case before the reconsideration opinion issued in <em>Randant II, </em>given the Supreme Court\u2019s opinions in <em>State v. Hale, </em>335 Or 612, 75 P3d 448 (2003), <em>cert den, </em>541 US 942 (2004), and <em>Lotches, </em>331 Or 455. In each of those cases, the Supreme Court reversed some, but not all, of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>defendant\u2019s aggravated-murder convictions. <em>Hale, </em>335 Or at 632; <em>Lotches, </em>331 Or at 499. In <em>Hale, </em>the court vacated the death sentences on the aggravated-murder convictions that it had reversed, and it remanded only \u201cfor entry of corrected judgments of conviction\u201d regarding the affirmed aggravated-murder counts\u2014it affirmed the death sentences on those counts and did not remand for resentencing. 335 Or at 631-32. Similarly, in <em>Lotches, </em>the court affirmed the death sentence for one count of aggravated murder after reversing two others; again, it did not remand for resentencing on that conviction. 331 Or at 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">It is true that the opinions in <em>Lotches </em>and <em>Hale </em>would not, themselves, have given a reasonable appellate attorney any reason to consider seeking a remand for resentencing after we issued <em>Garner I. </em>But nothing in <em>Lotches </em>or <em>Hale </em>suggests that the defendants in those cases argued that they were entitled to resentencing on the surviving aggravated-murder convictions, and nothing in those opinions suggests that the Supreme Court considered and rejected such an argument. The <em>absence </em>of a resentencing discussion in <em>Lotches </em>and <em>Hale </em>would not have dissuaded reasonable appellate counsel in <em>Garner I </em>from seeking remand for resentencing based on the results and reasoning that were <em>present </em>in <em>Randant I, Sanders II, </em>and <em>Rodvelt.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">The post-conviction court correctly concluded that reasonable appellate counsel would have petitioned for reconsideration in <em>Garner I. </em>Accordingly, the superintendent\u2019s cross-appeal presents no basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Affirmed on appeal and cross-appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-6\"> <em>See </em>ORS 163.095(l)(e) (aggravated murder includes murder that \u201coccurred in the course of or as a result of intentional maiming or torture of the victim\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b522-7\"> <em>See </em>ORS 163.095(2)(e) (aggravated murder includes murder that \u201cwas committed in an effort to conceal the commission of a crime, or to conceal the identity of the perpetrator of a crime\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b523-7\"> As we more recently have emphasized, \u201cthe phrase \u2018merged for sentencing purposes\u2019 is a misnomer and should never be used because it improperly conflates two distinct parts of the criminal process: the entry of convictions and the imposition of sentences.\u201d <em>State v.
