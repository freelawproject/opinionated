J.</author>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">In this criminal case, defendant appeals the trial court\u2019s judgment convicting him of one count of first-degree sodomy, ORS 163.405, and two counts of first-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.427, based on incidents in Washington County involving one victim. On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his pretrial motion to exclude evidence of incidents of sexual contact between defendant and the victim in Multnomah County. For the reasons explained below, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion. Defendant also assigns error to the sentence that the trial court imposed on the sodomy count. We reject that argument without written discussion. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Defendant was charged by indictment with one count of first-degree sodomy and one count of first-degree sexual abuse, based on an allegation that he had oral sex with the victim, who was 11 years old, at the victim\u2019s residence in Washington County. Defendant was also charged with one count of first-degree sexual abuse based on an allegation that he kissed the victim at a transit center in Washington County.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">Prior to trial, defendant filed a motion to exclude evidence of other incidents of sexual contact between defendant and the victim. At the hearing on the motion, the state informed the trial court that it planned to present evidence of three incidents in Multnomah County, two involving oral sex and one involving anal sex. The Multnomah County incidents occurred a few weeks after the initial Washington County incident at the victim\u2019s residence. The victim did not report defendant\u2019s conduct until after the Multnomah County incidents.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">The state argued that evidence of the Multnomah County incidents was relevant for two reasons. First, the state argued that, under <em>State v. McKay, </em>309 Or 305, 787 P2d 479 (1990), the evidence was relevant \u201cto show this defendant\u2019s sexual interest in the victim.\u201d The state asserted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>the evidence was not impermissible \u201cpropensity evidence\u201d because <em>\u201cMcKay </em>specifically says [this type of evidence] isn\u2019t relevant to show someone\u2019s propensity to commit a crime, but rather to show his sexual interest in this particular victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">Second, the state argued that, under <em>State v. Zybach, </em>308 Or 96, 775 P2d 318 (1989), the evidence was relevant \u201cto show a reason why the victim had not reported the original sexual assault.\u201d The state asserted that evidence that defendant continued to abuse the victim after the initial incident \u201chelps explain part of the reason why [the victim] didn\u2019t go tell his mom or the police [.] \u201d That is, the state asserted that, under <em>Zybach, </em>the evidence was \u201cnot admissible for propensity, but it\u2019s admissible to show why [the victim] hadn\u2019t reported [defendant\u2019s conduct].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">In response to the state\u2019s arguments, defendant contended that, even if the evidence was relevant under <em>McKay </em>to show his sexual interest in the victim and under Zybach'to explain the victim\u2019s delayed reporting, OEC 403 provided \u201canother specific reason to keep [the evidence] out.\u201d OEC 403 provides, in part, that relevant evidence \u201cmay be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury[.]\u201d Defendant argued that the evidence of the Multnomah County incidents would be distracting and that its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-6\">\u201cWe have a jury that will be seated to hear a case concerning alleged sexual acts that occurred in Washington County. They\u2019re not here to determine acts that occurred in other counties and other occasions. So our concern for the defense your Honor is that if the State is allowed to go into sexual acts that occurred in other counties, that will very much taint the jury against the defendant and deprive him of a fair trial. And that there is very real danger * * * of unfair prejudice outweighing the probative value; certainly there may be probative value, but the prejudice is extremely high.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">The trial court ruled that the evidence was relevant and admissible under both <em>McKay </em>and <em>Zybach. </em>Defendant then prompted the trial court to rule on his OEC 403 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>argument, and, after asking the parties their positions, the trial court ruled that the evidence was admissible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-4\">\u201cDEFENSE: Judge, I understand your ruling, of course with all due respect are you going to make a finding on my OEC 403 argument at all just so the record is complete?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-5\">\u201cCOURT: Okay, and [prosecutor], what\u2019s the State\u2019s position there then once again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-6\">\u201cSTATE: Well the defense is arguing that it\u2019s unfairly prejudicial and the State\u2019s position is that the evidence is highly relevant and that the relevancy and the probative value greatly outweighs the prejudicial effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-7\">\u201cCOURT: Okay, anything else on that then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-8\">\u201cDEFENSE: No, I\u2019ve made my argument your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b830-9\">\u201cCOURT: It\u2019s relevant and it outweighs the prejudicial effects.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b830-10\">The case proceeded to trial, during which the state presented a large amount of detailed evidence regarding the Multnomah County incidents. Defendant did not object to the amount or nature of that evidence at trial. The jury convicted defendant of all counts, and defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-11\">Defendant asserts that the trial court erred \u201cin denying defendant\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>and consequently admitting evidence of defendant\u2019s uncharged misconduct in another county.\u201d We review the denial of a motion <em>in limine </em>\u201cin light of the record made before the trial court when it issued the order, not the trial record as it may have developed at some later point.\u201d <em>State v. Pitt, </em>352 Or 566, 575, 293 P3d 1002 (2012); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>281 Or App 51, 53, 380 P3d 1023 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-12\">Before admitting evidence of a defendant\u2019s uncharged misconduct, a trial court must, upon request, weigh the probative value of the evidence against the danger of unfair prejudice, as required by OEC 403. <em>See State v. Holt, </em>279 Or App 663, 671, 381 P3d 897 (2016) (relying on <em>State v. Williams, </em>357 Or 1, 19, 346 P3d 455 (2015), and <em>State v. Turnidge (S059155), </em>359 Or 364, 441-42, 374 P3d 853 (2016), for the proposition that, \u201c[w]hen a trial court admits prior bad acts evidence in a child sexual abuse case, either for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>propensity purpose or a nonpropensity purpose, OEC 403 balancing is required, on a proper motion\u201d); <em>see also State v. Brumbach, </em>273 Or App 552, 563, 359 P3d 490 (2015), <em>rev den, </em>359 Or 525 (2016) (\u201cOEC 403 balancing is \u2018the only way that a court can ensure that the admission of \u201cother acts\u201d evidence is not unfairly prejudicial and a violation of \u201cfundamental concepts of justice.\u201d\u2019\u201d (Quoting <em>Williams, </em>357 Or at 18-19.)). Defendant argues that the trial court erred in two ways in conducting its OEC 403 balancing: (1) by failing to make an adequate record of its balancing, and (2) by concluding that the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">We begin with defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court \u201cfailed to make a record reflecting its exercise of discretion under OEC 403,\u201d as required by <em>State v. Mayfield, </em>302 Or 631, 733 P2d 438 (1987). In <em>Mayfield, </em>the Supreme Court set out a four-step process for OEC 403 balancing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-5\">\u201cFirst, the trial judge should assess the proponent\u2019s need for the uncharged misconduct evidence. In other words, the judge should analyze the quantum of probative value of the evidence and consider the weight or strength of the evidence. In the second step the trial judge must determine how prejudicial the evidence is, to what extent the evidence may distract the jury from the central question whether the defendant committed the charged crime. The third step is the judicial process of balancing the prosecution\u2019s need for the evidence against the countervailing prejudicial danger of unfair prejudice, and the fourth step is for the judge to make his or her ruling to admit all the proponent\u2019s evidence, to exclude all the proponent\u2019s evidence or to admit only part of the evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">302 Or at 645; <em>see also Williams, </em>357 Or at 22 n 21 (when assessing the probative value of evidence, a court should determine \u201cwhether other evidence that does not carry the same risk of unfair prejudice is available to prove an element of the charged crime\u201d);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>at 18 (describing \u201cunfair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>prejudice\u201d in the context of due process as \u201c\u2018the capacity of some concededly relevant evidence to lure the factfinder into declaring guilt on a ground different from proof specific to the offense charged,\u2019\u201d including \u201c\u2018generalizing a defendant\u2019s earlier bad act into bad character and taking that as raising the odds that he did the later bad act now charged\u2019\u201d (quoting <em>Old Chief v. United States, </em>519 US 172, 180, 117 S Ct 644, 136 L Ed 2d 574 (1997))).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">The proponent of the evidence bears the burden of \u201cconvine [ing] the court that the evidence not only is logically relevant but also that its probative value is substantial enough to outweigh any attendant danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d <em>Mayfield, </em>302 Or at 645. \u201cThe judge errs if the judge fails to exercise discretion, refuses to exercise discretion or fails to make a record which reflects an exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">In this case, the parties agree, and it is clear from the record, that the trial court conducted OEC 403 balancing. Nevertheless, defendant contends that the court erred in failing to make a more detailed record of its balancing process. According to defendant, the trial court committed reversible error because it \u201cfailed to make a record that reflects an exercise of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">Defendant is incorrect. As set out above, the state identified the two theories of relevance upon which it was relying, and defendant responded that, even if the evidence was relevant, the trial court should exclude it under OEC 403 because it would distract the jury and was highly prejudicial. After the trial court ruled that the evidence was relevant for the reasons proffered by the state, defendant specifically asked the trial court to rule on his OEC 403 argument. In response, the state asserted that the \u201cevidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>is highly relevant and that the relevancy and the probative value greatly outweighs the prejudicial effect,\u201d and the trial court ruled, \u201cIt\u2019s relevant and it outweighs the prejudicial effects.\u201d Thus, given the parties\u2019 arguments, we understand the trial court to have accepted the state\u2019s argument that the evidence was relevant under <em>McKay </em>to show defendant\u2019s sexual predisposition toward the victim and under <em>Zybach </em>to show why the victim delayed reporting the initial incident. We further understand the trial court to have rejected defendant\u2019s argument that, even if the evidence was relevant, its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">Although the trial court did not walk through the four-step <em>Mayfield </em>analysis on the record, the record is nevertheless sufficient in that it reflects that the trial court engaged in the \u201c\u2018conscious process of balancing the costs of the evidence against its benefits\u2019 that OEC 403 requires.\u201d <em>State v. Meyers, </em>132 Or App 585, 589, 889 P2d 374 (1995) (quoting <em>State v. Pinnell, </em>311 Or 98, 112-13, 806 P2d 110 (1991)). Here, understood in the context of the parties\u2019 arguments, the trial court\u2019s ruling is sufficient to allow us to evaluate whether, as defendant argues, the court abused its discretion in concluding that the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Accordingly, we turn to the merits of that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Defendant argues that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to exclude the evidence because, according to defendant, the evidence had little or no cognizable probative value under either of the state\u2019s two theories and any probative value it had was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Regarding the probative value of the evidence, defendant argues that the state did not need the evidence to prove \u201cdefendant\u2019s sexual intent or purpose\u201d under <em>McKay </em>because defendant \u201cdid not claim lack of sexual intent, which was undeniable given that one of the charged acts was oral sodomy.\u201d Defendant further argues that the state did not need the evidence to show why the victim delayed reporting, because the state had other evidence to explain the timing of the victim\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>We begin with defendant\u2019s contention that the evidence had no cognizable probative value under <em>McKay. </em>As mentioned, defendant asserts that, even if the evidence was relevant for the purpose of showing defendant\u2019s sexual predisposition toward the victim, there was no need for the evidence here because it was obvious, and defendant did not dispute, that, if he committed the charged acts\u2014that is, if he engaged in oral sex with or kissed the victim\u2014he did so with a sexual purpose.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That position rests on the understanding that, under <em>McKay, </em>evidence of sexual predisposition toward the victim is relevant only to prove a defendant\u2019s sexual intent, not to prove that the defendant engaged in the charged conduct. The state responds that evidence of a defendant\u2019s sexual predisposition toward the victim is relevant to prove both conduct and intent. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">In <em>McKay, </em>the Supreme Court held that OEC 404(3) allows the introduction of evidence of other abuse of the victim by the defendant \u201cto show the sexual inclination of [the] defendant towards the victim, not that he had a character trait or propensity to engage in sexual misconduct generally.\u201d 309 Or at 308. The court explained in <em>McKay </em>that it had reached the same conclusion in <em>State v. Pace, </em>187 Or 498, 507, 212 P2d 755 (1949), a prosecution for statutory rape in which the court \u201cheld that evidence of other similar criminal acts with the same child is admissible to show the specific sexual predisposition of the defendant towards that child.\u201d <em>McKay, </em>309 Or at 308. Referring to <em>Pace </em>and other similar cases decided before the adoption of OEC 404(3), the court explained, \u201cThe adoption of OEC 404(3) did not change the effect of the above cases.\u201d <em>McKay, </em>309 Or at 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">In <em>Pace, </em>the Supreme Court explained, \u201cIn prosecutions for statutory rape, evidence of other similar criminal acts with the same child is admissible to show the lustful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>disposition of the defendant and <em>the probability of his having committed the particular act charged in the indictment\u201d </em>187 Or at 507 (emphasis added). Thus, by adopting the rule stated in <em>Pace </em>and holding that OEC 404(3) \u201cdid not change\u201d the rule, the court in <em>McKay </em>held that evidence of other sexual abuse of the victim by the defendant was relevant to prove that the charged act took place, not just to prove that the defendant acted with sexual intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">Defendant is correct that, in this case, there was no need for the evidence of the Multnomah County incidents to prove that, if defendant engaged in the charged acts, he did so with sexual intent. However, as we have explained, under <em>McKay, </em>the evidence was also relevant to show that the charged acts took place. Whether the acts took place at all was the disputed issue in the case. The evidence was relevant for the nonpropensity purpose of proving defendant\u2019s sexual predisposition toward the victim, <em>McKay, </em>309 Or at 308, and it had cognizable probative value on that theory of relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">We turn to defendant\u2019s argument that the evidence lacked cognizable probative value as to the victim\u2019s delayed reporting. As we have explained, the information before the trial court when it decided defendant\u2019s motion was that the three Multnomah County incidents occurred a few weeks after the charged incident at defendant\u2019s residence in Washington County, and the victim did not report defendant\u2019s conduct until after the Multnomah County incidents. The court decided that the evidence that defendant\u2019s abuse of the victim had continued after the Washington County incidents was relevant to help explain why the victim had not reported the initial incident when it took place. <em>See Zybach, </em>308 Or at 99-100 (evidence of \u201cthe ongoing relationship\u201d between the defendant and the victim was relevant to allow jury to \u201cinfer reasons for the delayed reporting\u201d). On the record, it was reasonable for the court to decide that, in the course of assessing the credibility of the victim\u2019s allegations, the jury would wonder why the victim did not report the abuse earlier. Accordingly, on the record before it, the court could decide that the evidence would have cognizable probative value on a \u201cdelayed reporting\u201d theory of relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>As mentioned, defendant argues that other evidence available to the state adequately explained the victim\u2019s delayed reporting. Specifically, defendant relies on evidence presented at trial that the victim was afraid of defendant and did not report any sexual contact with defendant until an officer confronted him with reports of the contact from others. As explained above, however, we are reviewing the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion <em>in limine, </em>and defendant did not argue, at the time of the hearing on the motion, that the evidence should be excluded because the state had other evidence to explain the delayed reporting.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">The disputed evidence had cognizable probative value on both of the theories of relevance on which the trial court relied in admitting it. Under these particular circumstances, it was not an abuse of discretion for the court to decide that the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice from it.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b828-8\"> It is unclear from the record whether the incident at the transit center in Washington County occurred before or after the Multnomah County incidents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b831-7\"> In <em>Williams, </em>the court suggested that the consideration of the proponent\u2019s need for the evidence under OEC 403 arises, at least in part, from the requirement of due process:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b831-8\">\u201cFor instance, in <em>Old Chief </em>[v. <em>United </em>States], 519 US [172,] 174, [117 S Ct 644, 136 L Ed 2d 574 (1997),] the United States Supreme Court held that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>trial court had abused its discretion in rejecting the defendant\u2019s stipulation to an element of the charged crime (in that case, a prior conviction), when the stipulation met all the government\u2019s requirements for proving that element and the evidence proffered by the government \u2018raise [d] the risk of a verdict tainted by improper considerations.\u2019 The Court directed trial courts to weigh \u2018whether the danger of undue prejudice outweighs the probative value of the evidence in view of the availability of other means of proof and other facts appropriate for making decisions of this kind.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 184.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">357 Or at 22 n 21.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b834-6\"> Defendant also argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>McKay </em>was incorrect because a theory of relevance based on \u201csexual inclination\u201d or \u201csexual interest\u201d is actually just a propensity theory. He asserts that a \u201cperson\u2019s \u2018sexual inclination\u2019 towards a particular person is another way of saying that he or she is likely to act in conformity with that character trait.\u201d We reject that argument because the Supreme Court decided <em>McKay </em>and has not overruled it; thus, we are bound by its holding.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b836-6\"> At the hearing on the motion <em>in limine, </em>the state did not give any information about how much or what kind of evidence it intended to present about the Multnomah County incidents, and defendant did not request the court to place any limits on its presentation of that evidence.
