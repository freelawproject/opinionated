He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress certain evidence, which asserted that the police entry into his bedroom without a warrant was unlawful under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution. He argues on appeal, as he did below, that the entry was unlawful because his father, who allowed the police to enter the closed room defendant rented from him even though defendant indicated to the police that they did not have his permission to enter, was not authorized to give consent to enter defendant\u2019s bedroom. The state concedes that, although consent is an established exception to the warrant requirement, the trial court erred because the state did not meet its burden of proving that defendant\u2019s father had actual authority to consent to the entry. <em>See, e.g., State v. Bonilla, </em>356 Or 475, 481, 366 P3d 331 (2015) (\u201cWhen the state relies on consent, it must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that \u2018someone having the authority to do so\u2019 voluntarily gave the police consent to search the defendant\u2019s property and that any limitations on the scope of the consent were complied with.\u201d (Quoting <em>State v. Weaver, </em>319 Or 212, 219, 874 P2d 1322 (1994).)). We agree, accept the state\u2019s concession, and reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
