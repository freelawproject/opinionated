The state argues that key evidence offered by petitioner in support of his claim of inadequate assistance of counsel would have been inadmissible at his criminal trial and that the post-conviction court erred in granting relief based at least in part on that evidence. Specifically, the state asserts that expert witness testimony proffered by petitioner was scientific evidence and that petitioner failed to show that, as such, it comported with the admissibility requirements specific to scientific evidence. As explained in this opinion, we agree with the state that key parts of the challenged testimony are scientific evidence and that petitioner failed to meet his burden of showing that that testimony would have been admissible at petitioner\u2019s criminal trial. We conclude further that, because that testimony was critical to petitioner\u2019s claim of inadequate assistance of counsel, the post-conviction court erred in concluding that petitioner suffered prejudice, and we reverse the post-conviction court\u2019s grant of post-conviction relief on that basis.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">The following facts, which are undisputed on appeal, are drawn from the record. Petitioner was a guest at a party where he became intoxicated. Early in the evening, a group of partygoers\u2014including the victim, E, and her friend, A\u2014were downstairs watching a violent movie. Petitioner, who was visibly drunk, came downstairs for about 30 minutes. Petitioner sat next to A while watching the movie and, when A\u2019s boyfriend left the room, petitioner made sexual comments to her, telling A that he wanted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>to have sex with her and mumbling something about her \u201cboobs.\u201d After the movie ended, petitioner played a game of pool with E. Petitioner, who was slurring his speech and having trouble keeping his balance, told E that she was pretty. After playing pool, petitioner hugged E, although E \u201ckind of stood back and didn\u2019t really want a hug.\u201d Around 1:00 a.m., petitioner had an emotional breakdown while with his sister. Petitioner was crying and saying repeatedly, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t me,\u201d and attempting to go home. Petitioner\u2019s sister believed petitioner may have been having a flashback related to his service in the Vietnam War. Petitioner\u2019s sister took his car keys because she was concerned about him driving while intoxicated, and then made up a bed for petitioner and left him to sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">E, A, and a third woman all went to sleep around 2:00 a.m. in a basement room, with E and the third woman sharing an air mattress. E awoke to the feeling of someone touching her back, and found petitioner touching her breasts and buttocks. E immediately noticed that her pants and underwear had been pulled down to her knees and that petitioner was \u201ccompletely naked.\u201d E pushed petitioner away, but petitioner did not stop touching her until she pushed him \u201cabout two or three more times\u201d and said, \u201c[s]top.\u201d E later testified at the criminal trial that, after she told him to stop, petitioner \u201cjust kind of sat there for a little bit\u201d and looked \u201clike somebody snapping out of a trance.\u201d Petitioner picked up his clothes and walked into another room but returned a few minutes later and asked E if she was okay. E replied, \u201cNo. Go away.\u201d Petitioner then left. At some point, petitioner was seen coming up the stairs from the basement, naked, while several people were still hanging out in the house. He was described as mumbling and incoherent. Petitioner\u2019s sister took petitioner back to the bed that she had made for him, and petitioner went to sleep. In his subsequent statements to police, petitioner maintained that he had no recollection of going downstairs, taking off his clothing, or touching E.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">At petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, his defense counsel did not contest that petitioner had touched E; rather, defense counsel emphasized the witness accounts of petitioner\u2019s intoxication to argue that, because petitioner was so drunk, he could not have acted \u201cknowingly\u201d as required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>for a conviction in his case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his opening statement, petitioner\u2019s defense counsel referenced petitioner\u2019s military service in Vietnam and explained that the jury would hear evidence that the movie playing at the party was \u201cparticularly freaky\u201d and \u201cparticularly scary,\u201d and \u201cbrought back memories of [petitioner\u2019s] Vietnam service.\u201d As a result, defense counsel explained, petitioner \u201cdr[ank] and t[ook] his medication because he did not want to feel that way; he did not want to re-have those memories; he did not want to think about the war.\u201d During the trial, petitioner\u2019s sister testified that she believed that petitioner\u2019s emotional breakdown was related to his experience in Vietnam, but defense counsel did not introduce as evidence a mental health diagnosis for petitioner. Petitioner did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">In closing, petitioner\u2019s defense counsel argued that, as a result of his intoxication, petitioner was \u201con autopilot\u201d when he went downstairs and it was \u201cjust as likely\u201d that petitioner was trying to get out of the house and go home when he wandered into the room where E was sleeping. Defense counsel further argued to the jury that petitioner was \u201cfeeling his way through\u201d a dark and unfamiliar room when he touched E: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know who she is. He doesn\u2019t know where he is. When he\u2019s told, \u2018No,\u2019 he stops.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s defense counsel then argued that petitioner\u2019s lack of memory was evidence that he lacked the required mental state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b898-5\">\u201cI think I talked about it a little bit on jury selection when people are under anesthesia *** you don\u2019t remember what happened, and again, I\u2019m not bringing up lack of memory as excuse or as denial. Lack of memory is really\u2014 in this case is really a result of the extreme intoxication. That\u2019s what happens when somebody\u2019s either under anesthesia or extremely intoxicated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">At the conclusion of the trial, petitioner was found guilty by the jury of two counts of first-degree sexual abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">After petitioner\u2019s direct appeal was dismissed on his own motion, petitioner sought post-conviction relief, raising four claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Petitioner\u2019s second claim, which is the focus of this opinion, asserted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>petitioner\u2019s trial counsel \u201cfailed to develop a defense theory based on petitioner\u2019s health problems, including his military service-connected post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\u201d Petitioner asserted that his trial counsel should have been aware of evidence that petitioner was suffering from PTSD related to his military service and that petitioner abused alcohol to self-medicate and ease symptoms associated with that disorder. Petitioner claimed that his counsel could have leveraged those facts to develop a diminished capacity defense attacking the <em>mens rea </em>requirements of the sexual abuse charges<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or a lack-of-volition theory attacking the <em>actus </em>reus.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Petitioner acknowledged that his trial counsel did present some evidence of his military history, mental health issues, and intoxication; however, he pointed out that the evidence was introduced by lay witnesses and argued that a defense such as he outlined required expert testimony to be effective. Petitioner argued that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to obtain and present expert witness testimony supporting that theory constituted inadequate assistance of counsel and necessitated a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-4\">In support of his claim, petitioner offered, among other things, the testimony of two experts: Dr. Robert Julien, a retired pharmacologist, and Dr. Bridget Cantrell, a mental health therapist. Prior to the post-conviction trial, the state moved to exclude the testimony of both witnesses and argued that neither expert\u2019s testimony would have been admissible in petitioner\u2019s criminal trial. As relevant to this appeal, the state argued that key parts of each expert\u2019s testimony amounted to scientific evidence and that, under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>admissibility requirements for scientific evidence set out in <em>State v. Brown, </em>297 Or 404, 687 P2d 751 (1984), and <em>State v. O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or 285, 899 P2d 663 (1995), their testimony would have been inadmissible in petitioner\u2019s criminal trial because it lacked valid scientific foundation. In response, petitioner primarily argued that the admissibility requirements of <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key </em>did not apply to the testimony of Julien and Cantrell for various reasons that we address below. At the post-conviction trial, petitioner called Cantrell and Julien, whose testimony we discuss in detail as part of our analysis later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">Following the post-conviction trial, the court granted petitioner post-conviction relief, ordering the judgment from his criminal trial vacated and the case returned for a new trial. In its judgment, the post-conviction court concluded that petitioner\u2019s counsel was deficient and that petitioner had suffered prejudice. The post-conviction court framed the issue underlying petitioner\u2019s second claim for relief as \u201cwhether [petitioner\u2019s] trial attorney properly evaluated the PTSD and alcohol issues.\u201d The post-conviction court noted that \u201c[t]he bench and bar have recently become aware of the particular issues of veterans\u201d and that petitioner\u2019s attorney had access to trainings and referrals related to veterans\u2019 issues but did not \u201ccall upon the resources available to evaluate the defense.\u201d The post-conviction court then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-5\">\u201cThe best defense in this case is alcohol and PTSD. *** [Defense counsel] needed an expert with the proper experience who could follow up and definitively diagnose PTSD. [Defense counsel] could have called on the VA system or one of the experts from the [Oregon Criminal Defense Lawyer\u2019s Association] training. He didn\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">The post-conviction court also found that the testimony of Cantrell and Julien would have been admissible at trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b900-7\">\u201cBoth Julien and Cantrell qualify as expert witnesses based on their training and experience. They each have specialized knowledge and experience that would assist the trier of fact. Their testimony is admissible for this hearing and for trial. It would have then been up to a trial jury to decide what to do with that testimony. This court has certainly found it informative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>The post-conviction court then concluded that the expert witness testimony would have \u201caffected [the] outcome\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b901-3\">\u201cThere is prejudice here. The experts would have testified to enough that there is a reasonable likelihood it would have affected [the] outcome.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b901-4\">The court did not specify which parts of the testimony it found helpful or that it believed would have affected the outcome of petitioner\u2019s criminal trial, and it did not determine whether any parts of the experts\u2019 testimony were scientific evidence or whether that evidence met any of the admissibility criteria discussed in <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">On appeal, the state assigns error to the post-conviction court\u2019s determination that the testimony of Julien and Cantrell would have been admissible at trial and its decision to grant post-conviction relief based at least in part on that testimony. The parties largely reiterate to us the arguments that they made to the post-conviction court. The state contends that parts of the testimony of Julien and Cantrell are scientific evidence subject to the requirements of <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key </em>and that petitioner failed to meet his burden at the post-conviction trial of showing that the evidence would have been admissible at the criminal trial. The state argues further that, applying the admissibility criteria from <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key, </em>the science underlying parts of Julien\u2019s and Cantrell\u2019s testimony is invalid and therefore would have been inadmissible at trial. Petitioner argues that the testimony of Julien and Cantrell is not subject to <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key </em>but rather is governed only by the requirements applicable to all expert witnesses as stated in OEC 702. Petitioner further argues that Oregon\u2019s intoxication-defense statute, ORS 161.125, makes the testimony admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">Based on those arguments, the issue before us is whether the post-conviction court erred in concluding that the testimony of Julien and Cantrell would have been admissible at petitioner\u2019s criminal trial and, on the basis of that testimony, erred in granting petitioner a new trial. As we proceed to explain, we conclude that key parts of Julien\u2019s and Cantrell\u2019s testimony are \u201cscientific\u201d evidence. As the proponent of scientific evidence in a post-conviction proceeding, petitioner had the burden to show that the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>meets the admissibility requirements specific to scientific evidence. Because we conclude that petitioner failed to meet that burden, the post-conviction court erred in concluding that those parts of the testimony would have been admissible. As a result, petitioner failed to show that he was prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s performance at his criminal trial and, therefore, the post-conviction court erred in granting petitioner post-conviction relief as to his second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">We begin our analysis with an overview of our law regarding inadequate assistance of counsel. Petitioner raised claims for post-conviction relief under both the Oregon Constitution and the United States Constitution. A petitioner who seeks post-conviction relief on the ground that his trial counsel was inadequate must prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, facts demonstrating that his counsel failed to exercise reasonable professional skill and judgment and that the petitioner suffered prejudice as a result. <em>Trujillo v. Maass, </em>312 Or 431, 435, 822 P2d 703 (1991); <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 US 668, 687, 104 S Ct 2052, 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984) (the federal constitution requires \u201ceffective\u201d assistance of counsel). Our analysis focuses on the second of those two prongs\u2014whether petitioner showed that he suffered prejudice as a result of the alleged deficient performance of his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">To prove prejudice under the Oregon Constitution, a petitioner must show that his counsel\u2019s deficient performance had \u201ca tendency to affect the result of the prosecution.\u201d <em>Stevens v. State of Oregon, </em>322 Or 101, 110, 902 P2d 1137 (1995); <em>see also Green v. Franke, </em>357 Or 301, 322-23, 350 P3d 188 (2015) (explaining that \u201cthe tendency to affect the outcome standard demands more than mere possibility, but less than probability,\u201d and that \u201cthe issue is whether trial counsel\u2019s acts or omissions <em>could have tended to affect </em>the outcome of the case\u201d (emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted)). When a petitioner\u2019s claim is that his trial counsel was deficient for failing to investigate and pursue a particular trial strategy, as petitioner argues here, \u201cthe petitioner must adduce evidence at the post-conviction hearing that would have been discovered and <em>introduced </em>at the criminal trial had trial counsel undertaken the proposed investigation.\u201d <em>Short v. Hill, </em>195 Or App 723, 729, 99 P3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>311 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 374 (2005) (emphasis added). That is, to show prejudice, the petitioner \u201cmust prove that investigation would have produced <em>admissible </em>evidence\u201d that could have affected the outcome of the trial. <em>Tracy v. Nooth, </em>252 Or App 163, 170, 285 P3d 745 (2012), <em>adh\u2019d to on recons, </em>255 Or App 435, 299 P3d 565, <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 868 (2013) (emphasis added); <em>see also Holcomb v. Hill, </em>235 Or App 419, 438, 233 P3d 448, <em>rev den, </em>349 Or 370 (2010) (petitioner failed to show prejudice where testimony essential to his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel would have been inadmissible at trial). To prove prejudice under the federal constitution, a petitioner must demonstrate that there was a \u201creasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 US at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-4\">To summarize, to show that he was prejudiced by his trial counsel\u2019s failure to procure evidence, petitioner had to proffer evidence at the post-conviction trial that would have been admissible at his criminal trial and that had a tendency to affect the outcome of that trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">The threshold question in this case is whether key parts of petitioner\u2019s expert witness testimony were scientific evidence. Whether evidence is \u201cscientific\u201d is a legal question that we review for legal error. <em>State v. Trujillo, </em>271 Or App 785, 786, 353 P3d 609, <em>rev den, </em>358 Or 146 (2015). Evidence is considered scientific if it \u201cdraws its convincing force from some principle of science, mathematics and the like.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>297 Or at 407.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-6\">\u201cUnder <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key, </em>scientific evidence is admissible if it is relevant under OEC 401, helpful to the trier of fact under OEC 702, and not subject to exclusion under OEC 403. Underpinning the entire admissibility analysis, however, is the requirement that the evidence be shown to be scientifically valid. To determine that issue, and depending on the nature of the evidence in question, a court may be required to consider a number of factors, including:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-7\">\u201c\u2018(1) The technique\u2019s general acceptance in the field;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-8\">\u201c\u2018(2) The expert\u2019s qualifications and stature;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-9\">\u201c\u2018(3) The use which has been made of the technique;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b903-10\">\u201c\u2018(4) The potential rate of error;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>\u2018\u201c(5) The existence of specialized literature;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-3\">\u201c\u2018(6) The novelty of the invention; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b904-4\"><em>\u2018\u201c(7) </em>The extent to which the technique relies on the subjective interpretation of the expert.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b904-5\"><em>State v. Perry, </em>347 Or 110, 121, 218 P3d 95 (2009) (quoting <em>Brown, </em>297 Or at 417 (internal citations and. footnotes omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">In determining whether proposed expert witness testimony is scientific evidence, and therefore subject to <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key, </em>the key issue is \u201cwhether the expert\u2019s assertions possess significantly increased potential to influence the trier of fact as scientific assertions.\u201d <em>State v. Marrington, </em>335 Or 555, 562, 73 P3d 911 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIn other words, if jurors would view the evidence as having \u2018an unusually high degree of persuasive power\u2019 because of the perception that it is based on scientific assertions, then the underlying foundation for the evidence must be valid.\u201d State <em>v. Dulfu, </em>282 Or App 209, 214-15, 386 P3d 85 (2016), <em>rev allowed, </em>361 Or 100 (2017) (quoting <em>O\u2019Key, </em>321 Or at 291-92). The line between nonscientific expert testimony and scientific expert testimony \u201cmay be fine, but it is not artificial.\u201d <em>State v. Rambo, </em>250 Or App 186, 195, 279 P3d 361 (2012), <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 203 (2013). \u201cThe distinction is that specialized expert opinion evidence based on a witness\u2019s training and experience draws its force from that training and experience, but not necessarily from the mantle of science.\u201d <em>State v. Cuevas, </em>263 Or App 94, 109, 326 P3d 1242 (2014), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>358 Or 147, 361 P3d 581 (2015) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">In this inquiry, we and the Supreme Court have considered the content of an expert\u2019s proffered testimony, the manner in which the expert is presented to the fact-finder, and the relationship between the expert\u2019s conclusions and the expert\u2019s expertise. So, for example, an expert witness who has a background in science and who \u201cclaims that her knowledge is based on studies, research, and the literature in the field, announces to the factfinder that the basis of her testimony is \u2018scientific,\u2019 <em>i.e., </em>is grounded on conclusions that have been reached through application of a scientific method to collected data.\u201d <em>Marrington, </em>335 Or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>at 563-64. Additionally, when an expert witness \u201ccouches her testimony in the vocabulary of scientific research,\u201d we have concluded that the expert \u201ceffectively announces to the jury that the basis of her testimony is \u2018scientific.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Lusareta, </em>270 Or App 102, 108, 346 P3d 514 (2015) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\">However, where an expert\u2019s testimony \u201cdid not involve the vocabulary of scientific research,\u201d was based on personal experience, and did not suggest to the court that the expert\u2019s opinions \u201cwere grounded on conclusions that have been reached through application of a scientific method to collected data,\u201d that testimony was not scientific evidence. <em>State v. Clemens, </em>208 Or App 632, 639, 145 P3d 294 (2006), <em>rev den, </em>342 Or 299 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Cuevas, </em>263 Or App at 110 (expert witness\u2019s testimony not scientific where it was \u201cexplicitly framed in terms of [the expert\u2019s] own career, training, and experience,\u201d and \u201cdid not refer to studies, research, scholarly literature, or anything else that would cause a jury to infer that her testimony was based on more than her personal experience\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Turning to the evidence challenged in the present case, we conclude that the parts of Julien\u2019s and Cantrell\u2019s testimony challenged by the state\u2014principally, the testimony of each regarding brain chemistry and its impact on petitioner\u2019s mental state\u2014drew their persuasive force \u201cfrom the mantle of science,\u201d <em>Cuevas, </em>263 Or App at 109, and held \u201can unusually high degree of persuasive power\u201d because a factfinder would have perceived them to be \u201cbased on scientific assertions,\u201d <em>Dulfu, </em>282 Or App at 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">We analyze Cantrell\u2019s and Julien\u2019s testimony separately, starting with Julien\u2019s testimony. His testimony to the post-conviction court largely breaks down into three components. First, Julien testified about the effect of alcohol on the brain and the role of memory\u2014or, specifically, the lack of memory\u2014as an indicator of an advanced state of intoxication that he termed \u201cdrug-induced reversible dementia,\u201d or \u201corganic dementia.\u201d Second, Julien estimated petitioner\u2019s blood-alcohol content (BAC) at the time of the incident with E was at least 0.4 percent. And third, Julien testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>it was his opinion to a degree of \u201cmedical certainty\u201d that petitioner was in a state of \u201corganic dementia\u201d at the time he touched E and would have been \u201cincapable of forming intent.\u201d On appeal, the state does not challenge the admissibility of Julien\u2019s estimate of petitioner\u2019s BAC; the state challenges only the first and third component described above\u2014 Julien\u2019s testimony related to brain chemistry, memory, and alcohol, and Julien\u2019s opinion as to petitioner\u2019s mental state at the time of the incident. Accordingly, the following analysis is confined to those aspects of Julien\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">As noted, Julien testified at petitioner\u2019s post-conviction trial. Additionally, the post-conviction court admitted into evidence a separate declaration by Julien in which he stated that, having reviewed the files in petitioner\u2019s case, it was his opinion that, at the time of the incident, petitioner \u201ccould not meet the Oregon definition of intent or intentional behavior.\u201d Julien explained that petitioner \u201chad no memory of the incident, demonstrating a state of alcohol-induced dementia. In this state, he lacked the ability to form intent as required to meet the Oregon definition of intent.\u201d Julien elaborated that, \u201c[i]n other words, alcohol intoxication will prevent the formation of memories and the blood alcohol content can enable an individual to lack the ability to form memories or intentional behavior required to meet the Oregon definition of intent.\u201d Julien asserted that the opinions expressed in the declaration \u201cconstitute my conclusions to a degree of medical certainty based on information commonly relied upon by experts in my field.\u201d Julien added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b906-5\">\u201cAccording to the standards of my profession, I have applied appropriate scientific principles as reliable [to] the facts of this case. The principles relied upon by me are supported by testing, common peer-reviewed articles, appropriate error rates, and their acceptability in the relevant scientific community.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">In his testimony to the post-conviction court, Julien expanded on his opinion that, as a result of petitioner\u2019s intoxication and as evidenced by his lack of memory, petitioner was incapable of forming a culpable mental state at the time he touched E. In doing so, Julien first grounded his testimony in his scientific background and scholarship. Julien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>described his educational and professional background, which included a series of undergraduate and advanced degrees in medicine and science, more than two decades practicing anesthesiology at a Portland-area hospital, and extensive teaching and scholarship in the areas of pharmacology and anesthesiology. He stated that he had written \u201cthe very first textbook on psychopharmacology\u201d which was in its thirteenth edition. Julien explained that his textbook \u201chad a chapter on alcohol, devoted to alcohol,\u201d and that he had \u201ctaught the pharmacology of alcohol for many, many years as part of my psychopharmacology teaching.\u201d Julien then explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-4\">\u201c[Alcohol] basically affects most of the brain, primarily acting at GABA and glutamate cells. In the hippocampus of the brain, the drug affects the formation of memory proteins by blocking the formation of these proteins off of your DNA. This is what is responsible for what is termed a \u2018blackout.\u2019 It\u2019s actually a state of drug-induced reversible dementia, just like the organic dementias that we see in society. My textbook has always called it \u2018drug-induced reversible dementia.\u2019 As part of that, and even before that, the drug depresses our frontal cortex, which makes up a large percentage of the human cortex, basically depressing those neurons and inducing a demented state by reducing neuronal activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">Julien went on to explain that alcohol intoxication impairs the frontal cortex of the brain, which is responsible for \u201cexecutive functioning,\u201d and that \u201cthe best index we have of executive functioning, the state of the frontal cortex, is by using the ability to form memory as a marker of impairment.\u201d Therefore, he asserted, the lack of memory from intoxication \u201cis associated with major impairment of our executive functioning.\u201d Julien testified that, based on the amount of alcohol that petitioner reported drinking, he would have had a blood-alcohol content \u201cto a degree of medical certainty in excess, at about or in excess of about .4 grams percent.\u201d Julien then testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-6\">\u201cQ. When [petitioner] is in the blackout period that he doesn\u2019t remember, would you, from your knowledge of how much alcohol he drank, believe that he had diminished capacity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>\u201cA. Yes, ma\u2019am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-4\">\u201cQ. Would he have been able to form any type of criminal state of mind at that point?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-5\">\u201cA. He certainly would be incapable of forming intent. And I have authored a paper on that topic. He would have been\u2014in my opinion, he would have been in a severely demented state, similar to somebody with an organic dementia like Alzheimer\u2019s dementia. And in that state, it is my opinion, one should be held to the same culpability as someone with organic dementia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-6\">\u201cQ. So could you say to a reasonable medical certainty that he was, in fact, in that state of dementia on this day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-7\">\u201cA. The estimated BAC, which is self-report, certainly would put one in a state of blackout or drug-induced dementia. And of course, that is self-report also, that someone says they cannot remember, but it\u2019s corroborated by an estimated BAC in which virtually everyone would be in that state.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-8\">\u201cActions in that state are often referred to as an autonomous state or somnambulism sleep activities. Others have referred to it as being mentally unconscious, although I don\u2019t believe there\u2019s a legal definition of conscious. But this would be someone that I could consider to be, you know, to be anesthetized.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the challenged aspects of Julien\u2019s testimony\u2014his testimony related to brain chemistry, memory, and alcohol, and his opinion as to petitioner\u2019s mental state at the time of the incident\u2014 are scientific evidence. Julien presented himself as a scientific researcher and asserted that his knowledge was \u201cbased on studies, research, and the literature in the field,\u201d and \u201cgrounded on conclusions that have been reached through application of a scientific method to collected data.\u201d <em>Marrington, </em>335 Or at 563-64. Further, Julien\u2019s trial testimony was couched \u201cin the vocabulary of scientific research,\u201d <em>Lusareta, </em>270 Or at 108, and fundamentally drew its persuasive force not from Julien\u2019s personal experience, but \u201cfrom the mantle of science,\u201d <em>Cuevas, </em>263 Or App at 109.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">The essence of Julien\u2019s testimony was not all that different from what petitioner\u2019s trial counsel asserted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>his arguments to the jury: Petitioner was too intoxicated to have \u201cknowingly\u201d touched E and that the jury could judge petitioner\u2019s intoxication by his lack of memory. Julien\u2019s testimony, however, is significantly more persuasive precisely because of Julien\u2019s scientific background and expertise, and his use of scientific research and principles to reinforce that assertion. In sum, Julien\u2019s testimony \u201cdraws its convincing force from some principle of science, mathematics and the like,\u201d and the trier of fact would have perceived the testimony as \u201cscientific\u201d evidence. <em>Brown, </em>297 Or at 407.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\">We turn now to consider Cantrell\u2019s proffered testimony. Cantrell\u2019s testimony can be summarized as follows: (1) she had diagnosed petitioner with PTSD, among other mental health disorders; (2) she believed that petitioner\u2019s PTSD had been triggered by various events the day of the party and that those events drove petitioner to drink heavily so as to \u201cself-medicate\u201d the anxiety he was feeling; (3) PTSD can cause a surge of adrenaline that can interfere with a person\u2019s mental functioning; and (4) it was her opinion, \u201cat the time of the incident, that [petitioner] was operating at a diminished capacity, due to the fact that his adrenaline interfered with his higher level cognitive functioning.\u201d The state challenges only the last two of those components of Cantrell\u2019s testimony, and we narrow our analysis accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">At the post-conviction trial, the post-conviction court admitted into evidence a report by Cantrell in which she concluded that petitioner \u201cmeets the clinical criteria for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Depression, Anxiety, Alcohol Abuse and Sleep Disorder.\u201d Cantrell stated in her report that, having interviewed petitioner, it was her opinion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>he was \u201ctriggered by multiple events\u201d prior to and during the party, particularly the violent movie, which \u201ctriggered flashbacks\u201d to traumatic events petitioner had experienced during his service in the Vietnam War. As a result of those events and petitioner\u2019s ingrained military training and experience, Cantrell explained, petitioner \u201cautomatically reverted to his intrinsic skills of survival. This is initiated and primed through the activation of neuro-chemicals and adrenaline with the objective only to survive.\u201d Cantrell ultimately concluded that, at the time petitioner touched E, he \u201cwas operating at a diminished capacity, due to the fact that his adrenaline interfered with his higher level cognitive functioning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">In her testimony at the post-conviction trial, Cantrell described herself as a mental health counselor and a \u201ccertified trauma specialist\u201d with expertise in PTSD. She noted that she had a doctorate in clinical psychology, that her research during graduate school focused on PTSD, and that she had written books on the subject as well. She testified that she had diagnosed petitioner with PTSD and that sufferers of PTSD frequently use alcohol to \u201cnumb out their feelings, their emotional pain. We call that \u2018self-medication.\u2019\u201d She stated that petitioner was \u201calready in a state of arousal\u201d when he arrived at the party, that \u201cthere were indicators\u201d during the evening that petitioner \u201cwas having some issues with some post-traumatic stress behaviors,\u201d and that the violent movie \u201cactivated\u201d him.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">On cross-examination, Cantrell was pressed to explain her conclusion that petitioner was operating at diminished capacity as a result of the adrenaline in his system. Cantrell stated, \u201cMy understanding, when I look at post-traumatic stress, when I look at how the effects of adrenaline on someone\u2019s cognitive ability, their executive functioning diminishes under the influence of a substance and under the influence of adrenaline.\u201d When pressed further, Cantrell explained that \u201cI would say that it affects judgment and it affects the higher functioning of executive functioning.\u201d Cantrell also explained that PTSD \u201cputs [veterans] back into their primal level function and it takes away their ability to make higher-level function capabilities. Their executive functioning is not intact and * * * they resort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>back to the primal level of function * * * we call it the 'reptilian brain\u2019 in my world.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\">As with Julien, we conclude that Cantrell\u2019s testimony related to brain chemistry and functioning, and its relationship to petitioner\u2019s mental state, would be perceived by a factfinder as scientific. In considering Cantrell\u2019s testimony, the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Marrington </em>is instructive. In <em>Marrington, </em>the court considered whether the testimony of a \u201cprogram manager and clinical supervisor\u201d at a private nonprofit organization that specialized in treatment of sexually abused children was \u201cscientific\u201d evidence. 335 Or at 558. At issue was the witness\u2019s assertion that \u201cdelayed reporting\u201d was \u201ca predominant feature of disclosure in otherwise verified cases of child sexual abuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560. The court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-5\">\u201cthis court has made it clear that expert testimony concerning matters within the sphere of the behavioral sciences possesses the increased potential to influence the trier of fact as scientific assertions, just as expert testimony dealing with the \u2018hard\u2019 sciences does.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b911-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 561; <em>see also Jennings v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., </em>331 Or 285, 304, 14 P3d 596 (2000) (scientific evidence subject to requirements of <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key </em>even though science involved is not \u201chard\u201d science). Turning to the witness\u2019s testimony, the court in <em>Marrington </em>emphasized that the expert witness had stated that she held \u201cundergraduate and postgraduate degrees in the field of psychology, a behavioral science\u201d and that she was \u201clicensed by the State of Oregon and is a nationally certified counselor.\u201d 335 Or at 562. Further, she had \u201cstated that she was familiar with the 'recent literature and research in the area of sexual abuse of children.\u2019 The reference to \u2018research\u2019 implies a scientific foundation, with the results published in the \u2018literature\u2019 of the area of study.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 563. The court noted that the witness\u2019s testimony involved \u201cthe vocabulary of scientific research\u201d and that she implied that her theories had been confirmed empirically. <em>Id. </em>The court then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b911-7\">\u201cAn expert like [this witness], who has a background in behavioral sciences and who claims that her knowledge is based on studies, research, and the literature in the field, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>announces to the factfinder that the basis of her testimony is \u2018scientific,\u2019 <em>i.e., </em>is grounded on conclusions that have been reached through application of a scientific method to collected data. Because that is how the factfinder would understand it, a court has a duty to ensure that such information possesses the necessary indices of scientific validity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 563-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">Similarly, Cantrell is an expert \u201cwho has a background in behavioral sciences and who claims that her knowledge is based on studies, research, and the literature in the field.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Her testimony describing how PTSD affects brain functioning involved the vocabulary of scientific research and scientific jargon. Of particular significance, Cantrell, at various points in her testimony, implied that her opinions or assertions came not from her personal experience, but could be attributed generally to her field\u2014for example, stating that <em>\u201cwe </em>call [PTSD sufferers\u2019 use of alcohol] \u2018self-medication\u2019\u201d or, in describing changes to the brain when PTSD is triggered, stating that <em>\u201cwe </em>call it the \u2018reptilian brain\u2019 in my world.\u201d (Emphases added.) A jury would have perceived her testimony related to PTSD\u2019s effect on brain chemistry, and its relationship to petitioner\u2019s mental state, as scientific and, accordingly, we conclude it is scientific evidence subject to the requirements of <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">As the proponent of scientific evidence, petitioner had the burden of showing at the post-conviction trial that such evidence would have been admissible at the criminal trial. <em>Tracy, </em>252 Or App at 170. In assessing whether scientific evidence is admissible, a reviewing court considers the various factors outlined in <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key. </em>As noted, the factors listed in <em>Brown </em>include \u201cgeneral acceptance in the field,\u201d \u201cpotential rate of error,\u201d the existence of \u201cspecialized literature,\u201d and the \u201cnovelty\u201d of the scientific assertions at issue. <em>Brown, </em>297 Or at 417; <em>see </em>283 Or App at 877-78. In <em>O\u2019Key, </em>the Oregon Supreme Court incorporated additional, largely overlapping, factors articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, </em>509 US 579, 113 S Ct 2786, 125 L Ed 2d 469 (1993). 321 Or at 306. Those four factors are (1) \u201cwhether the theory or technique in question can be (and has been) tested\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>(2) \u201cwhether the theory or technique has been subject to peer review and publication\u201d; (3) \u201cthe known or potential rate of error and the existence of operational standards controlling the technique\u2019s operation\u201d; and (4) \u201cthe degree of acceptance in the relevant scientific community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303-05 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Oregon Supreme Court has emphasized that the factors in <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key </em>\u201care not exclusive and are not to be used as a mechanical checklist requiring an affirmative finding with respect to each factor\u201d; rather, \u201c[w]hatever factors may be relevant in a particular case, the party offering the scientific evidence at issue * * * has the burden of establishing that it is scientifically valid.\u201d <em>Perry, </em>347 Or at 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">Despite the state\u2019s objection that the proposed testimony was scientific evidence, petitioner did not seriously undertake to demonstrate to the post-conviction court that the science underpinning the challenged assertions by Cantrell and Julien was valid under the factors outlined in <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>More importantly for this appeal, petitioner does not even argue before us that he met the requirements of <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key. </em>Rather, he contends that Julien and Cantrell did not present \u201cscientific\u201d evidence as contemplated by <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key </em>and that their testimony would have been admissible for other reasons.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">First, petitioner argues that Julien\u2019s and Cantrell\u2019s testimony would have been admissible under the Oregon evidence rule regulating the use of expert witnesses, OEC 702, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-6\">\u201cIf scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b914-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>Petitioner contends that both Julien\u2019s and Cantrell\u2019s testimony would have been admissible under OEC 702 solely as \u201ctechnical or other specialized knowledge\u201d and therefore was not \u201cscientific\u201d evidence. As such, petitioner argues, it was subject only to the general requirements of OEC 702: that the testimony \u201cassist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue,\u201d and that the witness be \u201cqualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education.\u201d The post-conviction court appeared to adopt this reasoning when it stated in its general judgment that \u201c[b]oth Julien and Cantrell <em>qualify as expert witnesses based on their training and experience. </em>They each have <em>specialized knowledge </em>and experience that <em>would assist the trier of fact\u201d See </em>283 Or App at 874 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">However, as we have just discussed, we conclude that the challenged evidence is scientific and, as scientific evidence, it is subject to the additional requirements of <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key. </em>As noted in <em>Brown, </em>the legislature, in adopting OEC 702, explicitly left it to the courts \u201cto adopt a new approach to the admissibility of scientific evidence.\u201d 297 Or at 408 (noting that the legislative commentary to OEC 702 states that the legislature \u201cleaves for judicial decision the standard to be used in determining the admissibility of novel scientific evidence\u201d). The Supreme Court did that in <em>Brown, </em>and again in <em>O\u2019Key, </em>and the criteria of those cases apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Second, petitioner argues that, because the legislature has enacted a statute authorizing a voluntary intoxication defense to rebut the mental state element of a crime, the scientific validity of Julien\u2019s testimony has already been accepted by the legislature and his testimony is therefore admissible. Petitioner cites ORS 161.125(1), which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b914-6\">\u201cThe use of drugs or controlled substances, dependence on drugs or controlled substances or voluntary intoxication shall not, as such, constitute a defense to a criminal charge, but in any prosecution for an offense, evidence that the defendant used drugs or controlled substances, or was dependent on drugs or controlled substances, or was intoxicated may be offered by the defendant whenever it is relevant to negative an element of the crime charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>Accordingly, petitioner argues, any concerns about the validity of Julien\u2019s theory went to the weight afforded that evidence by the factfinder, not its admissibility. However, petitioner is mistaken that ORS 161.125(1) creates blanket admissibility for any and all evidence related to a criminal defendant\u2019s intoxication. Rather, that statute speaks to the <em>relevance </em>of such evidence; evidence offered for that purpose still must meet any applicable requirements for admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-3\">In sum, petitioner offered testimony by Julien and Cantrell in support of his claim for post-conviction relief. Parts of the testimony of each expert witness would have been perceived by a factfinder as scientific, and therefore constitute \u201cscientific\u201d evidence subject to the requirements of <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key. </em>As explained, petitioner had the burden of proving before the post-conviction court that such testimony would have been admissible at trial. Petitioner did not meet that burden with regard to Julien\u2019s testimony that (1) a person\u2019s lack of memory is an indicator that the person is in a state of \u201corganic dementia\u201d and, therefore, is unable to possess a culpable mental state, and (2) in his opinion, petitioner was in such a state at the time he groped E and, therefore, was incapable of forming intent, or was in an \u201cautonomous state\u201d and \u201cmentally unconscious.\u201d Petitioner also did not meet that burden with regard to Cantrell\u2019s testimony that (1) PTSD can cause a surge of adrenaline that affects brain functioning, and (2) it was her opinion that petitioner was operating at diminished capacity at the time he touched E as a result of PTSD-triggered adrenaline interfering with his cognitive functioning. Because petitioner failed to establish that those parts of Julien\u2019s and Cantrell\u2019s testimony were admissible, the post-conviction court erred in concluding that the testimony would have been admissible at petitioner\u2019s criminal trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\">We pause to note that, in this opinion, we do not rule on the actual validity of the science underlying each expert\u2019s testimony. The issue in this case is whether petitioner proved at his post-conviction proceeding that his trial counsel\u2019s allegedly deficient representation prejudiced petitioner. As we have noted, prejudice in this case required a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>showing that the relevant evidence would have been admissible at his trial which, in turn, required petitioner to prove that the proffered testimony of Cantrell and Julien, as scientific evidence, met the requirements of <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key. </em>We conclude only that petitioner did not meet that burden and, as a result, that the post-conviction court erred in determining that Julien\u2019s and Cantrell\u2019s testimony would have been admissible at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Because our ruling pertains only to the challenged parts of that testimony, other parts of Julien\u2019s and Cantrell\u2019s testimony\u2014such as Julien\u2019s estimate of petitioner\u2019s BAC and Cantrell\u2019s diagnosis of petitioner\u2019s military service-related PTSD\u2014are untouched by this opinion. We turn now to consider whether, in the absence of the challenged testimony, the record before us nevertheless supports the post-conviction court\u2019s finding of prejudice on petitioner\u2019s second claim. Whether petitioner has demonstrated prejudice is a question of law. <em>Ashley v. Hoyt, </em>139 Or App 385, 399 n 8, 912 P2d 393 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">Petitioner\u2019s claim of inadequate assistance of counsel to the post-conviction court was that his attorney was constitutionally deficient for failing to develop a defense theory based on petitioner\u2019s military history, his PTSD, and his intoxication. Although petitioner\u2019s counsel did, in fact, touch on each of those themes in arguing to the jury for an acquittal, petitioner asserted in his claim that his attorney was nevertheless ineffectual because he failed to procure expert witness testimony. Specifically, petitioner argued that such expert witness testimony could have affected the outcome of the trial by negating either the <em>mens rea </em>requirements of petitioner\u2019s charges or the volitional act requirement of the <em>actus reus. </em>The post-conviction court appeared to adopt that reasoning, concluding in its judgment that \u201c[t]he best defense in this case is alcohol and PTSD,\u201d and that petitioner\u2019s trial counsel was deficient by failing to call on veteran-specific resources in preparing the case. In finding that petitioner suffered prejudice, the post-conviction court highlighted the testimony of the expert witnesses, but stated only that \u201c[t]he experts would have testified to enough that there is a reasonable likelihood it would have affected the outcome.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b917-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>However, as explained in this opinion, the same evidence petitioner advanced to undercut the <em>mens rea </em>or <em>actus reus </em>elements of petitioner\u2019s offense is the same evidence we conclude should have been excluded by the post-conviction court because petitioner failed to establish a scientific foundation for its admissibility. So, although the state does not challenge Cantrell\u2019s testimony regarding petitioner\u2019s military history, her diagnosis of PTSD, and her opinion that petitioner\u2019s PTSD was triggered the night of the party, without some evidence explaining how those issues could have affected petitioner\u2019s mental state, there is little likelihood that her unchallenged testimony could have affected the outcome of the case. <em>See Green, </em>357 Or at 322-23 (explaining that \u201cthe tendency to affect the outcome standard\u201d for showing prejudice \u201cdemands more than a mere possibility, but less than probability\u201d). The necessary link between Cantrell\u2019s unchallenged testimony and the elements of petitioner\u2019s criminal charge was Cantrell\u2019s <em>challenged </em>testimony that petitioner\u2019s PTSD-related adrenaline rush \u201cinterfered with his higher level cognitive functioning\u201d and resulted in petitioner operating at a \u201cdiminished capacity.\u201d But, as we have explained, petitioner failed to lay the necessary foundation for that testimony and the post-conviction court erred in concluding that it would have been admissible. Without that linking testimony, we cannot say that Cantrell\u2019s unchallenged testimony had a tendency to affect the outcome. Nor can we say that, but for counsel\u2019s error, there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of petitioner\u2019s trial would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-3\">As to Julien\u2019s testimony, although the state does not challenge the pharmacologist\u2019s estimate of petitioner\u2019s BAC, that evidence is not so different from the various eyewitness accounts of petitioner\u2019s heavy intoxication that were admitted at petitioner\u2019s criminal trial such that we could conclude that the inclusion of Julien\u2019s BAC analysis would have had a tendency to affect the outcome. Rather, the parts of Julien\u2019s testimony that could have affected the outcome of petitioner\u2019s criminal trial are those parts that cast doubt on whether petitioner could have acted consciously, \u201cknowingly,\u201d or with the required <em>intent\u2014viz., </em>Julien\u2019s testimony discussing the link between alcohol, memory, and intentional behavior, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>Julien\u2019s assertion that petitioner\u2019s lack of memory indicated that he was in a state of dementia in which he \u201ccould not meet the Oregon definition of intent or intentional behavior.\u201d As with Cantrell, those parts of Julien\u2019s testimony required a scientific foundation and, without such a foundation, cannot prove prejudice in his case. Accordingly, we conclude that, for the reasons above, petitioner failed to show that he was prejudiced by his trial counsel\u2019s failure to procure expert testimony related to his military history, PTSD, and alcohol issues. The post-conviction court erred in so concluding.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">That would ordinarily conclude our review\u2014that is, having concluded that the post-conviction court erred in granting petitioner post-conviction relief as to his second claim, we would simply reverse that part of the judgment but otherwise affirm. However, the circumstances here are not ordinary.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">As previously noted, 283 Or App at 870 n 1, petitioner raised four claims to the post-conviction court. In his fourth claim for relief, petitioner argued to the post-conviction court that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to move to merge his two \u201cconvictions.\u201d In its judgment, the post-conviction court stated that, as to the fourth claim, \u201c[t]he two convictions should have merged.\u201d Ultimately, the court entered a judgment providing, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-6\">\u201cPetitioner\u2019s petition for [post-conviction relief] is granted. Judgment from trial court vacated and the matter returned for new trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-7\">Having now concluded that the post-conviction court erred in granting petitioner post-conviction relief as to his second claim, the post-conviction court must reassess the relief, if any, to which petitioner is entitled. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and remand for the post-conviction court to enter a judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-8\">On appeal, reversed as to petitioner\u2019s second claim for post-conviction relief and remanded for entry of judgment consistent with this opinion. On cross-appeal, affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b896-6\"> Petitioner raised four claims for relief to the post-conviction court. This opinion primarily addresses the state\u2019s appeal of the grant of relief based on petitioner\u2019s second claim for relief. Petitioner cross-appeals the post-conviction court\u2019s denial of his first claim for relief, which we affirm without written discussion. He also raises additional cross-assignments of error. We also reject those arguments without written discussion. Petitioner\u2019s third and fourth claims for relief were not the subject of any assignment of error on appeal or cross-appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b898-8\"> The indictment in petitioner\u2019s case charged him with \u201cunlawfully and knowingly\u201d subjecting E to sexual contact.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b899-5\"> As noted previously, see 283 Or App at 872 n 2, defendant was charged with \u201cknowingly\u201d committing sexual abuse. Additionally, a conviction for first-degree sexual abuse requires proof that a defendant \u201csubjectfed] another person to sexual contact.\u201d ORS 163.427. \u201cSexual contact\u201d is defined, in part, as \u201cany touching of the sexual or other intimate parts of a person <em>*** for the purpose of arousing or gratifying the sexual desire of either party\u201d </em>ORS 163.305(6) (emphasis added). Petitioner argues that his trial counsel could have used evidence of his PTSD and intoxication to negate either the \u201cknowingly\u201d mental state requirement or the specific intent requirement inherent in the \u201csexual contact\u201d element of sexual abuse in the first degree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b899-6\"> ORS 161.095(1) states that \u201c[t]he minimal requirement for criminal liability is the performance by a person of conduct which includes a voluntary act or the omission to perform an act which the person is capable of performing.\u201d ORS 161.085(2) defines a \u201cvoluntary act,\u201d in relevant part, as \u201ca bodily movement performed consciously.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b909-6\"> We note that we have previously considered the exclusion of similar testimony by this same expert, Julien, albeit in a different context. In <em>State v. Hazlett, </em>269 Or App 483, 495, 345 P3d 482 (2015), we concluded that a trial court erred in excluding testimony by Julien that was similar to the testimony at issue in this case\u2014in short, that intoxication could result in a state of dementia that effects a person\u2019s ability to form intent. In <em>Hazlett, </em>however, the issue was whether the trial court had erred in concluding that Julien was not \u201cqualified\u201d to render that testimony, as required by OEC 702, because he was a pharmacologist and not a psychologist. <em>Id. </em>at 494. We did not consider in <em>Hazlett </em>whether Julien\u2019s proposed testimony was scientific evidence and, if so, whether the science underlying that testimony comported with the requirements of <em>Brown </em>and <em>O\u2019Key.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b913-7\"> In opposing the state\u2019s motion to exclude Julien\u2019s testimony, petitioner, in a footnote, cited to three articles apparently dealing with scientific studies relating to alcohol and the brain. However, those articles were not admitted into evidence at the post-conviction trial and do not otherwise appear in the record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b913-8\"> In addition to the arguments summarized above, petitioner made other, less-developed arguments throughout the post-conviction proceedings, as well as on appeal before us, as to why the testimony of Julien and Cantrell is admissible. We reject those arguments without discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
