He argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal and entering the judgment because the record was insufficient to establish that he was in violation of the restraining order by being at the protected person\u2019s \u201ccurrent or future residence.\u201d The state concedes the error. We agree, accept the state\u2019s concession, and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">The restraining order at issue prohibited defendant from \u201centering or attempting to enter, or remaining in, the area within 150 feet * * * [of the protected person\u2019s] current or future residence.\u201d Next to that prohibition on the line provided for an address, the order states \u201c[w]ithheld for safety reasons.\u201d In a separate section of the restraining order that ordered defendant to pay emergency monetary assistance to the protected person, defendant was directed to mail the payment to a listed \u201csafe contact address.\u201d That same address was also listed as the protected person\u2019s \u201ccontact address\u201d in the \u201crelevant data\u201d sheet attached to the restraining order. That data sheet advised the protected person to use a \u201csafe address\u201d for the contact-address field. The same address was also listed as the \u201cfiler\u2019s address\u201d in an attachment to the restraining order. Defendant was charged with punitive contempt based on his presence at the safe-contact address specified in the restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">\u201cWhen the state seeks to impose a punitive sanction for contempt, it must prove beyond a reasonable doubt \u2018that a valid court order exists, that the defendant knew of the order, and that the defendant voluntarily failed to comply with it.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Langford, </em>260 Or App 61, 68, 317 P3d 905 (2013) (quoting <em>Frady v. Frady, </em>185 Or App 245, 248, 58 P3d 849 (2002)). Here, the trial court concluded that defendant had voluntarily failed to comply with the restraining order when he \u201centered, attempted, or came within 150 feet of [the safe-contact address]\u2014address of victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>On appeal, defendant argues that, because the state failed to present evidence that the safe-contact address was the protected person\u2019s current or future residence, and because the order did not prohibit defendant from entering or remaining at the safe-contact address, the court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal and entering a judgment of punitive contempt. The state concedes the error, and we accept the state\u2019s concession. The order did not prohibit defendant\u2019s presence at the safe-contact address and the state presented no evidence that that address was the protected person\u2019s \u201ccurrent or future residence.\u201d Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of punitive contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b639-7\"> The state elected to dismiss two other counts of punitive contempt brought against defendant based on the same incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
