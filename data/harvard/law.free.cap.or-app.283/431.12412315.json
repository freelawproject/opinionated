J.</author>\n<p id=\"b458-3\">Defendant appeals a judgment of conviction for third-degree assault, challenging the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress the victim\u2019s out-of-court eyewitness identification of defendant. He argues that, under the framework for determining the admissibility of eyewitness identifications established in <em>State v. Lawson/James, </em>352 Or 724, 291 P3d 673 (2012), the trial court should have excluded the victim\u2019s identification because it was unreliable and the photo lineup administered by the police was suggestive. He also asserts that, even if the identification met the foundational threshold for admissibility, it should have been excluded under OEC 403 as unduly prejudicial. In <em>State v. Haugen, </em>274 Or App 127, 360 P3d 560 (2015), <em>rev allowed, </em>359 Or 527 (2016), we upheld the admission of the victim\u2019s identification of defendant\u2019s codefendant. Here, we conclude that the trial court likewise did not err by admitting the victim\u2019s eyewitness identification of defendant, which occurred after the same incident and during the same photo lineup that we evaluated in <em>Haugen.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">We begin with the relevant background facts. Two men assaulted the victim late one night in the parking lot of a bar in Grants Pass. After the victim contacted the police later that night, he told the responding officer that he was unable to provide any information about his assailants other than that they were members of the Vagos Motorcycle Club. Five days later, Detective Brown interviewed the victim. During that interview, the victim explained to Brown what happened that night, including a description of his attackers and, during a sequential photo lineup of known Vagos members, identified defendant as one of his assailants. That interview was recorded and introduced as evidence at a preliminary hearing to determine the admissibility of that eyewitness identification. From that interview, we recount the victim\u2019s description of the events leading up to and including the assault, and we recount the details of the photo lineup administered by Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">On the night in question, the victim went to a bar in Grants Pass to sing karaoke with two friends. Upon entering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>the bar, the victim noticed eight to 10 men (including defendant) in the back of the bar in Vagos Motorcycle Club jackets who were \u201cflying their colors.\u201d At some point, a \u201clittle fat guy\u201d who was \u201cprobably in his 40s\u201d with a \u201clong ponytail\u201d approached the victim and asked him \u201cout of a clear blue sky\u201d if he knew Moore, a former Vagos member. When the victim answered that he did, the \u201clittle fat guy\u201d began ranting about Moore, calling him a \u201cscumbag,\u201d \u201crat,\u201d and \u201cthe lowest form of life on earth.\u201d The interaction ended, and the victim continued to sing karaoke with his friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Shortly after midnight, as the victim left the bar, \u201cthe little fat guy\u201d stood in front of him and asked, \u201cWell, are you here to kick us out?\u201d The victim replied, \u201cNo,\u201d and noticed Haugen\u2014a \u201cgreat big stout guy\u201d\u2014standing on the victim\u2019s right side. Haugen said to the victim, \u201cHave a good fucking night,\u201d then tapped the victim on the shoulder and said, \u201cWalk to your car.\u201d Haugen then punched the victim in the side of the head. After the victim fell to the ground, somebody kicked him in the side. The victim explained that \u201cone of the last things\u201d he saw was \u201cthe little fat guy\u201d hitting him with a hammer. After the assault, it \u201c[t]ook everything [the victim] had to stand up just to get out of there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">After the victim recounted the details of the assault to Brown, the detective explained that he would show the victim some photographs, which might help identify the \u201clittle fat guy.\u201d The detective further explained that \u201cthis is not necessarily typically the way we do it, but we\u2019re going to do it this way this time because of the situation that we\u2019re in.\u201d He then gave the victim the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">\u201cYou\u2019re about to be shown some photographs. Just because the police officer is showing you these photos, you are in no way obligated to identify anybody, okay? The person who committed the crime may or may not be in this group of photographs. Study the photos carefully before you make any comments or make any decisions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">\u00ab\u215c\u2021\u215c\u215c\u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">\u201cTypically, we just have like six small photographs, but because there\u2019s so many people involved in this I\u2019m just going to show you a group of photographs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>Brown began showing the victim a series of 23 photos that were taken from a binder containing Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) photos of known Vagos members. The photos did not include any notes or names. When Brown showed Haugen\u2019s picture to the victim, the victim commented, \u201cThis sure looks like the guy that hit me.\u201d In response to a question by Brown, the victim clarified that Haugen looked like the assailant who had punched him from the side. The victim indicated that a few more of the pictures showed people who were present at the bar that night, and Brown responded by telling the victim their names or nicknames. Brown pulled out of the notebook the photo of Haugen and the people whom the victim identified as being at the bar. The victim asked how old the photos were, and Brown responded \u201ca couple of years.\u201d Brown told the victim he could give the victim \u201csome better descriptors\u201d and provided \u201ccurrent\u201d descriptions of the people in the photos.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">When they came to defendant\u2019s photo, Brown explained that \u201c[t]his gentleman now has a little bit more gray. I\u2019m talking about \u2018Six Ball,\u2019 or Steve Rives. He\u2019s got more gray, but he\u2019s got a ponytail that long on his back.\u201d The victim responded, \u201cThat sure looks like the little fat man right there. He looks different in this. His hair appears darker. But that sure looks like him because he did\u2014his hair was lighter and the ponytail was probably about that long.\u201d Brown pulled the photo out and the victim told him, \u201cYeah, I believe he\u2019s one of the ones involved. I wanted to come back to him, but\u2014that\u2019s why I asked you when I looked at his picture how old these pictures are.\u201d Brown asked, \u201cSo you think\u2014and I\u2019m pointing to \u2018Six Ball,\u2019just to use names, you think this is the short fat guy?\u201d The victim responded, \u201cYeah, I do.\u201d Brown clarified, \u201cAnd that would be the one that hit you with the ball-peen hammer?\u201d The victim confirmed, \u201cI believe so. Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">At that point, the victim indicated to Brown that he was about \u201c80 percent\u201d sure that Haugen and defendant were the ones who had assaulted him. When Brown asked the victim whether he saw defendant \u201chit [him] with the hammer,\u201d the victim stated, \u201cYeah, I saw it coming. And after that I\u2014it was\u2014I don\u2019t remember much after that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>except just trying to collect myself and get out of there.\u201d After a break in the interview, Brown showed the victim surveillance photos of Vagos members that had been taken a few days before the interview, and the victim immediately identified defendant as the person who hit him with a hammer with \u201c99.9 percent certainty,\u201d explaining that \u201cthis is definitely the chap here\u201d and \u201cthat\u2019s exactly how he looked the other night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Defendant was charged with third-degree assault. His first trial, held in December 2011, ended in a mistrial. In the time between defendant\u2019s first and second trials, the Supreme Court issued <em>Lawson I James, </em>which devised a framework for determining the admissibility of eyewitness identification evidence. Accordingly, before his second trial, defendant moved to suppress the victim\u2019s out-of-court identification of him under the <em>Lawson!James </em>framework. The trial court ultimately denied defendant\u2019s motion, and the case proceeded to a jury trial, which resulted in defendant\u2019s conviction for third-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\"><em>Lawson/James </em>established a two-step process. <em>State v. Hickman, </em>355 Or 715, 724, 330 P3d 551 (2014). First, \u201cwhen a criminal defendant files a pretrial motion to exclude eyewitness identification evidence, the state\u2014as the proponent of the eyewitness identification\u2014must establish all preliminary facts necessary to establish admissibility\u201d under generally applicable provisions of the Oregon Evidence Code. <em>Lawson/James, </em>352 Or at 761. That \u201cfoundational\u201d inquiry provides the \u201cminimum baseline of reliability\u201d for eyewitness identifications. <em>Hickman, </em>355 Or at 728. It implicates \u201cthree interrelated evidentiary concepts: relevance under OEC 401, personal knowledge under OEC 602, and lay opinion under OEC 701.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Second, if the state satisfies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>the first step, the burden shifts to the defendant to prove that, under OEC 403, the evidence should nonetheless be excluded. <em>Id. </em>at 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">In <em>Lawson I James, </em>the court also identified two categories of factors that have been found to affect the reliability of eyewitness identifications: \u201cso-called \u2018estimator variables\u2019 and \u2018system variables.\u2019\u201d <em>Hickman, </em>355 Or at 724. Estimator variables \u201cgenerally refer to characteristics of the witness, the alleged perpetrator, and the environmental conditions of the event that cannot be manipulated or adjusted by state actors.\u201d <em>Lawson/James, </em>352 Or at 740. Those variables include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">\u201c(1) the witness\u2019s level of stress; (2) the witness\u2019s focus and attention; (3) the duration of exposure to an alleged perpetrator; (4) environmental viewing conditions; (5) the witness\u2019s physical and mental characteristics and condition; (6) the witness\u2019s description of the perpetrator; (7) the perpetrator\u2019s characteristics; (8) the speed of the identification; (9) the witness\u2019s confidence or certainty (noted as not reliably indicative of accuracy); and (10) memory decay.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-7\"><em>Haugen, </em>274 Or App at 141 (citing <em>Lawson/James, </em>352 Or at 744-46).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">On the other hand, system variables relate to \u201ccircumstances surrounding the identification procedure itself that are generally within the control of those administering the procedure.\u201d <em>Lawson/James, </em>352 Or at 740. Those factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-9\">\u201c(1) whether the identification procedure was conducted by a person who was unaware of the suspect\u2019s identity; (2) whether preidentification instructions were given to reduce the likelihood of misidentification; (3) the manner in which the photographic lineup was constructed and presented to the witness; (4) whether multiple viewings of the suspect could have led to source confusion; (5) whether suggestive wording or leading questions by investigators could have contaminated the witness\u2019s memory; and (6) whether confirming feedback could have falsely inflated the witness\u2019s confidence in the accuracy of his or her identification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number><em>Haugen, 274 </em>Or App at 141 (citing <em>Lawson/James, </em>352 Or at 741-44). As noted later in this opinion, estimator and system variables can play a role in both steps of the <em>Lawson/James </em>framework. <em>Hickman, </em>355 Or at 730-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-3\">Before discussing the basis of defendant\u2019s challenge to the victim\u2019s identification, we briefly recap the evidentiary concepts involved in the first step of the <em>Lawson/James </em>framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Eyewitness identification evidence will almost always meet the basic standard for relevance. <em>Lawson/James, </em>352 Or at 752; <em>see </em>OEC 401 (evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of an action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">When a pretrial challenge to eyewitness identification evidence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">\u201cspecifically implicates OEC 602 or OEC 701, those preliminary facts must include, at minimum, proof under OEC 602 that the proffered eyewitness has-personal knowledge of the matters to which the witness will testify, and proof under OEC 701 that any identification is both rationally based on the witness\u2019s first-hand perceptions and helpful to the trier of fact.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-7\"><em>Lawson/James, </em>352 Or at 761-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">An eyewitness identification satisfies OEC 602 \u201cif the eyewitness testifies to facts that, if believed, would permit a reasonable juror to find that the eyewitness observed the facts necessary to make the identification. Whether the eyewitness actually did observe those facts is a credibility determination for the jury.\u201d <em>Hickman, </em>355 Or at 729-30. Estimator variables are relevant to that inquiry, <em>Haugen, </em>274 Or App at 143, but \u201c[s]o-called \u2018system variables\u2019 do not apply to the trial court\u2019s OEC 602 determination, because they affect the witness\u2019s recollection of her observations, not the observations themselves.\u201d <em>Hickman, </em>355 Or at 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">OEC 701 limits a witness\u2019s testimony regarding inferences and lay opinions to those that are \u201c[r]ationally based on the perception of the witness\u201d and \u201c[bjelpful to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>clear understanding of testimony of the witness or the determination of a fact in issue.\u201d In eyewitness identification cases, the OEC 701 inquiry requires</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-4\">\u201cthat the trial court initially consider what the witness actually perceived (essentially, the OEC 602 inquiry described above), and then determine whether the witness\u2019s identification of the defendant was \u2018rationally based\u2019 on those perceptions. To satisfy its burden, the proponent of the identification evidence (generally the state) must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the witness perceived sufficient facts to support an inference of identification and that the identification was, in fact, based on those perceptions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-5\"><em>Lawson/James, 352 </em>Or at 754-55. System variables come into play in the OEC 701 inquiry because \u201cwhen a witness\u2019s perceptions support an inference of identification, but are \u2018nevertheless met with competing evidence of an impermissible basis for that inference\u2019 (such as suggestive police procedures), \u2018an issue of fact arises as to whether the witness\u2019s subsequent identification was derived from a permissible or impermissible basis.\u2019\u201d <em>Haugen, </em>274 Or App at 143-44 (quoting La<em>wson/James, </em>352 Or at 755). In that case, the \u201ctrial court must ascertain whether it was more likely than not that the witness\u2019s identification was based on his own perceptions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 144. Finally, whether an identification is \u201chelpful\u201d merely requires that the identification \u201ccommunicates more to the jury than the sum of the witness\u2019s describable perceptions.\u201d <em>Lawson/James, </em>352 Or at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">As noted, once the state satisfies the first step, \u201cthe burden shifts to defendant to demonstrate that the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the identification\u2019s probative value\u201d under OEC 403. <em>Hickman, </em>355 Or at 733-34 (quotation marks omitted). System variables \u201care particularly important under OEC 403 when \u2018an eyewitness has been exposed to suggestive police procedures.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 734 (quoting <em>Lawson/James, </em>352 Or at 758). In that instance, the trial court \u201chas a heightened role as an evidentiary gatekeeper because the danger of unfair prejudice increases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, a trial court may exclude an identification under OEC 403 only if the police identification procedures \u201chave been suggestive in one or more ways.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>In this case, at the hearing to address defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the identification, defendant provided the testimony of an expert witness who discussed the variables and how they were put into play in this case. Based in part on that testimony, defendant argued to the trial court that both estimator and system variables supported excluding the victim\u2019s identification of defendant. As to the estimator variables, he claimed that the victim was scared, injured, and under a high level of stress during the assault, which came from the \u201cblindside\u201d in a dark parking lot. He pointed out that the victim\u2019s attention was likely focused on his first assailant, so any exposure to his second assailant was very brief. Defendant also maintained that the victim told a officer in the immediate aftermath of the assault that he could not identify his assailants because the incident was brief and it was dark out. Finally, defendant argued that he had no particular distinctive characteristics that would make the victim\u2019s identification more reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-3\">As to the system variables, defendant asserted that the victim\u2019s memory was contaminated by the photo lineup procedure used by the police. In particular, he took issue with use of a lineup consisting of only known Vagos members, with no \u201cknown innocents.\u201d Defendant also claimed that Brown supplied the victim with information during the lineup that may have contaminated the victim\u2019s memory and that Brown made suggestive comments during the lineup that may have added a false sense of certainty to the victim\u2019s identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-4\">The court denied defendant\u2019s motion, concluding that neither estimator nor system variables required exclusion of the identification evidence. As for estimator variables, the court found the victim to be a credible witness, and noted that, \u201cprior to the assault,\u201d the victim was in a well-lit room with \u201ca limited number of people\u201d who were easily identifiable by their Vagos apparel. The court pointed out that the victim had a \u201cface to face\u201d conversation with defendant in the bar, and that the victim had not been drinking alcohol on the night of the incident. The court noted that on the night of the assault, the victim\u2019s reluctance to talk to the police was due to being traumatized by the assault, and that \u201chis chance to accurately relate what he saw was much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>better five days after than when he talked to [an officer the night of the assault].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">As for system variables, the court determined that, although perhaps unusual, the photo lineup procedure used by the police was appropriate given the circumstances. The court noted that the victim \u201cdirected the officer to the Vagos, as opposed to vice versa.\u201d The officer gave a standardized instruction before a \u201cblind administration\u201d of the lineup and, given the victim\u2019s identification of his attackers as Vagos members, it made sense to \u201chave in the sequential throw downs * * * members of the Vagos, and they were all blue back DMV photographs, could not shed light on the height, really or the weight.\u201d The court noted that \u201cit would have been ideal\u201d if the officer \u201ccould have found some DMV pictures of the person that was not a Vagos * * * just to make sure that the identification was sound, * * * but it\u2019s adequate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Accordingly, the court concluded that the state proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the eyewitness identification was sufficiently reliable to allow it into evidence. The court noted that it was not unduly prejudicial, and that defendant could \u201cprobe the issues regarding estimator variables through cross-examination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">On appeal, defendant reprises his arguments from below, first focusing on \u201cestimator variables\u201d to argue that the victim\u2019s eyewitness identification failed to satisfy the personal knowledge requirement of OEC 602. He argues that the victim\u2019s observation of his assailants was quick, and occurred at a time when he was scared and tired. Defendant also points out that his observation occurred in a dark parking lot late at night, and the victim\u2019s observation of the person who hit him with a hammer occurred while he was lying on the ground <em>after </em>he had been \u201csucker punched.\u201d Accordingly, defendant asserts that the circumstances demonstrate that there was a \u201clack of witness attention\u201d and a \u201cshort exposure by the witness\u201d that are \u201cestimator variables\u201d recognized in <em>Lawson!James </em>that undermine the conclusion that the victim had sufficient personal knowledge to identify defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">We conclude that the state satisfied the personal knowledge requirement of OEC 602 because it adduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>evidence from which a rational juror could find that the victim was able to make observations necessary to make the identification. The victim spoke with defendant earlier in the night in a well-lit bar and, moments before the assault, defendant stood in front of the victim and asked whether the victim was there \u201cto kick us out.\u201d The victim also indicated that \u201cone of the last things he saw\u201d was defendant hitting him with a hammer. In addition, before seeing any photos, the victim described defendant\u2019s approximate age, physical stature and height, and at least one unique characteristic (\u201ca long ponytail\u201d). Further, the trial court specifically found that the victim had not been drinking alcohol that night, so his senses were not impaired. Based on that evidence, a rational juror could find that the victim had sufficient personal knowledge to identify defendant. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Hickman, </em>once the state adduced such evidence, whether the victim actually had sufficient personal knowledge was a credibility issue that ultimately was for the jury to resolve. 355 Or at 730.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">As for the OEC 701 inquiry, defendant asserts that the lineup was suggestive. He claims that the lineup was not blindly administered because Brown knew that the suspects were Vagos members and identified defendant by his given name and nickname to the victim. He also notes that the lineup did not include any \u201cknown innocents\u201d and that defendant was the only one pictured who resembled the victim\u2019s description of his second assailant. Finally, defendant takes issue with the surveillance photos that were shown to the victim and the \u201cfeedback\u201d provided by Brown during the lineup.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">We addressed many of the same complaints about the lineup procedure used by Brown in <em>Haugen. </em>As we did in that case, we conclude that the victim\u2019s identification of defendant satisfied the OEC 701 inquiry. As we noted in <em>Haugen, </em>\u201c[w]hen facts indicate that a witness \u2018could have relied on something other than his or her own perceptions,\u2019 the state must establish, by a preponderance of the evidence that the witness\u2019s identification was more likely than not the product of his own perceptions.\u201d 274 Or App at 147. That \u201cissue of fact\u201d arises only \u201cif there is some evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>witness <em>could </em>have based his identification on something other than his own perceptions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">In <em>Haugen, </em>we concluded that, even assuming for the sake of argument that Haugen had sufficiently raised an issue of fact on that issue, it \u201ccan reasonably be resolved only in the state\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We rejected Haugen\u2019s arguments that the lineup was not \u201cblindly administered,\u201d noting that Brown\u2019s objective was to identify suspects and witnesses by having the victim identify members of the Vagos who were present at the bar. <em>Id. </em>We also noted that Brown instructed the victim that his assailants might not be included in the group and that, although the lineup procedure differed from a \u201cstandard lineup,\u201d the procedure used by Brown was \u201clogical\u201d and there was no indication in the record that the lineup\u2019s administration steered the victim toward identifying a particular person as his assailant. <em>Id. </em>at 147-48. The record also indicated that the victim knew that the purpose of the lineup was to potentially identify his assailants and other possible witnesses, and \u201c[t]hat he was able to identify [Haugen, defendant,] and other individuals present\u2014and the fact that the victim\u2019s account was also corroborated by other witnesses\u2014strongly supports the conclusion that the victim\u2019s identification of [Haugen] was based on the victim\u2019s own perceptions rather than on any deficiency in the identification procedure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Moreover, in <em>Haugen, </em>we rejected the argument that, by showing the victim more recent photos of Haugen and defendant, Brown created a risk of \u201cmugshot exposure,\u201d noting that surveillance photos were shown in response to the victim\u2019s question about the age of the photos. <em>Id. </em>at 149. We observed that \u201c[t]he fact that the victim, without prompting, asked about the age of the photos themselves indicates that the victim recalled his contemporaneous observations with clarity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, we rejected the complaint about the \u201cfeedback\u201d provided by Brown to the victim during the procedure, concluding that \u201cwe do not believe that the record in this case permits a conclusion that Brown\u2019s limited \u2018feedback\u2019 unduly influenced the victim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 150. Accordingly, we determined that \u201cany reasonable factfinder would conclude that the victim\u2019s identifications of [Haugen] were \u2018more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>likely based\u2019 on his \u2018own perceptions\u2019 than on any other factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As for the final part of the OEC 701 inquiry, we \u201ceasily conclude [d] that evidence of the victim\u2019s identification of [Haugen] as one of his assailants would be helpful to a trier of fact in an assault case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Here, defendant is essentially making the same arguments about the same lineup procedure that we rejected in <em>Haugen. </em>And, to the extent there are differences between the arguments made by defendant and the arguments we addressed in <em>Haugen, </em>those differences are not significant enough to warrant a different conclusion. For the reasons stated in <em>Haugen, </em>we conclude that the victim\u2019s identification satisfied the OEC 701 inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Accordingly, the state presented an adequate foundation under OEC 401, OEC 602, and OEC 701 for admission of the victim\u2019s eyewitness identification, and, thus, satisfied the first step of the <em>Lawson! James </em>framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">As for the second step, we review the trial court\u2019s determination as to whether defendant demonstrated that the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs the identification\u2019s probative value for an abuse of discretion. <em>Lawson/James, </em>352 Or at 762. Here, defendant argues simply that the evidence is unduly prejudicial because \u201cpolice used an invalid lineup procedure to bolster an invalid identification.\u201d In <em>Hickman, </em>the court noted that, under OEC 403, \u201cexclusion requires that the state-administered identification procedures have been suggestive in one or more ways.\u201d 355 Or at 734. Here, even if we assume for the sake of argument that the lineup procedure used by Brown was suggestive in some way, the trial court was within its discretion to conclude that the danger of unfair prejudice does not substantially outweigh the identification\u2019s probative value. That is so because, given our conclusion that any reasonable factfinder would conclude that the victim\u2019s identification of defendant was more likely based on his own perceptions than on any suggestive police procedures, any prejudice to defendant was slight, and the probative value (that is, reli-abililty) of the victim\u2019s identification was high.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-6\"> OEC 602 provides that \u201ca witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter.
