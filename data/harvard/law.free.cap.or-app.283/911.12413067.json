M. L. B., </em>282 Or App 203, 384 P3d 175 (2016). For the reasons that follow, we allow reconsideration to correct a mistake, and adhere to our original disposition as corrected and clarified in light of that mistake.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">This appeal arises from a judgment terminating mother\u2019s parental rights to her daughter, K. Our original opinion, minus a single footnote stated, in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-6\">\u201cMother appeals from a judgment terminating her parental rights to her daughter K. Mother, who did not appear at the termination trial, argues that the judgment must be reversed because her attorney \u201cmounted no defense on her behalf, which rendered his assistance inadequate.\u201d However, as we recently have held, <em>because </em>Mother did not appear at the trial, ORS <em>419B.815(8) </em>prohibited her attorney from participating in the trial on her behalf. <em>Dept. of Human Services v. S. C. T., </em>281 Or App 246, 261, 380 P3d 1211 (2016) (\u201cPut another way, parents\u2019 attorneys cannot save parents from the legal effect of parents\u2019 absence by acting for parents to challenge the evidence presented.\u201d). Mother\u2019s claim of inadequate assistance necessarily fails for that reason. Because Mother\u2019s attorney was statutorily prohibited from presenting a defense at the trial, he was not inadequate for failing to do so. Accordingly, we must affirm. Our affirmance is without prejudice to Mother\u2019s ability to seek relief from judgment pursuant to ORS 419B.923 on other grounds, if such grounds exist.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 204 (First emphasis in original; second emphasis added.).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">In the petition for reconsideration, mother points out that the statute that we cited, ORS 419B.815(8), applies only to proceedings to establish dependency jurisdiction and does not apply in termination proceedings. Mother notes that ORS 419B.819(8), which is worded almost identically to ORS 419B.815(8), applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">Mother is correct that ORS 419B.819(8), rather that ORS 419B.815(8), applies to termination proceedings, and we erred in stating otherwise. We nonetheless adhere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>to our original disposition. As mother acknowledges, ORS 419B.819(8),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> like ORS 419B.815(8), by its terms prohibits an attorney from appearing on a parent\u2019s behalf where, as here, the parent has been summoned or ordered to appear personally. Thus, consistent with our decision in <em>S. C. T. </em>that the almost-identically worded ORS 419B.815(8) precluded an attorney from appearing on a parent\u2019s behalf when a parent fails to appear in proceedings to establish dependency jurisdiction, we conclude that ORS 419B.819(8) barred mother\u2019s attorney from taking action on her behalf at the termination trial when mother failed to appear at trial. Because that statute barred mother\u2019s attorney\u2019s participation in the trial, her claim of inadequate assistance necessarily fails. As we noted previously, mother does not contend that she had a reasonable excuse for failing to appear, and that her attorney was inadequate for failing to request a continuance, which would present a different question. Our disposition also remains without prejudice to mother\u2019s ability to seek relief pursuant to ORS 419B.923 on other grounds, if such grounds exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-4\">Reconsideration allowed; former opinion adhered to as corrected and clarified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b939-5\"> ORS 419B.819(8) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-6\">\u201cIf the summons requires the parent to appear personally before the court, or if the court orders the parent to appear personally at a hearing * * * the parent may not appear through the parent\u2019s attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
