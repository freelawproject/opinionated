Those counts included a felony count (Count 1) and a misdemeanor count (Count 6) of first-degree animal abuse, both of which involved the failure to provide care for the same animal. On appeal, defendant argues, among other contentions, that the trial court erred by entering separate convictions on Counts 1 and 6 rather than merging the guilty verdicts for those counts into a single conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">The state concedes that the trial court erred in failing to merge the guilty verdicts on Counts 1 and 6, and it further concedes that, under our existing case law\u2014specifically, <em>State v. Skaggs, </em>275 Or App 557, 560-61, 364 P3d 355 (2015), <em>rev den, </em>359 Or 667 (2016)\u2014the error is one that involves the reversal of a judgment of conviction under ORS 138.222 (5)(b), which triggers an automatic remand for resentencing on all affirmed counts. However, the state argues that <em>Skaggs </em>was wrongly decided and urges us to overrule it. According to the state, merger errors like the one committed in this case should instead be governed by paragraph (a) of ORS 138.222(5), which allows this court to determine whether or not an error is one that actually \u201crequires resentencing.\u201d In the state\u2019s view, because the sentence on Count 6 runs concurrently with a longer sentence on Count 1, the merger error in this case does not \u201crequire resentencing\u201d and can be remedied simply by a remand for entry of a \u201ccorrected judgment\u201d that reflects a single conviction for Counts 1 and 6. Thus, the state asks that we remand with that more limited disposition and otherwise affirm with regard to defendant\u2019s sentences. For the reasons that follow, the state has not persuaded us to overrule our decision in <em>Skaggs. </em>Accordingly, we reverse and remand for resentencing based on the trial court\u2019s failure to merge the guilty verdicts on Counts 1 and 6, which obviates the need to address defendant\u2019s remaining assignments of error concerning sentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>As described above, defendant\u2019s merger argument concerns two counts of first-degree animal abuse under ORS 167.330. Under that statute, first-degree animal abuse is a misdemeanor, unless certain aggravating factors are present, in which case it becomes a Class C felony. ORS 167.330(2), (3). One of those aggravating factors is that the offense was part of an episode involving 10 or more animals. ORS 167.330(3). In addition, if more than 40 animals were neglected, the crime category classification for the offense is increased for sentencing purposes. ORS 167.330(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">In this case, the state separately alleged a felony (Count 1) and a misdemeanor (Count 6) under ORS 167.330 based on defendant\u2019s conduct toward one of his alpacas, an animal identified as number \u201c5.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After defendant was found guilty on those counts, the prosecutor acknowledged that the two guilty verdicts should merge into a single conviction for first-degree animal abuse. Nonetheless, the trial court\u2019s judgment reflects two separate convictions for first-degree animal abuse on Counts 1 and 6. That was error, as the state correctly concedes, because both counts involved the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>same statutory provision, the same criminal episode, and the same victim. <em>See </em>ORS 161.067 (a defendant has committed \u201cseparately punishable offenses\u201d when the \u201csame conduct or criminal episode\u201d violates two or more statutory provisions, each requiring proof of an element the others do not; involves two or more victims; or involves repeated violations of the same statutory provision against the same victim if separated by \u201csufficient pause\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\">The disputed issue on appeal is the consequence of that merger error. Just over a year ago, in <em>Skaggs, </em>we held that an error in failing to merge guilty verdicts is one that requires resentencing under ORS 138.222(5)(b). In <em>Skaggs, </em>as in this case, the state conceded that the trial court erred by failing to merge two guilty verdicts, but it argued that a remand for resentencing was unnecessary, relying on ORS 138.222(5)(a). We described that argument as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b877-5\">\u201c[T]he state urges us to reverse and remand for entry of a corrected judgment that merges defendant\u2019s convictions rather than to remand for resentencing. We should do so, the state asserts, because defendant received concurrent sentences on the two convictions and nothing in the judgment or record \u2018suggests that merger of the two convictions would have any effect at all on the overall disposition\u2019 of the case. The state further argues that, because the error can be fixed by the trial court\u2019s entry of a corrected judgment, the error in question is not one that \u2018requires resentencing\u2019 under ORS 138.222(5)(a).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">275 Or App at 559-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">We rejected the state\u2019s argument, reasoning that \u201c[t]his situation is controlled by ORS 138.222(5)(b), which provides that, \u2018 [i]f the appellate court, in a case involving multiple counts of which at least one is a felony, <em>reverses the judgment of conviction on any count </em>and affirms other counts, the appellate court shall remand the case to the trial court for resentencing on the affirmed count or counts.\u2019\u201d 275 Or App at 560 (emphasis in <em>Skaggs). </em>We explained that, \u201cbecause we are reversing the judgment of conviction on two of defendant\u2019s felony counts, and affirming defendant\u2019s third felony conviction, ORS 138.222(5)(b) requires that we <em>\u2018shall </em>remand the case to the trial court for resentencing on the affirmed count or counts.\u2019\u201d 275 Or App at 560 (emphasis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>Skaggs). Thus, we reversed and remanded for resentencing, notwithstanding the state\u2019s contention that resentenc-ing would be <em>\u201ca </em>waste of resources\u201d because \u201cdefendant will receive the same sentence on remand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 561.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">The state now contends that <em>Skaggs </em>wrongly decided that a merger error involves the reversal of a judgment of conviction for purposes of ORS 138.222(5)(b). In the state\u2019s view, that paragraph was never intended to apply to merger errors and addresses only the limited circumstance in which an appellate court reverses the underlying <em>adjudication of guilt, </em>so we should overrule <em>Skaggs </em>and direct a more limited remand in this case, as authorized by ORS 138.222(5)(a) <em>{\u201cIf </em>the appellate court determines that the sentencing court, in imposing a sentence in the case, committed an error that <em>requires resentencing, </em>the appellate court shall remand the entire case for resentencing.\u201d (Emphasis added.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">As we recently reiterated in <em>State v. Civil, </em>283 Or App 395, 416, 388 P3d 1185 (2017), \u201cwe must not, and do not, \u2018lightly overrule\u2019 our precedents, including those construing statutes.\u201d (Quoting <em>Aguilar v. Washington County, </em>201 Or App 640, 648, 120 P3d 514 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 34 (2006)). We only overrule cases that are \u201cplainly wrong, a rigorous standard grounded in presumptive fidelity to <em>stare decisis\u201d Id. </em>at 406 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cSuch revisiting of statutory construction precedent, while necessarily quite rare, usually occurs when our precedent cannot be reconciled with the result that would follow application of a prescribed (or subsequently prescribed) mode of analysis or when we are presented with a qualitatively new, potentially dispositive contention not previously raised and addressed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">The state contends that this case presents the latter circumstance, because we decided <em>Skaggs </em>without the benefit of briefing regarding the correct interpretation of ORS 138.222(5)(b). That is, although the defendant in <em>Skaggs </em>sought a remand as a result of a merger error, he had not identified the statutory source of authority for that remand, and the state had expressly argued that the case was governed by ORS 138.222(5)(a); thus, neither party addressed the applicability of ORS 138.222(5)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b879-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>Although the state is correct that we construed the statute in <em>Skaggs </em>without briefing from the parties, that alone is not a sufficient basis on which to overrule our previous construction. \u201c[W]e begin with the assumption that issues considered in our prior cases are correctly decided, and \u2018the party seeking to change a precedent must assume responsibility for affirmatively persuading us that we should abandon that <em>precedent.\u2019\" Farmers Ins. Co. v. Mowry, </em>350 Or 686, 698, 261 P3d 1 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the state has not advanced any new argument that seriously undermines the conclusion we reached in <em>Skaggs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">First, and most fundamentally, the state does not offer a compelling argument as to why the plain text of ORS 138.222(5)(b) excludes merger errors. The state frames the \u201cprecise question\u201d of statutory construction as \u201cwhether the operative phrase in ORS <em>138.222(5)(b)\u2014viz., </em>\u2018reverses the judgment of conviction on any count and affirms other counts\u2019\u2014is a reference to <em>the judgment </em>itself or rather only a reference to the underlying <em>adjudication of guilt\u201d </em>(Emphases by the state.) The state then argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b879-5\">\u201cAlthough paragraph (b) uses the phrase <em>judgment </em>of conviction,\u2019 it also limits its application only to those cases in which the appellate court <em>\u2018reverses\u2019 </em>the judgment of conviction on any count but nonetheless <em>\u2018affirms </em>other counts.\u2019 *** [G]iven that the statute speaks in terms of an appellate court that \u2018reverses\u2019 one or more of the convictions while it \u2018affirms\u2019 one or more of the others, it necessarily is speaking only of <em>the adjudications of guilt </em>on the individual counts, not the single, final written judgment entered in the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">(Emphases by the state.)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">The state\u2019s argument assumes a false dichotomy: the \u201csingle, final written judgment\u201d versus the \u201cadjudications of guilt.\u201d Although it might simplify matters if the criminal law could be divided that cleanly, the phrase \u201cjudgment of conviction\u201d is often used in reference to the individual judicial determinations, embodied within a single judgment document, that are entered on guilty adjudications and serve as the basis for a sentence. <em>See, e.g., State v. Martine, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>277 Or App 360, 362, 371 P3d 510 (2016) (remanding for the trial court to \u201center <em>judgments of conviction </em>for attempted tampering with physical evidence and attempted hindering prosecution, and for resentencing,\u201d notwithstanding the fact that both counts were adjudicated in a single judgment document (emphasis added)). In fact, that understanding of \u201cjudgment of conviction\u201d is the more natural one in this context. After all, ORS 138.222 is about sentencing (and resentencing), and sentences generally attach to individual convictions that are reflected in the judgment entered by the court; they do not attach to adjudications of guilt or the judgment document as a whole. <em>See State v. White, </em>341 Or 624, 636, 147 P3d 313 (2006) (adhering to the view, expressed in <em>State v. Barrett, </em>331 Or 27, 10 P3d 901 (2000), that the term \u201cseparately punishable offense\u201d in the antimerger statute refers \u201conly to a conviction <em>entered in the ultimate judgment, </em>to which some sentence could attach\u201d (emphasis in <em>White)); accord State v. Partain, </em>349 Or 10, 20-21, 239 P3d 232 (2010) (stating, in <em>dicta, </em>that \u201cORS 138.222(5)(b), adopted in 2005 (Or Laws 2005, ch 563, \u00a7 1), extends the general approach of ORS 138.222(5)(a), allowing trial courts to <em>resentence a defendant on any judgments of convictions </em>that are affirmed on appeal, if any other judgment of conviction in the same case is reversed on appeal\u201d (emphasis added)). For that reason, the state\u2019s textual argument does not persuade us that we were plainly wrong to apply ORS 138.222(5)(b) to circumstances where, because of the reversal of a merger error, there will be fewer ^\u2018judgments of conviction\u201d upon which to impose a sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-3\">Nor does the state\u2019s explanation of the legislative history of ORS 138.222 (5)(b) convince us to overrule <em>Skaggs. </em>The state points out that the \u201cimpetus for the bill,\u201d House Bill (HB) 2224 (2005), was this court\u2019s opinions in <em>State v. Fry, </em>180 Or App 237, 42 P3d 369 (2002), and <em>State v. Rodvelt, </em>187 Or App 128, 66 P3d 577, <em>rev den, </em>336 Or 17 (2003). <em>See, e.g., </em>Exhibit B, House Committee on Judiciary, HB 2224, Feb 1, 2005 (testimony of Assistant Attorney General Jonathan H. Fussner, describing the bases for the bill). In those two cases, we had reached divergent conclusions as to whether the trial court errors required resentencing. In <em>Fry, </em>we reversed several of the defendant\u2019s rape convictions based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>on insufficiency of the evidence but declined to remand for resentencing on the affirmed counts. 180\"Or App at 246. Then, in <em>Rodvelt, </em>we accepted the state\u2019s concession that the trial court erred in entering separate convictions for fourth-degree assault and first-degree criminal mistreatment, but we agreed with the state\u2019s contention that the case <em>should </em>be remanded for resentencing. Our decision in <em>Rodvelt </em>was based on the provision that is now paragraph (a) of ORS 138.222(5), which provided, in part, \u201cTf the appellate court determines that the sentencing court, in imposing a sentence in the case, <em>committed an error that requires resen-tencing, </em>the appellate court shall remand the entire case for resentencing.\u2019\u201d 187 Or App at 131 (quoting ORS 138.222(5) (2003); emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">In the state\u2019s view, that history suggests that the legislature intended merger errors to continue to be addressed, as they were in <em>Rodvelt, </em>under the text that is now paragraph (a), and intended for the reversal of adjudications of guilt (at issue in Fry) to be resolved under the new paragraph (b). But the legislative history cited by the state, although in some ways consistent with the state\u2019s theory, also refers to \u201ccodifying\u201d <em>Rodvelt, see </em>Staff Measure Summary, Senate Committee on Judiciary, HB 2224 (2005) (\u201cCodifies Court of Appeals ruling in <em>State v. Rodvelt, </em>187 Or App 128 (2003)\u201d), and refers to \u201cclarif [ying] an area of law that is handled differently at the appellate level depending on the panel of judges,\u201d <em>see </em>Staff Measure Summary, House Committee on Judiciary, HB 2224 (2005). Thus, the state\u2019s proffered legislative history is also consistent with the view that ORS 138.222(5)(b) was enacted to preclude any judicial determination about the proper remedy\u2014that is, to statutorily <em>require </em>a remand whenever one of multiple convictions is reversed, including the situation in <em>Rodvelt, </em>so that whether to remand was no longer subject to an appellate panel\u2019s determination as to whether such errors \u201crequire resentencing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Furthermore, <em>Rodvelt </em>itself undermines the state\u2019s contention that the legislature, in responding to that opinion, necessarily would have understood merger errors to result in something other than the reversal of a \u201cjudgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>of conviction.\u201d In <em>Rodvelt, </em>we repeatedly referred to the merger error in that case as one that involved \u201creversal of a conviction.\u201d In fact, we equated the \u201creversal of a conviction\u201d based on merger errors with those circumstances in which we reverse a conviction based on the trial court\u2019s failure to grant a motion for a judgment of acquittal. 187 Or App at 132 (\u201cGiven the way that sentences are calculated under the felony sentencing guidelines, we conclude that, <em>when some but not all convictions in a case are reversed, </em>there necessarily has been an \u2018error in imposing a sentence in the case,\u2019 and such an error \u2018required resentencing.\u2019\u201d (Emphasis added.)); <em>id. </em>at 132-34 (providing two examples to demonstrate the flaws in the dissent\u2019s opposition to resentencing, both of which involved a trial court\u2019s error in denying a motion for a judgment of acquittal); <em>id. </em>at 135 (\u201cIn sum, the dissent is flatly wrong in suggesting that sentencing errors that <em>flow from erroneous convictions </em>are not the type of \u2018sentencing errors\u2019 addressed by ORS 138.222(5). As shown by our examples above, <em>reversal of a conviction </em>often has a great deal to do with the sentencing of other offenses, and thus the dissent\u2019s proposition that those other sentences are not affected by the error is incorrect.\u201d (Emphases added.)). If anything, the legislature\u2019s awareness of <em>Rodvelt </em>cuts against the state\u2019s suggestion that the legislature would have had in mind a clear distinction between merger errors and the reversal of adjudications of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Next, we turn briefly to the state\u2019s suggestion that our disposition in <em>Skaggs </em>is somehow inconsistent with previous Supreme Court decisions. In particular, the state cites a capital case, <em>State v. Bowen, </em>352 Or 109, 121, 282 P3d 807 (2012), as a case \u201cfinding only merger error and remanding only for entry of [a] corrected judgment.\u201d Yet the state neglects to cite the subsequent history of that case. In a later decision after remand, the defendant in <em>Bowen </em>took issue with the limited scope of the remand; his \u201cbasic argument [was] that, under ORS 138.222(5)(b), [the Supreme Court in an earlier appeal] was statutorily required to remand for resentencing on those convictions; therefore, defendant asserts, the trial court erred by following the terms of this court\u2019s remand, rather than resentencing defendant as this court should have ordered.\u201d <em>State v. Bowen, </em>355 Or 469, 473, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>326 P3d 1162 (2014) (footnote omitted). The court rejected that new argument on the ground that the defendant had not raised ORS 138.222(5)(b) in the earlier appeals, despite ample opportunity to do so. <em>Id. </em>at 474 (\u201cDefendant could have made his current argument on direct review * * *. He could have also argued, as he now does, that ORS 138.222(5)(b) required resentencing on his felony convictions as well. He did not, however, make that argument\u201d). In a footnote, the Supreme Court expressly reserved any decision on the merits of the defendant\u2019s contention regarding the applicability of ORS 138.222(5)(b) to the merger errors in that case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-4\">\u201cDefendant relies on paragraph (b) to assert that this court was obligated to remand the \u2018entire case\u2019 for resen-tencing. The state argues that paragraph (b) does not apply because this court did not reverse any of the murder convictions within the meaning of that paragraph by directing that they be merged into a single conviction. According to the state, paragraph (a), instead, is the operative provision, and no remand for resentencing was required under it because this court did not determine that the sentencing court, in imposing the sentence, committed an error that requires resentencing. <em>We do not sort through the parties\u2019 respective arguments at greater length or resolve them on their merits because we conclude that defendant\u2019s claim of error is not properly before us at this juncture!\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 473 n 3 (emphasis added). In short, neither <em>Bowen, </em>nor the other Supreme Court decisions cited by the state,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> casts any doubt on our holding in <em>Skaggs.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Finally, we observe that ORS 138.222(5)(b) was enacted because of the state\u2019s concern that we were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>remanding in every case in which one of multiple convictions was reversed, and it proposed a broadly worded statutory fix that eliminated this court\u2019s ability to fashion a narrower remand. If the state is now concerned that ORS 138.222(5)(b), as construed by this court, gives the state more than it asked for, that concern likewise can be addressed by the legislature\u2014yet another reason not to overrule <em>Skaggs </em>under these circumstances. <em>See Mowry, </em>350 Or at 697 (explaining that \u201cthe legislature\u2019s constitutional role allows it to make any change or adjustment in the statutory scheme that it deems appropriate\u201d after a court\u2019s construction of a statute, and that \u201c[t]he legislature can\u2014and often does\u2014amend a statute that this court has interpreted to clarify or change the statute or otherwise to advance the policy objectives that the legislature favors\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the state has failed to demonstrate that our decision in <em>Skaggs </em>should be overruled. Accordingly, we adhere to that decision and, based on the trial court\u2019s failure to merge the guilty verdicts on Count 1 and Count 6, remand for resentencing under ORS 138.222(5)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b884-5\">Convictions on Counts 1 and 6 reversed and remanded for entry of a judgment of conviction for one count of felony first-degree animal abuse; remanded for resentenc-ing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b875-5\"> The trial court sentenced defendant to terms of 36 months in prison on Count 1 and Count 2 (second-degree animal abuse), to be served concurrently, and one-year jail terms on Counts 3 through 18, each to be served concurrently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>with all other sentences. On appeal, defendant argues that the 36-month prison terms for Counts 1 and 2 were constitutionally disproportionate, and that the restitution award\u2014$16,622.09 to reimburse the Polk County Sheriffs Office for the <em>costs </em>that it incurred in caring for the entire herd of alpacas\u2014was unauthorized. In light of our remand for resentencing on all affirmed counts, we do not address defendant\u2019s challenges to the proportionality of his sentences or to restitution. <em>See State v.

In Count 6, the state alleged that, \u201c[a]s part of the same act or transaction as Count 1,\u201d defendant had \u201cunlawfully and recklessly and with criminal negligence fail[ed] to provide minimum care for an animal, to-wit: adult brown female, ID number \u20185\u2019, an animal in defendant\u2019s custody or control, such failure resulting in the death of the animal.\u201d Count 6 did not include the additional allegations regarding the number of animals that had been neglected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b883-7\"> The state also cites two other capital cases, <em>State v. Tiner, </em>340 Or 551, 567-68, 135 P3d 305 (2006), <em>cert den, </em>549 US 1169 (2007), and <em>State v. Acremant, </em>338 Or 302, 340, 108 P3d 1139, <em>cert den, </em>546 US 864 (2005), as examples of cases in which the Supreme Court remanded for entry of a corrected judgment after finding only merger errors. The state acknowledges that neither case \u201cspecifically addresses\u201d ORS 138.222(5), but argues that \u201cthe fact that the court remanded only for entry of a corrected judgment suggested that the court assumed that ORS 138.222(5)(a)\u2014rather than ORS 138.222(5)(b)\u2014governed its remedial authority when the only error is a failure to merge adjudications of guilt.\u201d The better explanation of those decisions is that the Supreme Court assumed (correctly) that ORS 138.222(5)(b) could not apply to those appeals, which were filed before January 1, 2006. <em>See </em>Or Laws 2005, ch 563, \u00a7 2 (\u201cThe amendments to ORS 138.222 by section 1 of this 2005 Act apply to appeals filed on or after the effective date of this 2005 Act\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
