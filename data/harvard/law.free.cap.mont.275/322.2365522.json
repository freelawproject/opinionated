We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">The following issue is raised on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Did the District Court err in granting EMC\u2019s motion for summary judgment?</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Plaintiff, Dr. Nafisseh Heiat Ph.D. (Nafisseh), and her husband Dr. Abbas Heiat Ph.D. (Abbas) are employed as associate professors in the Department of Accounting and Information Systems at EMC. Both Nafisseh and Abbas possess Ph.D. degrees from Portland State University. The District Court determined that they, as faculty members at EMC, perform substantially the same work. Abbas was hired by EMC in 1987 as an assistant professor in the information systems program. At the time Abbas was hired, EMC had recently lost its only faculty member in the information systems program who held a Ph.D. EMC advertised for the position listing a Ph.D. as a qualification. EMC offered Abbas the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Based on Abbas\u2019 \u201cterminal\u201d doctoral degree and experience, his starting salary under the collective bargaining agreement then in effect would have been $20,491. However, the collective bargaining agreement authorized the EMC administration to offer higher salaries to prospective faculty members in extraordinary recruitment situations. Fearing that Abbas would not accept the position for $20,491, EMC offered him in excess of $30,000. Ultimately, after additional negotiation, Abbas accepted the position at a starting salary of $40,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">In 1988, EMC advertised for another faculty opening in the information systems program. The posting listed a Ph.D. or equivalent as a qualification. Nafisseh received her Ph.D. in 1987, and applied for this position with EMC. She was offered the position with a staring salary of $27,190. Although she requested an additional adjustment to the starting salary, her request was denied and she accepted the position for the offered salary. Both Nafisseh and Abbas have received periodic salary increases, as mandated by the collective bargaining agreement and, during the 1992-93 academic year, Nafisseh earned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>$39,049 while Abbas earned $54,575. This disparity is due entirely to the difference in their starting salaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">In April of 1991, Nafisseh filed a complaint with the Montana Human Rights Commission alleging that she had been discriminated against based on her sex and that she had not been given equal pay for equal work. The Montana Human Rights Commission issued a right to sue letter. In her District Court complaint, Nafisseh alleged violations of the Montana Human Rights Act, the Government Code of Fair Practices, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, the Civil Rights Act of 1991, and the Equal Pay Act. On June 24,1994, the District Court granted EMC\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Nafisseh appeals from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Our standard in reviewing a district court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment is <em>de novo. Minnie v. City of Roundup </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 429, 431, 849 P.2d 212, 214. That is, we review an order of summary judgment using the same criteria as the district court; we are guided by Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. <em>Chilberg v. Rose </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 414, 903 P.2d 1377, 1378 (citing Minnie, 849 P.2d at 214). Thus, we determine whether a genuine issue of material fact exists and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Minnie, 849 P.2d at 214. Summary judgment is an extreme remedy and should never be substituted for a trial if a material fact controversy exists. <em>Howard v. Conlin Furniture No. 2, Inc. </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 433, 436, 901 P.2d 116, <em>118-19 (citing Hagen v. Dow Chem. Co. </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 487, 491, 863 P.2d 413, 416).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">A party seeking summary judgment has the burden of establishing a complete absence of any genuine factual issues. <em>Howard, </em>901 P.2d at 118. In light of the pleadings and the evidence before the district court, there must be no material issue of fact remaining which would entitle a non-moving party to recover. <em>Howard, </em>901 P.2d at 118. Once the moving party has met its burden, the party opposing the summary judgment motion must present material and substantial evidence, rather than conclusory or speculative statements, to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Howard, </em>901 P.2d at 119. In addition, all reasonable inferences that might be drawn from the offered evidence should be drawn in favor of the party who opposed summary judgment. <em>Howard, </em>901 P.2d at 119 (citing <em>Cereck v. Albertson\u2019s, Inc. </em>(1981), 195 Mont. 409, 411, 637 P.2d 509, 511).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">EMC contends that it was willing to pay Abbas a higher salary than that contemplated in the collective bargaining agreement because EMC had a pressing need to have a faculty member with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Ph.D. in the information systems program. EMC asserts that \u201c[o]nce the discipline was \u2018anchored\u2019 with a Ph.D. the need for a subsequent Ph.D. was lessened and, given the tight budget the College has labored with for several years, the College felt no need to pay a premium for a second Ph.D. in the same discipline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Abbas and Nafisseh assert that the rationale of \u201canchoring\u201d the department was not mentioned to either of them as a factor in setting salaries when they applied for and accepted positions on the faculty at EMC. Further, in an affidavit, Abbas stated that even after he was hired by EMC, he was not told that he occupied an \u201canchor position\u201d nor was he assigned extra duties or responsibilities. Nafisseh stated that at the time she was hired she was told that she could not be paid a high salary because of the tight budget at EMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Dr. Ronald Sexton, vice-president for academic affairs at EMC, asserted that the term \u201canchor position\u201d was essentially administrative jargon and, as a result, it is quite possible that neither Abbas nor Nafisseh had heard the term. Further, Sexton contended that because EMC already had Abbas as a Ph.D. on its information systems program faculty, EMC was not willing to pay a premium to hire another Ph.D. and that is the reason that Nafisseh was offered a lower starting salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">According to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s burden shifting analysis employed in discrimination cases, once the plaintiff has, by a preponderance of the evidence, proved a prima facie case of discrimination, the burden shifts to the defendant \u201cto articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee\u2019s rejection.\u201d <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Community Affairs v. Burdine </em>(1981), 450 U.S. 248, 252-53, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1093, 67 L.Ed.2d 207, 214-15 (citing <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green </em>(1973), 411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668). Should the defendant carry this burden, \u201cthe plaintiff must then have an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination.\u201d <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 253, 101 S.Ct. at 1093. Recently, the Supreme Court refined this stage, stating that \u201ca reason cannot be proved to be a \u2018pretext <em>for discrimination\u2019 </em>unless it is shown <em>both </em>that the reason was false, <em>and </em>that discrimination was the real reason.\u201d <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr. v. Hicks </em>(1993), 509 U.S. 502, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 2752, 125 L.Ed.2d 407, 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">At all times, the plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion and, after the defendant has articulated a legitimate, nondiscrimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>tory reason, the plaintiff must have the opportunity to demonstrate that the proffered reason was not the true reason for the employment decision. <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 256, 101 S.Ct. at 1095. At this point, the burden merges with the ultimate burden of persuading the court that the plaintiff has been a victim of intentional discrimination. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr., </em>509 U.S. at _, 113 S.Ct. at 2752; <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 256, 101 S.Ct. at 1095. The plaintiff succeeds either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence. <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 256, 101 S.Ct. at 1095.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">On a motion for summary judgment in discrimination cases, the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>order of proof and shifting of burdens at trial must be viewed in light of the traditional test for granting a motion for summary judgment. <em>Brown v. Parker-Hannifin Corp. </em>(10th Cir. 1984), 746 F.2d 1407, 1411. That test is whether the moving party has demonstrated that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.R; <em>Howard, </em>901 P.2d at 118-19. As the Seventh Circuit stated, \u201c[a]s a general rule, questions of motive and intent are inappropriate for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Box v. A &amp; P Tea Co. </em>(7th Cir. 1985), 772 F.2d 1372, 1378, <em>cert. denied, </em>478 U.S. 1010, 106 S.Ct. 3311, 92 L.Ed.2d 724 (1986) (citing <em>Cedillo v. International Ass\u2019n of Bridge &amp; Structural Iron Workers </em>(7th Cir. 1979), 603 F.2d 7, 11). The <em>Box </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">Consequently, a defendant in a discrimination case is not entitled to summary judgment if the plaintiff submits evidence from which a court can reasonably infer that the articulated legitimate reason is, in fact, a pretext for discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-11\"><em>Box, </em>772 F.2d at 1378 (citing <em>Gifford v. Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Ry. </em>(9th Cir. 1982), 685 F.2d 1149, 1156).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">The District Court determined that although Nafisseh had established a prima facie case of sex discrimination, EMC had established a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the salary disparity between Abbas and Nafisseh. The District Court determined that the differences in the salaries were based on factors other than sex. <em>See County of Washington v. Gunther </em>(1981), 452 U.S. 161, 170-71, 101 S.Ct. 2242, 2248-49, 68 L.Ed.2d 751, 760-61. However, in making this determination, the District Court adjudicated the disputed issue of material fact as to the reason for the differences in the salaries. As the Seventh Circuitfound <em>inBox, </em>this factual determination of motive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>or intent is precisely the reason that summary judgment is generally inappropriate in discrimination cases. <em>Box, </em>772 F.2d at 1378; <em>see also Sorba v. Pennsylvania Drilling Co. </em>(3d Cir. 1987), 821 F.2d 200, 205, <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 1019, 108 S.Ct. 730, 98 L.Ed.2d 679. Where different ultimate inferences may be drawn from the evidence presented by the parties, the case is not one for summary judgment. <em>Brown, </em>746 F.2d at 1411.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">We note that Nafisseh\u2019s burden to overcome a motion for summary judgment is different than her burden at trial. In <em>Kenyon v. Stillwater County </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 142, 148, 835 P.2d 742, 745-46, we stated that, in order to survive a motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff has the initial burden to \u201cadduce facts which, if believed, support a reasonable inference that he or she was denied an employment opportunity....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">We went on to hold that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">If that burden is met, the employer must rebut the inference of discrimination with evidence of legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons the plaintiff was not hired or was terminated; upon such a showing, the burden shifts back to the employee to demonstrate with specific facts that the employer\u2019s explanation is a pretext.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"An0\"><em>Kenyon, </em>835 P.2d at 746 (citing <em>Foster v. Arcata Associates, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1985), 772 F.2d 1453, <em>1459, cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1048, 106 S.Ct. 1267, 89 L.Ed.2d 576 (1986), <em>overruled on other grounds by, Kennedy v. Allied Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1991), 952 F.2d 262). We now determine that this process places a plaintiff, the nonmoving party in this summary judgment context, in the peculiar position of having to prove her case to survive the defendant\u2019s motion. The order of proof and shifting of burdens at trial must be viewed in light of the traditional test for granting a motion for summary judgment. Thus, to survive a motion for summary judgment, a plaintiff must only produce evidence sufficient to support a reasonable inference of the existence of the fact at issue. Under the <em>Kenyon </em>test, the non-moving party is saddled with two burdens, first, to \u201cadduce facts which, if believed, support a reasonable inference that he or she was denied an employment opportunity\u201d and, if the employer rebuts the inference of discrimination with evidence of legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons, to \u201cdemonstrate with specific facts that the employer\u2019s explanation is a pretext.\u201d <em>Kenyon, </em>835 P.2d at 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">The three-step <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>analysis, as adopted in the summary judgment context by this Court in <em>Kenyon, </em>conflicts with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>the two-step analysis traditionally employed in deciding motions for summary judgment. Under the traditional summary judgment analysis the party opposing summary judgment has only one burden, namely, to demonstrate that genuine issues of material fact exist. To do so, the party opposing summary judgment must present material and substantial evidence, rather than mere conclusory and speculative statements, to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Howard, </em>901 P.2d at 119. In <em>Kenyon, </em>we made the mistake of following the lead of many state and federal courts throughout the country and superimposed the three-step <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>trial analysis into the summary judgment context without specifically noting that the plaintiff\u2019s burden in defending against a motion for summary judgment differs from the plaintiff\u2019s burden at trial. At trial, the plaintiff has the burden of proof so the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>construct of placing the initial burden on the plaintiff is logical. However, when, as here, the defendant makes a motion for summary judgment, that construct does not work. In summary judgment, the moving party has the initial burden of establishing that there are no genuine issues of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">We now determine that it is error to require a plaintiff in a discrimination case to satisfy the burdens set forth in <em>Kenyon </em>to survive a motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, we overrule that portion <em>of Kenyon v. Stillwater County </em>which requires a plaintiff to initially \u201cadduce facts which, if believed, support a reasonable inference that he or she was denied an employment opportunity\u201d and, in rebuttal, to \u201cdemonstrate with specific facts that the employer\u2019s explanation is a pretext.\u201d <em>Kenyon, </em>835 P.2d at 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Instead, we now adopt an analysis consistent with the <em>Burdine </em>test, yet more compatible with the traditional analysis used in the summary judgment context. The plaintiff must allege a prima facie case of discrimination in her complaint. In this context, the plaintiff alleges a prima facie case by asserting that plaintiff is a member of a protected class, and that a male colleague with the same credentials, who performs substantially the same work, receives a higher salary. The employer seeking summary judgment must then come forward with a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the disparity. If the employer comes forward with a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason, the plaintiff must then, in addition to having alleged a prima facie case in the complaint, produce evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>establishes her prima facie case as well as evidence which raises an inference that the employer\u2019s proffered reason is pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Of course, this does not mean that a plaintiff in a discrimination action always survives summary judgment when the plaintiff calls the employer\u2019s proffered explanation into question. Rather than having to demonstrate with specific facts that the employer\u2019s explanation \u201cis a pretext,\u201d she need only introduce evidence which raises an inference that the employer\u2019s proffered reason is pretextual. To create a genuine issue of material fact as to pretext, the plaintiff must not only introduce evidence from which a reasonable person could infer that she is qualified, she must also introduce evidence that casts doubt on the defendant\u2019s contention that there was a legitimate business justification for defendant\u2019s action. <em>Chauhan v. M. Alfieri Co. </em>(3d Cir. 1990), 897 F.2d 123, 127 (citing <em>Healey v. New York Life Ins. Co. </em>(3d Cir. 1988), 860 F.2d 1209, 1220, <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1098, 109 S.Ct. 2449, 104 L.Ed.2d 1004 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The <em>Chauhan </em>court determined that the plaintiff had pointed to evidence necessary to pass this test, stating that \u201cthe inconsistencies in [defendant\u2019s] explanation, as pointed out by [plaintiff], present precisely the kind of 'inconsistencies and implausibilities in [defendant\u2019s] proffered reasons\u2019 that <em>could </em>support an inference of discrimination.\u201d <em>Chauhan, </em>897 F.2d at 128 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Justice Nelson\u2019s specially concurring opinion contends that the <em>Kenyon </em>test requires that a plaintiff opposing summary judgment do nothing more than establish a genuine issue of material fact. However, as this case exemplifies, in discrimination cases, the district courts are requiring that a plaintiff do more than merely raise an issue of material fact. In the present case, the District Court held that EMC established a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the salary disparity and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">Dr. Nafisseh Heiat failed to establish the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason offered by EMC for her salary is <em>pretextual. A </em>reasonable jury could not return a verdict in favor of Dr. Nafisseh Heiat in light of the evidence presented to the court during the summary judgment proceedings. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">Notably, the court granted summary judgment not because of Nafisseh\u2019s inability to establish a genuine issue of material fact or to raise an <em>inference of </em>pretext. Rather, the court, citing the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>trial burden, faulted Nafisseh for her failure to \u201cestablish\u201d that EMC\u2019s proffered reason \u201cis <em>a pretext.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>The test that we now establish for a plaintiff in a discrimination case to survive a motion for summary judgment comports with Rule 56, M.R.Civ.R, in that a plaintiff is required to raise an inference of pretext, as opposed to proving pretext. This burden is more aligned with the general requirement of raising a genuine issue of material fact to survive the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">In the instant case, Nafisseh has pointed to inconsistencies in EMC\u2019s explanation that could support an inference of discrimination. The District Court found that Nafisseh had established a prima facie case because she had \u201cproved that she is a woman and her male colleague with the same credentials, who performs substantially the same work, receives a higher salary than her.\u201d <em>See St. Mary\u2019s Honor Ctr., </em>509 U.S. at _, 113 S.Ct. at 2747 (discussing the elements of a prima facie case in the racial discrimination context); <em>Sorba, </em>821 F.2d at 203 (discussing the elements of a prima facie case in the ADEA context). Additionally, Nafisseh submitted affidavits which, in addition to the facts making up the prima facie case, raise an inference that the defendant\u2019s proffered reason is pretextual. <em>Chauhan, </em>897 F.2d at 128. Under the standard we now announce, Nafisseh would not be required to produce affidavits establishing her prima facie case until the defendant moves for summary judgment and proffers a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the salary disparity.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">In her affidavit, Nafisseh stated that she \u201cwas not advised that the reason Dr. Abbas Heiat was receiving a higher salary than mine was because he occupied an \u2018anchor position\u2019 in the department and that it was the practice of the college to pay a premium salary to fill such \u2018anchor positions.\u2019 \u201d Further, Nafisseh stated that she was told that she was receiving a lower salary because of \u201cbudgetary problems.\u201d In his affidavit, Abbas stated that when he was hired he was not advised that one of the reasons he was offered a salary of $40,000 was because he was occupying an \u201canchor position.\u201d In addition, he stated that he has not \u201cbeen assigned any extra duties, chores, assignments, or responsibilities relative to said \u2018anchor position.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">Contrary to the dissent\u2019s suggestion that the Heiats have done nothing more than establish an \u201cunderstandable lack of knowledge as to the basis for administrative decisions made by EMC,\u201d these affidavits raise genuine issues as to material facts in at least three particulars: (1) neither Nafisseh nor Abbas were advised of the \u201canchor position\u201d rationale when they were hired or during their tenure of teaching; (2) EMC has propounded two differing reasons for Nafisseh\u2019s lesser pay; budgetary concerns on the one hand, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>\u201canchor position\u201d rationale on the other; and (3) contrary to what one would expect if Abbas were in fact an \u201canchor\u201d \u2014 he was never assigned any additional duties or responsibilities commensurate with such a position on the faculty. These are not mere conclusions but, rather, material facts which give rise to genuine issues, not the least of which is the question of whether the \u201canchor position\u201d rationale was, as Nafisseh claims, merely an afterthought or pretext. These material facts are sufficient to overcome the motion for summary judgment. <em>Hagen, </em>863 P.2d at 416 (citing <em>D\u2019Agostino v. Swanson </em>(1990), 240 Mont. 435, 442, 784 P.2d 919, 924).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Nafisseh argues, and we agree, that, at best, there is a disputed issue of material fact as to whether Abbas was hired to fill a so-called \u201canchor position\u201d and, at worst, an issue of whether the whole concept of an \u201canchor position\u201d was merely a pretext developed after the fact to escape the consequences of EMC\u2019s actions which led to this suit. Nafisseh testified that she was told that budgetary problems were the reason she was offered a lower salary. Resolution of this discrepancy was a question of material fact. A jury should have the opportunity to weigh the credibility of the witnesses and the testimony to determine whether Nafisseh has indeed been discriminated against because of her sex. This question of material fact, whether there was a nondiscriminatory reason for the difference in salaries, should have precluded the District Court from granting EMC\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b358-6\">JUSTICES HUNT and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b358-7\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"AB8\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">I concur with the result of our opinion.

Arcata Assoc., Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1985), 772 F.2d 1453, a summary judgment-discrimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>case, which, like cases in many other jurisdictions, followed the analysis in <em>McDonnell-Douglas. </em>I believe that the first step in that analysis and in our approach here is really the same \u2014 i.e. the plaintiff must initially make out a prima facie case of discrimination at the pleading stage. While that may appear to be a first burden for the plaintiff under <em>McDonnell-Douglas, </em>that same hurdle exists for the plaintiff in any case. I do not believe that the language used in <em>Kenyon </em>that the plaintiff need \u201cadduce facts which, if believed, support a reasonable inference that he or she was denied an employment opportunity,\u201d sets any different or higher standard for the initial pleading in discrimination cases than we have traditionally required for pleading in non-discrimination cases. <em>Kenyon, </em>835 P.2d at 745.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">In <em>Treutel v. Jacobs </em>(1989), 240 Mont. 405, 784 P.2d 915, a personal injury case decided on summary judgment, citing Rule 8(a), M.R.Civ.P., we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\">While this Court has long recognized that a complaint is to be construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, <em>Fraunhofer v. Price </em>(1979), 182 Mont. 7, 594 P.2d 324, we cannot say that Linda\u2019s complaint, even when viewed favorably to her position, set forth a claim upon which relief can be granted. As we stated in <em>Rambur v. Diehl Lumber Co. </em>(1963), 142 Mont. 175, 179, 382 P.2d 552, 554:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">\"... a complaint must state something more than facts which, at most, would breed only a suspicion that plaintiffs have a right to relief. Liberality does not go so far as to excuse omission of that which is material and necessary in order to entitle relief.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-7\"><em>Treutel, </em>784 P.2d at 916. Accordingly, the first element of <em>Kenyon </em>is in line with existing law. If plaintiff does not set out a prima facie case in the complaint, her claim will never survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, much less a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">The burden then shifts to the movant for summary judgment, the employer. Under our decision here, under <em>McDonnell-Douglas, </em>and under <em>Kenyon, </em>the test is the same; the employer must come forward with a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the alleged discriminatory treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">Assuming the employer meets that burden, it is then incumbent on the plaintiff to come forward with sufficient facts to raise an inference that the employer\u2019s reason is actually a pretext. While the majority reads the language used in <em>Kenyon </em>as imposing a trial burden of proof on the plaintiff, I do not. I do not find anything in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>either <em>Kenyon </em>or in <em>Foster </em>that leads me to believe that our statement that the employee must \u201cdemonstrate with specific facts that the employer\u2019s explanation is a pretext,\u201d imposes any different or higher burden of proof on the plaintiff in a summary judgment-discrimination case than in any other case.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Again, in the context of a non-discrimination case, we recently reiterated the well-established rule as to plaintiff\u2019s burden in opposing a motion for summary judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">Once the movant has presented evidence to support his or her motion, the party opposing summary judgment must present material and substantial evidence, rather than mere conclusory or speculative statements, to raise a genuine issue of material fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQx\"><em>Howard v. Conlin Furniture No. 2, Inc. </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 433, 437, 901 P.2d 116, 119, a wrongful discharge-summary judgment case. See also <em>Thornton v. Songstad </em>(1994), 263 Mont. 390, 868 P.2d 633, a contract case involving the sale of real property, wherein we stated that the non-moving party\u2019s proof must be substantial and consist of specific facts and that reliance on speculative, fanciful or conclusory statements is insufficient. <em>Thornton, </em>868 P.2d at 638. In my view, <em>Kenyon\u2019s </em>third step does not require of plaintiff any more than that she present material and substantial factual evidence of pretext, nor does that step allow her to prevail merely on conclusion and speculation. I do not believe that, under <em>Kenyon, </em>the plaintiff is subjected to a trial burden of proof in opposing summary judgment; she is simply required to raise a factually based inference of pretext, but nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Again, I believe our opinion and our approach here is correct. It should now be crystal clear who bears which burden and what is the correct standard ofproofin summaryjudgment-discrimination cases. Nevertheless, for the very reasons that we set out in our opinion, I would have also concluded under <em>Kenyon </em>that Nafisseh had met her burden to raise a factually based inference that EMC\u2019s explanation was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">Accordingly, I specially concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b360-8\">JUSTICE GRAY</author>\n<p id=\"A1z\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">I concur in the result we reach in this case, but disagree strenuously with portions of the analysis under which it is reached. In this regard, I join in the analysis contained in Justice Nelson\u2019s special concurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>I write separately to state my dismay over the unnecessary and unwise step of \u201coverruling\u201d <em>Kenyon </em>which is taken here by the three Justices who have signed the plurality opinion. First, <em>Kenyon </em>can and should be clarified, but not overruled, for the reasons stated by Justice Nelson. Indeed, no party to this case suggested overruling <em>Kenyon, </em>a unanimous \u2014 and recent \u2014 opinion by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Moreover, the statement in the plurality opinion that \u201cthe district courts\u201d are requiring plaintiffs in discrimination cases to do more than merely raise an issue of material fact is questionably sweeping, at best, given that this is the first such case we have seen. In addition, the fact that the District Court in this case applied the <em>McDonnell-Douglas </em>trial burden, rather than the summary judgment burden established by this Court in <em>Kenyon, </em>is hardly a reason to overrule <em>Kenyon. </em>Indeed, had the District Court applied <em>Kenyon, </em>but done so erroneously, the proper course for this Court would be to correct the District Court, not to overrule <em>Kenyon. </em>To suggest that a district court\u2019s error in either missing a case altogether or applying it erroneously is a proper basis for overruling that case is certainly a new approach to <em>stare decisis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">My major concern with the plurality opinion, however, is just that: it is merely a plurality opinion with regard to overruling <em>Kenyon. </em>A majority of this Court is opposed to overruling <em>Kenyon, </em>yet apparently this Court is being forced down an entirely new path by virtue of three of its members stating that they can overrule a case with less than a majority vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">I recognize that, as a practical matter, it makes little difference in this case whether <em>Kenyon </em>is merely clarified or overruled since either would produce the same result. Here, however, it is the plurality\u2019s attitude toward precedent and <em>stare decisis </em>\u2014 and where that attitude will lead us in the future \u2014 which is important. Can three votes really overrule a case? In a four to three decision, will the dissenters \u201coverrule\u201d cases relied on by the majority? Are such approaches sufficiently cognizant of the importance of stability, continuity and clarity in the law?</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Applying <em>Kenyon, </em>I would conclude that Nafisseh met her burden in this case. Accordingly, I would reverse the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b362-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"AxM\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">In pointing out that there are only three votes to reverse <em>Kenyon, </em>Justice Gray\u2019s special concurrence characterizes the present decision as a \u201cplurality\u201d decision. That is not an accurate characterization of our holding in this case. Including the special concurrences of Justice Nelson and Justice Gray,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> there are five votes for the new test adopted in the present case. Thus, as to the adoption of that test, there is clearly a majority. Those same five Justices, however, disagree as to what effect the new test has on the test previously enunciated in <em>Kenyon. </em>No more than three Justices were able to agree on any one characterization. That is, has <em>Kenyon </em>been overruled, clarified or modified? As is apparent from the opinion, three of the Justices did agree that, since the Court had changed <em>Kenyon </em>both procedurally and substantively, <em>Kenyon </em>was, in effect, overruled. The disagreement as to how the result in this opinion affects <em>Kenyon, </em>does not alter the fact that, in the final analysis, a majority of the Court has adopted a new test which replaces the <em>Kenyon </em>test.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b361-8\">.1 have resisted the temptation to count my own special concurrence as yet another vote for the opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b362-5\">JUSTICE ERDMANN</author>\n<p id=\"A3j\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">I respectfully dissent. I am not convinced that the new standard adopted by the majority for summary judgment motions in discrimination cases is necessary, nor do I believe it is necessary to overrule our recent decision in <em>Kenyon v. Stillwater County </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 142, 835 P.2d 742. I would continue to utilize the standard established in <em>McDonnell Douglas v. Green </em>(1973), 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668, as applied in the summary judgment context in <em>Foster v. Arcata Associates, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1985), 772 F.2d 1453, which was adopted by this Court in <em>Kenyon. </em>Under either the traditional standard or the new standard adopted by the majority, however, I would affirm the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">As recognized by the majority, this Court has adopted the test articulated in <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>and further developed in <em>Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine </em>(1981), 450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207, for analyzing discrimination cases. <em>See Kenyon, 835 </em>P.2d 742; <em>Taliaferro v. State </em>(1988), 235 Mont. 23, 764 P.2d 860; <em>European Health Spa v. Human Rights Comm\u2019n </em>(1984), 212 Mont. 319, 687 P.2d 1029; <em>Martinez v. Yellowstone County Welfare Dept. </em>(1981), 192 Mont. 42, 626 P.2d 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">In <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>the U.S. Supreme Court set forth the shifting burdens and order of proof in discrimination cases. The plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>is generally established with reference to the prima facie case model for disparate treatment cases adopted in <em>McDonnell Douglas. </em>Upon proof of a prima facie case, a presumption arises that the employer unlawfully discriminated against the employee. If a prima facie case is established, the employer must produce evidence that its action was based on a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, or, under the Equal Pay Act, based on \u201cfactors other than sex.\u201d If the employer can articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, the presumption of discrimination drops out of the case and the burden shifts back to the plaintiff who must then establish that the reason is pretextual. <em>Kenyon, </em>835 P.2d at 745-46; <em>Taliaferro, </em>764 P.2d at 863; <em>European Health Spa, </em>687 P.2d at 1031; <em>Martinez, </em>626 P.2d at 246; <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 252-53, 101 S.Ct. at 1093-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">The District Court found that Nafisseh established a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that she was' a woman and a male colleague (Abbas) with the same credentials, who performed substantially the same work, received a higher salary. The District Court went on to find that EMC had established a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the salary differential between Nafisseh and Abbas. Finally, the District Court found that Nafisseh failed to establish that the legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason offered by EMC was pretextual. Since Nafisseh could not produce evidence to establish that EMC\u2019s reasons were pretextual, there was no genuine issue of material fact. The District Court concluded that a reasonable jury could not return a verdict in favor of Nafisseh.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">As noted, the maj ority has determined that the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test is not appropriate for analyzing discrimination cases in the summary judgment context and developed a new standard. The majority abandons the first element of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test which required the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case, which, once established, created a presumption of discrimination. The majority states that for summary judgment purposes, the court will assume that the plaintiff has alleged a prima facie case of discrimination. The majority retains the second element of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test by then requiring the employer to come forward with a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the action. If the employer comes forward with a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason, only then does the plaintiff need to establish a prima facie case of discrimination. If the plaintiff produces evidence which raises an inference that the employer\u2019s proffered reason is pretextual, the plaintiff\u2019s burden is met and summary judgment must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>This new standard requires employers to rebut discrimination allegations not yet proven, which places the cart before the proverbial horse. The Ninth Circuit has discussed and applied the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>standard in the summary judgment context in <em>Foster.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-4\">On a motion for summary judgment in discrimination cases, the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>order of proof and shifting of burdens must be viewed in light of the traditional test for granting summary judgment. See <em>Steckl [v. Motorla, Inc.], </em>703 F.2d [392] at 393, [(9th Cir. 1983)]. That test is whether the moving party has demonstrated that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Alaska v. United States, </em>754 F.2d 851, 853 (9th Cir. 1985). Although courts are generally cautious about granting summary judgment when motivation and intent are at issue, as in Title VII and ADEA cases, such relief may nonetheless be appropriate. <em>Steckl, </em>703 F.2d at 393. One purpose of the allocation of burdens in Title VII and ADEA actions is to enable the district courts to identify meritless suits and dispense with them short of trial. Id., at 393-94; <em>[Douglas v.] Anderson, </em>656 F.2d [528] at 535, [(9th Cir. 1981)]. Summary judgment, judiciously applied, is an appropriate vehicle for accomplishing this objective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ao3\"><em>Foster, </em>772 F.2d at 1459.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">While the majority\u2019s new standard appears to simplify the summary judgment procedure in discrimination cases by eliminating the initial <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>element, it necessarily abandons the precedence established by this Court as well as numerous other state and federal courts in this area. The traditional standard has worked well in Montana and other jurisdictions and this Court should be reluctant to abandon the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">The adoption of the new standard, while simplifying the steps to be followed by the parties, leaves unchanged the analysis of the final <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>element \u2014 whether the plaintiff can produce evidence to raise an inference that the employer\u2019s proffered reasons are pretextual. Here I differ with the majority as to what suffices as evidence to establish the inference in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">The majority finds three geniune issues of material fact: (1) Nafisseh and Abbas were not advised by EMC that it considered Abbas\u2019 position an \u201canchor position\u201d; (2) EMC has given two reasons for Nafisseh\u2019s lower pay \u2014 budgetary concerns and the \u201canchor position\u201d rationale; and (3) Abbas was never assigned any additional duties one would expect of an \u201canchor position.\u201d These three assertions are merely speculative or conclusory and are insufficient to raise a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Farm Credit Bank of Spokane v. Hill </em>(1993), 266 Mont. 258, 265, 879 P.2d 1158, 1162.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">In this case, EMC established that when Abbas was hired in 1987 the school had just lost the only faculty member in the information systems discipline who possessed a Ph.D. The administration felt it was important to the credibility and reputation of the discipline to immediately find another Ph.D. to \u201canchor\u201d the discipline. The term \u201canchor position\u201d merely referred to the need for a Ph.D. and there was absolutely no evidence in the record that the term envisioned any additional duties or responsibilities. EMC was willing to pay a premium to recruit a high quality applicant with a Ph.D. and did so when they hired Abbas.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">In 1988, however, when EMC advertised for an assistant professor in the information systems discipline, a Ph.D. was already on staff so there was no reason to pay a premium. The job advertisement did not require that applicants have a Ph.D. Nafisseh, who had a Ph.D., applied for and was hired for the position at a salary level higher than the salary schedule the union agreement called for, but lower than the salary paid to Abbas the year before. EMC\u2019s articulated reason for the salary differential was that there was no need to pay a premium for a second Ph.D. in the same discipline, a reason the District Court found to be legitimate and nondiscriminatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">In the affidavits filed in opposition to EMC\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the Heiats stated that they were not aware of EMC\u2019s proffered reasons for the salary differential when they were hired. Nafisseh stated in her deposition that she was told when she was hired that the college was experiencing \u201cbudget problems,\u201d but that statement does not conflict with EMC\u2019s position that they were not willing to pay a premium for a second Ph.D. in the information systems discipline. The Heiats\u2019 affidavits do not create any genuine issues of material fact, but merely reflect the Heiats\u2019 understandable lack of knowledge as to the basis for administrative decisions made by EMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">In her deposition, Nafisseh confirmed that she had no knowledge that would create a genuine issue of material fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">Q: So you don\u2019t think \u2014 you don\u2019t know then that the basis for offering you $28,000 was the fact that you were a woman rather than the fact that you were the second Ph.D. hired?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\">HEIAT: I know that I was offered a lower salary, and I knew that I was a female rather than a male compared to another colleague <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>who was paid a higher salary. So my conclusion was that probably it was based on my sex.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-4\">Q: Well, you said that you can\u2019t say that the school was not basing their salary decisions on the fact that you were the second Ph.D.? They might very well have been basing them on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">HEIAT: I said I don\u2019t know. If they were, I wasn\u2019t aware of it. Nobody told me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Nafisseh\u2019s subjective belief of discrimination does not create a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Tozzi v. Joliet Junior College </em>(U.S.D.C. N.D. Ill. 1989), 57 FEP 269, 272, 1989 WL 96447 (citing <em>Andre v. Bendix Corp. </em>(7th Cir. 1988), 841 F.2d 172, 176, <em>cert. denied </em>(1988), 488 U.S. 855, 109 S.Ct. 144, 102 L.Ed.2d 116). Her statements are conclusory and are not supported by any specific evidence and are insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Grimwood v. Univ. of Puget Sound </em>(Wash. 1988), 753 P.2d 517, 519-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">The majority cites <em>Box v. A &amp; P Tea Co. </em>(7th Cir. 1985), 772 F.2d 1372, and <em>Brown v. Parker-Hannifin Corp. </em>(10th Cir. 1984), 746 F.2d 1407, and yet both these cases support the traditional summary judgment standard.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">It is true that once a properly supported motion for summary judgment is made, the opposing party may not merely rest on the allegations in the complaint and must respond with some factual showing of the existence of a genuine issue of material fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApO\"><em>Brown, </em>746 F.2d at 1412.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-9\">As the district court correctly noted, \u2018[c]onjecture, speculation, references to matters outside the [affiant\u2019s] personal knowledge, conclusory statements and bare assertions of the general truth of a particular matter will not suffice to withstand a properly supported motion for summary judgment.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-10\"><em>Box, </em>772 F.2d at 1378.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">In this case, Nafisseh has certainly not presented any evidence that EMC\u2019s proffered reasons are pretextual nor has she presented evidence that would raise an inference that the reasons are pretextual. She instead argues that she and her husband were not informed of EMC\u2019s reason for the pay differential when they were hired and, since her husband is being paid more, she \u201cconcluded\u201d that she had been discriminated against based upon her gender. Under the <em>McDonnell Douglas I Foster </em>analysis, a plaintiff seeking to establish a pretext must, at a minimum, introduce <em>evidence </em>that raises an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>inference that the employer\u2019s proffered reasons are pretextual. Nafisseh has simply failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">This Court has held that the primary policy and general purpose underlying Rule 56, M.R.Civ.R, is \u201cto promptly dispose of actions in which there is no genuine issue of fact, thereby eliminating unnecessary trial, delay and expense.\u201d <em>Silloway v. Jorgenson </em>(1965), 146 Mont. 307, 310, 406 P.2d 167, 169. \u201c[T]he purpose of summary judgment is to encourage judicial economy by eliminating unnecessary trials ....\u201d <em>Cole v. Flathead County </em>(1989), 236 Mont. 412, 416, 771 P.2d 97, 99-100.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\">[T]he salutary purposes of summary judgment \u2014 avoiding protracted, expensive and harassing trials \u2014 apply no less to discrimination cases than to commercial or other areas of litigation. ... To allow a party to defeat a motion for summary judgment by offering purely conclusory allegations of discrimination, absent any concrete particulars, would necessitate a trial in all Title VII cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZ2\"><em>Ritzie v. City Univ. of New York </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1989), 703 F. Supp. 271, 281.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Virtually all of the cases in this area, including those cited by the majority, require more than speculation and conclusory statements. Here EMC\u2019s proffered reason was that Abbas had been hired at the higher salary for an \u201canchor position\u201d because of the need for a Ph.D. in the discipline. No evidence contradicted this. When Nafisseh was hired there was no need to expend additional dollars to recruit a Ph.D. since the discipline already had one. No evidence contradicted this. Nafisseh and the majority speculated that the \u201canchor position\u201d might require additional duties. No evidence supports this speculation. Nafisseh has simply failed to establish evidence which would support an inference that EMC\u2019s reasons were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The proper standard was set forth by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Foster </em>and was properly articulated and applied by this Court in <em>Kenyon. </em>I would continue to rely on the <em>McDonnell Douglas /Burdine </em>standard as defined in the summary judgment context by <em>Foster </em>and adopted by this Court in <em>Kenyon. </em>However, under either standard Nafisseh has failed to establish that EMC\u2019s proffered reasons are pretextual. I would affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b367-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE joins in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
