Taylor (Taylor) appeals from the Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Judgment of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court determining that two of three workers\u2019 compensation claims filed by Taylor were fraudulent. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-16\">We consider the following dispositive issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b458-17\">1. Does substantial credible evidence support the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that Taylor filed fraudulent claims for injuries?</p>\n<p id=\"b458-18\">2. Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err when it failed to find that the insurer\u2019s conduct was unreasonable and in failing to award Taylor his attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and the statutory penalty?</p>\n<p id=\"b459-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>Taylor began working for the Montana Department of Transportation (DOT) in 1988. At the time of Taylor\u2019s alleged accidents, Taylor\u2019s job classification was a truck driver. Taylor filed claims for industrial accidents that allegedly occurred on February 26, 1990, November 15,1990, and March 4,1991. At the time of the alleged injuries, State Fund was the workers\u2019 compensation insurer for the DOT. State Fund accepted liability for each claim and began paying Taylor wage loss and medical benefits. Although State Fund began an investigation of Taylor\u2019s claims and requested the Montana Criminal Investigations Bureau to conduct an investigation, State Fund continued to pay benefits until April of 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Taylor alleges that he injured his neck in an industrial accident on February 26, 1990. Taylor underwent neck surgery for this injury. Similarly, Taylor alleges that he suffered a work-related injury on November 15, 1990, while he was working in the maintenance shed of the DOT\u2019s Bozeman, Montana facility. No one witnessed this accident. He alleges that he bumped the left side of his head near his ear while he was standing up from checking bolts on the plow. Taylor asserts that he hit his head so hard that it knocked him to his knees. Following this incident, Taylor consulted Dr. Pamela Hiebert for treatment. Taylor was admitted to Bozeman Deaconess Hospital overnight for observation. The next day, Taylor was discharged from the hospital and sought no further treatment for this injury. State Fund accepted liability for this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">On March 4,1991, Taylor was working with a road crew fixing pot holes on Main Street in Bozeman, Montana. Taylor testified that near the end of his shift he was directed to pick up the safety cones and signs that marked the job area. He alleges that while picking up the cones he stumbled and fell, hitting his head, neck, and shoulders and landing on his hips and back. Again, this accident was unwitnessed. After the incident, Taylor got into the truck and drove approximately one mile back to the DOT shop where he reported the accident to his acting supervisor, Dan Noyes (Noyes), and asked Noyes to drive him to the hospital. Taylor was admitted to the hospital and, while hospitalized, he complained of lumbar pain and pain in his left extremities. Taylor was discharged from the hospital on March 8, 1991. Two days later, Taylor was readmitted to the hospital for injuries related to his cervical and lumbar spine. He was treated with an anesthetic and an anti-inflammatory and was again released from the hospital on March 15, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Taylor was admitted to St. Vincent\u2019s Hospital in Billings, Montana, on August 27,1991, by Dr. James Johnson, and was released the next day. On August 29, 1991, at the request of Dr. Johnson, Taylor was examined by Dr. Robert Snider, an orthopedic surgeon, who stated that surgery may not be of any value because he was not sure of the source of Taylor\u2019s back pain. Another doctor concurred in the opinion that surgery was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">In the fall of 1993, Taylor was seen by another orthopedic surgeon, Dr. J ames Lovitt, who opined that Taylor had two choices, to live with his pain or to consider surgery. Dr. Lovitt noted that Taylor was not a good candidate for surgery, which included spinal fusion, because of his history of smoking and, further, that surgery might lead to additional complications.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">State Fund asserted that Taylor did not suffer a disabling injury on March 4, 1991, and, therefore, terminated Taylor\u2019s benefits on April 20, 1994. State Fund filed a petition for hearing before the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court alleging that Taylor did not suffer any industrial injuries and that his claims were fraudulent. Taylor responded by filing a petition for hearing in order to reinstate his benefits. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court consolidated the petitions and trial was held in February of 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">At trial, State Fund offered the testimony of several witnesses to prove that Taylor\u2019s claims were fraudulent. Elizabeth Larain (Larain) and Robert Beebe (Beebe) testified that Taylor allegedly told them that he was \u201cscamming the system\u201d and that his claims were fraudulent. Beebe testified that he called the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fraud Hotline and reported Taylor\u2019s fraudulent claim. Larain testified that she had telephoned Lance Zanto, an adjuster with State Fund, and told him that Taylor\u2019s claims were fraudulent. Several other witnesses, including a claims adjuster with State Fund, an investigator with the Montana Criminal Investigations Bureau, Taylor\u2019s former supervisor from the DOT, and Taylor\u2019s ex-wife testified at trial. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court acknowledged that \u201cthe credibility of witnesses testifying at trial is critical to the resolution of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Ultimately, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court determined that both the November 15, 1990 and the March 4, 1991 claims were fraudulent. The court concluded that State Fund failed to carry its burden of proof that the February 26, 1990 claim was fraudulent. Taylor appeals from the determination that two of his claims were fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>1. Does substantial credible evidence support the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s finding that Taylor filed fraudulent claims for injuries?</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">In reviewing findings of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, we determine whether the findings are supported by substantial credible evidence. <em>Wilson v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1995), [273 Mont. 313], 903 P.2d 785, 787 (citing <em>Miller v. Frasure </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 132, 137, 809 P.2d 1257, 1260). Substantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla of evidence but may be less than a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Wilson, </em>903 P.2d at 787. We will not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court where the issue relates to the weight given to certain evidence or the credibility of the witnesses. <em>Wilson, </em>903 P.2d at 787 (citing Burns <em>v. Plum Creek Timber Co. </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 82, 84, 885 P.2d 508, 509); <em>Rose v. Burdick\u2019s Locksmith </em>(1994), 265 Mont. 178, 180-81, 875 P.2d 337, 339.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court determined that State Fund satisfied its burden of proving that Taylor committed actual fraud. To sustain a claim of fraud, State Fund was required to plead and prove each of the nine elements of fraud. <em>Haag v. Montana Sch. Group Ins. Auth. </em>(1995), [274 Mont. 109], 906 P.2d 693, 697. Fraud can never be presumed but must be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Barrett v. Holland &amp; Hart </em>(1993), 256 Mont. 101, 106, 845 P.2d 714, 717 (citing <em>Batten v. Watts Cycle &amp; Marine </em>(1989), 240 Mont. 113, 117, 783 P.2d 378, 381, <em>cert. denied, </em>494 U.S. 1087, 110 S.Ct. 1826, 108 L.Ed.2d 955 (1990)). The court found that, as to the November 15, 1990 and March 4, 1991 claims, State Fund satisfied its burden and proved each of the nine elements of fraud. The elements are: (1) a representation; (2) falsity of the representation; (3) materiality of the representation; (4) speaker\u2019s knowledge of the falsity of the representation or ignorance of its truth; (5) the speaker\u2019s intent it should be relied upon; (6) the hearer\u2019s ignorance of the falsity of the representation; (7) the hearer\u2019s reliance on the representation; (8) the hearer\u2019s right to rely on the representation; and (9) the hearer\u2019s consequent and proximate injury caused by the reliance on the representation. <em>Lee v. Armstrong </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 289, 293, 798 P.2d 84, 87; <em>Batten, </em>783 P.2d at 380-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The court noted that Taylor made specific statements acknowledging that two of his claims were fraudulent. While the court recognized that \u201cit is ultimately [Taylor\u2019s] word against the words of Larain and Beebe, I found the latter witnesses to be credible and believable. Ultimately, however, this case doesn\u2019t rely solely on their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>evidence. The finding of fraud is supported by other significant evidence.\u201d The court made extensive findings relating to the medical evidence, the testimony of the witnesses, and the credibility of the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Taylor asserts that State Fund did not rebut the testimony of the numerous physicians who have treated Taylor for his multiple injuries. The findings of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, however, reflect otherwise. The court\u2019s findings indicate that several of Taylor\u2019s treating physicians could not find an objective basis for Taylor\u2019s pain complaints and, further, that Taylor\u2019s pain complaints were abnormal and that his subjective complaints were out of line with the objective medical findings. Nonetheless, Taylor argues that the medical testimony regarding his injuries was \u201cunrefuted\u201d and should not be disregarded based on the testimony of Larain and Beebe. However, in its order supplementing findings of fact and otherwise denying claimant\u2019s post-trial motions, the court noted that \u201cthere is nothing in the medical evidence to indicate an acute injury as opposed to long term degeneration, or, other than Taylor\u2019s own report, to prove that his back problems stemmed from an industrial accident.\u201d Further, the court noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-5\">Significantly, claimant testified about cuts and scratches he had when he went to the hospital on March 4th, even mentioning a \u201cpretty good nick on the side of my head or maybe in my jaw area.\u201d (Tr. II at 112.) His complaints of hip pain changed from the left side on March 4, to the right side on March 11th. He insisted on hospitalization and claimed he could not perform ordinary tasks of daily living. Yet, the medical records and testimony of the physicians who examined him show that they did not see any objective evidence of any injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Thus, even without Beebe\u2019s and Larain\u2019s testimony there is evidence in the record which casts doubt on Taylor\u2019s claims of industrial injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">According to Taylor, both Larain\u2019s and Beebe\u2019s testimony should be disregarded because Larain and Beebe, who were friends with one another and acquaintances of Taylor\u2019s, had a motive to testify against Taylor because of a dispute regarding some money Taylor allegedly took from Beebe. Taylor asserts that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court erred in finding that Larain\u2019s and Beebe\u2019s testimony was credible. However, this Court will not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court on questions of witness credibility when substantial credible evidence supports the trial court\u2019s deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>mination. <em>Wilson, </em>903 P.2d at 787. Here, the findings of fact and the record reflect that the court could have found these witnesses to be truthful in some areas of their testimony and untruthful in others. The trial court was in the best position to judge the credibility and demeanor of the witnesses while testifying. Where there is conflicting evidence in the record, it is within the provence of the trial court to pass on the credibility of witnesses and the sufficiency of the evidence. <em>Wilson, </em>903 P.2d at 787-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Beebe stated that, following the March 4, 1991 injury, he saw Taylor working on his car and replacing the drive line. Beebe testified that the parts weighed between seventy and eighty pounds and that Taylor worked at this heavy labor for over four hours. Taylor testified that the part weighed approximately twenty pounds and that he would have completed the job much more quickly but for his injuries. Larain testified that Taylor was very interested in, and asked questions about, her own workers\u2019 compensation claim and confided in her that his claims were fraudulent. Taylor denies that he made any such admissions to Larain.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">The findings reflect Taylor\u2019s inconsistent explanations of how the March 4,1991 incident occurred. For example, Taylor\u2019s ex-wife testified that Taylor told her that he had injured his back operating a j ack-hammer. Larain testified that Taylor told her that he had tripped over some road cones, and Beebe testified that Taylor told him that he slipped on some road oil and fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">As to Taylor\u2019s own testimony, the court found that \u201cclaimant has made as great a negative impression on me as any witness I have observed during the last two years. Listening to him and observing him, I simply did not believe him and concluded that he was perpetuating a fraudulent scheme.\u201d In its order supplementing findings of fact and otherwise denying claimant\u2019s post-trial motions, the court also noted that \u201cTaylor\u2019s confident, forceful testimony at trial stood in stark contrast to the complaining, depressed, non-functional individual who appears in the many medical and psychological records presented in this case. ... He had a smooth answer for everything presented against him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court findings also reflect evidence and testimony showing that Taylor had been reprimanded at work and placed on probation for his performance, had a problem with alcohol abuse, had received citations for DUI\u2019s, was in \u201csevere financial straits,\u201d was having his wages attached by creditors, and owed both the Internal Revenue Service and the State of Montana for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>unpaid taxes. Taylor maintains that, regardless of his financial situation and job performance, he did indeed suffer industrial injuries. Our standard, however, is not whether the evidence supports findings different than those made by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, but whether substantial credible evidence supports the court\u2019s findings. <em>Wilson, </em>903 P.2d at 787 (citing <em>Caekaert v. State Compensation Mut. Ins. Fund </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 105, 110, 885 P.2d 495, 498). In the instant case, we conclude that substantial credible evidence in the record supports the findings of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court that two of Taylor\u2019s three claims were fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">2. Did the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court err when it failed to find that the insurer\u2019s conduct was unreasonable and in failing to award Taylor his attorney\u2019s fees, costs, and the statutory penalty?</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Although the court found that two of Taylor\u2019s three claims were fraudulent, Taylor nonetheless asks this Court to find State Fund\u2019s conduct unreasonable under \u00a7 39-71-611, MCA, and award the twenty-percent statutory penalty against State Fund pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-2907, MCA. Reasonableness is a question of fact. <em>Stordalen v. Ricci\u2019s Food Farm </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 256, 258, 862 P.2d 393, 394. We must determine whether substantial credible evidence supports the court\u2019s finding that State Fund\u2019s actions were reasonable and that Taylor was not entitled to the statutory penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">The statutory penalty set forth in \u00a7 39-71-2907, MCA, was not intended to eliminate an insurer\u2019s assertion of a legitimate defense to liability. <em>Paulson v. Bozeman Deaconess Found. Hosp. </em>(1984), 207 Mont. 440, 444, 673 P.2d 1281, 1283. Here, State Fund pled and proved the nine elements of fraud in defending its decision to terminate Taylor\u2019s benefits. Further, the court determined that State Fund\u2019s actions were not unreasonable and that Taylor was not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees or the statutory penalty. As is illustrated by the court\u2019s findings that two of Taylor\u2019s three claims were fraudulent, substantial credible evidence supports the court\u2019s finding that State Fund\u2019s actions in terminating Taylor\u2019s benefits were reasonable. Accordingly, we conclude that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court did not err in failing to award attorney\u2019s fees, costs, or the statutory penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b464-8\">JUSTICES NELSON, GRAY and ERDMANN concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b464-9\">JUSTICE HUNT</author>\n<p id=\"Amt\">specially concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">I concur in the conclusions reached by the majority but do not agree with all that is said in the opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
