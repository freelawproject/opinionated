We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in denying Roberts\u2019 motion to dismiss the escape charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">Roberts was an inmate at the Montana State Prison (MSP) in Deer Lodge, Montana. On January 26, 1994, the Montana Board of Pardons (Board) granted Roberts parole subject to the usual parole conditions and certain special conditions. One of the special conditions was a Board recommendation that Roberts obtain a 10-day furlough to find housing and employment. Roberts subsequently submitted a furlough request/permit form which was approved on February 4, 1994. The furlough program rules required Roberts to meet with parole officer Dave Weaver (Weaver) on specified dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">Roberts left the MSP on February 7,1994. He met with Weaver as scheduled on February 8. Weaver went to Roberts\u2019 wife\u2019s residence on February 10 for another scheduled meeting with Roberts, but Roberts failed to attend the meeting. Weaver left a message for Roberts to contact him; Roberts did not do so. On February 14, 1994, Weaver issued an arrest warrant and notified the MSP of Roberts\u2019 escape. Roberts was arrested in Pablo, Montana, on February 17, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-12\">The State of Montana (State) charged Roberts by information with felony escape under \u00a7 45-7-306, MCA. The information alleged that, on or about February 10, 1994, Roberts was an \u201cinmate subject to official detention ... temporarily released on work furlough ... [and] removed himself from official detention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-13\">Roberts moved to dismiss the charge. He argued that he was not subject to \u201cofficial detention\u201d during his furlough, as that term is defined in \u00a7 45-7-306(1), MCA, and, therefore, that he could not commit the offense of escape as defined in \u00a7 45-7-306(2), MCA. More particularly, he argued that he was a \u201cparole violator\u201d when he failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>to report to Weaver and that the statutory definition of \u201cofficial detention,\u201d by its terms, does not include supervision of probation or parole. The State contended that Roberts was being supervised while under a supervised release program, one of the statutory definitions of \u201cofficial detention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">The District Court determined that Roberts\u2019 furlough was approved in order for him to seek employment after he was paroled and, therefore, that he was not yet on parole during the furlough. On that basis, the court denied Roberts\u2019 motion. A jury subsequently found Roberts guilty of the charged offense and the District Court sentenced him and entered judgment. Roberts appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Did the District Court err in denying Roberts\u2019 motion to dismiss the escape charge?</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">The District Court\u2019s denial of Roberts\u2019 motion implicitly concluded that the State could prosecute Roberts for escape pursuant to \u00a7 45-7-306(2), MCA, because he was subject to official detention \u2014 by virtue of being on a supervised release program \u2014 at the time he failed to meet with Weaver. We review a district court\u2019s conclusion of law to determine whether it is correct. <em>State v. Mantz </em>(1994), 269 Mont. 135, 137, 887 P.2d 251, 253 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">In interpreting a statute, \u201cthe office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d Section 1-2-101, MCA. The intention of the legislature must be pursued. Section 1-2-102, MCA. If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, it requires no further interpretation; we will not resort to legislative history or other means of interpretation unless the legislative intent cannot be determined from the plain words of the statute. <em>Clarke v. Massey </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 412, 416, 897 P.2d 1085, 1088 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Insofar as is relevant here, an escape charge can be maintained only against a person \u201csubject to official detention.\u201d Section 45-7-306(2), MCA. The Montana legislature has defined \u201cofficial detention,\u201d in part, as \u201csupervision while under a supervised release program.\u201d Section 45-7-306(1), MCA. The State equates the furlough program in which Roberts was participating to the \u201csupervised release program\u201d referenced in \u00a7 45-7-306(1), MCA. On that basis, it contends that Roberts was subject to official detention while on furlough and, therefore, that he was properly prosecuted for felony escape. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>The only \u201csupervised release program\u201d addressed by statute in Montana is codified in \u00a7\u00a7 46-23-401 through 46-23-426, MCA. The legislature did not define with any specificity in these statutes the supervised release program it contemplated. Instead, it directed the Department of Corrections to establish the supervised release program and to promulgate administrative rules to implement it. Section 46-23-405, MCA. The legislature did require, however, that prisoners in the supervised release program participate \u201cin a recognized educational, treatment, or training program or work program.\u201d Section 46-23-405(2), MCA. Prisoners are eligible for the program 24 months before they are eligible for parole. Section 46-23-411(1), MCA. Applications for the supervised release program are approved or denied by the Board after \u201ca hearing consistent with the procedural rules adopted by it for parole hearings....\u201d Section 46-23-412, MCA. Section 46-23-426, MCA, specifically provides that a prisoner convicted of escape from a supervised release program is punishable pursuant to \u00a7 45-7-306, MCA. Not a single reference to \u201cfurloughs\u201d is contained in the supervised release program statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The administrative rules establishing and implementing the supervised release program set out the requirements of the program in more detail. A prisoner applying for acceptance into the supervised release program must enter into a contract with a sponsor stating the terms of the supervised release and establishing a supervised release plan. Section 20.7.103, ARM. The prisoner also is required to submit a favorable psychological evaluation and establish that he has been accepted into an approved treatment or training program. Section 20.7.102(4X5), ARM.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The only statutory reference to a \u201cfurlough\u201d is contained in the statutes governing parole. Section 46-23-215(3), MCA, which is captioned \u201c[cjonditions of parole,\u201d specifically provides that, when an MSP prisoner has been approved for parole on condition that employment or suitable living arrangements be obtained, the prisoner may be granted a furlough not to exceed 10 days for purposes of fulfilling the condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">We conclude that term \u201csupervised release program\u201d contained in \u00a7 45-7-306(1), MCA, clearly and unambiguously refers to the supervised release program codified in \u00a7\u00a7 46-23-401 through 46-23-426, MCA, and not to the furlough associated with parole proceedings under \u00a7 46-23-215, MCA. To conclude otherwise would require us to delete the word furlough from \u00a7 46-23-215, MCA, and insert it into the supervised release program statutes. Our role in interpreting statutes does not permit us to do so. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>The State contends that the legislature\u2019s intent vis-a-vis the relationship between furloughs and the supervised release program can be determined only by examining legislative history. We have concluded, however, that the \u201csupervised release program\u201d referenced in \u00a7 45-7-306(1), MCA, clearly and unambiguously means the supervised release program addressed in \u00a7\u00a7 46-23-401 through 46-23-426, MCA, which does not encompass furloughs. Thus, we may not resort to other means of interpretation. <em>Clarke, </em>897 P.2d at 1088.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">In the present case, it is clear that Roberts was released from the MSP into the parole-related furlough program and not into the supervised release program. Roberts appeared before the Board seeking parole; he did not appear as an applicant for the supervised release program which required him to participate in a recognized educational, treatment, or training program or work program. He did not enter into a contract with a sponsor or meet the other requirements of the administrative rules governing the supervised release program. His hearing was conducted pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-202(2),-MCA, and the Board\u2019s case disposition form specifically states that it constitutes notice \u201cof the Montana State Board of Pardons decision in your parole consideration, in accordance with sections 46-23-201 through 46-23-218, MCA.\u201d Indeed, Roberts was \u201cgranted parole\u201d subject to certain conditions and the Board\u2019s recommendation of a 10-day furlough. Neither the procedural nor the substantive requirements of the supervised release program were applied at any phase of the proceedings which resulted in Roberts\u2019 10-day furlough from the MSP. Roberts\u2019furlough was granted pursuant to \u00a7 46-23-215(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">We conclude that Roberts was not being supervised under a \u201csupervised release program\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 45-7-306(1), MCA. Having rejected the sole basis under which the State asserted that Roberts was \u201csubject to official detention\u201d for proposes of the escape charge, it is not necessary to determine whether Roberts was technically \u201con parole\u201d for purposes of excluding him from \u201cofficial detention\u201d pursuant to the \u201csupervision of probation or parole\u201d exclusion in \u00a7 45-7-306(1), MCA. We hold that the District Court erred in concluding that Roberts could be prosecuted for the offense of escape pursuant to \u00a7 45-7-306(2), MCA, and in denying Roberts\u2019 motion to dismiss the escape charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">Reversed and remanded with instructions to enter an order of dismissal.</p>\n<judges id=\"b393-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, TRIEWEILER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
