Tucker, and a cross-appeal from the District Court\u2019s exclusion of evidence and giving of jury instructions. We reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">1. Did the District Court err in ordering a new trial on the issue of punitive damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">2. Did the District Court err in ordering a new trial on the issue of compensatory damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b256-12\">3. Did the District Court err in excluding evidence of events other than the accident that could have lead to Maurer\u2019s depression?</p>\n<p id=\"b256-13\">4. Did the District Court err in denying a new trial on the issue of punitive damages because evidence of Clausen\u2019s employees\u2019 work-related convictions for driving under the influence (DUIs) was excluded?</p>\n<p id=\"b256-14\">5. Did the District Court err in denying a new trial because instructions were given to the jury on Clausen\u2019s vicarious liability for punitive damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b256-15\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b256-16\">Michael Tucker was a salesperson for Clausen Distributing Co., a Helena beverage and bar supply wholesaler and distributor. On November 25, 1991, Tucker was returning from his Townsend sales route when he ran into the rear of a Montana Highway Patrol vehicle parked on the side of the highway. David Maurer, a motorist who had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>been stopped by the patrolman, was sitting in the front passenger seat of the patrol car and was injured when he was thrown to the floor of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-3\">Tucker pled guilty to a charge of driving while under the influence of alcohol. His blood alcohol content over an hour after the accident was .17 percent. Defendants Clausen and Tucker admitted liability for the accident and a trial was held to award compensatory damages and determine liability for punitive damages. At trial, Tucker testified that he drank five or six beers that day while he was servicing his Townsend customers. Clausen\u2019s policy permitted salespersons to use their discretion in consuming alcohol while working. Clausen did not amend this policy as it pertained to Tucker, even though Clausen was aware that Tucker had received two citations for DUIs prior to this accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">As a result of the accident, Maurer suffered pain in his neck and back which he alleged prevented him from performing duties essential to running a ranch. Maurer became severely depressed, quit the family ranch, and moved from Montana. Clausen and Tucker attempted to introduce evidence of non-related felony charges against Maurer which could have caused his depression and disrupted his established course of life. The District Court did not allow the evidence because of its prejudicial effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">Clausen also attempted to introduce evidence that no Clausen driver had, until this accident, received a DUI while working. The District Court excluded this evidence, finding it was not relevant to the issue of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">At the proposal of jury instructions, the District Court ruled that a pattern instruction on vicarious liability would be given. Clausen objected to the giving of this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">The jury awarded $1,000,000 in punitive damages against Clausen and $75,000 in punitive damages against Tucker. Clausen filed a motion for a new trial and the District Court concluded that the jury\u2019s awards for punitive damages were based on passion and prejudice and exceeded the amount necessary to punish Clausen and Tucker. Accordingly, the District Court ordered a new trial on the determination of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">The jury also awarded Maurer $570,349 in actual damages, $500,000 of which was for loss of established course of life, and $50,000 for pain and suffering. Maurer had requested $90,000 for loss of established course of life. Although requested by Maurer, the jury did not award any damages for loss of earnings or loss of earning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>capacity. The District Court concluded that the jury\u2019s award for compensatory damages was excessive and granted a new trial on the issue of compensatory damages as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\">Maurer appeals the District Court\u2019s granting of a new trial on the issues of punitive and compensatory damages. Clausen and Tucker cross-appeal the District Court\u2019s evidentiary and legal rulings relevant to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Did the District Court err in ordering a new trial on the issue of punitive damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">The District Court vacated the jury\u2019s award for punitive damages of $1,000,000 against Clausen and $75,000 against Tucker. The District Court ordered a new trial because it concluded that these awards were excessive. This Court will not disturb a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny a new trial absent a manifest abuse of discretion. <em>Baxter v. Archie Cochrane Motors, </em>Inc. (1995), 271 Mont. 286, 287-88, 895 P.2d 631, 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">Section 25-11-102(5), MCA, provides that a district court may vacate a jury\u2019s verdict and grant a new trial when the jury\u2019s award of damages is excessive and appears to have been given under the influence of passion or prejudice. As required by \u00a7 27-l-221(7)(c), MCA, the District Court reviewed the jury\u2019s verdict and considered the factors set forth in subsection (7)(b). Those factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-9\">(i) the nature and reprehensibility of the defendant\u2019s wrongdoing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-10\">(ii) the extent of the defendant\u2019s wrongdoing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-11\">(iii) the intent of the defendant in committing the wrong;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-12\">(iv) the profitability of the defendant\u2019s wrongdoing, if applicable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-13\">(v) the amount of actual damages awarded by the jury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-14\">(vi) the defendant\u2019s net worth;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-15\">(ix) any other circumstances that may operate to increase or reduce, without wholly defeating, punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-16\">The court found that Clausen had a net worth of $944,534 in 1993 and taxable income of $31,662 (average for 1990 to 1993). The court found that Tucker had no evidence of net worth but that he had been rehired by Clausen at a yearly salary of $27,000. Based on those findings, the court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Although an award of punitive damages was proper in this case, it appears that the award was the result of passion or prejudice. Passion and prejudice can, of course, be strong when drinking and driving result in an accident. The significant factor here, however, is the excessive amount of the award.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-4\">There was no evidence regarding Tucker\u2019s net worth. The award against him was almost three times his annual salary. While Tucker\u2019s conduct was certainly reprehensible and should in no way be condoned, the amount awarded exceeds the amount necessary to punish him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-5\">The amount awarded against Clausen Distributing exceeded the company\u2019s net worth. The award must be sufficient to get the company\u2019s attention, but in this case, the award exceeds the amount necessary to adequately punish this Defendant and to serve as an example to it and others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">A review of the record reveals that the punitive damages assessed against Clausen were not excessive when compared to Clausen\u2019s overall financial condition. Section 27-l-221(7)(a), MCA, states that \u201c[i]n the separate proceeding to determine the amount of punitive damages to be awarded, the defendant\u2019s financial affairs, financial condition, and net worth must be considered.\u201d We note that Clausen declared taxable income of $0 to $49,000 between 1990 and 1993, even though its yearly sales were between $3,400,000 to $4,600,000. Actually, Clausen had a policy of retaining profits within the corporation. Clausen\u2019s general manager testified that Clausen\u2019s yearly retained profits averaged between $850,000 and $1,000,000. In addition, Clausen kept $300,000 to $400,000 in cash on hand for expenditures. Clausen\u2019s balance sheet valued many of the company\u2019s assets at their historic cost when purchased up to thirty-five years ago. Testimony was presented that at this time the warehouse alone is worth between $550,000 and $800,000. Nevertheless, the District Court failed to consider the appreciation of these assets, as well as Clausen\u2019s policy of retaining profits, which resulted in a decrease of the company\u2019s taxable income.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Tucker\u2019s financial condition was also valued improperly by the District Court. After noting there was no evidence of Tucker\u2019s net worth, the District Court concluded that Tucker\u2019s salary did not support an award of punitive damages in the amount of $75,000. In <em>Gurnsey v. Conklin Co., Inc. </em>(1988), 230 Mont. 42, 55, 751 P.2d 151, 158, we stated a plaintiff is not required to show proof that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>defendant\u2019s net worth supports an award of punitive damages. If the defendant\u2019s net worth does not support an award of punitive damages, the defendant must produce evidence to that fact. <em>Gurnsey, </em>751 P.2d at 158. Tucker should not gain an advantage from failing to produce evidence of his net worth. Accordingly, there was no evidence that Tucker\u2019s net worth could not support a punitive damage award of $75,000, and so, the District Court erred in vacating the jury\u2019s award of punitive damages against Tucker.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">For these reasons, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s order for a new trial on the issue of punitive damages was a manifest abuse of discretion, and therefore, reverse the District Court on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Did the District Court err in ordering a new trial on the issue of compensatory damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The issue of damages was submitted to the jury on a line item verdict form. Maurer asked the jury to return a verdict of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-8\">Past medical expenses $ 12,598.80</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A09\">Future medical expenses 20,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmG\">Out-of-pocket expenses 440.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyC\">Pain and suffering 65.520.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5V\">Loss of established course of life 90,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4K\">Loss of earnings 35.642.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AG9\">Loss of earning capacity 2,241,761.00</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQR\">The jury returned a verdict of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Amh\">Past medical expenses $ 12,598.80</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7j\">Future medical expenses 7,310.50</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlD\">Out-of-pocket expenses 440.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1x\">Pain and suffering 50,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANs\">Loss of established course of life 500,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqC\">Loss of earnings -0-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZC\">Loss of earning capacity -0-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-24\">The District Court noted that the jury\u2019s award for loss of established course of life was more than five times the amount requested by Maurer. On these facts, the court concluded that an award of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>$500,000 for loss of established course of life was excessive and appeared to have been given under the influence of passion or prejudice. Accordingly, the court ordered a new trial on compensatory damages pursuant to \u00a7 25-11-102(5), MCA. We will review the court\u2019s decision to grant a new trial to determine if the court abused its discretion. <em>See Baxter, </em>895 P.2d at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Maurer attempts to justify the jury\u2019s award for his loss of established course of life by pointing to the fact the jury awarded less compensation as a whole than was requested. This justification is fallacious. The jury\u2019s award for Maurer\u2019s loss of established course of life cannot be considered as damages to offset the jury\u2019s refusal to award damages for Maurer\u2019s loss of earnings and earning capacity. On the contrary, the jury found that Maurer suffered no loss of earning capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Maurer produced evidence to support an award of $90,000 for loss of established course of life. Instead, the jury awarded $500,000. Unreasonable damages cannot be recovered. Section 27-1-302, MCA. Thus, an award must be reduced when it substantially exceeds that which the evidence can sustain. <em>Safeco Ins. Co. v. Ellinghouse </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 239, 254, 725 P.2d 217, 226. The record does not support the jury\u2019s award of $500,000 for loss of established course of life. Therefore, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in ordering a new trial for compensatory damages on this issue and we affirm that portion of the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Did the District Court err in excluding evidence of events other than the accident that could have lead to Maurer\u2019s depression?</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">During trial, Maurer produced evidence that after the car accident he was depressed. This depression lead Maurer to leave the family ranch and contributed to his \u201ccourse of life\u201d damages. Clausen and Tucker attempted to introduce evidence that Maurer became depressed and left the ranch because of other reasons. Specifically, an event occurred in August 1990 where Maurer\u2019s former girlfriend\u2019s neck was broken during an altercation with him and which resulted in her being rendered quadriplegic (the Miller incident). In December 1990, she filed a civil suit against him which was settled in August 1991. In addition, Maurer was criminally charged with aggravated assault, a felony. Following a jury trial he was acquitted from the felony charge in January 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Maurer claims the evidence was inadmissible because the defendants offered no proof linking Maurer\u2019s psychological condition with the Miller incident and that the defendants merely wanted to ask a highly prejudicial question. The defendants counter that the incident\u2019s link to Maurer\u2019s depression was self-evident and that the jury could consider the evidence from a common sense viewpoint. The District Court acknowledged the significant stress of the incident and its resulting criminal charges. Nevertheless, the court excluded the evidence because of its prejudicial nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Rule 403, M.R.Evid. The decision whether or not to exclude such evidence will not be reversed by this Court unless the district court has abused its discretion. <em>Newville v. </em>State, <em>Dept. of Family Svcs. </em>(1994), 267 Mont. 237, 260, 883 P.2d 793, 806 (citing <em>Kimes v. Herrin </em>(1985), 217 Mont. 330, 333, 705 P.2d 108, 110).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">We conclude that the Miller incident was certainly a stress provoking event which may have contributed to Maurer\u2019s depression and its probative value was not substantially outweighed by its prejudicial nature. We further conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in excluding evidence of the Miller incident for that reason. The jury should have been given the opportunity to determine to what degree, if any, the stress from the Miller incident contributed to Maurer\u2019s loss of established course of life. <em>See </em>\u00a7 26-1-202, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The defendants intended to introduce evidence of the Miller incident during cross-examination of Maurer and his witnesses in order to rebut evidence that Maurer was depressed as a result of his injury. Before this rebuttal could be admitted, the defendants must have produced testimony to the fact that the Miller incident contributed to Maurer\u2019s depression and his leaving the ranch.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-7\">[W]hen the admissibility of evidence depends upon proof of other connecting facts, the court may admit such evidence subject to the condition that further evidence be introduced sufficient to support a finding of those connecting facts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Rule 104(b), M.R.Evid. In <em>Kimes </em>and <em>Newville, </em>we'held that evidence of an event which may have contributed to an injury is not admissible unless the evidence establishes a causal connection between the event and the injury. <em>Newville, 883 </em>P.2d at 806; <em>Kimes, </em>705 P.2d at 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">As we are remanding this case to the District Court for a new trial on compensatory damages for loss of established course of life, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>District Court should admit evidence of the Miller incident if such evidence is offered and the proper foundation has been laid.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">ISSUE 4</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Did the District Court err in denying a new trial on the issue of punitive damages because evidence of Clausen\u2019s employees\u2019 work-related DUI convictions was excluded?</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">At trial, the defendants\u2019 counsel asked Clausen Distributing\u2019s general manager the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-7\">During that period of time until Mr. Tucker\u2019s work-related DUI, how many other DUIs have your employees had that were work related?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Akn\">The District Court sustained Maurer\u2019s objection to the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">On the defendants\u2019 motion for new trial, the District Court reviewed its ruling and concluded that evidence of whether any of the employees of Clausen Distributing had ever had a work-related DUI was irrelevant. We will review the District Court\u2019s denial of a new trial for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Baxter, </em>895 P.2d at 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">The defendants assert that prior to Tucker\u2019s accident there were no work-related DUIs among Clausen\u2019s employees. The defendants claim that evidence to this fact would vindicate Clausen\u2019s policy of tolerating drinking on the job and would therefore be relevant to whether punitive damages should be assessed against Clausen. The court, however, found that the jury\u2019s award for punitive damages was based on Clausen\u2019s conduct in placing Tucker in a position where he was permitted to drink and drive despite Clausen\u2019s knowledge of Tucker\u2019s two previous DUIs. We have stated that evidence is irrelevant when it does not tend to make any requisite factors for punitive damages more or less probable. <em>Derenberger v. Lutey </em>(1983), 207 Mont. 1, 11, 674 P.2d 485, 489. Accordingly, the DUI records are irrelevant because they do not tend to disprove the egregiousness of Clausen\u2019s conduct for which the jury assessed an award of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-11\">We therefore conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying a new trial for admissibility of evidence and hold that the District Court did not err in denying a new trial on the issue of punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">ISSUE 5</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">Did the District Court err in denying a new trial because instructions were given to the jury on Clausen\u2019s vicarious liability for punitive damages?</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>The District Court instructed the jury on vicarious liability. Clausen contends that the pattern instruction given was not intended for punitive damage actions and was thus not appropriate in this case. On a motion for new trial, the court concluded that the instruction was a correct statement of Montana law and giving it was not grounds for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">The jury returned a verdict against Clausen finding that Clausen should \u201cbe assessed punitive damages as a result of its conduct.\u201d Clausen\u2019s argument that the jury instruction was not appropriate is moot because the jury found Clausen liable for punitive damages based on its own conduct under \u00a7 27-1-221, MCA, rather than under a vicarious liability theory. In seeking review of an instruction, the party claiming error must show prejudice in order to prevail. <em>Hall v. Big Sky Lumber &amp; Supply, Inc. </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 328, 332, 863 P.2d 389, 392 (citing <em>Walden v. State </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 132, 818 P.2d 1190). In this case, Clausen was not prejudiced by the court\u2019s instruction because the jury did not assess damages against Clausen for Tucker\u2019s conduct but for its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">We will not overturn the court\u2019s denial of a new trial absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Baxter, </em>895 P.2d at 632. We conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion, and therefore, did not err in denying a new trial because the appropriateness of the instruction was a moot point.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">In summary, we reverse the District Court\u2019s grant of a new trial on the issue of punitive damages, and we affirm the District Court\u2019s grant of a new trial on the issue of compensatory damages for loss of established course of life. We also affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of a new trial on the issues of employee work-related convictions and jury instructions. On remand to the District Court for new trial, we direct the court to admit evidence of the Miller incident so long as the proper foundation has been laid.</p>\n<judges id=\"b264-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, HUNT and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">Respondents Clausen Distributing Co. and Michael A. Tucker request that we rehear our decision of February 8, 1996, reversing the District Court\u2019s order for a new trial on punitive damages. Pursuant to Rule 34, M.R.App.P.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-10\">[a] petition for rehearing may be presented upon the following grounds and none other: That some fact, material to the decision, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>or some question decisive of the case submitted by counsel, was overlooked by the court, or that the decision is in conflict with an express statute or controlling decision to which the attention of the court was not directed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Respondents contend a rehearing is appropriate because our attention was not directed to \u00a7 27-1-22 l(7)(b)(v), MCA, which conflicts with our decision. Respondents claim our decision is in error because we affirmed the District Court\u2019s grant of a new trial on actual damages, and therefore, the amount of those damages could not have been considered in an award of punitive damages as required by \u00a7 27-l-221(7)(b)(v) and (c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">A finding of actual damages, rather than a determined amount, is required for an award of punitive damages. <em>Doll v. Major Muffler Centers, Inc. </em>(1984), 208 Mont. 401, 414, 687 P.2d 48, 55 (citing <em>Lauman v. Lee </em>(1981), 192 Mont. 84, 626 P.2d 830; <em>Miller v. Fox </em>(1977), 174 Mont. 504, 571 P.2d 804.) In the present case, respondents admitted liability, and the jury\u2019s award of $70,439.30 in compensatory damages for past and future medical expenses, out-of-pocket expenses, and pain and suffering was upheld. The only damages left undetermined were for loss of established course of life due to the jury\u2019s award of more than five times that which was requested. In upholding the jury\u2019s award of punitive damages, we directed our attention to \u00a7 27-l-221(7)(b), MCA, and considered all of the factors set forth in that section. We were aware that the amount of compensatory damages in this case would be between $70,439 and something less than $570,439. Under the facts of this case, the punitive damage award was reasonably given the egregiousness of the defendants\u2019 conduct and their overall financial status. Therefore, our decision was not in error and a rehearing on that issue is inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">Respondents also claim an error in fact in what we considered to be their overall financial condition. The last sentence beginning the bottom of page six and the top of page seven of the slip opinion reads \u201cClausen\u2019s general manager testified that Clausen\u2019s yearly retained profits averaged between $850,000 and $1,000,000.\u201d While this language was in error, our decision was based on the understanding that Clausen Distributing Co.\u2019s yearly retained profits were in fact cumulative retained earnings averaging between $850,000 and $1,000,000. We did not assume Clausen Distributing Co. retained that amount of profit from each year\u2019s income. A rehearing on that issue is therefore inappropriate. To correct the erroneous factual statement in the opinion, the sentence will be amended as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Clausen\u2019s general manager testified that Clausen\u2019s cumulative retained profits averaged between $850,000 and $1,000,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that respondent\u2019s petition for rehearing is DENIED.</p>\n<judges id=\"b266-5\">JUSTICE GRAY would grant rehearing on the issue of punitive damages and would deny rehearing on our consideration of Clausen\u2019s financial condition.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
