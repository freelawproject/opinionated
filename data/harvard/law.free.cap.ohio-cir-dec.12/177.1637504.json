Error was claimed in the admission of testimony as to a general custom prevailing among contractors of helping themselves to each other\u2019s material when a small quantity was needed to complete a job.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-17\">The reviewing court holds that while such a custom is unreasonable as a rule of property, and therefore not binding, yet it was competent for the purpose for which it was evidently introduced \u2014 that is, as tending to prove a lack of criminal intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-18\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
