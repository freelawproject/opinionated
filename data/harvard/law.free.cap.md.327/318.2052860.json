Margaret was awarded custody of their two daughters and John was ordered to pay $250 per week toward the girls\u2019 support. Over four years later, an order dated October 7, 1985 increased the amount of John\u2019s obligation for the support of both children to $1400 per month. The circuit court\u2019s order also awarded John certain detailed visitation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">On March 8, 1991, the circuit court\u2019s intercession was again sought to address John\u2019s request to find Margaret in contempt for violating the visitation order as well as Margaret's motion to modify child support. The Honorable Raymond G. Thieme, Jr. presided at that hearing and shortly thereafter entered an order finding that Margaret was not in contempt of court. That order also increased John\u2019s child support obligation for the one daughter who was still a minor from $700 per month to $1550 per month. John then appealed the modification of child support to the Court of Special Appeals. Because of the important issues raised on appeal, this Court granted certiorari before consideration by the intermediate appellate court. While Margaret failed to file an appellee\u2019s brief or respond to John\u2019s oral arguments, both the Maryland Chapter of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers and the Attorney General of Maryland filed amici curiae briefs and presented oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>This dispute requires the Court, for the first time, to address Maryland Code, (1984, 1991 Repl.Vol.) Family Law Article \u00a7\u00a7 12-201 <em>et seq. </em>(the \u201cguidelines\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The General Assembly enacted these guidelines in 1989 to comply with federal law and regulations. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 651-667 (1982 &amp; 1984 Supp. II) and 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 302.56 (1989). The federal mandate required that the guidelines be established and \u201cbased on specific descriptive and numeric criteria and result in a computation of the support obligation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When drafting the guidelines, the Maryland Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee had before it <em>Development of Guidelines For Child Support Orders: Advisory Panel Recommendations and Final Report, </em>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Child Support Enforcement. This report explained that the need for the guidelines was threefold: (1) to \u201cremedy a shortfall in the level of awards\u201d that do not reflect the actual costs of raising children, (2) to \u201cimprove the consistency, and therefore the equity, of child support awards,\u201d and (3) to \u201cimprove the efficiency of court processes for adjudicating child support____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">After considering several different models recommended by the Advisory Panel on Child Support Guidelines, the General Assembly chose to base Maryland\u2019s guidelines on the Income Shares Model. <em>See </em>Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, <em>Bill Analysis, </em>Senate Bill 49 (1989). The conceptual underpinning of this model is that a child should receive the same proportion of parental income, and thereby enjoy the standard of living, he or she would have experienced had the child\u2019s parents remained together. <em>Id. see also </em>Robert G. Williams, \u201cChild Support Guidelines: Economic Basis and Analysis of Alternative Approaches,\u201d <em>Improving Child Support Practice </em>1-12 to 1-13 (A.B.A.1986). Accordingly, the model establishes child support obligations based on estimates of the percentage of income that parents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>in an intact household typically spend on their children. <em>Id. </em>Consistent with this model, the legislature constructed the schedule in \u00a7 12-204(e), which sets forth the basic child support obligation for any given number of children based on combined parental income.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Following the Income Shares Model, Maryland\u2019s guidelines first require that the trial judge determine each parent\u2019s monthly \u201cadjusted actual income.\u201d Section 12-201(d) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">\u201c \u2018Adjusted actual income\u2019 means actual income minus:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">(1) preexisting reasonable child support obligations actually paid;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">(2) except as provided in \u00a7 12-204(a)(2) of this subtitle, alimony or maintenance obligations actually paid; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">(3) the actual cost of providing health insurance coverage for a child for whom the parents are jointly and severally responsible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">After determining each parent\u2019s monthly \u201cadjusted actual income,\u201d the judge then adds these two amounts together to arrive at the monthly \u201ccombined adjusted actual income\u201d of the parents. <em>See </em>\u00a7 12-201(e). Having calculated the combined adjusted actual income of the parents, the judge can then determine whether that figure falls within the range of incomes found in the schedule of \u00a7 12-204(e). If the figure is within the schedule, the judge then locates the corresponding \u201cbasic child support obligation\u201d for the given number of children. Where the monthly income falls between two amounts set forth in the schedule, \u00a7 12-204(c) dictates that the basic child support obligation is the same as the obligation specified for the next highest income level. The judge then divides this basic child support obligation between the parents in proportion to each of their adjusted actual incomes. \u00a7 12-204(a). The judge must then add together any work-related child care expenses, extraordinary medical expenses, and school and transportation expenses and allocate this total between the parents in proportion to their adjusted actual incomes. \u00a7 12-204(g)-(i)- The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>amount of child support computed in this manner<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is presumed to be correct, although this presumption may be rebutted by evidence that such amount would be unjust and inappropriate in a particular case. \u00a7 12-202(a)(2). In the instant case, evidence was presented at the March 8, 1991 hearing that John now earns $145,000 per year, while Margaret\u2019s annual income is $30,000. John does not contend that his actual income should be reduced by any expenses identified in \u00a7 12-201(d). Therefore, he computes a \u201ccombined adjusted actual income\u201d of $175,000 a year or $14,583 per month in his argument to this Court. This combined income exceeds $10,000 per month, which is the highest income provided for in \u00a7 12-204(e). The legislature addressed this situation in \u00a7 12-204(d), which says: \u201cIf the combined adjusted actual income exceeds the highest level, specified in the schedule in subsection (e) of this section, the court may use its discretion in setting the amount of child support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">While John\u2019s primary contention is that Judge Thieme abused his discretion in setting the monthly obligation at $1550, he first argues that the judge could not modify the amount of child support without making a threshold finding that there was a \u201cmaterial change of circumstance.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 12-104(a). At the hearing before Judge Thieme, John\u2019s trial counsel never suggested that the parties\u2019 circumstances had not materially changed. In effect, John\u2019s trial counsel admitted that a material change in circumstances existed when she told Judge Thieme, \u201cWe\u2019re not arguing that [Margaret] shouldn\u2019t have an increase.\u201d Moreover, in more than doubling the amount of child sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>port, Judge Thieme implicitly found that a change of circumstances had been shown. <em>See </em>\u00a7 12-202(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">Having disposed of John\u2019s preliminary argument, we now reach his primary contention. John contends that the $1550 monthly child support award is inconsistent with the spirit and intent behind the Income Shares Model, and concludes that Judge Thieme abused his discretion in awarding that amount. John maintains that Judge Thieme accurately found that the parties\u2019 earnings created a ratio of 83 to 17 for John\u2019s and Margaret\u2019s respective percentages of their $175,000 combined annual income. John contends, however, that Judge Thieme erred in the manner in which he applied these percentages to arrive at the amount of $1550 per month for John\u2019s share of the obligation. Judge Thieme examined expense sheets for each of the parties and concluded that the \u201creasonable expenses of the child\u201d were $1873 each month. The judge then calculated 83% of that figure and rounded John\u2019s share of the obligation down to $1550.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">John argues here, as he did below, that a \u201creasonable approach\u201d would have been for the trial judge to assume that the maximum basic child support obligation listed in the schedule is not only applicable to combined monthly incomes of $10,000, but also applies to those in excess of $10,000 per month. Under the schedule in \u00a7 12-204(e), the maximum basic child support obligation of $1040 per month is presumptively correct for parties who have a combined monthly income of $10,000. John argues that $1040 per month should also provide the presumptively correct basic child support obligation for all combined monthly incomes over $10,000. While we believe that $1040 could provide the presumptive <em>minimum </em>basic award for those with combined monthly incomes above $10,000, we do not believe that the legislature intended to cap the basic child support obligation at the upper limit of the schedule. <em>See, e.g., Hinshelwood v. Hinshelwood, </em>564 So.2d 141 (Fla. 5th DCA 1990); <em>In re Marriage of Van Inwegen, </em>757 P.2d 1118, 1120 (Colo.App. 1988). Had the legislature intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>make the highest award in the schedule the presumptive basic support obligation in all cases with combined monthly income over $10,000, it would have so stated and would not have granted the trial judge discretion in fixing those awards. Further, John\u2019s proposed approach creates an artificial ceiling and itself defeats the guidelines\u2019 policy that the child enjoy a standard of living consonant with that he or she would have experienced had the parents remained married. We are unpersuaded by John\u2019s argument that the legislature meant for all children whose parents earn more than $10,000 per month to have the same standard of living as those whose parents earn $10,000 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">Alternatively, John argues that Judge Thieme should have extrapolated from the guidelines to determine what the support obligation would have been had the schedule extended up to the parties\u2019 $14,583 monthly income. John notes that at the upper levels in the guidelines, the basic child support obligation for one child increases by $5 for every $100 rise in combined adjusted actual income.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Extrapolating on that basis, John argues that the basic child support obligation would be $1270 per month ($4583/ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>100 x $5 plus $1040). John also acknowledges that under the guidelines, in addition to the basic child support obligation\u2014whatever that is computed to be, he has an obligation to pay 83% of the additional work-related child care expenses which, in the instant case, are $400 per month. <em>See </em>\u00a7 12-204(g). Taking 83% of the $1270 basic child support obligation plus 83% of the $400 work-related child care expenses, John argues, renders his portion of his daughter\u2019s support to be $1386 per month. Although slightly more generous than his earlier argument, which would leave the judge with no discretion, John\u2019s second contention is essentially that this Court should significantly restrict the judicial discretion granted by \u00a7 12-204(d) and allow judges very little latitude in deviating from the extrapolation method. John asks this Court to hold that Judge Thieme abused his discretion when he set the award $164 higher than the amount computed by John\u2019s strict extrapolation theory. While we believe that the trial judge should consider the underlying policies of the guidelines and strive toward congruous results, we think that Judge Thieme did not abuse his discretion in fixing the amount of this award.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">The legislature has clearly enunciated that the policies of the guidelines are those embodied in the Income Shares Model. John also argues that this model relies on the assumption that the percentage of income expended on children decreases as parental income increases, and therefore the General Assembly could not have intended to permit an award in this case to exceed 10.4% of combined monthly income, the percentage represented by the schedule\u2019s maximum support obligation for one child. The legislative history, however, indicates that the General Assembly did not intend to impose a maximum percentage of income or any similar restraint on the judge\u2019s discretion in setting awards where the parents\u2019 combined adjusted actual income exceeds $10,000 per month. In the hearings on the guidelines, the General Assembly was asked repeatedly to circumscribe the discretion granted in \u00a7 12-204(d). The Fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>Family Law Association of Maryland testified that \u201c[t]he proposed statute leaves families with income above $10,000 a month ($120,000 a year) with absolutely no guidelines,\u201d and suggested that the schedule be amended to provide that \u201cfor family incomes greater than $10,000 per month the basic child support obligation shall be the same percentage of total family income as for income of $10,000 per month [10.4% for one child].\u201d Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, S.B. 49 Bill File (1989). Several members of Family Law Section of the Montgomery County Bar Association testified that \u201c[l]eaving the amount of child support in upper income cases to the discretion of the court will not help us to predict results or settle cases____ We suggest that the table be extended, or that guidelines of some sort be provided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Notwithstanding these pleas, the General Assembly did not change \u00a7 12-204(d) or address any specific comment to these concerns. Rather, it chose to rely on judicial discretion. We agree with the Attorney General\u2019s conclusion in its amicus curiae brief that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alz\">\u201c[i]mplicit in this judgment is the view that at very high income levels, the percentage of income expended on children may not necessarily continue to decline or even remain constant because of the multitude of different options for income expenditure available to the affluent. The legislative judgment was that at such high income levels judicial discretion is better suited than a fixed formula to implement the guidelines\u2019 underlying principle that a child\u2019s standard of living should be altered as little as possible by the dissolution of the family.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">While the legislature specifically rejected the request for more explicit formulae for incomes above the schedule, the general principles from which the schedule was derived should not be ignored. <em>See </em>\u00a7 12-202(a), which provides that \u201cin <em>any </em>proceeding to establish or modify child support ... the court shall use the child support guidelines set forth in this subtitle.\u201d (emphasis added). To effectuate the legislative intent to improve the consistency of child support awards, trial judges should bear in mind the guidelines\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>underlying principles when deciding matters within their discretion. Extrapolation from the schedule may act as a \u201cguide,\u201d but the judge may also exercise his or her own independent discretion<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in balancing</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-4\">\u201cthe best interests and needs of the child with the parents\u2019 financial ability to meet those needs. Factors which should be considered when setting child support include the financial circumstances of the parties, their station in life, their age and physical condition, and expenses in educating the children.\u201d (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-5\"><em>Unkle v. Unkle, </em>305 Md. 587, 597, 505 A.2d 849, 854 (1986). These principles expressed in the pre-guidelines <em>Unkle </em>decision are consistent with the underlying concept that the child\u2019s needs be met as they would have been absent the parents\u2019 divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">While we reject John\u2019s argument that Judge Thieme abused his discretion because he placed too <em>little </em>reliance on John\u2019s suggested mechanical extrapolation from the schedule, we also decline to adopt the position taken by the Maryland Chapter of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers (the AAML) in their amicus curiae brief. The AAML basically argues that Judge Thieme abused his discretion because he placed too <em>much </em>reliance on a mechanical application of the guidelines. The AAML contends that the economic data from which the figures in the schedule were derived did not include empirical evidence of the actual household expenditures for children of high income parents. Because the research and data used in constructing the Income Shares Model did not contemplate these high-range combined parental incomes, the AAML argues, the model provides <em>no </em>assistance in calculating the proper amount of child support. Thus, the AAML concludes, \u201cthe trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>erred when it applied a rigid formula (relative percentage of parents\u2019 income)____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">In support of this conclusion, the AAML points out that the legislature did not include in \u00a7 12-204(d) the phrase which appears in \u00a7 12-204(a)(1), (g)(1), (h), and (i)\u2014\u201cshall be divided between the parents in proportion to their adjusted actual incomes.\u201d While the argument is not expressly articulated, the AAML seems to suggest that Judge Thieme should not have divided the child support obligation in an 83 to 17 ratio. We believe that Judge Thieme acted properly in apportioning the obligation based upon the parties\u2019 respective percentages of their combined adjusted actual income. Moreover this action was consonant with the principle, expressed in the Income Shares Model as well as preguidelines caselaw, that each parent \u201cshare the responsibility for parental support in accordance with their respective financial resources.\u201d <em>Rand v. Rand, </em>280 Md. 508, 517, 374 A.2d 900, 905 (1977). Finally, Judge Thieme did not look only to the parties\u2019 incomes and calculate a particular percentage thereof. Rather, he determined the reasonable needs of the child and then calculated each parent\u2019s proportionate share.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The Court in <em>Rand </em>declined to \u201cmandate any specific formula by which the chancellor is to calculate the amount of support to be charged against each parent\u201d and left to the chancellor\u2019s discretion the manner of assessing financial resources. <em>Id. </em>The legislature has modified Rand\u2019s holding, as \u00a7 12-201 now defines the manner in which the trial judge should determine each party\u2019s \u201cadjusted actual income.\u201d This would seem to be the initial step in <em>any </em>proceeding to establish or modify child support, as the judge must first determine whether the parents\u2019 combined adjusted actual income falls within, above, or below the schedule range. Although \u00a7 12-204(d) itself does not contain specific language requiring that the judge divide the child support obligation \u201cbetween the parents in proportion to their adjusted actual incomes,\u201d this principle certainly underlies the Income Shares Model. Consequently, we be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>lieve that Judge Thieme properly calculated the support obligation and divided it between the parties in proportion to their incomes.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">In <em>Rand </em>and other cases decided before the enactment of the guidelines, the determination or modification of a child support award was left to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Rand, </em>280 Md. at 517, 374 A.2d at 905. As quoted from <em>Unkle </em>above, courts were to balance the best interests and needs of the child with the parents\u2019 ability to satisfy those needs, and to make awards based on the circumstances of each individual case. <em>Unkle, </em>305 Md. at 597, 505 A.2d at 854. Referring to alimony or child support in preguidelines cases, this Court had repeatedly said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvC\">\u201c \u2018 \u201c[i]n making such an award the court can only use judicial discretion. <em>Of course, there is no special statute or rule governing this discretion. </em>It must be exercised to the necessary end of awarding justice and based upon reason and law.\u201d \u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-6\"><em>Bowis v. Bowis, </em>259 Md. 41, 44, 267 A.2d 84, 86 (1970) (quoting <em>Burton v. Burton, </em>253 Md. 233, 237, 252 A.2d 472, 473 (1969), in turn quoting <em>Waters v. Waters, </em>191 Md. 436, 440-41, 62 A.2d 250, 253 (1948)). We do not believe that the legislature intended that the schedule in \u00a7 12-204(e) \u201cgovern\u201d a judge\u2019s discretion by dictating a cap or mechanical extrapolation. However, we also do not believe that the legislature intended that the principles from which the schedule was derived should be ignored when a judge exercises discretion under \u00a7 12-204(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">While awards made under \u00a7 12-204(d) will be disturbed only if there is a clear abuse of discretion, a reviewing court must also be mindful that the federal call for child support guidelines was motivated in part by the need to improve the consistency of awards. Thus, the trial judge has somewhat more latitude than that argued by John, but not the unguided discretion of pre-guidelines cases as advocated by the AAML. Rather, we agree with the Attorney General\u2019s position that the guidelines do establish a rebut-table presumption that the maximum support award under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>the schedule is the minimum which should be awarded in cases above the schedule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Beyond this the trial judge should examine the needs of the child in light of the parents\u2019 resources and determine the amount of support necessary to ensure that the child\u2019s standard of living does not suffer because of the parents\u2019 separation. Further, the judge should give some consideration to the Income Shares method of apportioning the child support obligation. Consequently, we conclude that Judge Thieme properly exercised his discretion in receiving evidence of the parents\u2019 financial circumstances, considering the needs of the child, and then apportioning the \u201creasonable expenses of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Finally John contends that, even if Judge Thieme did not abuse his discretion in the manner in which he set the award, the evidence upon which he based the award was legally insufficient. This Court addressed a similar argument in <em>Rothschild v. Strauss, </em>257 Md. 396, 263 A.2d 511 (1970). The father there argued \u201cthat \u2018the Chancellor did not base his award on any substantial evidence in the record,\u2019 the mother having supplied, so the father says, \u2018boxcar figures\u2019 as to the monthly needs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 398, 263 A.2d at 512. The Court said that the short answer to the father\u2019s contention was found in Maryland Rule 886a. That Rule was subsequently readopted, without substantive change, as Md.Rule 8-131(c), which provides that an appellate court \u201cwill not set aside the judgment of the trial court on the evidence unless clearly erroneous, and will give due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>regard to the opportunity of the trial court to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d The Court in <em>Rothschild </em>then held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">\u201cthe chancellor did have before him evidence from the mother of costs for support of the child. It is obvious that the chancellor gave very careful consideration to the mother\u2019s testimony, the original agreement, the changes in the cost of living, changes by virtue of change in age insofar as the young lady is concerned and her actual needs. It is significant in this regard that although the chancellor increased the support payments, he did not accept the support figure requested by the mother. We cannot say that the chancellor\u2019s judgment in this case was \u2018clearly erroneous\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">The case at hand is markedly similar to that in <em>Rothschild. </em>Judge Thieme received testimony from Margaret about her daughter\u2019s expenses, accompanied by a list enumerating each. This list identified food, shelter, and clothing as the primary expenses, but also itemized expenses for transportation, extracurricular activities, outside sports teams, and religious instruction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rather than adopt these numbers, Judge Thieme recessed to review the evidence and said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to shoot from the hip without looking at the expenses and making my own determination as to what this\u2014what this child reasonably needs for monthly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>expenses.\u201d Judge Thieme gave due consideration to the evidence before him, and we will not set aside his judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY AFFIRMED.

Discussing the economic studies of spending in intact households, Robert G.

I do not believe that the legislature intended to authorize trial judges to ignore basic policy decisions made by the legislature with respect to the equitable establishment of child support, or to authorize virtually unlimited discretion as soon as the combined adjusted actual income of the parties exceeds $10,000 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">As the Court\u2019s opinion points out, the legislature adopted an Income Shares Model when it enacted Senate Bill 49 in 1989. The Bill Analysis prepared for the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee explains the basic concepts of this model in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-9\">The Income Shares model is based on the premise that the child should receive the same proportion of parental income he or she would receive if the parents lived together. Under this model, a basic child support obligation is computed based on the combined income of the parents (replicating total income in an intact household). This basic obligation is then prorated in proportion to each parent\u2019s adjusted gross income. Prorated shares of child care costs and extraordinary medical expenses are added to each parent\u2019s basic obligation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-10\">The economic assumptions underlying this model are based on recent studies estimating expenditures on children as a proportion of household consumption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">The chancellor followed one of these policies when he allocated the share of each parent in accordance with their share of the total income. He apparently ignored, however, the \u201crecent studies estimating expenditures on children as a proportion of household consumption\u201d which underlay the legislature\u2019s approved model, and instead reverted to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>earlier practice of attempting to determine the needs of a child based upon the custodial parent\u2019s estimated allocation to the child of a portion of fixed expenses of the family. As the Court of Special Appeals cogently observed in <em>Tannehill v. Tannehill, </em>88 Md.App. 4, 11, 591 A.2d 888 (1991), one of the principal purposes for adopting the guidelines was \u201cto improve the consistency and equity of child support awards.\u201d <em>See also Richardson v. Richardson, </em>12 Va.App. 18, 401 S.E.2d 894, 895 (1991) (child support guidelines were intended to \u201cdecrease the disparity in the amount of awards, which, without the guidelines, range from unreasonably low to unrealistically high\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">I believe the Income Shares Model adopted by the legislature provides informed guidance for the fixing of child support obligations even when the combined adjusted actual income exceeds $10,000 per month, while still granting the discretion referred to in \u00a7 12-204(d) of the Family Law Article, Maryland Code (1991 RepLVol.). The schedule of basic child support obligations, based upon data that the legislature found acceptable, shows that above the poverty level the percentage of parental income dedicated to child-rearing expenses decreases as the parental income increases. I do not agree with the father that the curve which can be plotted from the schedule must be projected to establish child support obligations beyond the limits of the schedule; that argument is contrary to the express intention of the legislature to grant a measure of discretion to the court when incomes exceed the highest income listed on the schedule. But that does not mean that the entire concept of the schedule, or its underlying data, should be jettisoned as soon as the upper limit of the schedule is passed. The legislative objective may be carried forward by using the schedule to establish presumptive maximum and minimum amounts for basic child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Specifically, I suggest that the amount calculated in accordance with the schedule for child support when the combined income equals $10,000 per month should serve as the presumptive floor for awards based upon combined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>income in excess of that amount. It makes no sense to hold the parents who would be required to provide $1,040 per month for the support of a child when their combined monthly income is $10,000 would be permitted to pay less if their income were $10,050 per month. Similarly, I believe the presumptive maximum base payment for one child should be 10.4 percent of the combined income of the parents, which is the percentage that the maximum scheduled payment bears to the maximum combined income ($1,040 to $100,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">As I have noted above, the studies upon which the schedule is based demonstrate that the percentage of combined income of families living together that is dedicated to support of a child decreases as the income increases. Thus, it would hardly be inequitable to the child to establish as a maximum the percentage fixed by the schedule for a lesser amount of combined income. It should be kept in mind, however, that it is the <em>percentage </em>of income that remains as a constant presumptive ceiling\u2014the amount of dollars to be paid for the support of the child obviously increases as the combined income increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">I certainly would not fault a chancellor for utilizing a projection of the schedule for combined incomes above $10,000 a month as a presumptive child support payment where other factors did not suggest a different amount, but I agree that such a projection is not required. The legislature expressly reserved a considerable range of discretion to the chancellor when the combined monthly income of the parties exceeds $10,000, and thus there is no authority for requiring a mathematical projection. It was, however, the intent of the legislature that this discretion be exercised in a manner consistent with the principles approved by the passage of subtitle 2 of Chapter 12 of the Family Law Article (Child Support Guidelines). Accordingly, the presumptive maximum and minimum support payments should be dictated by those policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Applying these principles to this case, the presumptive minimum base payment would be $1,040 (the payment es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>tablished by the schedule for $10,000), and the presumptive maximum would be $1,517 (10.4 percent of combined income of $14,583). Adding $400 of child care expense's to the presumptive maximum figure produces a total of $1,917, and multiplying that amount by 83 percent to arrive at the contribution to be made by the father produces a total presumptive maximum payment of $1,591. The monthly payment ordered in this case was $1,550. Although calculated by a method which I believe is at variance with the approach intended by the legislature, the payment ordered here falls within the range of discretion which I believe the legislature intended to grant to trial judges, and I would therefore affirm the decision in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">ELDRIDGE, J., joins in this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
