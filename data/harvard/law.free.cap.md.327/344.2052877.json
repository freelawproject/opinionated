In that complaint, Mancuso alleges that on September 22, 1986, she purchased a prescription drug at a pharmacy owned and operated by the appellee, Giant Foods, Inc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>(\u201cGiant\u201d). The prescription was for a drug named \u201cCorgard\u201d (a beta blocker) to control her pulse rate and blood pressure. Mancuso claims that instead of receiving Corgard, Giant filled the prescription with Chlorpropamide (a generic form of diabinese), a drug used to treat diabetes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She relates that after taking the Chlorpropamide she went into a diabetic coma and suffered a serious and life-threatening injury. Mancuso alleges negligence, breach of warranties, and strict liability on the part of Giant because its employees failed to fill her physician\u2019s prescription property-</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Prior to trial on the merits, the trial court granted Giant\u2019s motion to dismiss Mancuso\u2019s claim on the ground that Mancuso had failed to comply with the mandatory arbitration provisions of the Act before instituting a suit in court. Judgment was entered in favor of Giant for costs. Discontented with the circuit court\u2019s decision, Mancuso filed a Motion to Revise Judgment or in the Alternative for a Stay pending arbitration. After a hearing on July 29, 1991, the trial court denied Mancuso\u2019s motion. Mancuso appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, and we issued a writ of certiorari before the matter was considered by the intermediate appellate court. Mancuso asks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">1. Did the trial court err in ruling that claims against pharmacists are subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions of the Health Care Malpractice Claims Act?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">2. Did the trial court err in denying Mancuso\u2019s Motion to Revise Judgment to allow a Stay of the circuit court\u2019s proceedings pending the outcome of arbitration?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">The question of whether claims against pharmacists for errors in dispensing prescribed drugs are subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions in the Act is essentially an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>issue of statutory construction. We recently reviewed the rules of statutory construction in <em>Motor Vehicle Admin. v. Seidel, </em>326 Md. 237, 248-49, 604 A.2d 473, 479 (1992), quoting <em>Morris v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>319 Md. 597, 603-04, 573 A.2d 1346, 1349 (1990) (citations and footnote omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">\u201cThere is no doubt that the beginning point of statutory construction is the language of the statute itself. Obviously, \u2018 \u201cwhat the legislature has written in an effort to achieve a goal is a natural ingredient of analysis to determine that goal.\u201d \u2019 When we look at the statutory language, we attempt to give effect to all the words in the statute. And sometimes it may not be necessary to go further than the scrutiny of the statutory language, for the language itself may be sufficiently expressive of the legislative purpose or goal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">\u201cBut our endeavor is always to seek out the legislative purpose, the general aim or policy, the ends to be accomplished, the evils to be redressed by a particular enactment. In the conduct of that enterprise, we are not limited to the study of the statutory language. The plain meaning rule \u2018 \u201cis not a complete, all-sufficient rule for ascertaining a legislative intention____\u2019\u201d The \u2018meaning of the plainest language\u2019 is controlled by the context in which it appears. Thus, we always are free to look at the context within which statutory language appears. Even when the words of a statute carry a definite meaning, we are not \u2018precluded from consulting legislative history as part of the process of determining the legislative purpose or goal\u2019 of the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">(citations and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">Section 3-2A-02 of the Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-11\">\u201c(1) all claims, suits, and actions ... by a person <em>against a health care provider for medical injury </em>allegedly suffered by the person in which damages of more than the limit of the concurrent jurisdiction of the District Court are sought are subject to and shall be governed by the provisions of [the Act].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>(2) An action or suit of that type may not be brought or pursued in any court of this State except in accordance with this [Act] ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">(emphasis added). The critical terms in \u00a7 3-2A-02, \u201chealth care provider\u201d and \u201cmedical injury,\u201d are defined in \u00a7 3-2A-01 of the Act. At the time Mancuso filed this action, subsection 3-2A-01(e) defined a \u201chealth care provider\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq9\">\u201ca hospital, a related institution as defined in \u00a7 19-301 of the Health-General Article, a physician, an osteopath, an optometrist, a chiropractor, a registered or licensed practical nurse, a dentist, a podiatrist, and a physical therapist, licensed or authorized to provide one or more health care services in Maryland. \u2018Health care provider\u2019 does not mean any nursing institution conducted by and for those who rely upon treatment by spiritual means through prayer alone in accordance with the tenets and practices of a recognized church or religious denomination.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Subsection 3-2A-01(f) defined \u201cmedical injury\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-7\">\u201cinjury arising or resulting from the rendering or failure to render health care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Mancuso contends that it is clear from the statutory language contained in \u00a7 3-2A-01(e) that the Legislature did not include pharmacists as health care providers, and therefore did not intend that pharmacists be subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions of the Act. She submits that the statutory list of those professionals deemed to be health care providers is an exhaustive, as opposed to illustrative, list. In support of this contention, Mancuso highlights the Legislature\u2019s amendments to \u00a7 3-2A-01(e) in 1990, which added two professions to the list of those deemed to be health care providers.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She argues that if the Legislature had intended the statutory list in \u00a7 3-2A-01(e) to be merely illustrative, it would not have been necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>for the Legislature to add two more professions. Finally, with respect to whether her injury was a \u201cmedical injury,\u201d Mancuso contends that the filling of a prescription and/or the labeling of the drug dispensed does not constitute the \u201crendering of health care,\u201d but, rather, is the sale of a product. Therefore, she argues that the trial court committed reversible error when it granted Giant\u2019s motion to dismiss her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Giant, on the other hand, maintains that the analysis of whether a claim is subject to mandatory arbitration provisions of the Act does not end after determining whether the defendant satisfies the black letter definition of a health care provider in \u00a7 3-2A-01(e). It contends that this Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Group Health Ass\u2019n v. Blumenthal, </em>295 Md. 104, 453 A.2d 1198 (1983), and <em>Miles Laboratories v. Doe, </em>315 Md. 704, 556 A.2d 1107 (1989) reflect that our analysis in cases such as the instant one is to look beyond the statutory definition of a health care provider to the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, which necessarily includes analyzing the defendant\u2019s services. Giant submits that, in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the nature of Mancuso\u2019s claim is one sounding in medical malpractice, and that the services provided by pharmacists are akin to those of a professional who provides health care. In support of its contention that pharmacists are professionals who provide health care, Giant relies primarily on: 1) the General Assembly\u2019s regulation of pharmacists in the Health Occupations Article of the Md.Code; and 2) several out-of-state cases in which courts have commented on pharmacists and their role in advising customers regarding health care.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">At the outset, we believe that Giant misconstrues our holdings in both <em>Blumenthal, supra, </em>295 Md. 104, 453 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>1198, and <em>Miles Laboratories, supra, </em>315 Md. 704, 556 A.2d 1107. In <em>Blumenthal, </em>the plaintiffs sued a Health Maintenance Organization (\u201cHMO\u201d) for the alleged malpractice of a physician employed by that HMO. Among the issues certified to this Court by the United States District Court for the District of Maryland were: 1) whether the HMO was a \u201chealth care provider\u201d under the Act so that the action against it for alleged malpractice was subject to mandatory arbitration, and 2) if not, was the plaintiffs claim seeking to hold the HMO liable on a <em>respondeat superior </em>theory for alleged malpractice of \u201chealth care providers\u201d in its employ nevertheless subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions of the Act. <em>Blumenthal, supra, </em>295 Md. at 109, 453 A.2d at 1202.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">With respect to the first question, we determined that the HMO was not a health care provider because it was neither \u201ca hospital\u201d nor \u201ca related institution as defined in \u00a7 19-301 of the Health-General Article\u201d under \u00a7 3-2A-01(e). <em>Blumenthal, supra, </em>295 Md. at 110, 453 A.2d at 1203. In reaching this decision, we examined the statutory list of professions set forth in \u00a7 3-2A-01(e) and determined that HMOs were neither expressly listed, nor included under those professions listed. We did not, as Giant suggests, look beyond the statutory language to the nature of the plaintiffs claim or the defendant\u2019s services in an attempt to determine whether a HMO was a health care provider within the contemplation of the Act. Instead, we found that the statutory language itself was sufficiently expressive to hold that HMOs were not subject to the Act\u2019s mandatory arbitration provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">We did, however, look to the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint in addressing the second issue of whether claims against the defendant based on a <em>respondeat superior </em>theory were subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions of the Act. With respect to this issue, we concluded that the language in \u00a7 3-2A-02:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">\u201c[wa]s sufficient to encompass a claim against a health care provider which also forms the basis for <em>respondeat </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number><em>superior </em>liability on the part of the health care provider\u2019s employer, whether or not that employer is itself a health care provider.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 112, 453 A.2d at 1203. In reaching this conclusion, we reasoned: 1) that the word \u201cclaim\u201d in \u00a7 3-2A-02 is broader than the defendant named in the complaint; 2) that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint against the HMO was based solely on the HMO\u2019s vicarious liability for its employee-physician; and 3) that physicians are expressly listed under \u00a7 3-2A-01(e) as health care providers. Therefore, we held that the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the HMO was subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions of the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 111-14, 453 A.2d at 1203-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">In <em>Miles Laboratories, supra, </em>315 Md. 704, 556 A.2d 1107, the plaintiff was infected with the AIDS virus after receiving a transfusion of blood supplied by the American Red Cross (\u201cthe Red Cross\u201d). In his complaint, the plaintiff alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>negligence, breach of implied warranties, and strict liability on the part of the Red Cross in supplying the contaminated blood. <em>Id. </em>at 735, 556 A.2d at 1123. One of the questions presented to this Court was whether claims of negligence or product liability against a blood supplier were subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions of the Act. <em>Id. </em>at 739, 556 A.2d at 1125. The Red Cross contended that injury suffered by the plaintiff constituted a \u201cmedical injury\u201d under the Act, and that it was a \u201chealth care provider\u201d under the statute, even though the statutory definition in \u00a7 3-2A-01(e) did not expressly include blood suppliers. After examining the language in \u00a7 3-2A-01(e), we determined that blood suppliers were not health care providers and that the alleged injury was not a medical injury within the ambit of the Act\u2019s provisions. <em>Id. </em>at 741, 556 A.2d at 1125. Again, we reasoned that blood suppliers were not health care providers because they were not included in the list of occupations set forth in \u00a7 3-2A-01(e). We did not look beyond the statutory definition of health care provider to the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s claim in reaching our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we are likewise convinced that the unambiguous statutory language of \u00a7 3-2A-01(e) reveals that the Legislature did not intend that pharmacists be included as health care providers subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions of the Act. Pharmacists are not physicians, osteopaths, optometrists, chiropractors, registered or licensed practical nurses, dentists, podiatrists, or physical therapists, nor is a pharmacy a hospital or a \u201crelated institution as defined in \u00a7 19-301 of the Health-General Article.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Furthermore, we agree with Mancuso that the Legislature\u2019s recent amendment to the definition of \u201chealth care provider,\u201d in which two professions were added, evidences the Legislature\u2019s intention that the list of occupations set forth in \u00a7 3-2A-01(e) is exhaustive rather than illustrative.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We therefore hold that under the plain meaning of the statute pharmacists are not subject to the mandatory arbitration provisions of the Act and that it was error for the trial court to grant Giant\u2019s motion to dismiss Mancuso\u2019s complaint. <em>Accord Weidig v.
