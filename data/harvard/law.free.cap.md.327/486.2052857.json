Rodriguez and Helen Lopez were riding in a car on Sligo Creek Parkway in Montgomery County. An unidentified person stood on a bridge that crossed over the parkway and hurled a 30-pound boulder onto the couple\u2019s car as they passed underneath. The boulder crashed through the windshield and killed German Rodriguez. At the time of the accident Helen Lopez was pregnant with German\u2019s child. Helen survived the assault, carried her pregnancy to full term, and over eight months later gave birth to a son, Herman Edwardo Rodriguez Lopez.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Two weeks after the boy was born, Helen filed a claim with the Maryland State Treasurer on her son\u2019s behalf for damages resulting from the death of his father.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the sake of simplicity, we will refer to the infant plaintiff as Lopez. The basis of Lopez\u2019 claim is that the Maryland State Highway Administration breached its duty to operate and maintain the bridge in a safe and reasonable manner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The child\u2019s claim arises under Maryland\u2019s wrongful death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>statute, Maryland Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7\u00a7 3-901 <em>et seq. </em>In order to pursue this claim against the State, Lopez had to first comply with the provisions of the Maryland Tort Claims Act (MTCA), Md.Code (1984, 1991 Cum.Supp.), State Government Art., \u00a7\u00a7 12-101 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>When the legislature passed the MTCA and abrogated the State\u2019s sovereign immunity, it imposed certain procedural requirements that must be met in order to maintain a common law or statutory tort claim against the State. Section 12-106(b) embodies a condition precedent to such an action: \u201cA claimant may not institute an action under this subtitle unless ... the claimant submits a written claim to the Treasurer or a designee of the Treasurer within 180 days after the injury to person or property that is the basis of the claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">The Lopez claim was filed with the Treasurer on March 16, 1989\u201416 days after his birth and 286 days after the death of his father. In a letter dated September 1, 1989, the State Treasurer denied his claim stating that she believed \u201cthat the State was not at fault\u201d in his father\u2019s death. Approximately six months later, Lopez filed a wrongful death action in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County naming the Maryland State Highway Administration as a defendant. The State countered with a motion for summary judgment arguing that Lopez had failed to file his claim with the Treasurer within 180 days of his father\u2019s death and, therefore, he did not satisfy the \u00a7 12-106(b) condition precedent to bringing the action. Judge Joseph S. Casula felt constrained to accept the State\u2019s contention and granted its motion for summary judgment, although he recognized that this interpretation was \u201charsh\u201d and acknowledged that he would be \u201cvery happy to be reversed\u201d on appeal. Lopez appealed the grant of summary judgment and we issued a writ of certiorari before the case was argued to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>The parties do not dispute that a claimant must satisfy the requirement of \u00a7 12-106 as a condition precedent to pursuing a claim against the State. <em>See Simpson v. Moore, </em>323 Md. 215, 225, 592 A.2d 1090, 1094-95 (1991). Lopez\u2019 primary argument is that the trial court erred in holding that the 180-day period in \u00a7 12-106(b) began to run at the time of his father\u2019s death. The language of \u00a7 12-106(b) states that a claim must be submitted to the Treasurer \u201cwithin 180 days after the injury to person or property that is the basis of the claim____\u201d Lopez contends that, in his wrongful death action, the \u201cinjury\u201d for which he seeks a remedy is the loss he suffers as a fatherless child. He argues that his injury, replete with all its damages, first manifested itself on the day he was born.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">In support of his argument, Lopez points out that the nature of a wrongful death action is distinguishable from a survival action. In the latter case, the decedent\u2019s estate may bring an action for the injury the decedent suffered. As such, the decedent\u2019s personal representative is essentially bringing an action that the decedent could have brought had he or she not died. <em>Smith v. Gray Concrete Pipe Co., </em>267 Md. 149, 158-59, 297 A.2d 721, 727 (1972), <em>overruled on other grounds, Owens-Illinois v. Zenobia, </em>325 Md. 420, 601 A.2d 633 (1992). In a wrongful death action, however, the injury for which a plaintiff may recover is not that suffered by the decedent, but it is the loss that the plaintiff has suffered from the death of a spouse, child, or parent. <em>See Stewart v. United Elec. L. &amp; P. Co., </em>104 Md. 332, 338-40, 65 A. 49, 51-52 (1906). The claimant in the instant case\u2014Lopez as a statutory beneficiary under \u00a7 3-904 of the Courts Article\u2014had not yet been born at the time of his father\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">The State argued below that since the limitations period for the child\u2019s wrongful death action began to run at the time German Rodriguez died,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> his claim to the Treasurer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>must have necessarily been filed within 180 days of that date. Yet even had Lopez filed within 180 days of his father\u2019s death, the State argues, it would have been for naught because \u201che was a fetus and therefore did not have a cause of action\u201d and \u201cwas not a statutory beneficiary until the time of filing had expired.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">Lopez agrees that, as a fetus, he had no cause of action for the wrongful death of his father; yet he draws a different conclusion from this fact. While agreeing that no cause of action existed at the time of Rodriguez\u2019 death, Lopez argues that he became a statutory claimant, <em>i.e., </em>his cause of action arose, upon his birth. Most recently in <em>Owens-Illinois v. Armstrong, </em>we held that a cause of action arises \u201c \u2018when facts exist to support each element.\u2019 \u201d 326 Md. 107, 121, 604 A.2d 47, 54 (1992) (citation omitted). We went on to explain, \u201cIn a negligence claim, the fact of injury would seemingly be the last element to come into existence. The breach, duty, and causation elements naturally precede the fact of injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Again we look to the nature of a wrongful death action and the injury it was designed to recompense to determine when, and if, Lopez\u2019 cause of action arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">One injury for which a plaintiff in a wrongful death action is compensated \u201cis the pecuniary loss sustained by reason of the death\u201d of a loved one. <em>Tucker v. State, Use </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number><em>of Johnson, </em>89 Md. 471, 479, 43 A. 778, 780, 44 A. 1004 (1899). <em>See also Stewart, </em>104 Md. at 342-43, 65 A. at 53-54. In addition to pecuniary loss, the damages recoverable by wrongful death plaintiffs are those for \u201cmental anguish, emotional pain and suffering, loss of society, companionship, comfort, protection, marital care, parental care, filial care, attention, advice, counsel, training, guidance, or education____\u201d Md.Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.) Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc.Art., \u00a7 3-904(d). Certainly those damages for loss of a father\u2019s companionship, care, attention, and support could not exist until the child\u2019s birth. It was only after he was born that Lopez suffered injury from the loss of his father\u2019s pecuniary support, and the paternal affection and guidance attending the father-son relationship. Consequently, we agree with Lopez that a cause of action for the wrongful death of his father arose on the date of his birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Accepting that conclusion, we now focus on the language of the MTCA, as found in the State Government Article. As quoted earlier, \u00a7 12-106(b) requires that a claim be filed to the Treasurer \u201cwithin 180 days after the injury to person or property that is the basis of the claim.\u201d Since the injury suffered by Lopez began on the date of his birth, the claim filed 16 days thereafter was timely and satisfied the condition precedent in \u00a7 12-106(b). Our interpretation of the latter provision is complemented and reinforced by other provisions in the MTCA subtitle. Section 12-107, which governs the form that an MTCA claim must take, requires that a \u201cdemand for specific damages\u201d be included. To avoid speculative damage claims, we believe it is appropriate that claimants not be required to file these claims until after their birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">More significantly, \u00a7 12-102 addresses how this Court should interpret the MTCA and directs, \u201cThis subtitle shall be construed broadly, to ensure that injured parties have a remedy.\u201d The State urges this Court to hold that Lopez not only <em>did not, </em>but <em>could not, </em>properly seek a remedy from the State for it was not possible for him to comply with the MTCA. Completely excluding the class of claimants who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>are unborn at the time of the wrongful death is entirely at odds with the legislative intent that the MTCA be construed broadly so as to ensure redress to injured parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The parties also disagree as to the effect to be given \u00a7 3-904(h) of the Courts Article. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">\u201c(h) <em>Child of parents who have not participated in a marriage </em>ceremony.\u2014For the purposes of this section, a person born to parents who have not participated in a marriage ceremony with each other is considered to be the child of the mother. The person is considered to be the child of the father only if the father (1) has been judicially determined to be the father in a proceeding brought under \u00a7 5-1010 of the Family Law Article, or (2) prior to the death of the child, (a) has acknowledged himself, in writing, to be the father, or (b) has openly and notoriously recognized the person to be his child, or (c) has subsequently married the mother and has acknowledged himself, orally or in writing, to be the father.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APD\">Each party suggests a different configuration in which this requirement of establishing paternity has some bearing on when the 180-day period of \u00a7 12-106(b) begins to run. We note, however, that we do not see that the judicial determination of paternity alters the timing or impact of the loss a child will suffer at his or her birth. Regardless of whether paternity has yet been judicially established, Lopez has alleged and will have to prove that he has suffered damages as the result of the loss of his father for which the State is legally liable. Therefore, just as with a child born in wedlock, the 180-day period begins to run on the date of the child\u2019s birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">In further support of this conclusion we note that a claim filed to the Treasurer need not contain proof of all elements of the action, but only a \u201cconcise statement of facts that sets forth the nature of the claim, including the date and place of the alleged tort____\u201d \u00a7 12-107(a)(1). Lopez, therefore, did not have to establish Rodriguez\u2019 paternity before forwarding his claim to the Treasurer. Rather, Lopez must prove that he is Rodriguez\u2019 child as an addition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>al element of his cause of action under the wrongful death statute. This latter requirement embodied in \u00a7 3-904(h) of the Courts Article is comparable to that in \u00a7 3-904(b), which requires secondary beneficiaries to establish that they were \u201cwholly dependent\u201d on the decedent as part of their claim. <em>See, e.g., McKeon v. State, Use of Conrad, </em>211 Md. 437, 127 A.2d 635 (1956) (determining whether sisters were \u201cwholly dependent\u201d was an issue for the jury). Lopez, therefore, did not have to establish his parentage before filing a claim with the Treasurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">Within 180 days of his injury, Lopez filed his claim to the Treasurer who, in turn, denied the claim. Consequently, Lopez satisfied \u00a7 12-106(b)\u2019s condition precedent to pursuing his cause of action in the circuit court. We, therefore, reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR PRINCE GEORGE\u2019S COUNTY REVERSED. CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. APPELLEE TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-9\">. Helen Lopez filed the claim as mother and next friend of Herman Edwardo Rodriguez Lopez. She filed no claim with the State Treasurer as personal representative of Rodriguez\u2019 estate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b538-10\">. The State argues on appeal that the judgment below could be affirmed on the basis that the State owed no duty to protect Rodriguez from the wrongful acts of third parties and, therefore, could not be liable for his death. This argument was not raised below as a ground for summary judgment and we will not entertain it on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b539-5\">. Unless otherwise indicated, all statutory references are to Maryland Code (1984, 1991 Cum.Supp.), State Government Article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b540-8\">. The State assumes that despite the absence of a claimant the limitations period for the wrongful death action would begin at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Rodriguez\u2019 death. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.), Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Art., \u00a7 3-904(g)(l) (\"an action under this subtitle shall be filed within three years after the death of the injured person.\u2019\u2019). This issue is not before us and we will not venture to resolve it today.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Even accepting the State\u2019s assumption that the limitations period for Lopez\u2019 action would begin running on the day of his father\u2019s death, we do not see how this precludes Lopez\u2019 action from arising at the time of his birth. At most, Lopez would have lost from his limitations period the time he spent <em>en ventre sa mere </em>after his father\u2019s death. If, as the State argues, the limitations period necessarily began on June 3, 1988, when Rodriguez died, Lopez would still have until June 3, 1991, to file his claim. The fact that he was not born\u2014and therefore not a statutory beneficiary\u2014until February 28, 1989, only means that Lopez could lose from the three-year limitations that time between June 3, 1988, and February 28, 1989.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
