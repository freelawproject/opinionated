The first\u2014and certainly not the least\u2014is when members of the family of Frederick William Reynolds, Jr., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>confronted him, late in the spring of 1989, with dark secrets two of his adult daughters had just shared with them. For years, according to the women, Reynolds had sexually abused them at the family farm in Carroll County when they were children; one he had repeatedly raped throughout her youth and into her adolescence. Now in his 50s with the girls grown, Reynolds was no longer engaged in criminally incestuous behavior. But also now there were granddaughters, and Crystal, the eldest daughter and the one who had suffered the most, feared for them. That fear led her to tell other family members what had happened to her; she learned she was not the only daughter who had been sexually abused. The family then confronted Reynolds and urged him to get help.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Reynolds went to a pastor, who counseled him and other family members for a period of time. The cleric\u2019s schedule did not allow him to see Reynolds very often that summer, so he suggested that Reynolds seek further help from an organization called Family Children\u2019s Service Center in Westminster. Reynolds agreed and phoned for an appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">When Reynolds arrived at the Center, he spoke there with a woman named Marcia Meyer. Reynolds testified later, \u201cShe said that I had to be very honest with them, that they would take me on, that they had lots of patients like I was and they would\u2014they could help.\u201d But Meyer told Reynolds that he would have to sign a form authorizing her organization to notify the police of any evidence implicating him as a child abuser. Reynolds asked Meyer about the form, and \u201cshe said you can\u2019t take counseling here unless you sign this because I cannot do it with you.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Uncertain what to do, Reynolds telephoned the Carroll County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s office and spoke with Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Kathi Hill. The call was unexpected, and Hill tried to be both cautious and candid. According to Reynolds, she told him, \u201cWell, you should go and take your counseling right now, that\u2019s the first thing.\u201d Hill added, \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since this occurred, but I cannot give you advice because if\u2014I\u2014it may, in the future,\u2014I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m a prosecutor. I prosecute these types of cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Reynolds wanted help and assumed that all counselors would have the same policy about reporting to the police as did the Family Children\u2019s Service Center (the Center).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accompanied by his wife, Agnes, he went to the Center and signed the form.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">After Reynolds\u2019 counseling program was underway, Meyer called Reynolds and told him that the police wanted to talk with him. It was not part of the program, she said, and he did not have to discuss anything with the police if he did not want to. Still, Reynolds agreed to meet Corporal Richard E. Norman of the Maryland State Police at the Center. He agreed to speak with Norman, Reynolds later testified, because \u201cthat\u2019s what my children had told me they wanted; they weren\u2019t interested in prosecution or jail.\u201d On July 11, 1989, Norman came to interview Reynolds at the Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">Norman introduced himself and told Reynolds that he understood \u201csome statements\u201d had been made to Meyer; would Reynolds now \u201ctell me the same things?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>\u201cWell,\u201d Reynolds replied, \u201cwhatever I tell you is goin\u2019 to incriminate me.\u201d Norman asked what he meant, and Reynolds explained, \u201cWell, I\u2019m an abuser\u2014I\u2019m considered an abuser.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">At that point, Norman told Reynolds that he did not have to say anything. Reynolds then asked for \u201chis rights,\u201d though he later testified that he had made this request \u201cjokingly.\u201d Nevertheless, Norman obliged, reading the \u201cMiranda rights\u201d aloud from a printed card he carried.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to his testimony, Norman also advised Reynolds that \u201che wasn\u2019t under arrest and he didn\u2019t have to talk to me; I mean, he didn\u2019t have to say a thing to me.\u201d Again, Reynolds acknowledged that he would be \u201cincriminating\u201d himself. The July 11 interview began and lasted \u201canywhere from fifteen minutes to an hour.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">Reynolds talked about sexually touching all four of his daughters, starting with each when she was about ten years old. As for Crystal, there was more than touching; he had sexual intercourse with her periodically until she was well into her high school years. Reynolds told Norman where and how he might be able to contact his daughters.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">After the interview, Norman pursued his investigation, eventually talking at length with Crystal and with Vivian, the second daughter. Over a period of time both women gave detailed accounts of how they were abused by their father. After a long interviewing session with Crystal on September 6, 1989, Norman decided to speak again with Reynolds. That afternoon, he went to Reynolds\u2019 home. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Reynolds was not there, so Norman waited. Shortly after 4 P.M. Reynolds showed up, and the investigator asked if he could speak with him because Crystal \u201chad told me things.\u201d Reynolds said, \u201cFine,\u201d and the two men went inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">According to Reynolds\u2019 testimony later, Norman \u201cexplained to me that he wanted me to try to remember the events as closely as I could and I couldn\u2019t understand that and he says, \u2018It\u2019s for Crystal\u2019s good because if you can\u2019t remember them, she doesn\u2019t think anybody believes her, that it didn\u2019t happen,\u2019 and so I was to try to remember because I would really be helping my daughter, that\u2014she needed that for her own mental health____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Eventually Norman\u2019s second interview with Reynolds began. This time, their conversation was tape-recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">\u201cFirst of all, you\u2019re not under arrest, okay, like I told you a bit earlier,\u201d Norman advised Reynolds. \u201cSame situation down in\u2014in Ms. Meyer\u2019s office. All I want to do is just get some information from you, hear your side of the story again and, you know, you don\u2019t have to talk to me. If you want me to leave, I\u2019ll leave, you know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Reynolds talked about his sexual episodes with Crystal and Vivian. At times he corroborated what his daughters had told Norman about some of the events; other incidents from the past he disputed or could not remember. When Norman began to follow up after Reynolds acknowledged threatening Crystal to get his way, Reynolds asked, \u201cWell, why do you need those times?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">\u201cBecause I\u2019m trying to verify what she\u2019s telling me,\u201d Norman responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-11\">\u201cBut you\u2019re not arresting me,\u201d continued Reynolds. \u201cWhy do you need to know every little detail?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b550-12\">\u201cBecause it\u2019s important for her to understand,\u201d Norman replied, \u201cyou know, and that\u2014that I can\u2014I can say, yes, you know, I talked to your dad and\u2014and he\u2019s saying that everything that happened____\u201d At that moment, Reynolds interrupted Norman to get the phone. When he came back ten minutes later, Agnes was with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Norman reopened the interview with these words: \"You realize I\u2019m\u2014I\u2019m not gonna arrest you today. All I want to do is just talk to you, you know, and you\u2019re not under arrest and I can <em>leave\u2014you </em>want me to leave any time you want, so I [inaudible] understand that. Do you understand that?\u201d Reynolds indicated he did, and the conversation continued until just before 5:20 P.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">Two days later, Norman returned and arrested Reynolds, who was eventually charged with several sexual offenses against Crystal and Vivian.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Before trial, Reynolds moved to suppress the incriminating statements he had made to Norman. The trial court denied the motion, finding that Reynolds had confessed freely and voluntarily to the State Police investigator. Neither Marcia Meyer nor anyone else from the Family Children\u2019s Service Center testified about anything Reynolds said in counseling. The only statements by Reynolds introduced into evidence were those he had made directly to Norman. After a two-day trial, a Carroll County Circuit Court jury found Reynolds guilty of second degree rape, two counts of second degree sexual offense, assault with intent to rape, assault with intent to commit second degree sex offense, and incest. On June 5, 1990, Judge Donald Gilmore sentenced Reynolds to a total of 50 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Reynolds appealed, but the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment against him. <em>Reynolds v. State, </em>88 Md.App. 197, 594 A.2d 609 (1991). Reynolds petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which we granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">As was the case in the Court of Special Appeals, Reynolds\u2019 attack on his convictions focuses on the statements he gave to Norman. He challenges their introduction into evidence, claiming that they were the result of improper inducement and violative of his due process rights. In support of his contention, Reynolds relies on both constitutional and common law arguments. For the following reasons, we, too, decline to set aside his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>THE FIRST CONFESSION</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Reynolds complains that what Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Kathi Hill told him during their brief telephone conversation induced him to confess. Therefore, he argues, his subsequent statements to Norman were involuntary. He further contends that Hill should have warned him about \u201cthe consequences of seeking counseling.\u201d Under Reynolds\u2019 reasoning, Hill\u2019s failure to do so led him to make admissions to the counselors, which in turn led to his admissions to Norman and thus rendered his statements inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">Reynolds bases his argument on both constitutional and common law voluntariness grounds. The State contends that the issue of common law voluntariness was waived because Reynolds failed to present it with specificity to the trial court; the Court of Special Appeals agreed. 88 Md.App. at 219-21, 594 A.2d at 620. Reynolds claims the issue was raised when, in his motion to suppress, he argued that his confession was admitted in violation of \u201cother legal rights,\u201d citing a host of common law voluntariness cases including <em>Stokes v. State, </em>289 Md. 155, 423 A.2d 552 (1980); <em>Hillard v. State, </em>286 Md. 145, 406 A.2d 415 (1979); and <em>Bellamy v. State, </em>50 Md.App. 65, 435 A.2d 821 (1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>292 Md. 376 (1982). Reynolds further asserts that he specifically adopted the arguments and points and authorities contained in his motion at the suppression hearing. Because Reynolds\u2019 common law voluntariness contentions are intertwined with his constitutional voluntariness contentions, we are going to assume that the issue was raised below. But we caution defense counsel that they must be precise when they craft such motions and when they argue them at suppression hearings. It is an attorney\u2019s obligation to present with clarity all issues that must be resolved by a trial judge, whose responsibilities include making sure that proper evidence is presented to those entrusted with determining guilt or innocence. In the future, we will be less inclined to review an issue such as the one on common law voluntariness that Reynolds says was included in his scat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>tergun motion but which was not specifically argued and clearly identified at the suppression hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Originally common law confessions were admissible even if they had been wrung from hapless suspects by torture. W. LaFave &amp; J. Israel, 1 <em>Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 6.2, at 439 (1984) (hereinafter <em>LaFave &amp; </em>Israel). In 1775, Lord Mansfield first articulated what Wigmore would later characterize as the initial expression of the requirement that a confession be voluntary in order to be admissible against a criminal defendant. In that early elucidation, Lord Mansfield specifically referred to promises as one of the factors that might render a confession inadmissible. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE3\">\u201cThe instance has frequently happened, of persons having made confessions under threats or promises: the consequence as frequently has been, that such examinations and confessions have not been made use of against them on their trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-5\"><em>Rudd\u2019s Case, </em>1 Leach Cr.C. 115, 118, 168 Eng.Rep. 160, 161 (1775), <em>quoted in </em>1 <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 146 (4th ed. 1992) (hereinafter McCormick). <em>See </em>3 Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>\u00a7\u00a7 818-19 (Chadbourne rev. 1970) (hereinafter <em>Wigmore). </em>The common law approach was to identify inducements that might make a confession unreliable or even false. Actual or threatened physical harm, promises to be lenient upon conviction or not to prosecute, and deceptive interrogation came under scrutiny. <em>See LaFave &amp; Israel </em>\u00a7 6.2, at 443.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Examination of a confession\u2019s \u201cvoluntariness\u201d can be made both under a constitutional due process analysis and by application of state evidentiary laws. <em>See generally </em>1 <em>McCormick </em>\u00a7\u00a7 146-47, at 564-74. When analyzing whether a confession was voluntary under due process standards, \u201c[t]he test is of the totality of the circumstances. All of the circumstances of the interrogation, and the particular characteristics of the accused must be examined. Generally, no one factor is dispositive.\u201d D. Nissan et al., <em>Law of Confessions </em>\u00a7 1:9 (1980, 1991 Cum.Supp.) (hereinafter <em>Law of Confessions). </em>\u201c[W]hether [a] confession was obtained by coercion or improper inducement can be deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>mined only by an examination of all of the attendant circumstances.\u201d <em>Haynes v. Washington, </em>373 U.S. 503, 513, 83 S.Ct. 1336, 1343, 10 L.Ed.2d 513, 521 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">It is clear that coercion by government agents is a necessary ingredient to a determination that a defendant\u2019s confession should be suppressed because the defendant\u2019s constitutional due process rights have been violated. \u201cAbsent police conduct causally related to the confession, there is simply no basis for concluding that any state actor has deprived a criminal defendant of due process of law.\u201d <em>Colorado v. Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 164, 107 S.Ct. 515, 520, 93 L.Ed.2d 473, 482 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Determining voluntariness under common law principles, as opposed to constitutional due process requirements, may require an additional inquiry. \u201cGenerally, the approach under the common law rule was to identify certain inducements which made a confession unreliable. These included actual or threatened physical harm, a promise not to prosecute, a promise to provide lenient treatment upon conviction, and deceptive practices so extreme that they might have produced a false confession.\u201d <em>LaFave &amp; Israel </em>\u00a7 6.2, at 440. This Court has held that, regardless of constitutional imperatives, Maryland law demands that confessions \u201cbe shown to be free of any coercive barnacles that may have attached by improper means to prevent the expression from being voluntary.\u201d <em>Hillard, </em>286 Md. at 150, 406 A.2d at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">In harmony with the approach taken in federal constitutional analysis, Maryland has for the most part applied a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d rule when appraising the voluntariness of confessions under state nonconstitutional law. <em>See Hoey v. State, </em>311 Md. 473, 483, 536 A.2d 622, 627 (1988); <em>Lewis v. State, </em>285 Md. 705, 721, 404 A.2d 1073, 1081 (1979). <em>See also State v. Kidd, </em>281 Md. 32, 36, 375 A.2d 1105, <em>1108, cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1002, 98 S.Ct. 646, 54 L.Ed.2d 498 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">One area that has attracted special attention with respect to voluntariness\u2014both under common law and con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>stitutional due process requirements\u2014concerns promises made to suspects being interrogated. 1 <em>McCormick </em>\u00a7 154. It is the defendant\u2019s sensitivity to inducement while in custody and the potential impact of the promise of leniency that render the confession inadmissible. Courts abhor, or at least find distasteful, promises of leniency or immunity made by state agents to defendants subject to the vulnerability of custodial interrogation. In contrast, however, courts permit and perhaps even encourage promises of leniency through reduced charges or lower sentences made by prosecuting attorneys that induce criminal defendants to admit their culpability and plead guilty. <em>Cf. Wright v. State, </em>307 Md. 552, 515 A.2d 1157 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The reasons that promises of leniency may render a confession inadmissible were discussed by the Supreme Court in <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">\u201c[When] a confession [was] given by a defendant in custody, alone and unrepresented by counsel ... even a mild promise of leniency was deemed sufficient to bar the confession ... because defendants at such times are too sensitive to inducement and the possible impact on them too great to ignore and too difficult to assess.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 754, 90 S.Ct. at 1472, 25 L.Ed.2d at 759.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">In <em>Arizona v. Fulminante, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302 (1991), the Supreme Court made it clear that constitutional voluntariness does not require that all promises, threats, or inducements render a confession involuntary; instead, the federal constitution requires only that courts consider promises, threats, or inducements as part of the totality of the circumstances that courts must look at to determine voluntariness.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">In <em>Law of Confessions, </em>the authors observed that state courts developed a per se rule of exclusion to apply when the following elements were met in cases involving promises of leniency or immunity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-11\">\u201c1. Promise of benefit or advantage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>2. Made by a person of official or apparent official authority.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-4\">3. The suspect would not have confessed but/for the promise.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">4. The suspect\u2019s conclusion that he had received an offer was objectively reasonable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-6\"><em>Law of Confessions </em>\u00a7 1.12, at 23-24. In the 1991 supplement to their work, however, they note that there is \u201ca pronounced trend away from\u201d per se exclusion and \u201ctoward a totality of the circumstances approach.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1:12, at 13 (1991 Cum.Supp.). McCormick also notes that judicial rejection of the per se analysis in favor of a totality of the circumstances approach has increased the need for determining the impact of promises on particular defendants in particular interrogations. 1 <em>McCormick </em>\u00a7 154, at 615. <em>See State v. Strain, </em>779 P.2d 221, 227 (Utah 1989) (Case remanded for a determination whether, under the totality of the circumstances, the defendant was so affected by improper promises that his confession was involuntary). In 1987, after holding a confession voluntary notwithstanding a firm promise of leniency made by the police, the Seventh Circuit noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">\u201c[Although it was at one time suggested that any indication of leniency was both a necessary and a sufficient condition of a finding of involuntariness <em>(Bram v. United States, </em>168 U.S. 532, 542-43, 18 S.Ct. 183, 186-87, 42 L.E.[Ed.] 568[, 573] (1897)), the law today is that such an indication is a necessary but not itself a sufficient condition. Or to borrow a familiar concept from another area of the law, it is not enough for the indication of leniency to bear a but-for relationship to the confession in a purely temporal sense (that is, simply to show the defendant would not have considered confessing had the police not raised the subject by speaking of potential benefits). Instead the but-for test is one of proximate cause in the overborne-will sense: whether the police promise caused a deprivation of free will on the part of the then suspect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number><em>Cole v. Lane, </em>830 F.2d 104, 109 (7th Cir.1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 1076, 108 S.Ct. 1053, 98 L.Ed.2d 1015 (1988). See also <em>Green v. Scully, </em>850 F.2d 894 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 945, 109 S.Ct. 374, 102 L.Ed.2d 363 (1988), where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-5\">\u201cA reading of our own decisions reveals that the presence of a direct or implied promise of help or leniency alone has not barred the admission of a confession where the totality of the circumstances indicates it was the product of a free and independent decision____ Other circuits also conclude that promises do not require an analysis separate from or different than the totality of circumstances rule____ Thus, the inquiry in each case is whether such a promise overbears a suspect\u2019s will, as the promise of leniency did in <em>Bram, </em>either alone or in conjunction with other factors.\u201d (Citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">850 F.2d at 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">Maryland has followed the old common law rule, which has seemed to adopt a per se exclusion rule that official promises of leniency to a defendant in custody that induce a confession render the confession inadmissible. In a line of Maryland cases reaching back into the last century, this Court has explored challenges to the voluntariness of statements made by suspects who had been offered promises. If a confession \u201chad been induced by any threat of harm, or promise of worldly advantage held out to him by [the interrogating detective], or by his authority, or in his presence and with his sanction, it ought to be excluded.\u201d <em>Nicholson v. State, </em>38 Md. 140, 153 (1873).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-12\">A mere exhortation to tell the truth is not enough to make a statement involuntary. <em>See Ralph v. State, </em>226 Md. 480, 486, 174 A.2d 163, 166 (1961), <em>cert. denied, </em>369 U.S. 813, 82 S.Ct. 689, 7 L.Ed.2d 613 (1962). <em>See also State v. Rochester, </em>301 S.C. 196, 391 S.E.2d 244, 247 (1990) (Polygraph examiner\u2019s statement that it would be in suspect's interest to tell the truth did not offer a \u201chope of reward or benefit.\u201d). An entreaty to \u201ctell the truth\u201d coupled with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>promise that there would be benefits to the suspect, however, can render the statement involuntary. In <em>Biscoe v. State, </em>for example, a confession was inadmissible because the suspect was told \u201cthat it would be better for him to tell the truth, <em>and have no more trouble about it\u201d </em>67 Md. 6, 7, 8 A. 571, 572 (1887) (emphasis added). The declaration, \u201cTell the truth about it. You\u2019ve got nothing to fear i/you tell the truth, and you weren\u2019t in it,\u201d was also seen as an improper inducement by a plurality of the Court in <em>State v. Dobbs, </em>148 Md. 34, 61, 129 A. 275, 286 (1925) (Offutt, J., concurring) (emphasis added). For a discussion of the difference between exhortations and inducements, see <em>Clark v. State, </em>48 Md.App. 637, 644-45, 429 A.2d 287, 292, <em>cert. denied, </em>291 Md. 773 (1981).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">From our precedents, we distilled the following common law principle on promises:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-6\">\u201c[I]f an accused is told, or it is implied, that making an inculpatory statement will be to his advantage, in that he will be given help or some special consideration, and he makes remarks in reliance on that inducement, his declaration will be considered to have been involuntarily made and therefore inadmissible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-7\"><em>Hillard v. State, </em>286 Md. at 152-53, 406 A.2d at 420. \u201cThe rule in <em>Hillard </em>announces that a statement is rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>involuntary if it is induced by any official promise which redounds to the benefit or desire of the defendant.\u201d <em>Stokes v. State, </em>289 Md. at 160, 423 A.2d at 554. One common thread that runs through our cases is that the promise must have caused the suspect to confess. If a suspect did not rely on an interrogator\u2019s comments, obviously, the statement is admissible regardless of whether the interrogator had articulated an improper inducement. By definition, there would have been no \u201cinducement\u201d at all, because the interrogator \u201cinduced\u201d nothing. See <em>Ralph v. State </em>in which we said, \u201c[T]he court besides finding out whether an inducement held out to the accused should also ascertain whether he had been influenced by such inducement in making the confession.\u201d We noted that there was nothing in that case \u201cto show what <em>effect </em>the statement had on the defendant.\u201d 226 Md. at 486-87, 174 A.2d at 166 (emphasis added). <em>See also State ex rel. Collins v. Superior Court, </em>145 Ariz. 493, 702 P.2d 1338, 1340 (1985) (\u201c[T]he promise must <em>induce </em>the defendant to waive his fifth amendment rights. If defendant did not rely on the promise, he certainly was not induced by it to make a statement.\u201d) (Emphasis in the original).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">We note that Hill was responding to Reynolds' unsolicited telephone call; Reynolds was not under any kind of custodial restraint or compulsion. Furthermore, there was no inducement by Hill. She did not promise Reynolds any advantages or benefits. In fact, she promised him nothing. All Hill did was recommend that Reynolds receive counseling and warn that she could not give him advice because she might be called upon to prosecute him in the future. Hill certainly never suggested that Reynolds talk with the police. If anything, Hill\u2019s comments were a further indication to Reynolds that he could be held criminally liable for sexually abusing his daughters.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Without a promise of benefit or advantage, there was no inducement.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>We note further that nothing Reynolds said to Hill or at the Center became evidence at his trial. Even assuming that Hill\u2019s comments were an inducement to seek counseling, what he said to Meyer or any counselor at the Family Children\u2019s Service Center was not used against him in court. The confessions at issue were made to Corporal Norman much later and were completely independent of the brief telephone conversation between Reynolds and Hill.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">In trying to link Hill\u2019s comment to his subsequent confession to Norman, Reynolds reaches a bit too far. We would have to accept that the prosecutor not only coerced or induced him into talking to the counselor at the Center, but also coerced or induced him into confessing to Corporal Norman at a later date after his counseling was well underway. Arguably, Hill may have induced Reynolds to speak to the counselors; in no way did she attempt to induce him to speak to the police. Even assuming improper conduct by the prosecutor, any taint is so attenuated by the time Corporal Norman interviewed Reynolds\u2014preceded by both the investigator and Meyer advising Reynolds he did not have to talk to the police\u2014that exclusion is not appropriate. There is no established link between the alleged inducement to talk with counselors at the Center and Reynolds\u2019 decision to speak with Corporal Norman.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Whatever the prosecutor did, Reynolds gave his first statement to Norman after having received his <em>Miranda </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>rights and being told by Meyer that he did not have to talk to police. In neither his conversation with Hill nor his interview with Norman was Reynolds under any compulsion to confess, and he was offered no inducements affecting the voluntariness of his statements. In short, nothing Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Hill did or said led Reynolds to admit his crimes to the police, whether one analyzes the evidence from a per se rule or a totality of the circumstances approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">THE SECOND CONFESSION</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The second interview, which occurred at Reynolds\u2019 home nearly two months after the initial session with Norman, is also a target of Reynolds\u2019 attack. By this time, Norman had interviewed both Crystal and Vivian and was apparently well on his way to developing a case against their father. Reynolds invited the investigator inside and agreed to talk. Norman told Reynolds that he was not going to arrest him that day and that he could stop the interview and tell him to leave any time he wished. He did not, however, reiterate the full <em>Miranda </em>rights as he had done at the Center; he said merely that it was the \u201csame situation down in Ms. Meyer\u2019s office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">Reynolds contends that Norman should have fully advised him of his rights before the second interview. We reject his argument and adopt the well-reasoned analysis of the Court of Special Appeals, which held that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were unnecessary because there was no custodial interrogation. 88 Md.App. at 207-13, 594 A.2d at 614-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Reynolds also contends that Norman improperly induced him to talk by indicating the truth would \u201chelp\u201d Crystal. We disagree. What Norman may have implied was that the statement might be for Crystal\u2019s benefit\u2014not for Reynolds\u2019 benefit. At most, any reward would be a purely collateral benefit. Promises of purely collateral benefits do not generally reach a level that undermines the voluntariness of a confession.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number><em>\u201c </em>\u2018[I]n general such promises [of only \u201ccollateral\u201d benefits] are less coercive to the accused than promises directly relating to the criminal proceedings at hand.\u2019 Some courts ... apparently regard the collateral nature of the promised benefit unworthy of consideration or even comment.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">1 <em>McCormick </em>\u00a7 155, at 616-17 (quoting <em>Miller v. Fenton, </em>796 F.2d 598, 610 (3d Cir.), <em>cert. denied sub nom., Miller v. Neubert, </em>479 U.S. 989, 107 S.Ct. 585, 93 L.Ed.2d 587 (1986)). Generally the type of inducements that rendered confessions inadmissible at common law were inducements extreme enough to make the confessions unreliable and which directly impacted on the accused or the crime charged. <em>LaFave &amp; Israel </em>\u00a7 6.2, at 440.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">In <em>Stokes v. State, </em>this Court suppressed a statement from a suspect who had been promised what may have been both a direct and collateral benefit\u2014that his wife would not be arrested and charged as a codefendant if he told the police where illicit drugs were hidden. 289 Md. at 157, 423 A.2d at 553. In that case, and in the cases cited therein, the inducements concerned what the <em>police </em>would or would not do if the defendant made a statement. It was the threat of the authorities to cause the defendant distress and anguish that created the coercive atmosphere. We added, \u201cNeither Maryland nor any other jurisdiction of which we are aware, however, goes so far as to say that a confession motivated solely by a defendant\u2019s sense of altruism, without the inducement of an official threat or promise, is involuntary.\u201d 289 Md. at 161, 423 A.2d at 555. <em>See also Rogers v. State, </em>89 Md. 424, 43 A. 922 (1899). In <em>Rogers, </em>a brother and sister were both being simultaneously interrogated about a homicide. The brother confessed to the murder after having been told by police \u201cif your sister is innocent you are the only one who knows so, and it is your duty as a man to tell what you know about it____\u201d 89 Md. at 426-27, 43 A. at 923. This Court upheld the admissibility of the confession because there was neither threat, promise, nor any <em>quid pro quo </em>posited by the police officer\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>In the instant case, Norman made no express or implied threat or promise to take official action or refrain from taking official action depending on whether Reynolds made a statement. Thus, \u201cwhere no express or implied promise or threat is made by the police, a suspect\u2019s belief that his cooperation will benefit a relative will not invalidate the ... [statement].\u201d <em>Stokes v. State, </em>289 Md. at 162, 423 A.2d at 555-56 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>People v. Steger, </em>16 Cal.3d 539, 128 Cal.Rptr. 161, 168, 546 P.2d 665, 672 (1976) <em>(en banc). See also Finke v. State, </em>56 Md.App. 450, 485-86, 468 A.2d 353, 371-72 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>299 Md. 425, 474 A.2d 218, <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1043, 105 S.Ct. 529, 83 L.Ed.2d 416 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Reynolds does not contend that Corporal Norman was untruthful when he relayed Crystal\u2019s concern that her allegations might not be believed. Merely relaying this to Reynolds was not an \u201cimproper\u201d inducement. <em>See Wright v. State, </em>307 Md. 552, 515 A.2d 1157 (1986) (discussing inducements and the requirement that an inducement be \u201cimproper.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">At most, Norman implied that, by confessing, Reynolds would allay Crystal\u2019s self-doubt and concern that no one would believe her. This may have triggered Reynolds\u2019 \u201csense of altruism,\u201d but it was not the type of inducement that would mandate suppression. There was no promise or threat of official action if Reynolds did not confess. The trial judge did not err in refusing to suppress the second confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">In sum, we do not find that any action on the part of the prosecutor or the police investigator subverted Reynolds\u2019 freedom to decide whether or not to make his incriminating statements. What Reynolds told Norman\u2014and what was used eventually at his trial\u2014was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

The suspect in that case had been urged to \"help himself by considering his own interests against those of his codefendants.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-9\">\"When the benefit pointed out by the police to a suspect is merely that which flows naturally from a truthful and honest course of conduct, we can perceive nothing improper in such police activity. On the other hand, if in addition to the foregoing benefit, or in the place thereof, the defendant is given to understand that he might reasonably expect benefits in the nature of more lenient treatment at the hands of the police, prosecution or court in consideration of making a statement, even a truthful one, such motivation is deemed to render the statement involuntary and inadmissible.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-10\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b559-6\">. Had Hill truly embarked on a course of offering legal advice to Reynolds that induced him to confess, she might have crossed the line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>into impermissible conduct. In <em>Martin v. Wainwright, </em>770 F.2d 918, 927 (11th Cir.1985), <em>modified, </em>781 F.2d 185, <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 909, 107 S.Ct. 307, 93 L.Ed.2d 281 (1986), the court said it was \u201ctroubled\u201d by allegations that an assistant state\u2019s attorney named Jack Scarola gave legal \"advice\" to a criminal suspect being interrogated.
