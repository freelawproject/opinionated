Sykes, Jr., filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, seeking money damages from Alfred H. Hall and Nationwide Insurance Company. The plaintiff alleged that he is a bus driver for the Mass Transit Administration (\u201cMTA\u201d), that on September 25, 1986, at about 6:45 a.m., the plaintiff was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>operating an MTA bus \u201cin a normal and prudent manner\u201d in an easterly direction on Liberty Heights Avenue in Baltimore City, that the plaintiff stopped the bus at the intersection of Liberty Heights Avenue and Granada Avenue because of traffic, and that \u201cwhile stopped, a vehicle owned and operated by the Defendant, Alfred H. Hall, in a reckless and negligent manner in an easterly direction on Liberty Heights Avenue, struck the Plaintiffs vehicle in the rear.\u201d The complaint went on to set forth several specific respects in which Mr. Hall was negligent. It further alleged that the plaintiff was free of contributory negligence, that as a result of the collision the plaintiff \u201cwas thrown about the interior of the vehicle, striking various parts of his body on stationary objects therein,\u201d and that the plaintiff suffered head and body injuries and pain, was required to incur medical expenses, and was prevented from working for a considerable period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The complaint asserted that Mr. Hall was an uninsured motorist. In addition, it was claimed that the plaintiff lived in the same household with his wife, that Nationwide Insurance Company had issued to the plaintiffs wife an automobile insurance policy on two motor vehicles at the household, and that the plaintiff, as a family member residing in the household, was an insured under the policy. According to the plaintiff, he timely notified the defendant Nationwide that the defendant Hall was uninsured. The plaintiff made a claim under the policy for uninsured motorist benefits, but Nationwide \u201crefused and continues to refuse to honor the Plaintiffs claim under the Uninsured Motorist provision____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Following some discovery, the defendant Nationwide filed a motion for summary judgment. In the motion and accompanying memorandum, Nationwide acknowledged that the bus driven by the plaintiff had been struck by a vehicle driven by Mr. Hall, that Mr. Hall was an uninsured motorist, that the plaintiffs wife was the insured named in the declarations of a Nationwide automobile insurance policy, and that the plaintiff was a member of the named insured\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>household. Nationwide asserted, however, that the plaintiff was an excluded driver pursuant to Art. 48A, \u00a7 240C-1, that as a named excluded driver under the statute, the plaintiff \u201cis not an insured,\u201d and that \u201c[d]ue to the exclusion ..., Nationwide is not liable for any personal injuries or other damages, losses or claims incurred by Ruthard Sykes----\u201d Nationwide argued that a recovery by the plaintiff under the circumstances would \u201cdefeat the purposes\u201d of the named driver exclusion provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">In his opposition to Nationwide\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the plaintiff did not deny that he had been excluded pursuant to Art. 48A, \u00a7 240C-1, but he argued that under the insurance policy and the statute, the exclusion did not apply in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The circuit court initially granted Nationwide\u2019s motion for summary judgment without an opinion and without stating any reasons. Subsequently, upon the plaintiff\u2019s request for reconsideration, the circuit judge on December 12, 1989, filed an opinion and order reiterating that the insurer\u2019s motion for summary judgment was granted. The circuit judge indicated that her ruling was based entirely on the provisions of Art. 48A, \u00a7 240C-1, and the legislative policy underlying the section. The circuit judge concluded \u201cthat Plaintiff, as the excluded driver under his wife\u2019s policy, is excluded from <em>all coverage, </em>including uninsured motorist coverage of any and all injuries sustained by him when he is the driver of any motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">The circuit court\u2019s December 12, 1989, ruling in favor of Nationwide was not final under Maryland Rules 2-601 and 2-602(a) because the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the uninsured motorist Hall was still pending. Thereafter, on June 27, 1990, the circuit court entered pursuant to Rule 2-602(b) a final judgment in favor of Nationwide. The plaintiff took an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and, prior to oral argument in that court, we issued a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Preliminarily, it is clear that, except to the extent affected by the named driver exclusion pursuant to Art. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>48A, \u00a7 240C-1, the plaintiff at the time of the accident was an insured under Nationwide\u2019s insurance policy issued on the two motor vehicles and listing the plaintiff\u2019s wife as the insured.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the definitional part of the insurance policy provides in relevant part as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2B\">\u201cDEFINITIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-5\">\u201cThe language of this insurance policy includes certain common words for easy understanding. They have exactly defined meanings, however. In this policy:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">\u201c1. the words \u2018YOU\u2019 and \u2018YOUR\u2019 mean or refer to the policyholder first named in the attached Declarations, <em>and include that policyholder\u2019s spouse if living in the same household.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-9\">\u201c3. the words \u2018THE INSURED\u2019, \u2018AN INSURED\u2019, and \u2018ANY INSURED\u2019 mean or refer to the persons and organizations specifically indicated as entitled to protection under the coverage being described.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">The uninsured motorist coverage portion of the policy states (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-11\">\u201cUnder this coverage we will pay all sums for bodily injury and property damage that <em>you </em>or your legal representative are legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or driver of an uninsured motor vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtP\">As \u201cyou\u201d is defined as including the \u201cpolicyholder\u2019s spouse if living in the same household,\u201d the plaintiff was clearly covered for purposes of uninsured motorist insurance. In addition, the uninsured motorist coverage portion of the policy went on to provide specifically that \u201c[rjelatives living <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>in your household also are covered for bodily injury damages under this coverage.\u201d As the plaintiff was married to and living in the same household with the named insured Darlene Sykes, he was an insured for the purposes of uninsured motorist coverage under this language in the policy. <em>See Forbes v. Harleysville Mutual, </em>322 Md. 689, 703-705, 589 A.2d 944, 951-953 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">Moreover, with regard to a family motor vehicle insurance policy, the Maryland Insurance Code itself contemplates that ordinarily a member of the named insured\u2019s family, living in the same household, is also an insured under the policy. <em>See, e.g., </em>Art. 48A, \u00a7\u00a7 240AA(a), 240C-1(a)(1), 240C\u2014l(a)(l)(iii), 240C-l(b)(2)(iii), 539(b)(l)(i), 541(c)(2)(v), 545(c); <em>Forbes v. Harleysville Mutual, supra, </em>322 Md. at 704, 589 A.2d at 951.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Turning to the scope of the named driver exclusion pursuant to \u00a7 240C-1, the circuit court interpreted the statutory provision to mean that an excluded individual is excluded from all coverage under the policy when he is the driver of <em>any </em>vehicle whatsoever. Nationwide\u2019s position, both in the circuit court and in this Court, is that the exclusion under \u00a7 240C-1 is even broader than the circuit court believed it to be. Nationwide argues that an excluded individual under \u00a7 240C-1 is not an insured under the policy for any purpose. Neither the circuit court\u2019s nor Nationwide\u2019s interpretation can be squared with the statutory language and legislative purpose underlying \u00a7 240C-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The first part of \u00a7 240C-l(a)(l) deals with the situation where an insurer is authorized to cancel, nonrenew, or increase the premiums on an automobile liability insurance policy because of the claim experience or driving record of one or more but less than all residents of the household. It requires that, in lieu of cancellation, nonrenewal or premium increase, the insurer shall offer to exclude all coverages when the automobile is operated by the individual whose claim experience or driving record would have justified the cancellation or nonrenewal. The first part of \u00a7 240C-l(b)(l) deals with the initial issuance of an automobile liability <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>insurance policy, and it authorizes the insurer to issue the policy with coverage excluded when the motor vehicle is operated by the person whose claim experience or driving record could have justified a refusal to issue the policy. The remaining language of both subsections (a) and (b) is substantially the same, and it delineates the precise scope of the exclusion. Section 240C-l(a) thus provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-5\">\u201cThe policy may be endorsed to specifically exclude all coverage for any of the following when the named excluded driver is operating the motor vehicle(s) covered under the policy whether or not that operation or use was with the express or implied permission of a person insured under the policy:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-6\">(1) The excluded operator or user;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-7\">(ii) The vehicle owner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">(iii) Family members residing in the household of the excluded operator or user or vehicle owner; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">(iv) Any other person, except for the coverage required by \u00a7\u00a7 539 and 541(c)(2) of this article if such coverage is not available under any other automobile policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-10\">(2) The premiums charged on any policy excluding a named driver or drivers under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not reflect the claims experience or driving record of the excluded named driver or drivers.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"Arug\">Under the plain language of \u00a7 240C-1, coverage for the \u201cexcluded operator or user\u201d is excluded only \u201cwhen the named excluded driver is operating the motor vehicle(s) covered under the policy.\u201d The plaintiff Sykes was not operating either of the 1981 Ford automobiles covered under the policy, and therefore uninsured motorist coverage for him was not excluded. <em>Cf. Neale v. Wright, </em>322 Md. 8, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>21-23, 585 A.2d 196, 202-203 (1991) (the excluded driver was operating the insured vehicle, and therefore the insurer was not liable on a negligent entrustment theory); <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. v. Miller, </em>305 Md. 614, 619-620, 505 A.2d 1338, 1340 (1986) (the excluded driver was operating the insured vehicle; therefore the insurance company was not liable to an injured passenger).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">The limitation upon the scope of the exclusion authorized by \u00a7 240C-1 is confirmed by the language of \u00a7 541(c) relating specifically to permissible exclusions of uninsured motorist coverage. Section 541(c)(2)(v) states as follows (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-5\">\u201c(v) In no case shall the uninsured motorist coverage be less than the coverage afforded a qualified person under Article 48A, \u00a7\u00a7 243H and 243-1. However, the insurer may exclude from coverage benefits for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b318-6\">\u201c1. The named insured or members of his family residing in the household when occupying, or struck as a pedestrian by, an uninsured motor vehicle that is owned by the named insured or a member of his immediate family residing in his household; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8Z\">\u201c2. The named insured, members of his family residing in the household, and all other persons having other applicable automobile insurance and occupying, or struck as a pedestrian by, <em>the insured motor vehicle operated or used by a person excluded from coverage under \u00a7 240C-1 of this article. </em>The coverage required under this subsection shall be primary to any right to recovery from the Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund pursuant to \u00a7 243H of this article.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Section 541(c) does not authorize an exclusion from uninsured motorist benefits under the circumstances of the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">We have pointed out that the purpose of the named driver exclusion authorized by \u00a7 240C-1 of the Insurance Code was to allow a family automobile to become or to remain insured by excluding from the policy a member of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>the household whose driving record warrants nonissuance, cancellation or nonrenewal of the policy. <em>Neale v. Wright, supra, </em>322 Md. at 21, 585 A.2d at 202; <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. v. Miller, supra, </em>305 Md. at 619-620, 505 A.2d at 1340. The purpose \u201c \u2018was to exclude risks arising from the named person\u2019s negligence in driving the [insured] car.\u2019 \u201d <em>Neale v. Wright, supra, </em>322 Md. at 23, 585 A.2d at 203, quoting <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. Co. v. Miller, supra, </em>305 Md. at 618, 505 A.2d at 1340. The present case does not involve a risk arising from the plaintiff\u2019s negligent driving of an insured vehicle. Instead, it involves a risk arising from the plaintiff\u2019s non-negligent presence in another vehicle. With regard to the purpose of the named driver exclusion, the plaintiff is in the same position as an innocent pedestrian who is struck by an uninsured motorist. If it turns out after trial, however, that the plaintiff was guilty of negligence contributing to the accident, he will not be able to recover either against the uninsured motorist or against Nationwide under the uninsured motorist coverage. <em>See, e.g., Lane v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>321 Md. 165, 173-174, 582 A.2d 501, 505 (1990); <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. v. Webb, </em>291 Md. 721, 732-738, 436 A.2d 465, 472-475 (1981). Nevertheless, it would be entirely inconsistent with the purpose of \u00a7 240C-1 to hold that there is no uninsured motorist coverage under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Therefore, the circuit court erred in holding that the plaintiff was excluded from uninsured motorist coverage under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

While the policy lists the plaintiffs wife as the insured and her home address, it does not indicate the ownership of the vehicles. Nothing else in the record indicates whether the vehicles were titled in the wife\u2019s name, in the husband\u2019s name, jointly, or one titled in the wife\u2019s name and one in the husband\u2019s name. Under the circumstances here, however, these questions of titling are not pertinent to the issue in the case. <em>Cf. Neale v.
