Approximately five and a half months prior to Jeffrey\u2019s birth, Kelly married Danny Whist-ed (Danny). Before her marriage, Kelly was also involved in a relationship with William Turner (Turner). Jeffrey was conceived during the time Kelly was seeing Turner, and Kelly, on at least two occasions, wrote to Turner that he was her child\u2019s father. Despite these letters, Jeffrey was given the Whisted name and Danny Whisted was listed as father on Jeffrey\u2019s birth certificate. Six months after Jeffrey was born, Kelly left her husband and renewed her relationship with Turner. Despite the separation, Danny continued to visit Jeffrey on a regular basis and to pay support for his care and maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">The relationship between Kelly and Turner continued for eighteen months, during which time Turner appears to have developed a relationship with Jeffrey. When Kelly and Turner broke up once again, Turner\u2019s contact with Jeffrey ended. Turner then filed a \u201cComplaint for Visitation\u201d in the Circuit Court for Harford County, naming Kelly Whist-ed as defendant and seeking visitation with Jeffrey. Pursu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>ant to Maryland Code (1974, 1991 Repl.Vol.), Estates and Trusts Article, \u00a7 l-206(a), which provides that \u201c[a] child born or conceived during a marriage is presumed to be the legitimate child of both spouses,\u201d Jeffrey is presumed to be the legitimate child of Danny Whisted. Apparently recognizing this presumption, Turner later amended his complaint naming Danny Whisted as an additional defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">In addition, Turner filed a \u201cMotion for Blood Test\u201d to establish that he was Jeffrey\u2019s biological father. The Whisteds, each by separate counsel, filed a Motion to Strike Turner\u2019s Motion for Blood Test. The circuit court assumed Turner\u2019s request for blood tests to be pursuant to Md.Code (1984, 1991 Repl.Vol.), Family Law Art., \u00a7 5-1029, (Family Law Article, Title 5, Subtitle 10 will hereinafter be referred to as the \u201cpaternity statute\u201d). The court ruled that mandatory blood tests under \u00a7 5-1029 were not available to Turner for the purpose of rebutting Jeffrey\u2019s presumed legitimacy. Consequently, the court denied Turner\u2019s motion for blood tests and granted the Whisteds\u2019 motions to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Thereafter, Danny Whisted filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on the ground of laches, in which Kelly Whisted joined. The circuit court granted the motion and Turner appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. The intermediate appellate court, in an unreported opinion, disagreed with the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of the action by summary judgment, finding that the issue of \u201cwhether [Turner had] delayed too long in seeking visitation was very much in dispute.\u201d Accordingly, that court remanded the case to the circuit court for a resolution of the conflicting evidence related to the extent of Turner\u2019s delay in bringing his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The Court of Special Appeals then looked to the remaining issue of whether Turner was entitled to have all of the parties submit to a blood test. Viewing the Motion for Blood Test in the same posture as did the circuit court, the intermediate appellate court agreed that Turner \u201cmay not initially use the blood test provisions of the paternity statute to overcome the presumption of legitimacy of the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>herein.\u201d We granted Turner\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari to determine:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">\u201cWhether a male individual who claims to be the father of a child born to a married couple is entitled to petition a circuit court for a blood test to determine paternity for the purpose of determining whether said male individual is the biological father of the child when the child was conceived prior to the marriage of said married couple.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AAK\">Initially we note that neither Turner\u2019s Complaint for Visitation nor his Motion for Blood Test contains a single reference to the paternity statute. Indeed, as a result of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s refusal to consent to Turner\u2019s action under the paternity statute, Turner invoked the equitable powers of the court to grant visitation. As grounds for his Motion for Blood Test, Turner cites \u00a7 1-208 of the Estates &amp; Trusts Article and this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Thomas v. Solis, </em>263 Md. 536, 283 A.2d 777 (1971). Md.Code (1974, 1991 RepLVol.), Estates &amp; Trusts Art., \u00a7 1-208 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">\u201c(b) <em>Child of his </em>father.\u2014A child born to parents who have not participated in a marriage ceremony with each other shall be considered to be the child of his father only if the father</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">(1) Has been judicially determined to be the father in an action brought under the statutes relating to paternity proceedings; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-8\">(2) Has acknowledged himself, in writing, to be the father; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-9\">(3) Has openly and notoriously recognized the child to be his child; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-10\">(4) Has subsequently married the mother and has acknowledged himself, orally or in writing, to be the father.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-11\">In <em>Thomas, </em>an unwed father, wishing to protect his visitation rights and to assure entitlement to notice of any attempted adoption of the child, sought a declaratory judgment that he was the child\u2019s natural father. This Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>held that compliance with any of the four methods set forth in \u00a7 1-208 of the Estates &amp; Trusts Article was sufficient to achieve this end. 263 Md. at 544, 283 A.2d at 781.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Referring to \u00a7 1-208 of the Estates &amp; Trusts Article, we have on several occasions</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANe\">\u201cindicated that a \u2018liberal interpretation\u2019 of our legitimation statute was essential; that it was \u2018not limited in its scope and application to matters of inheritance only\u2019 but was legally sufficient \u2018to establish other rights, ... arising from the relationship existing between parent and legitimate issue,\u2019 ... and that the status sought by the father was afforded to him by compliance with the legitimation statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-6\"><em>Bridges v. Nicely, </em>304 Md. 1, 7-8, 497 A.2d 142, 145 (1985), quoting <em>Thomas, </em>263 Md. at 542, 283 A.2d at 780. <em>See also Dawson v. Eversberg, </em>257 Md. 308, 262 A.2d 729 (1970). Consequently, we believe that Turner, alleging that Jeffrey was a child \u201cborn to parents who have not participated in a marriage ceremony with each other,\u201d quite properly cited \u00a7 1-208 of the Estates &amp; Trusts Article as a basis upon which he could seek to establish his status as Jeffrey\u2019s natural father.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">Most recently in <em>Taxiera v. Malkus, </em>320 Md. 471, 578 A.2d 761 (1990), this Court implicitly recognized that paternity could be established by a statutory action in a paternity proceeding under the Family Law Article or in an equitable action under the Estates &amp; Trusts Article. In <em>Taxiera, </em>we noted the reciprocal references in the two articles. Section 5-1005 of the Family Law Article states: \u201cAn equity court may determine the legitimacy of a child pursuant to \u00a7 1-208 of the Estates &amp; Trusts Article.\u201d Conversely, \u00a7 1-208 provides that one way to legitimize a child is if the father \u201c[h]as been judicially determined to be the father in an action brought under the statutes relating to paternity proceedings.\u201d 320 Md. at 478-79, 578 A.2d at 764. Thus, the legislature offered a choice of actions by which one could seek to establish paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>Indeed, over two decades earlier, the Court acknowledged that one might seek a declaration of paternity under either the paternity statute or in equity. In <em>Shelley v. Smith, </em>249 Md. 619, 241 A.2d 682 (1968), the Court could</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AU2\">\u201csee no reason why the child\u2019s rights to inherit from M should in any respect depend on whether M\u2019s paternity was established in a paternity proceeding pursuant to [the paternity statute] or in an equity proceeding like the case at bar. And if that be so then <em>the rules of evidence controlling the proof of paternity ought to be the same in either case.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 630, 241 A.2d at 688. <em>See also Staley v. Staley, </em>25 Md.App. 99, 103-04, 335 A.2d 114, 118, <em>cert. denied, </em>275 Md. 755 (1975). Consequently, we believe that \u00a7 1-208 of the Estates &amp; Trusts Article provides an alternate avenue by which one could seek blood tests for the purpose of establishing paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">For the reasons set forth below, in those cases where two men each acknowledge paternity of the same child, we believe that an action to establish paternity is more appropriately brought under the Estates &amp; Trusts Article. As advanced by this Court in <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Dawson, </em>the Estates &amp; Trusts Article presents the \u201cmore satisfactory\u201d and \u201cless traumatic\u201d means of establishing paternity. <em>Thomas, </em>263 Md. at 544, 283 A.2d at 781; <em>Dawson, </em>257 Md. at 314, 262 A.2d at 732. In Turner\u2019s attempt to establish paternity under the Estates &amp; Trusts Article, he had to rebut the presumption that Jeffrey was the legitimate child of Kelly and Danny Whisted. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1974, 1991 Repl.Vol.), Estates &amp; Trusts Art., \u00a7 1-206. A motion for blood tests made under the Estates &amp; Trusts Article is best analyzed as a request for a physical examination under Maryland Rule 2-423,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the court has discretion to grant or deny the blood tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>As a discovery request, the court may order the blood tests on motion for good cause shown. The Whisteds\u2019 legitimate interests in privacy must be considered along with Turner\u2019s relationship with Jeffrey. In <em>Michael H. v. Gerald D., </em>491 U.S. 110, 109 S.Ct. 2333, 105 L.Ed.2d 91, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>492 U.S. 937, 110 S.Ct. 22, 106 L.Ed.2d 634 (1989), the Supreme Court was presented with a factual situation analogous to the instant case. While married to Gerald D., Carol D. had an adulterous affair with Michael H. and sometime later a child, Victoria, was born. Michael H. and Carol D., without Gerald\u2019s knowledge, had blood tests performed which conclusively established that Michael H. was Victoria\u2019s biological father. Michael H. filed an action to establish paternity and for visitation. A California statute created a conclusive presumption that a child born to a married woman living with her husband is a child of the marriage, and the statute denied Michael H. the right to prove he was Victoria\u2019s father. Michael H. contended the California statute violated his due process rights by denying him the opportunity to rebut the presumption of legitimacy. A majority of the Supreme Court upheld the California presumption and held Michael H. had no constitutionally protected right to establish his paternity of Victoria. In a plurality opinion authored by Justice Scalia and joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist, and in part by Justice O\u2019Connor and Justice Kennedy, the Court noted that there was a common law presumption of legitimacy and that society has historically protected the integrity of the marital family unit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>from claims of paternity by other men. The rationale was based on the promotion of family harmony, as well as a reluctance to declare the children of a married woman illegitimate. 491 U.S. at 125, 109 S.Ct. at 2343, 105 L.Ed.2d at 107. The opinion further pointed out that \u201cto <em>provide </em>protection to an adulterous natural father is to <em>deny </em>protection to a marital father, and vice versa.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 491 U.S. at 130, 109 S.Ct. at 2345, 105 L.Ed.2d at 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Justice Brennan in a dissenting opinion noted that \u201c[f]ive Members of the Court refuse to foreclose \u2018the possibility that a natural father might ever have a constitutionally protected interest in his relationship with a child whose mother was married to and cohabiting with another man at the time of the child\u2019s conception and birth.\u2019 \u201d 491 U.S. at 136, 109 S.Ct. at 2349, 105 L.Ed.2d at 114 (dissenting opinion). Justice Brennan pointed out that on four prior occasions, the Supreme Court had considered whether unwed fathers have a constitutionally protected interest in a relationship with their children. <em>See Stanley v. Illinois, </em>405 U.S. 645, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972); <em>Quilloin v. Walcott, </em>434 U.S. 246, 98 S.Ct. 549, 54 L.Ed.2d 511 (1978); <em>Caban v. Mohammed, </em>441 U.S. 380, 99 S.Ct. 1760, 60 L.Ed.2d 297 (1979); <em>Lehr v. Robertson, </em>463 U.S. 248, 103 S.Ct. 2985, 77 L.Ed.2d 614 (1983). Justice Brennan observed that these cases</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-5\">\u201cproduced a unifying theme: although an unwed father\u2019s biological link to his child does not, in and of itself, guarantee him a constitutional stake in his relationship with that child, such a link combined with a substantial parent-child relationship will do so. \u2018When an unwed father demonstrates a full commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood by \u201ccom[ing] forward to participate in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>the rearing of his child,\u201d ... his interest in personal contact with his child acquires substantial protection under the Due Process Clause.\u2019 \u201d (Citations and footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-5\"><em>Michael H., </em>491 U.S. at 142-43, 109 S.Ct. at 2352, 105 L.Ed.2d at 118-19, quoting <em>Lehr, </em>463 U.S. at 261, 103 S.Ct. at 2993, 77 L.Ed.2d at 626, in turn quoting <em>Caban, </em>441 U.S. at 392, 99 S.Ct. at 1768, 60 L.Ed.2d at 307.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">We believe that a trial court ought to be able to consider and balance the different interests that were separately recognized by the majority and the dissent in <em>Michael H. </em>A discovery request for blood tests allows the court to weigh these competing interests. Most significantly, the determination of good cause allows the court discretion to consider the best interests of the child. <em>Matter of Marriage of Ross, </em>245 Kan. 591, 783 P.2d 331, 338 (1989) (\u201cPrior to ordering a blood test to determine whether the presumed parent is the biological parent, the district court must consider the best interests of the child____\u201d); <em>McDaniels v. Carlson, </em>108 Wash.2d 299, 738 P.2d 254, 261 (1987) (where child is presumed legitimate, best interests of the child should be considered before ordering blood tests).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">While Jeffrey is not a party to the action, Rule 2-423 permits the physical examination of a party \u00f3r a \u201cperson in the custody or under the legal control of a party.\u201d Consequently, the court might even appoint counsel to represent Jeffrey\u2019s interests if it believes that those interests might be compromised by the blood test. If Jeffrey\u2019s best interests would be jeopardized by submitting to a blood test, the child\u2019s representative may then request a protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">The criteria for determining the child\u2019s best interests in cases of disputed paternity include consideration of the stability of the child\u2019s current home environment, whether there is an ongoing family unit, and the child\u2019s physical, mental, and emotional needs. An important consideration is the child\u2019s past relationship with the putative father. <em>Ross, </em>245 Kan. 591, 783 P.2d at 338; <em>McDaniels, </em>738 P.2d at 262. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Finally, other factors might even include the child\u2019s ability to ascertain genetic information for the purpose of medical treatment and genealogical history.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">On remand, the trial court should consider the extent of Turner\u2019s commitment to the responsibilities of parenthood, and balance his interest in establishing his status as Jeffrey\u2019s natural father against the Whisteds\u2019 interest in protecting the integrity of the familial relationships already formed. This balance of interests should be considered in connection with the court\u2019s paramount concern of protecting Jeffrey\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Turner\u2019s motion for blood tests of all parties is impeded, but not absolutely precluded, by the presumption that Jeffrey is the legitimate child of Danny Whisted. Not being prohibited from granting the motion solely because of the presumption of legitimacy, the trial court could have, and should have, held a hearing to determine whether ordering the blood tests would be contrary to Jeffrey\u2019s best interests. <em>See </em>Traci Dallas, <em>Rebutting the Marital Presumption: A Developed Relationship Test, </em>88 Colum.L.Rev. 369, 383 (1988) (\u201cAll putative fathers should be afforded a preliminary hearing to determine whether [a developed] relationship exists.\u201d) Accordingly, the Court of Special Appeals was in error in its determination that blood tests could not be used to rebut the legitimacy presumption. The issue of laches is not before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HARFORD COUNTY AND TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR HARFORD COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

I do not agree, however, with the majority\u2019s statement that when two men claim paternity of a child, their dispute is more appropriately resolved under the Maryland Code (1974,1991 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 1-201 <em>et seq. </em>of the Estates and Trusts Article, rather than the Code (1984,1991 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-1001 <em>et seq. </em>of the Family Law Article. In addition, I dissent from the Court\u2019s position that Mr. Turner must prove that a declaration of paternity is in the child\u2019s best interests before blood tests pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-423 will be ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The majority states (at 113):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-8\">\u201cin those cases where two men each acknowledge paternity of the same child, we believe that an action to establish paternity is more appropriately brought under the Estates &amp; Trusts Article. As advanced by this Court in <em>Thomas [v. Solis, </em>263 Md. 536, 544, 283 A.2d 777, 781 (1971)] and <em>Dawson [v. Eversberg, </em>257 Md. 308, 314, 262 A.2d 729, 732 (1970)], the Estates <em>&amp; </em>Trusts Article presents the \u2018more satisfactory and less traumatic\u2019 means of establishing paternity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">In \u00a7 l-208(b) of the Estates and Trusts Article, the General Assembly set forth methods by which a natural father of a child born out of wedlock can legitimate his child. Section l-208(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-10\"><em>\u201cChild of his father. </em>A child born to parents who have not participated in a marriage ceremony with each other shall be considered to be the child of his father only if the father</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-11\">(1) Has been judicially determined to be the father in an action brought under the statutes relating to paternity proceedings; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>(2) Has acknowledged himself, in writing, to be the father; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-5\">(3) Has openly and notoriously recognized the child to be his child; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-6\">(4) Has subsequently married the mother and has acknowledged himself, orally or in writing, to be the father.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">This portion of the statute presumes that the child being legitimated is in fact \u201c[a] child born to parents who have not participated in a marriage ceremony with each other.\u201d That is, the child\u2019s natural parents are the mother and the man seeking to legitimate the child. It does not contemplate or provide a mechanism for the resolution of a dispute over who the natural parents are.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">In prior cases, this Court has held that the legitimation statute, now codified in the Estates and Trusts Article, can provide a means for a man to establish legally a parent/child relationship. Nevertheless, each of the cases relied upon by the majority for the proposition that the legitimation statute is capable of securing rights other than inheritance, involve situations in which there was no dispute as to who was the natural father of the child, and in which the natural father sought to legitimate his children who were born out of wedlock.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">For example, in <em>Thomas v. Solis, supra, </em>Thomas fathered three children out of wedlock. He sought to legitimate the children after their mother married another man in order to protect his visitation rights and to prevent the mother\u2019s husband from adopting Thomas\u2019 children without his consent. 263 Md. at 538, 283 A.2d at 778. At no point did anyone suggest that Thomas was not the children\u2019s natural father. It was in this context that the Court held that the legitimation statute \u201cshould certainly be of sufficient legal validity to establish other rights ... arising from the relationship existing between parent and legitimate issue.\u201d 263 Md. at 542, 283 A.2d at 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Similarly in <em>Dawson v. Eversberg, supra, </em>the natural father of children born out of wedlock had been declared to be their father in an action brought by the mother under the paternity statute, presently codified in the Family Law Article. In order to ensure that the children would be his legitimate heirs, the natural father filed an adoption proceeding. This Court suggested that when the objective was legitimation, the legitimation statute, rather than the adoption statute, provided a \u201cless traumatic approach\u201d for accomplishing that goal. 257 Md. at 314, 262 A.2d at 732. <em>See also Bridges v. Nicely, </em>304 Md. 1, 497 A.2d 142 (1985) (natural father, declared to be the father in a paternity action, sought to adopt his child). In each of these cases, a paternity action had already determined that the child had been \u201cbom to parents who had not participated in a marriage ceremony with each other.\u201d \u00a7 l-208(b) of the Estates and Trusts Article. Thereafter, the natural father was able to use the Estates and Trusts provisions to legitimate the children and to secure the rights stemming from their legitimacy for himself and for the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">None of these cases involved a dispute between two men, each of whom claimed to be the natural father. Cases of disputed paternity are more appropriately resolved under the Family Law Article. <em>Cf. Taxiera v. Malkus, </em>320 Md. 471, 578 A.2d 761 (1990) (putative father\u2019s estate disputed paternity for purposes of inheritance, and the paternity action proceeded under the Family Law Article instead of the Estates and Trusts Article).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">In this case, Mr. Turner and Mr. Whisted each has a basis under the Estates and Trusts Article for asserting that he is the child\u2019s father. Mr. Turner claims that the child, Jeffrey, was \u201cborn to parents who have not participated in a marriage ceremony with each other,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>Mr. Turner and Mrs. Whisted, and that he acknowledged the child as his own in compliance with \u00a7 l-208(b). By filing this action asserting that he is the father, seeking blood tests and seeking visitation, Mr. Turner satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 l-208(b)(2) in that he has acknowledged himself, in writ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>ing, to be the father. <em>See Thomas v. Solis, supra, </em>263 Md. at 544, 283 A.2d at 781 (acknowledgment of child in pleading satisfied both \u00a7 l-208(b)(2) and (b)(3)); <em>Hall v. Coates, </em>62 Md.App. 252, 260, 489 A.2d 41, 45-46 (1985); <em>Skeens v. Paterno, </em>60 Md.App. 48, 58, 480 A.2d 820, 825, <em>cert. denied, </em>301 Md. 639, 484 A.2d 274 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">On the other hand, Mr. Whisted claims that Jeffrey was \u201cborn or, conceived during the marriage\u201d and, therefore, under \u00a7 1-206 of the Estates and Trusts Article, is \u201cpresumed to be the legitimate child\u201d of Mr. and Mrs. Whisted. In order for \u00a7 l-208(b) of the Estates and Trusts Article to have a logical application, there cannot be a dispute as to whether the \u201cparents\u201d were married at the time of conception or birth. The provisions of the Estates and Trusts Article, because they were not designed to resolve an adversarial dispute between two men claiming paternity, require an assumption as to who is the natural father before a determination can be made concerning which section of the statute applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Because the Estates and Trusts Article presumes knowledge of the identity of the natural father before its legitimation procedures become meaningful, I cannot agree that the legitimation provisions of the Estates and Trusts Article are better suited to resolve a dispute between two men each claiming to be the natural father. It seems to me that the paternity provisions of the Family Law Article were better designed to resolve disputes over the identity of the natural father. Nonetheless, because the General Assembly clearly intended that there be a judicial mechanism for resolving disputes over paternity, and as no action was brought under the Family Law Article in this case, I do not dissent from the remand to afford Mr. Turner an opportunity to establish his paternity under the Estates and Trusts Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">According to the majority, in order to resolve this dispute between a man presumed to be the father and a man who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>has acknowledged his paternity under \u00a7 l-208(b), the man seeking paternity may ask for blood tests under Maryland Rule 2-423 to determine who is the natural father.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">In all other cases, blood tests, like other mental or physical examinations, are available upon a showing of \u201cgood cause.\u201d Rule 2-423; <em>Hutzell v. Boyer, </em>252 Md. 227, 249 A.2d 449 (1969); <em>Roberts v. Roberts, </em>198 Md. 299, 82 A.2d 120 (1951). In order to establish \u201cgood cause\u201d the party requesting blood tests must demonstrate that the mental or physical character or condition of another party is material to an issue in the case. <em>Roberts v. Roberts, supra, </em>198 Md. at 302, 82 A.2d at 122. Obviously, in the present case, the blood test results would be material to the determination of who is Jeffrey\u2019s natural father. Moreover, because the status of natural father gives rise to a presumption that the best interests of the child are served by allowing the natural father visitation, the information obtained by the blood tests is also material to Mr. Turner\u2019s request for visitation. <em>Ross v. Hoffman, </em>280 Md. 172, 178, 372 A.2d 582, 586-587 (1977); <em>Ross v. Pick, </em>199 Md. 341, 351, 86 A.2d 463, 468 (1952). <em>See also Lipiano v. Lipiano, </em>89 Md.App. 571, 577-578, 598 A.2d 854, 857-858 (1991), <em>cert. denied, </em>325 Md. 620, 602 A.2d 710 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">The majority opinion, however, imposes a significant burden on a man who has acknowledged paternity as required by the Estates and Trusts Article, before blood tests can be performed. According to the majority, in order to prove \u201cgood cause\u201d for blood tests, the alleged father must demonstrate, not that the results of the tests are material to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>disputed issue, but rather that it is in the child\u2019s best interests for the court to make a determination as to paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The majority has simply changed the law in a particular class of cases. The motivation for this departure apparently is the desire to avoid a result which the majority perceives as an evil, to be rectified by judicial fiat, namely the declaration that a man, other than a married woman\u2019s husband, is the father of her child. Because the determination of the identity of the natural father of this child could lead to the natural father having some rights with respect to that child, and because such rights may impinge upon the \u201cintegrity of familial relationships already formed,\u201d the majority has reconstructed the principles which govern the resolution of disputes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Normally a dispute is resolved after the relevant facts are ascertained and the pertinent law is applied. Under the majority\u2019s construction, in this limited class of cases, sometimes the most relevant facts will not be ascertained in order to prevent an unsatisfactory resolution of the dispute. The father may bring an action to determine paternity but, in some cases, may not have access to the most germane evidence available to resolve this dispute, namely the results of the blood tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">Nevertheless, according to the majority, if the man can prove that it is in the best interests of the child for him to be declared the father, blood tests will be provided. The majority has formulated a procedure whereby the trial court must determine the ultimate result, in order to discover whether that result is satisfactory, before it can ascertain the facts. If the court decides that it likes the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>predicted ultimate result, then the fact finding process continues. If the court decides that it does not like the predicted ultimate result, the process ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">I cannot subscribe to the proposition that relevant, ascertainable evidence should be excluded because it may lead to a result which the court does not like. The trial court\u2019s conjecture over whether the result will be satisfactory should not determine whether facts relevant to that result are concealed. I simply cannot agree with the majority\u2019s view that the government (through its courts) is entitled to determine in a particular case that one will be better off by the perpetuation of a falsity and the suppression of relevant, unprivileged facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">The notion that people\u2019s best interests are served by ignorance of the facts, enforced by a governmental entity, is reminiscent of the society portrayed in George Orwell\u2019s <em>1984. </em>In that society, one of the slogans of the governing \u201cParty,\u201d engraved on the \u201cMinistry of Truth\u201d building, was \u201cIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While concealment of the truth is a fundamental tenet of totalitarian regimes,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> it should not be an operative principle in a free society.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">I am aware of no other type of action where relevant and admissible evidence, unprotected by a recognized privilege against non-disclosure, is excluded. The majority\u2019s reasoning could lead to the exclusion of relevant admissible evidence in a number of cases. For example, in an incident recently publicized in the newspapers, two mothers gave birth to two girls in a Florida hospital. Either hospital negligence or unexplained circumstances led to the mothers returning to their homes with the wrong child. Under the majority\u2019s reasoning, in order to examine the hospital records to determine whether a switch had even occurred, the couples would have to prove that it was in the children\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>best interests for there to be a determination of who were their true biological parents. If a court found that each of the girls\u2019 best interests were served by remaining with the woman who took her home, the hospital records as well as any scientific evidence of parentage would be excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Another example could arise in the surrogacy area.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is possible with current scientific advances that an egg from one woman can, by in vitro procedures, be fertilized by the sperm of a man and then implanted into the uterus of another woman who promises to act as surrogate. Although the question of which woman is the \u201cmother\u201d may be a controversial one, the majority\u2019s holding would prevent the genetic background of the child from being considered in a dispute over the identity of the \u201cmother\u201d unless it was in the child\u2019s best interests for the court to make that determination. <em>See </em>John Lawrence Hill, <em>What does it means to be a \u201cParent\u201d? The Claims of Biology as the Basis for Parental Rights, </em>66 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 353, 363 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The suppression of relevant, admissible evidence promoted by the majority in this case is unprecedented. In certain situations, the General Assembly, after balancing the privacy interests involved, has provided for records to be sealed. For example, juvenile delinquency records are confidential so that the juvenile will not be stigmatized by a criminal record. Md.Rule 921. Likewise adoption records are sealed to protect the privacy interests of natural parents who choose to place their children for adoption. Code (1984, 1991 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-309 of the Family Law Article. These instances, however, are readily distinguished from the attempt of the majority today to conceal facts material to a determination of paternity. In addition to being legislative policy determinations, these examples of sealed records prevent the future disclosure of previously ascertained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>facts for collateral purposes. They do not prevent the ascertainment of these facts in the primary litigation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Even if the majority\u2019s concern over the consequences of a paternity adjudication were justified, the majority\u2019s \u201cbig brother\u201d approach would be indefensible. Nevertheless, the majority\u2019s concern over the consequences is overstated. The admission of the blood test results would do no more than establish the true paternity of the child.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The best interests standard would still control the determination of visitation and custody. <em>See McCready v. McCready, </em>323 Md. 476, 481, 593 A.2d 1128, 1130 (1991); <em>Domingues v. Johnson, </em>323 Md. 486, 498, 593 A.2d 1133, 1139 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">The ultimate determination of visitation or custody, however, should only come after careful consideration of all relevant evidence, including biological parentage. The fact of biological parentage does not automatically entitle the natural father to visitation with his child. A determination of paternity would entitle the natural father to the presumption that the child\u2019s interests will best be served by allowing the father visitation. Yet, this presumption can be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>rebutted when \"some exceptional circumstances render such custody [or visitation] detrimental to the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>Ross v. Hoffman, supra, </em>280 Md. at 178, 372 A.2d at 586-587, quoting <em>Ross v. Pick, supra, </em>199 Md. at 351, 86 A.2d at 468. <em>See also Lipiano v. Lipiano, supra, </em>89 Md.App. at 577-578, 598 A.2d at 857-858.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">One commentator explained the illogic of the majority\u2019s position as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-5\">\u201cThe question of the child\u2019s best interests, however, does not arise until the putative father has first been accorded his procedural right to standing to establish his paternity. <em>This is not to say that the best interests of the child are unimportant, but only that they are irrelevant to the preliminary and essential factual determination of paternity. </em>A successful paternity action by a putative father does not automatically entitle him to custody, for example, nor even to visitation with his child.\u201d (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Jean E. McEwen, <em>R. McG. &amp; C.W. v. J.W. &amp; W.W.: The Putative Father\u2019s Right to Standing to Rebut the Marital Presumption of Paternity, </em>76 N.W.U.L.Rev. 669, 688 (1981). <em>See Anonymous v. Anonymous, </em>472 So.2d 640, 642 (Ala.Civ.App.1984), <em>cert. quashed, </em>472 So.2d 643 (Ala.1985) (putative father entitled to blood tests upon showing of good cause, and it is not necessary for him to prove his entire case prior to the ordering of blood tests).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The approach taken by the majority disregards the reality of the modern world in which blood tests are a reliable source of information for the determination of a fact that is relevant to the attempt by Mr. Turner to establish a relationship with Jeffrey. Justice Brennan criticized a similar head-in-the-sand approach while sitting on the New Jersey Superior Court stating <em>(Cortese v. Cortese, </em>10 N.J.Super. 152, 156, 76 A.2d 717, 719 (1950)):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-8\">\u201cIn the field of contested paternity ... the truth is so often obscured because social pressures create a conspiracy of silence or, worse, induce deliberate falsity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>In my opinion, the majority\u2019s opinion today contributes to this conspiracy of silence by authorizing the concealment of a fact that is relevant to the determination of visitation and ascertainable with a high degree of accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Judge McAULIFFE has authorized me to state that he concurs with the views expressed herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b172-7\">.

Maj. at 117. The majority\u2019s concern for the integrity of familial relationships already formed ignores the reality of the present case. The Whisteds were married approximately five and a half months before Jeffrey\u2019s birth. They separated six months after Jeffrey was born, and Jeffrey and Mrs. Whisted lived with Mr. Turner for a year and a half. It is unclear whether it is possible to protect the \"integrity of familial relationships already formed,\u201d as it is not evident that any such relationship exists.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b174-8\">.

Nevertheless, in the primary litigation a determination is made concerning whether the juvenile in fact committed a crime. It is the record of this finding that is sealed. Applying the majority's rationale in this situation would require the trial court to determine whether a delinquency adjudication would be in the juvenile\u2019s best interests before determining whether to hear the victim's testimony about the crime. If the juvenile\u2019s best interests would not be furthered, the victim could not testify. If the juvenile\u2019s best interests would be furthered, the victim could testify and the juvenile could be adjudicated delinquent. Obviously, this result is preposterous.
