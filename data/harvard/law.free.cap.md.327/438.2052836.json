Vol.), is a \u201ctax on income\u201d under the above-quoted Maryland statute so that the taxpayers in this case are entitled to claim a credit against their Maryland income taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">The pertinent facts of this case are not in dispute. The taxpayers, Edward F. Roach and his wife, Josephine D. Roach, are residents of Annapolis, Maryland. Mr. Roach, during the 1986 tax year, was a 50% owner of a District of Columbia partnership called Roach &amp; Seagraves. Pursuant to \u00a7 47-1808.1 of the D.C.Code, Mr. Roach paid taxes to the District of Columbia on income he realized through the partnership. On their 1986 joint Maryland income tax return, pursuant to \u00a7 10-703 of the Tax-General Article of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>the Maryland Code, the Roaches claimed as a credit against their Maryland income tax the amount of the tax on income paid to the District of Columbia. The Maryland Comptroller, however, disallowed the credit, and entered an assessment against the Roaches for unpaid tax, interest and penalties.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">The Maryland Tax Court upheld the Comptroller\u2019s assessment solely on the basis of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gardella v. Comptroller, </em>213 Md. 1, 130 A.2d 752 (1957). Upon the Roaches\u2019 action for judicial review, the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County affirmed the Tax Court\u2019s decision, also relying entirely upon <em>Gardella. </em>The Roaches appealed, and this Court issued a writ of certiorari prior to argument in the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Title 47, Ch. 18, subchapter VIII of the D.C.Code, comprising \u00a7\u00a7 47-1801.1 through 47-1808.7, originally enacted by the District of Columbia Council as part of the Revenue Act of 1975,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> entitled \u201cTax on Unincorporated Businesses,\u201d provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">\u201c\u00a7 47-1808.1.

The taxes imposed under this subchapter may be assessed in the name of the unincorporated business or in the name or names of the person or persons liable for the payment of such taxes, or both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-23\">Thus, the tax imposed by the above-quoted statutory provisions applies to partnerships, and an individual partner is liable for the tax. The tax is a percentage of \u201ctaxable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>income\u201d which is defined as \u201cnet income derived from sources within the District.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">In <em>Gardella v. Comptroller, supra, </em>213 Md. 1, 130 A.2d 752, this Court examined a prior District of Columbia unincorporated business tax which was substantially similar to the present tax on unincorporated businesses. Our predecessors concluded in <em>Gardella </em>that the tax was a franchise tax and not an income tax and that, therefore, a Maryland taxpayer, who was a partner in a District of Columbia business, was not entitled to a credit against his Maryland income tax for the tax paid to the District of Columbia. The <em>Gardella </em>opinion relied upon the District of Columbia\u2019s characterization of the tax, set forth in the statutory language, as a \u201cfranchise tax\u201d which is \u201cimposed on the privilege of carrying on and engaging in a trade or business in the District of Columbia and of receiving income from sources within said District____\u201d <em>Gardella v. Comptroller, supra, </em>213 Md. at 4, 130 A.2d at 753. The Court in <em>Gardella </em>stated that, while a jurisdiction\u2019s \u201cdeclaration that a tax shall be of a particular character does not make it such, nevertheless, the declaration of the law making power is entitled to much and respectful weight.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Although acknowledging that the tax was imposed on \u201ctaxable income,\u201d the <em>Gardella </em>opinion concluded that merely because a franchise tax is measured by a business\u2019s income does not make it an income tax. 213 Md. at 4-5, 130 A.2d at 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">As previously indicated, the statute involved in the <em>Gardella </em>case was replaced by provisions of the District of Columbia Revenue Act of 1975. The subchapter of the 1975 statute imposing a tax on unincorporated businesses was before the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in <em>Bishop v. District of Columbia, </em>401 A.2d 955 (D.C.App.1979), <em>affirmed en banc, </em>411 A.2d 997 (D.C.App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>446 U.S. 966, 100 S.Ct. 2943, 64 L.Ed.2d 825 (1980). The taxpayers in the <em>Bishop </em>case were a Maryland resident and a Virginia resident, both of whom practiced law in the District of Columbia. The earlier District of Columbia unincorporated business tax had contained a \u201cprofessional exemption,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>but the Revenue Act of 1975 repealed the exemption, \u201cthereby allowing the District of Columbia to impose an unincorporated business tax upon unincorporated professionals and personal service businesses.\u201d <em>Bishop v. District of Columbia, supra, </em>401 A.2d at 955. Congress in the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, however, had prohibited the District of Columbia Council from enacting a so-called commuter tax, <em>i.e., </em>an income tax on the personal income of nonresidents working in the District of Columbia. Thus D.C.Code (1978 Supp.), \u00a7 l-147(a)(5), provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-5\">\u201cthe Council shall have no authority to</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">(5) impose any tax on the whole or any portion of the personal income, either directly or at the source thereof, of any individual not a resident of the District.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">The taxpayers in <em>Bishop </em>argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the unincorporated business tax was an income tax and that, therefore, as applied to them it was invalid under the Home Rule Act. The District of Columbia government, on the other hand, insisted that the unincorporated business tax was a franchise tax, and, as such, was not precluded by the Home Rule Act. As stated by the <em>Bishop </em>court, 401 A.2d at 956, \u201c[t]he question is whether [the unincorporated business tax] imposes a tax on the personal income of nonresidents or whether the tax is levied on something other than income <em>(e.g., </em>the privilege of doing business in the District).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">The District of Columbia Court of Appeals held in <em>Bishop </em>that the unincorporated business tax was an income tax and not a franchise tax. Initially, the court stated \u201cthat the nature and effect of a tax ... determine if it is an income tax or not.\u201d 401 A.2d at 958, citing <em>Dawson v. Kentucky Distilleries, </em>255 U.S. 288, 292, 41 S.Ct. 272, 274, 65 L.Ed. 638, 645 (1921). The <em>Bishop </em>opinion pointed out that numerous jurisdictions have \u201cstyled their tax a franchise tax only to have the courts intercede to reclassify the tax.\u201d 401 A.2d at 959, citing <em>Gaulden v. Kirk, </em>47 So.2d 567, 574-575 (Fla.1950); <em>State ex rel. v. Keller, </em>140 Fla. 346, 348-349, 191 So. 542, 547-548 (1939); <em>Commissioners of Sinking </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number><em>Fund v. Howard, </em>248 S.W.2d 340, 342-343 (Ky.1952), <em>aff'd, </em>344 U.S. 624, 73 S.Ct. 465, 97 L.Ed. 617 (1953); <em>City of Louisville v. Sebree, </em>308 Ky. 420, 428, 214 S.W.2d 248, 253 (1948); <em>Carter Carburetor Corp. v. City of St. Louis, </em>356 Mo. 646, 658, 203 S.W.2d 438, 440 (1947). The Court of Appeals in <em>Bishop </em>then emphasized that the unincorporated business tax was a tax upon the net income of the taxpayer instead of upon the gross receipts, and that the purpose and incidents of the tax were the same as those of income taxes generally and not the same as those of franchise taxes, 401 A.2d at 959-960. The court rejected the government\u2019s argument \u201cthat this tax is a tax on the right to earn income in the District,\u201d because it is not levied on \u201cany act of earning income\u201d but only on net income, <em>id. </em>at 960-961. The court went on to point out that the federal Commissioner of Internal Revenue had consistently ruled that the tax was an income tax, that it \u201cis levied upon personal income,\u201d and that the individual is personally liable for the payment of the tax, <em>id. </em>at 961. Concluding that the \u201ctax, by its very terms, is a tax on net income,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 960, the court held \u201cthat the professional tax here at issue is an invalid exercise of the City Council\u2019s legislative authority under the Home Rule Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 961.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">In light of the <em>Bishop </em>case, applying this Court\u2019s rationale in <em>Gardella v. Comptroller, supra, </em>213 Md. at 4, 130 A.2d at 753, leads to a decision which is opposite from the result in <em>Gardella. </em>As previously discussed, the ruling in <em>Gardella </em>was based upon giving \u201cmuch and respectful weight\u201d to the District of Columbia\u2019s \u201cdeclaration that [the] tax shall be of a particular character.\u201d The <em>Gardella </em>Court relied on the declaration, then set forth in the District of Columbia statutory language, that the unincorporated business tax was a \u201cfranchise tax\u201d which is \u201cimposed on the privilege of carrying on and engaging in a trade or business in the District of Columbia____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">If, however, we follow <em>Gardella\u2019s </em>approach and rely upon the District of Columbia\u2019s characterization of its present unincorporated business tax, we take that charac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>terization from the interpretation of the statute by the highest court of the District of Columbia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While the nature of another jurisdiction\u2019s statute for purposes of Maryland law is for this Court to decide, nevertheless, to the extent that we rely on the other jurisdiction\u2019s characterization of its statute in deciding that issue of Maryland law, we take the statute with whatever interpretative gloss has been placed upon it by the highest court of the other jurisdiction. This principle was set forth long ago by Chief Justice Marshall for the Supreme Court in <em>Elmendorf v. </em>Taylor, 10 Wheat. 152, 159-160, 6 L.Ed. 289, 292 (1825), dealing with a Kentucky statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-5\">\u201cThis Court has uniformly professed its disposition, in cases depending on the laws of a particular State, to adopt the construction which the Courts of the State have given to those laws. This course is founded on the principle, supposed to be universally recognised, that the judicial department of every government, where such department exists, is the appropriate organ for construing the legislative acts of that government. Thus, no Court in the universe, which professed to be governed by principle, would, we presume, undertake to say, that the Courts of Great Britain, or of France, or of any other nation, had misunderstood their own statutes, and therefore erect itself into a tribunal which should correct such misunderstanding. We receive the construction given by the Courts of the nation as the true sense of the law, and feel ourselves no more at liberty to depart from that construction, than to depart from the words of the statute. On this principle, the construction given by this Court to the constitution and laws of the United States is received by all as the true construction; and on the same principle, the construction given by the Courts of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>several States to the legislative acts of those States, is received as true, unless they come in conflict with the constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. If, then, this question has been settled in Kentucky, we must suppose it to be rightly settled.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-5\"><em>See R.A. V. v. City of St. Paul, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 2542, 120 L.Ed.2d 305, -(1992) (\u201cIn construing the St. Paul ordinance, we are bound by the construction given it by the Minnesota court\u201d). This Court has applied the same principle. <em>See, e.g., White v. King, </em>244 Md. 348, 356-358, 223 A.2d 763, 768-769 (1966); <em>Smith v. Mercantile Trust Co., </em>199 Md. 264, 281, 86 A.2d 504, 511-512 (1952); <em>Heyn v. Fidelity Trust Company, </em>174 Md. 639, 658, 1 A.2d 83, 87 (1938); <em>Zell v.

Ct. 762, 71 L.Ed. 1329 (1926).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-9\">The Comptroller in the present case argues that the <em>Bishop </em>opinion was \u201cin error\u201d and that the language of the D.C.Code shows that the District of Columbia views its unincorporated business tax as a franchise tax (brief, pp. 5-6, 9). But, as emphatically pointed out by the Chief Justice in <em>Elmendorf v. Taylor, supra, </em>10 Wheat, at 159, 6 L.Ed. at 292, \u201cno Court in the universe, which professed to be governed by principle, would, we presume, undertake to say that the Courts of [another jurisdiction] ... had misunderstood their own statutes, and therefore erect itself into a tribunal which should correct such misunderstanding.\u201d We shall not undertake to say that the highest court of the District of Columbia misunderstood a District of Columbia statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-11\">Recently the Supreme Court of Virginia decided the identical issue presented in the case at bar, <em>King v. Forst, </em>239 Va. 557, 391 S.E.2d 60 (1990). The Supreme Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Virginia held that the District of Columbia unincorporated business tax was an income tax, not a franchise tax, and that a Virginia taxpayer was entitled to a credit against his Virginia income tax for the amount of tax paid to the District of Columbia. In reaching this decision, the Virginia court specifically relied upon the principle that the interpretation of a particular jurisdiction\u2019s statute by the highest court of that jurisdiction should be followed by the courts of another jurisdiction. The court quoted Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s statement in <em>Elmendorf v. Taylor, supra, </em>10 Wheat, at 159, 6 L.Ed. at 292, to this effect, as well as numerous other authorities. <em>King v. Forst, supra, </em>239 Va. at 560-561, 391 S.E.2d at 62. The Virginia court thus applied the interpretation and characterization of the District of Columbia tax statute by the highest court of the District of Columbia in the <em>Bishop </em>case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>In sum, the District of Columbia, by its highest court, interprets and characterizes its unincorporated business tax as an income tax and not a franchise tax. According to the <em>Bishop </em>case, the tax is one imposed on net income earned in the District of Columbia, and its purposes are the same as the purposes of any other income tax. Therefore, applying the approach taken in <em>Gardella v. Comptroller, supra, </em>leads to the conclusion that the District\u2019s unincorporated business tax is an income tax and that the taxpayers in the present case should have been granted the credit provided for in Maryland Code (1988), \u00a7 10-703 of the Tax-General Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">In addition to the District of Columbia characterizing its unincorporated business tax as an income tax, both the nature of that tax and purpose of \u00a7 10-703 of the Tax-General Article confirm that the taxpayers in this case are entitled to the credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">The Comptroller in his brief conceded, as he must, that the District of Columbia tax is upon the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cnet income\u201d (brief, p. 6). Under D.C.Code \u00a7 47-1808.5, the tax is imposed upon and payable by the individual earning the net income within the District of Columbia. At oral argument before us, the Comptroller also acknowledged that the District of Columbia tax return is filed by and the tax is paid by the individual engaged in the District of Columbia business. Regardless of labels, these are characteristics of an income tax. Furthermore, residents of the District of Columbia are permitted to exclude from their gross income, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>for purposes of their personal income taxes, any net income subject to the unincorporated business tax. D.C.Code \u00a7 47-1803.2(a)(2)(D). This also indicates that the District of Columbia unincorporated business tax is just another form of income tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">The obvious purpose of the credit granted by \u00a7 10-703 of the Tax-General Article is to avoid double taxation on the same income. <em>See Reiling v. </em>Lacy, 93 F.Supp. 462, 470-471 (D.Md.1950), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>341 U.S. 901, 71 S.Ct. 614, 95 L.Ed. 1341 (1951). To disallow the credit under the circumstances of this case cannot be squared with this legislative purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Section 10-703 of the Tax-General Article does not require, as a condition for the tax credit, that the other jurisdiction\u2019s tax be an income tax in any particular form or be labeled \u201cincome tax\u201d or be exclusively an \u201cincome tax.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It simply requires that there be \u201ctax on income paid to another State____\u201d Under the plain language of the Maryland statute, the taxpayers here have paid a \u201ctax on income\u201d to the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">The District of Columbia\u2019s interpretation and characterization of its unincorporated business tax, the nature of that tax, and the purpose of the Maryland tax credit provisions, all lead to the conclusion that the District of Columbia unincorporated business tax is a \u201ctax on income paid to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>another state\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 10-703(a) of the Tax-General Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY REVERSED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE DECISION OF THE TAX COURT AND REMAND THE CASE TO THE TAX COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.

The Comptroller, in his brief in the case at bar, argues that the Supreme Court of Virginia\u2019s decision in <em>King v. Forst </em>was based upon the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution, Article IV, \u00a7 1, cl. 1, and that the Virginia court erroneously invoked the Full Faith and Credit Clause because the meaning and application of the tax credit provision of the Virginia income tax law was an issue of Virginia law to be determined by the Virginia Court. (Comptroller\u2019s brief, p. 9 n. 6, pp. 13-17.) In our view, however, the opinion of the court in <em>King v. Forst </em>was not based on the Full Faith and Credit Clause. The words \"Full Faith and Credit\u201d do not appear in the court\u2019s opinion, and the Clause was not cited by the court. In fact, the United States Constitution was not mentioned. Moreover, the Supreme Court of Virginia\u2019s principal reliance was Chief Justice Marshall\u2019s statement in <em>Elmendorf v. Taylor, supra, </em>10 Wheat. at 159, 6 L.Ed. at 292. The Chief Justice's statement was obviously based on principles of comity and not on the Full Faith and Credit Clause, as he specifically referred to the interpretations of statutes of other nations by the courts of those nations. In addition, none of the other cases cited by the Supreme Court of Virginia relied on the Full Faith and Credit Clause. As to the matter of Virginia law, the court in <em>King v. Forst, supra, </em>239 Va. at 559, 391 S.E.2d at 61, appeared to say that the parties did not dispute the meaning of Virginia law and that the only dispute concerned the District of Columbia\u2019s interpretation of its own statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The dissent in <em>King v. Forst </em>did mention the Full Faith and Credit Clause, as well as \u201cnotions of comity,\u201d as possible bases for the majority\u2019s opinion, 239 Va. at 562, 391 S.E.2d at 63. The principle invoked by the dissent was that the meaning and application of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Virginia tax statute was an issue of Virginia law for the Virginia court, and that, as a matter of Virginia law, there should be no credit for the tax paid to the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">We have no disagreement with the principle invoked by the dissent in <em>King. </em>In the instant case, we agree that whether the District of Columbia tax is a \"tax on income\u201d for purposes of Maryland Code (1988) \u00a7 10-703 of the Tax-General Article, is a question of Maryland law for this Court. Nonetheless, to the extent that the issue of Maryland law is to depend upon the District of Columbia\u2019s interpretation and characterization of its own tax, we accept the interpretation and characterization from the <em>Bishop </em>case instead of concluding that <em>Bishop </em>mischaracterized the District of Columbia statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b499-9\">. As pointed out by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals in <em>Bishop, </em>401 A.2d at 959-960, quite often statutes label a tax as a \u201cfranchise tax\u201d or purport to give it certain characteristics of a franchise tax, but courts hold that in substance the tax is also an income tax. In addition to cases previously cited, <em>see, e.g., Md. Nat'l Bank v. St. Dep\u2019t of Assess., </em>57 Md.App. 269, 273, 469 A.2d 907, 909 <em>cert. denied, </em>299 Md. 656, 474 A.2d 1344 (1984) (\"franchise tax when measured on income is one of many \u2018income taxes\u2019\u201d); <em>People v. Knapp, </em>230 N.Y. 48, 52-53, 129 N.E. 202, 203, 205 (1920) (per Cardozo, J.: tax labeled a \"franchise\u201d tax and imposed \"for the privilege of doing business,\u201d but computed on net income, \"must be held in practical operation to be a tax upon the income\u201d); <em>People v. Graves, </em>259 App.Div. 30, 18 N.Y.S.2d 418 (1940) (unincorporated business tax is an income tax).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
