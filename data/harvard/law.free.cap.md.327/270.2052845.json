The court (Hammerman, J.) sentenced each defendant to thirty years\u2019 imprisonment on the murder count and ten years, to be served concurrently, on the handgun count. Under the sentencing guidelines, a sentence of twenty-five years was indicated, but Judge Hammerman departed from the suggested range, citing \u201cthe particular degree of violence here\u201d and \u201cthe very serious impact that has been left on the family, particularly the son.\u201d The court expressed its sympathy for the victim\u2019s family, and commented on the financial burdens imposed on the family as a result of the crime. It said that there was $3,000 in medical expenses and a $3,000 funeral bill. In an effort to help the victim\u2019s mother shoulder this financial burden, Judge Hammerman said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-11\">\u201cI am willing to give you the opportunity of bringing the sentence down into the guidelines by helping to relieve <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>the very serious financial burden ... that has been placed on Mrs. Johnson, the mother of the victim____ I\u2019m anxious to see, if at all possible, that this financial burden be relieved____ If each of you and your families see your way clear and pay your fair share of that financial burden, then I am willing to reduce the sentence by five years and bring it into the guideline range.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0c\">Accordingly, the docket entries reflect the judge\u2019s offer to Reddick as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">\u201cFive years to be suspended from the defendant Mr. Reddick\u2019s sentence if he pays $3000 restitution to the victim\u2019s mother Rosetta Johnson through Parole and Probation by 2-2-91.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">Reddick and Southall appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed their convictions in an unreported opinion. We granted certiorari based on a petition filed solely on Reddick\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">Reddick argues that the trial court erred in offering to reduce his term of incarceration if he made a $3,000 contribution to the victim\u2019s expenses. He claims that because he is indigent, the sentence violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. He contends that the criminal justice system cannot constitutionally distinguish between defendants on the basis of wealth or poverty. It is, he says, unconstitutional to incarcerate an indigent defendant for a term longer than that imposed on a similarly situated nonindigent defendant who would be able to make the requisite monetary payment. Accordingly, Reddick urges us to vacate his sentence, contending that the condition attached to the five-year suspension invalidates the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-13\">The State views the sentence as an unconditional, thirty-year term of incarceration. It argues that the only legal effect of the judge\u2019s \u201coffer\u201d was to inform Reddick about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>what conduct or developments would persuade him to modify the sentence at a later date, pursuant to his revisory power under Maryland Rule 4-345. Furthermore, the State argues, if the sentence were viewed as a conditional offer to suspend a part of a term of incarceration, it would have been invalid under Art. 27, \u00a7 639, which authorizes orders for suspended sentences only in relation to payment of costs, recognizance for appearance, or matters relating to the residence or conduct of the defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because payment of the victim\u2019s expenses does not fit into any of these categories, the State argues that the \u201coffer\u201d of a five-year suspended sentence is null and void. It urges that we simply strike the illegal portion of the sentence and permit the thirty-year term of incarceration to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The State\u2019s characterization of Judge Hammerman\u2019s sentence is not entirely accurate. The court did not suggest that Reddick file a motion to modify sentence or indicate that his \u201coffer\u201d was simply gratuitous information about what might cause the court to reduce the sentence to twenty-five years. The docket entries make it clear that the court, in effect, offered Reddick the opportunity to \u201cbuy\u201d a suspended sentence. While Judge Hammerman was plainly motivated by concern for the finances of the victim\u2019s family, that part of the sentence which would be suspended upon payment by Reddick of the expenses was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">In an opinion in which \u201c[d]ue process and equal protection principles converge,\u201d <em>Bearden v. Georgia, </em>461 U.S. 660, 665, 103 S.Ct. 2064, 2068, 76 L.Ed.2d 221 (1983), the United States Supreme Court made clear that, having determined that a fine or restitution is an appropriate sentence, a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>cannot then imprison a defendant solely because of his inability to pay it. The thirty-year sentence that Judge Hammerman imposed subjects Reddick, an indigent, to five years\u2019 imprisonment beyond that which a nonindigent defendant would be required to serve. Since imprisonment for a lack of financial resources is illegal, Reddick is entitled to the sentence that a defendant with the financial wherewithal to make the payment would have received under the same circumstances. <em>Compare Tate v. Short, </em>401 U.S. 395, 91 S.Ct. 668, 28 L.Ed.2d 130 (1971); <em>Williams v. Illinois, </em>399 U.S. 235, 90 S.Ct. 2018, 26 L.Ed.2d 586 (1970); <em>Griffin v. Illinois, </em>351 U.S. 12, 76 S.Ct. 585, 100 L.Ed. 891 (1956); <em>Turner v. State, </em>307 Md. 618, 516 A.2d 579 (1986); <em>Smith v. State, </em>306 Md. 1, 506 A.2d 1165 (1986). Accordingly, Reddick\u2019s sentence for murder must be modified by striking out the illegal portion and imposing a twenty-five-year sentence, commencing on January 24, 1990. Reddick\u2019s sentence on the handgun count is affirmed as originally imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS ON THE CHARGE OF SECOND DEGREE MURDER AFFIRMED, EXCEPT AS TO THE SENTENCE. CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY FOR RESENTENCING TO TWENTY-FIVE YEARS\u2019 IMPRISONMENT ON THE MURDER COUNT.
