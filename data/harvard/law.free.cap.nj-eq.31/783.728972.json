(1) The decree prevents the widow from receiving any of the first year\u2019s income\u2014not even the interest accruing during that year on any investments of the principal of the estate can be allowed her. The widow is entitled to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>income from the death of the testator. He gives to her the income of all his estate, real and personal. Unquestionably, she is entitled to the income of the real estate from the testator\u2019s death, and it is fair to presume that the testator intended the same rule to govern the income of both estates. He is required to pay the testator\u2019s son George, out of the income, one thousand dollars, upon his becoming twenty-one years of age. If he had reached that age during the first year after the testator\u2019s death, the widow could not have then paid him.his legacy, except by using the first year\u2019s income.</p>\n<headnotes data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b815-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>.allotting to each stockholder forty per cent, in stock, upon the payment of $75 per share. The trustee sold this privilege for about $20 \u00a1per share, carrying the proceeds to the capital fund of his trust. Another corporation increased its capital on nearly similar terms, and the trustee subscribed to the new stock, and afterwards sold the stock at a profit of $400, which he also carried to the <em>corpus.\u2014Held, </em>that both items were income.

E. Gr. 28; Halsted </em>v. <em>Meeker, 3 C. E. Gr. 140; Church at Acquackanonk </em>v. <em>Ackerman, Sax. 43.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b817-9\">The appellants say that Mrs. Hughes (Weiss) was entitled to the income of the <em>real </em>estate from the death of the testator, and, therefore, is entitled to interest on her legacy from the same time.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b817-10\">Eirst\u2014The answer is, there was no real estate.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b817-11\">Second\u2014There is nothing in the will to show any intention in the testator to take her legacy out of the general rule.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b817-12\">The cases cited by the appellants to establish the proposition that \u201c where a testator bequeaths the <em>entire </em>income of his estate to his widow for life, she is entitled to the income accruing from his death\u201d\u2014fail to do so. And the books cited admit the <em>rule </em>to be as we contend. One answer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>to this is that the \u201c entire\u201d income was not bequeathed to her. Appellants cite <em>2 Redf. on Wills ch. 4 \u00a7 6 subd. 11, 12. </em>There is no such section in that chapter. Section 6 is in chapter 1, and does not refer to the question. They cite <em>Perry on Trusts </em>\u00a7 <em>548, 551. </em>Sections 548 and 550 admit the rule to be as we contend. Section 551 refers to cases of real estate, and cases which turned on the <em>language </em>of the will, and <em>intention </em>of the testator. The cases cited in clause 7 of section 551, to wit, <em>Llewellyn\u2019s Trust, 29 Beav. </em>171, and <em>Meyer </em>v. <em>Simonson, 5 DeG. &amp; Sm. 723, </em>show that the rule allowing a certain per cent, interest from testator\u2019s death is upon \u201c the value taken at the <em>expiration </em>of one year from the testator\u2019s death.\u201d This being the time which, by the rule we contend for, is fixed by the law for the ascertainment of the amount of the estate, and when all legacies are payable; and, inasmuch as there is nothing in the will to show testator intended that the executrix should pay income to any one, until the time fixed by law to ascertain the amount of the principal fund, that is, one year from testator\u2019s death, there is nothing in this case to take this legacy to Mrs. Hughes out of the general rule. The same remarks are a sufficient answer to <em>2 Spence\u2019s Eq. Jur. 567. </em>They .also rely on <em>Green </em>v. <em>Green, 3 Stew. 451. </em>Page 457 of this case says: \u201c The rule which gives the executor one year, was made to secure him from embarassment in the settlement of the estate.\u201d I submit that this is not the reason of the rule. The reason is, that a definite time should be fixed, at which the amount of the estate is to be ascertained, or fixed\u2014in reference to which the income may be calculated. 2<em> Redf. on Wills ch. 4 \u00a7 31 subd. 1; Perry on Trusts ch. 19 </em>\u00a7 <em>575.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b818-4\">So far as <em>Green </em>v. <em>Green </em>decides that a tenant for life of <em>personalty </em>is entitled to interest from testator\u2019s death, <em>when no time is fixed by the will for the payment of the legacy, </em>the case of <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Francis, 3 Stew. 448, </em>is a perfect answer. The limitation by <em>statute [Pev. p. 581 </em>\u00a7 <em>1) </em>may have had for <em>one </em>of its objects the protection of the executor from litiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>\u2022tion for one year, but the whole section shows the legislature comprehended the pre-existing rule, and the proviso in the section shows they understood the difference between cases where a time was <em>fixed, </em>in the will for the payment of legacies, and those where no time was fixed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b819-5\">Counsel cites <em>Angerstin </em>v. <em>Martin, Turn. &amp; Russ. 232, </em>cited in <em>Redfield on Wills ch. 4 </em>\u00a7 <em>31 subd. 1 note 2, </em>and some New York cases, for the purpose of making a distinction between interest on legacies and income. There is no such distinction. The chancellor, in <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Francis, 3 Stew. 448, </em>\u2022cites the case of <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Williamson, 6 Paige 298, </em>and holds that the widow could have <em>\u201c </em>interest only according to the common rule, notwithstanding the fact that the legatee was, <em>at the testator\u2019s death, dowable of lands of which he died seized.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b819-6\">N. The second ground of appeal is not well founded. \u25a0Catharine \"Weiss was not entitled to the premium she received on the sale of the gold she brought, as executrix, from Russia to this country. Such premium was not income\u2014that is, annual earnings\u2014it was a mere change in \u2022the form of the corpus of the fund. It was simply changing \u25a0one kind of currency for another. It still remained the principal\u2019 of the fund from which sh\u00e9 was to receive income. In <em>Dimes </em>v. <em>Scott, 4 Russ. 195, </em>a part of the interest was added to the corpus. In <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Clark, 1 Hare 161, </em>the rule is well stated by Vice-Chancellor \"Wigram. In <em>Wray </em>v. <em>Smith, 14 Sim. 202, </em>it is said that a sale is \u2022simply a conversion of the corpus from one form into another. <em>Mackie </em>v. <em>Mackie, 5 Hare 70; Sparling </em>v. <em>Parker, 9 Beav. 524; Gibson v. Bott, 7 Ves. 89; Fearns </em>v. <em>Young, 9 Ves. 552; Howe </em>v. <em>Lord Dartmouth, 7 Ves. 137a; Crawley </em>v. <em>Crawley, 7 Sim. 427; Mills </em>v. <em>Mills, 7 Sim. 501; Mousley </em>v. <em>Carr, 4 Beav. 49, </em>are to the same effect. <em>Phayre </em>v. <em>Perce, 3 Dow 128, </em>a unanimous decision by the house of lords. <em>Hill on Trustees (ed. of 1846) p. 386-389 ; Valentine </em>v. <em>Strong, 20 Md. 522. 2 Story\u2019s Eq.

Suppose the gold had been a ship, would that increase in value have been \u201cuse\u201d or \u201cincome?\u201d Would it not clearly have been an increase in <em>value </em>of the corpus ? Can an increase in the value of a ship, a horse, or a quantity of gold, or a draft, in any sense be called the \u201c income\u201d of or from any of them ? The authorities cited, <em>Perry on Trusts, 4 C. E. Gr. 176; 11 C. E. Gr. 11, </em>all refer to the earnings or interest of the <em>corpus.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b820-4\">III. It was the duty of the executrix, Catharine Hughes (afterwards Weiss), to have filed a bill in the court of chancery, so soon as she arrived in Hew Jersey, and placed the fund under the control of that court, and invested and re-invested it under the direction of that court. Whether or not she was entitled to the income the first year after testator\u2019s death, her representatives now make a question. When the gold should have been sold, was a question; on what amount she was entitled to receive income was a question; also, as to how the money should be invested; and she ought to have brought them to the notice of the court, and had them decided. <em>Quick </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>4 <em>Hal. Ch. 674, 778. </em>If .she made a change in the fund without such direction, the gains belong to the fund, the losses are chargeable to her. <em>Quick </em>v. <em>Fisher, 1 Stock. 802, 805.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b820-5\">The cases relied upon from other states, by the appellants, such as <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Williamson, 6 Paige 306, </em>that the executor shall <em>estimate </em>the value at the testator\u2019s death, and pay interest or income on that amount, are contrary to the policy of our law, and opposed to the decisions in this state. Such a doctrine would furnish no <em>rule, </em>for there would be no <em>certainty </em>as to what debts come against the estate. That interest, or income, begins to run from one year after' the testator\u2019s death, has been the rule of this state from the earliest period to the present time. <em>Barnes </em>v. <em>Danforth, 2 Stew. 12 ; Howard </em>v. <em>Francis, 3 Stew. 444, 448.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b821-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b821-5\">Dodd, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">By the will of George W. Hughes, deceased, the income of all his property, personal and real, was given to his wife during the term of her'natural life, with \u00e1 bequest over of the principal at her death. The testator died while in Russia, on the 15th of October, 1862, and his will was subsequently proved by his widow and executrix, before the surrogate of Passaic, in this state. A portion of his property\u2018was balances in the hands of bankers in Europe, which balances were represented by a draft on Baring Brothers &amp; Co., in London. This draft, for the sum of over eight thousand pounds sterling, was sold by the executrix, in New York, on the 21st of October, 1862. Its gold value was then and there the sum of $41,227, for which, as there was then a premium on each gold dollar of twenty-seven and one-half per cent., the executrix received, in legal tender money, the sum of $52,573.89.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">In this suit now pending for the settlement of the estate, two questions were decided by the vice-chancellor, which are again raised by this appeal: Eirst\u2014Is the premium which was received by the executrix on the gold value of the draft, to be taken as part of the income of the estate, or is it to be taken as a part of the principal fund ? Second\u2014 Is the income of the estate which was given to the wife, to be reckoned from the death of the testator, or from the expiration of one year thereafter ?</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">It was held by the vice-chancellor, that the premium on the gold was not income, but a part of the principal. In this ruling I entirely concur. The appellants, in resisting it, relied upon the cases of <em>Van Doren </em>v. <em>Olden, C. E. Gr. 176, </em>and <em>Ashhurst </em>v. <em>Field, 11 C. E. Gr. 11. </em>These cases do not support the appellant\u2019s claim. Trust funds, of which the income, interest or profits were given by a testator to one person for life, and the principal over on the life tenant\u2019s death, were there invested in the stock of an incorporated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>company. Extra dividends, in the form of new stock, had been made by the company, out of the earnings of their business; and the question was, whether the stock dividends were to be regarded as income or capital. The answer to the question was held to turn upon the point whether the earnings, out of which the dividends had been declared, had been carried to account of accumulated surplus laid up by the company before or after the investment was made. If before the investment, the dividends were adjudged to be capital and to belong to the remaindermen. If after the investment, they were income, and belonged to the tenant for life. The important circumstances distinguishing those cases from the present, were the existence of earnings or profits from the business; and, also, the declaring of the dividends on the distribution of such profits by the board of directors. A mere increase or rise in the market value of the investment would have been essentially different, and not to be regarded as income belonging to the tenant for life. The difference between the par value of the gold and its value in legal tender money, is not earnings, but, like the increase in value of the testator\u2019s jewelry or pictures, sold at an advance on their cost, is a part of the property from which income is to arise. If, in the draft, was included interest which had accrued on the testator\u2019s money after his death, such interest should be distinguished in the accounting from the principal on which it arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Second\u2014At what time did the income to .the widow begin to accrue? It was decreed by the vice-chancellor, to begin at the expiration of one year from the testator\u2019s death. To the correctness of the decree in this particular, I am unable to assent. It is grounded on the general rule, that legacies bear interest from the time they are payable, and upon the statutory provision, that the executor or administrator shall have a year after probate in which to pay legacies, where no time for their payment is fix.ed by the will. This general rule has been expressed and applied in cases adjudged in this state. <em>Church at Acquackanonk </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number><em>Ackerman\u2019s ex\u2019r, Sax. 40 ; Brinkerhoff </em>v. <em>Marselis\u2019s ex\u2019r, 4 Zab. 680; Halsted </em>v. <em>Meeker\u2019s ex\u2019rs, 8 C. E. Gr. 186; Hennion\u2019s ex\u2019r </em>v. <em>Jacobus, 12 C. E. Gr. 28 ; Howard </em>v. <em>Francis, 3 Stew. 444.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\"><em>Ex </em>all these cases, the legacies were specific sums, or the interest of such sums, and differ from bequests of the residuary'personal estate made to a legatee for life. This distinction is explained and enforced by the chancellor in the recent case of <em>Green </em>v. <em>Green, 3 Stew. 452, </em>in which the opinion was delivered after the decision of the present case. The rule that, where the Residuary personal estate is given to a legatee for life, the interest thereon accruing from the testator\u2019s death, shall, in the absence of any direction to accumulate, go to the tenant for life, is declared, by the chancellor, to be established. It is placed, not on the presumption that the life interest was given for support, but on the equity which seeks, as between the life tenant and the remainderman, to give to each his due. To give the interest for the first year to the remainderman by treating it as part of the principal, is correctly said to be injustice to the tenant for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">In addition to the authorities cited in the chancellor\u2019s opinion, reference may be made to <em>Berry on Trusts </em>\u00a7 <em>651, </em>and the accompanying notes. I am of the opinion that the appellants should he allowed the income from the testator\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">The decree should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-10\">Decree unanimously reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
