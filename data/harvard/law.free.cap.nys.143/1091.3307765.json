The respondent, as defendant in the said action, tendered to the plaintiff a return of $50 which he had paid as earnest money, and denied the agreement. On the plaintiff\u2019s refusal to accept the $50, it was paid into court for the purpose of keeping the tender good, and was deposited with the city chamberlain. Upon the trial of the action the complaint was dismissed, with costs, and a judgment was entered in favor of the respondent against the plaintiff for $70.88 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-3\">The defendant issued execution upon the judgment and obtained an order for the examination of the plaintiff in supplementary proceedings in aid of execution. Upon the examination had pursuant to this order the plaintiff, Bernstein, testified that he had $50 on deposit with the city chamberlain, which was the money paid into court by the defendant, and that he had made an agreement with his attorneys, Morris &amp; Samuel Meyers, to pay to them, for their services in prosecuting the action, \u201ca sum equal to 50 per cent, of the amount recovered, or the amount obtained by way of compromise, settlement, or otherwise.\u201d Upon this testimony the learned justice at Special Term granted an order directing the city chamberlain to pay the money in his hands to the sheriff, to be applied upon execution upon the defendant\u2019s judgment. It is recited in this order' that it was granted \u201cafter hearing Samuel Meyers, Esq., in support of the claim of said attorneys to an alleged lien for services rendered, * * * based upon a written agreement, and having duly determined that the said attorneys were and are not entitled to any such claim or lien.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-4\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It is not disputed, however, that no notice of motion to determine the lien of the appellants upon the fund in question was given, and Samuel Meyers, Esq., was only present in court upon the day of the examination and order in question because the defendant\u2019s attorney notified him by telephone on the morning of the hearing to come to the court, without telling him what the nature of the hearing was to be. Furthermore, it is not disputed that the appellant objected' to a summary adjudication of his lien without notice. The order appealed from was not, therefore, an order granted upon notice in a contested motion to determine an attorney\u2019s lien, but merely a summary order in supplementary proceedings pursuant to section 2447 of the Code of Civil Procedure, It is well settled that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-5\">\u201cSuch an order can be made, however, only when the judgment debtor\u2019s right to the possession of the money or property is not substantially disputed. If there is a real controversy in this respect, it cannot be settled in' supplementary proceedings, but must await determination in an appropriate action.\u201d- Kenney v. South Shore Natural Gas &amp; E. Co., 201 N. Y. 89, at page 92, 94 N. E. 606, at page 607.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1124-6\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The right of the debtor to the money in the hands of the city chamberlain was disputed by his attorneys, who claimed a lien thereon for the amount of their services. As soon as the money was paid into court by the defendant, it became the property of the plaintiff irrevocably, regardless of what the final outcome of the action might be. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1093\">*1093</page-number>The plaintiff could have drawn it out at any time, and, had it been lost or stolen, the loss would have fallen upon him, and not upon the defendant.

In the latter case it is said at page 111 of 185 N. Y., at page 1018 of <em>77 </em>N. E. (5 L. R. A. [N. S.] 561, <em>7 </em>Ann. Cas. 95):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1125-3\">\u201cNot only does the party paying it into court lose all right to it, but the court itself has no power to make an order in the same action which, in effect, retransfers the title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1125-4\">The lien of the appellants as attorneys for the plaintiff attached to the money as soon as it was paid into court, and this lien was not disturbed by the subsequent judgment for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">The order appealed from was accordingly improperly granted, and must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
