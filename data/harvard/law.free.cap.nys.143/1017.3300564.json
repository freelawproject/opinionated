Goldstein, Moses A. Goldstein, and Harry Ginsberg, the appellant. After the maturity of these notes the plaintiffs entered into an agreement in writing with the Gingold Realty Company and Abraham J. Goldstein, dated September 27, 1912, which provided that the Gingold Realty Company should execute and deliver to the plaintiffs a participation certificate for $1,000 in a mortgage on New York City real estate in part payment of the amount due upon the notes and contained the further provisions as' follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-12\">\u201cFourth. It is expressly understood and agreed that the remaining $1,028.47 due to the parties of the first part after the participation of $1,000 in the first mortgage, as hereinbefore described and agreed, shall be paid by notes executed by the Gingold Realty Company and indorsed by Abraham J. Goldstein in the following sums and due at the following time: $328.47 three months after the date of execution; $300 four months after the date of execution; $400 four and one-half months after the date of execution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1050-13\">\u201cFifth. It is expressly understood and agreed that the acceptance of such notes for the indebtedness herein set forth shall nowise be construed to relieve, release, or discharge the parties hereto from the indebtedness previously accruing, and the liability shall remain in full force and effect until full payment of the amounts shall be made as herein set forth. That it is understood and agreed that the Gingold Realty Company and Abraham J. Goldstein shall have renewals of said notes herein mentioned for reasonable lengths of time upon payment of a small amount on said notes. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1050-14\">The participation certificate and the new notes were accepted by the plaintiffs pursuant to this agreement, and the old notes, including the one here in suit, were surrendered to the Gingold Realty Company, the maker and primary debtor. During all this time an action had been pending in the City Court against maker and indorsers of the last of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>the old notes, which was one for $500, dated November 6, 1911. Aft\u25a0er the acceptance of the participation certific\u00e1te and new'notes by the plaintiffs as above set forth, and on March 3, 1913, the plaintiffs entered judgment by default against the defendant appellant, Harry \u2022Ginsberg, as indorser, for $550.30, which included protest fees, interest, and costs. The appellant moved to vacate the judgment on the ground that he had been discharged as indorser by the actions of the plaintiffs before the judgment was entered. This appeal is taken from the order denying his motion. . \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">It is a well-established rule of law that an indorser of negotiable paper, like any surety, <em>is </em>entitled to have the engagement of the principal debtor preserved without variation, and any change or extension of time granted by the holder to the maker of a promissory note without the consent of the indorser discharges his liability as indorser unless the right of recourse against the indorser is expressly reserved. 'Negotiable Instruments Law (Consol. Laws 1909, c. 38) \u00a7 201, subd. 6. Both the object and effect of the agreement and subsequent transaction above set forth was undoubtedly to extend the time of payment of the old notes for the benefit of the maker, and as this defendant, Harry Ginsberg, was not a party to the agreement and in no way consented to it, his liability as indorser upon the note in suit was discharged (Dorlon v. Christie, 39 Barb. 610; <em>Pomeroy </em>v. Tanner, 70 N. Y. 547; Hubbard v. Gurney, 64 N. Y. 458), and the fact that the extension was granted after the maturity of the note is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">The plaintiffs attempt to take the case out of the operation of this rule by virtue of the fifth clause of their agreement above set forth, which they claim amounted to a reservation of their rights against the indorser. The agreement merely states, however, that the acceptance of the notes \u201cshall nowise be construed to relieve, release, or discharge <em>the parties hereto </em>from the indebtedness previously accruing, and the liability shall remain in full force and effect until full payment of the amounts shall be made as herein set forth.\u201d Ginsberg was not, however, one of the parties to the agreement, and it is difficult to spell any reservation against him out of the language of the agreement. The entire transaction, including the surrender of the notes to the maker, would negative such a construction. Had Ginsberg determined to pay the note in suit after the execution of the above agreement, it would have been impossible for him to proceed against the maker in subrogation of the plaintiffs\u2019 rights and recover back the money which he had paid (Calvo v. Davies, 73 N. Y. 211, 29 Am. Rep. 130), at least during the interval for which the extension was granted. As indorser he is entitled to a strict application of the rule above stated; and under it he was undoubtedly discharged. National Park Bank v. Koehler, 204 N. Y. 174, 97 N. E. 468.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-7\">The order appealed from is reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the judgment vacated. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
