Venner against August Belmont. Plaintiff moved for leave to discontinue on payment of costs, and defendant moved for an extra allowance. Leave to discontinue granted, and extra allowance denied, and defendant appeals. Affirmed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-14\">The opinion of Blackmar, J., at Special Term, referred to by the court, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-15\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> This is not a difficult and extraordinary case, within the meaning of the section of the Code authorizing an extra allowance. It is an ordinary action for a libel. The rules of law governing it are simple and elementary. It is true that the defendant has expended large sums of money in investigating the past life of the plaintiff, seeking matter to plead in justification, and has succeeded in discovering enough to enable him to set forth in his answer a biography of the plaintiff stretching over 118 printed pages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-16\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The presumption should be that, when one publishes libelous matter, he already possesses information justifying the charge. The fact that an expensive and elaborate investigation is necessary to secure evidence in justification, while it may indicate that the defense is difficult, does not make the case a difficult one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b193-17\">Motion to discontinue on payment of taxable costs granted.
