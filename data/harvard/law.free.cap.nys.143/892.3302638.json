In so far as the defendant is accused of using unfair means to attract business, we scarcely think that plaintiff has made out a case. The chief contention is as to defendant\u2019s right to use in the transaction of his business certain forms, consisting of sheets of paper ruled in a certain manner and designed for the ready tabulation of items of work in machine shops and like establishments. It is disputed whether these forms were devised by plaintiff\u2019s president or by defendant. That is a question of fact which, if important, can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>best be determined on the trial. In any event plaintiff\u2019s grievance is rather that defendant has copied its methods of doing business than that he has used unfair means to attract business. We do not think that, upon the papers before us, plaintiff has made out a case for an injunction pendente lite. This has nothing to do with the question whether or not it may be entitled, upon the facts shown on the trial, to a permanent injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">The order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion for an injunction- pendente lite denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
