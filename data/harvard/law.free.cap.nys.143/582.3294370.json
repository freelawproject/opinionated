For resulting injuries he brings this action, and de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>fendant appeals from a judgment against it, and from an order denying a motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">The statute provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">\u201cAll vats, pans, saws, planers, cogs, gearing, belting, shafting, set-screws and machinery, of every description, shall be properly guarded.\u201d Consolidated Laws, c. 31 (Laws 1909, c. 36) \u00a7 81.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">One of the allegations of the complaint was failure to guard the shaft at the point where the \"injury was caused, and the learned trial court submitted to the jury the question,- among others, \u201cwhether or not this machine was properly guarded,\u201d and at the request of plaintiff\u2019s counsel further instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">\u201cThat the risks occasioned by the failure of the employer to supply the statutory safeguards, above referred to, were not as matter of law assumed by the employ\u00e9, though he had full knowledge of such failure.\u201d Fitzwater v. Warren, 206 N. Y. 355, 99 N. E. 1042, 42 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1229.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">\u201cA machine that is maintained wholly without guards is presumptively contrary to the statute. The burden of showing that it is impracticable to guard a machine, or that its location removes it from danger to employ\u00e9s, is upon the person or corporation maintaining it.\u201d Scott v. International Paper Co., 204 N. Y. 49, 97 N. E. 413.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">While defendant was examining as a witness the manager of its \u25a0 works, who had had 23 years\u2019 experience in that position, he was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-10\">\u201cIs it customary to guard a machine, where the gears have to be shifted in that way?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-11\">And again:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-12\">\u201cIs there any way by which that machine, at that point, could have been guarded, and carry on the work properly?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">To each of these questions 'objection was made, although not specifically upon the form of the question, the objection was sustained, and defendant excepted. Construing these questions together, it is apparent that the answers which they would have elicited might have shown that it was not practicable to guard these cogs, and that the statute, which only required defendant to \u201cproperly\u201d guard the same, had no application. Such evidence would be competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-14\">Without further discussion, I advise that the judgment and order appealed from be reversed, and a new trial granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
