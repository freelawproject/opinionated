The action was commenced in May, 1911, and issue was joined in that month. On February 9, 1912, a new attorney was substituted for the former attorney of the plaintiff. From the date of joining issue until July 18, 1913, when the defendant made the motion to dismiss, no step to prosecute the action was taken by the plaintiff, and younger issues had in the meantime been tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-18\">, In opposition to the motion an affidavit was presented of an attorney \"associated with\u201d the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, to the effect that he \u201cbelieved that the notice of trial had been served and note of issue filed, and the first intimation that defendant had that these matters of procedure had not been attended to was the receipt of the motion papers.\u201d The court characterized the plaintiff\u2019s excuse as a \u201clame one,\u201d but denied the motion simply upon condition \u201cthat the cause be immediately placed on1 the calendar.\u201d The defendant made out a clear case entitling him to have the action dismissed.
