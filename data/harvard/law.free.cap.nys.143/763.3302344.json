Laws 1909, c. 38) \u00a7 91, defines a holder in due course as one who has no notice of any defect in the title of the person negotiating it, and section 94 describes the title as defective when the person who negotiated it did so by a breach of faith, and consequently such facts would destroy the presumption created by section 98 that every holder is a holder in due course.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b795-7\">[Ed.

The contract required defendant to execute four notes, but by subsequent agreement defendant gave only one note for the purchase price, which note was, after rescission, wrongfully negotiated by the seller. <em>Held, </em>that in an action by the holder of the note, who took with notice, proof of the agreement was not an attempt to vary a written instrument by parol evidence; the contract which governed the issuance of the note being written, and the subsequent oral modification, which was necessarily supported by a consideration, making the written agreement applicable to the single note.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b795-10\">[Ed.

The complaint alleges that the note was originally made to A. M. Kendrick &amp; Co., by whom it was indorsed, \u201cand that thereafter and before its maturity it lawfully came into possession of plaintiff for value.\u201d' Appellant\u2019s answer contains some general denials, but on the trial these were evidently abandoned, and no point is m\u00e1de thereof here..</p>\n<p id=\"b796-17\">The entire case turns- upon the defendant\u2019s separate defense, which is, in substance, that she entered into a contract in writing with Kendrick &amp; Co. to buy their business and to pay $1,000 for the same in four monthly installments, for which notes were to be given, title to the business to pass to her upon final payment. It was a further condition of the contract that, if she should be unable to make any of the payments, either party should have the right to rescind, whereupon the business should be returned to Kendrick &amp; Co., and any payments previously made by her should be returned to her. \u201cThereafter it was agreed that the note set forth in the complaint should be given in place of the four notes above mentioned, but that the payments were to be at the intervals and in the amounts set forth in the original contract\u201d; that subsequently she becam\u00e9 unable to make the payment due March 1, 1912, and notified Kendrick &amp; Co. of her election to rescind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>the contract; that Kendrick &amp; Co. retook possession of the business and kept it. Finally she alleges, \u201con information and belief, that plaintiff is not a bona fide holder for value of said note sued upon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">On the trial, the learned court asked what- the defense was and defendant appellant\u2019s counsel confined himself to stating this separate defense. The court remarked that the plaintiff was not a party to the agreement between the defendant and Kendrick &amp; Co., to which defendant appellant\u2019s counsel replied: \u201cWe contend that the note is not good in the hands of the payee\u201d\u2014and added: \u201cDoes your honor hold that the payee could indorse that note to a person who had knowl-. edge of these facts, and that that person could-then bring action against the maker of the note and recover upon it?\u201d To this the court replied: \u201cI think he can.\u201d The court had previously remarked: \u201cI do not see how this defense can be maintained ,-in a case against a holder for value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> It is quite evident that the learned court below was of opinion that this defense was not available against a holder for value; even though he had notice of defendant\u2019s equities. In this ruling the learned court confounded a holder for value with a holder in due course <em>ks </em>that term is defined in the Negotiable Instruments Law (Consol. Laws 1909, c. 38). \u201cA holder in due course\u201d of a note, under section 91, is one who has no notice of any \u201cdefect in title of the person negotiating it.\u201d Section 94 describes the title as defective when the holder obtains the instrument \u201cin breach of faith or under such circumstances as amount to fraud.\u201d The defense here asserted alleged such a negotiation, and if proved, would overcome the presumption established by section .98 that plaintiff was a holder in due course, and put him to his proof that he had no knowledge of defendant\u2019s equities finder the agreement with Kendrick &amp; Co. German-American Bank v. Cunningham, 97 App. Div. 244, 89 N. Y. Supp. 836; Ginsburg v. Shurman, 71 Misc. Rep. 463, 128 N. Y. Supp. 653; Canajoharie Nat. Bank v. Diefendorf, 123 N. Y. 191, 25 N. E. 402, 10 L. R. A. 676. The defense is therefore . good.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> There was also some discussion in the court below, and apparently respondent advanced the claim, to the effect that defendant\u2019s reliance on the collateral agreement was an attempt \u201cto vary the terms of a written instrument by parol testimony\u201d\u2014citing Jamestown Business College v. Allen, 172 N. Y. 291, 64 N. E. 952, 92 Am. St. Rep. 740. That case, however, has no application. The defendant appeals to no parol testimony, but, on the contrary, refers to a written contract as modifying the terms of the note; and although, as pleaded, the written contract did not originally refer to a note, but to four installment notes, the allegation is sufficient to show that by subsequent oral agreement (for which, from its very terms, there was mutual consideration) the parties modified the contract by substituting the one note for the originally promised four notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> The court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion to dismiss the defense and directed the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff. Defendant appellant now makes the point that the dismissal of a defense at the trial is not permissible. In this, however, he is in error. See Amper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>sand Hotel Co. v. Home Ins. Co., 198 N. Y. 495, 91 N. E. 1099, 28 L. R. A. (N. S.) 218, 19 Ann. Cas. 839.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\"><bracketnum>[4]</bracketnum> The respondent contends that, inasmuch as the defendant appellant\" has not appealed from the judgment, but only from the order denying his motion for a new trial, he cannot avail on this appeal of any alleged errors of law committed below. In support, he cites, among others, the case of Alden v. Knights of Maccabees, 178 N. Y. 535, 71 N. E. 104. That case, however, held merely that an appeal from the judgment alone does not bring up for review questions of fact. The converse is by no means true. On the contrary, it has been held repeatedly that an appeal solely from an order denying a new trial brings up for review in the Appellate Division (and evidently in this court as well\u2014see Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3188, 3189, 3192) all errors committed below. Alden Case, supra, 178 N. Y. 541, 542, 71 N. E. 104; Raible v. Hygienic Ice Co., 134 App. Div. 705, 119 N. Y. Supp. 138; Voisin v. Commercial Ins. Co., 123 N. Y. 120, 25 N. E. 325, 9 L. R. A. 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\"><bracketnum>[5,6]</bracketnum> Respondent\u2019s other contentions are not very clear, but'apparently he urges that the separate defense does not contain a denial\u2019 of material allegations of the complaint, and is therefore incomplete-under the rule laid down in Douglass v. Phoenix Co., 138 N. Y. 209, 33 N. E. 938, 20 L. R. A. 118, 34 Am. St. Rep. 448. Evidently the-\u201cmaterial\u201d allegation to which he refers is that the note \u201clawfully came into the possession of plaintiff for valu'e.\u201d That, however, is-not equivalent to the plea that plaintiff is a holder in due course. Moreover, it is, in any aspect, defective as stating merely a legal conclusion. Browning, King &amp; Co. v. Terwilliger, 144 App. Div. 516, 129 N. Y. Supp. 431; Eulton v. Varney, 117 App. Div. 575, 102 N. Y. Supp. 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\"><bracketnum>[7]</bracketnum> If, however, plaintiff should rely on the presumption accorded in the Negotiable Instruments Raw, that he is a holder in due course, then defendant is entitled to have considered the allegation of the answer that the plaintiff is not a bona fide holder for value.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax3X\"><bracketnum>[8]</bracketnum> The plaintiff respondent\u2019s claim that this pleading states mprely a legal conclusion might have force, had it been raised below, but it is not available here; for, had it been raised below, defendant, under the pleadings, would have been entitled to permission to amend so as-to plead that plaintiff, at the time he negotiated the note, had knowledge of the facts of the defense as set forth. See McCarton v. City of N. Y., 149 App. Div. 516, 133 N. Y. Supp. 939; Ramsay v. Miller, 202 N. Y. 72, 95 N. E. 35; Boynton Furnace Co. v. Trohn, 141 App. Div. 773, 126 N. Y.
