The sale and delivery were not proved, so that the first cause of action was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-3\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> As to the second cause of action plaintiff failed to prove an express promise to pay. It did prove, however, that daily bills had been sent to the defendant as each lot of coal was delivered, and that monthly bills were sent on the 1st of each month, one of them on June 1, 1912. Plaintiff was erroneously prevented from proving that no objection had ever been made to these bills. Upon this state of facts, an account stated as of June 1, 1912, would have been made out, or at least the evidence would have warranted the submission of that issue to the jury. See Lockwood v. Thorne, 11 N. Y. 170, 62 Am. Dec. 81; Spellman v. Muehlfeld Piano Co., 166 N. Y. 245, 59 N. E. 817.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-4\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Appellant has made a point which may arise on the new trial, and should therefore be disposed of. It moved at the opening for judgment on the second cause of action, on the ground that its plea of account stated had been denied by the defendant in the form of denial of knowledge of. information sufficient to form a belief, and that such denial, as to a matter which must have been within defendant\u2019s personal knowledge, was a sham, citing Kirschbaum v. Eschmann, 205 N. Y. 127, 132-133, 98 N. E. 328. It is evident, without further argument, from a recital of the facts upon which the inference of an account stated is based, that the allegation is not one of the character referred to in the Kirschbaum Case, of which personal knowledge on the part of the defendant must necessarily be predicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
