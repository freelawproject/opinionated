It appears, without contradiction, that after a prolonged dispute as to the amount due from defendant to plaintiff, defendant wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-7\">\u201cWe inclose our check for $132.59, together with statement showing our entire indebtedness to you on the Gimbel bodies. This statement is in accordance with the contract. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1069-8\">The check inclosed was indorsed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-9\">\u201cIn full settlement as per contract.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1069-10\">The check was deposited and used by the plaintiff, and two days later plaintiff.wrote defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-11\">\u201cTour check for $132.59 received, for which we will credit your account. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1069-12\">There can be no doubt that this would have constituted an accord and satisfaction as pleaded, were it not for the point raised by the plaintiff respondent to the effect that he himself never saw the check, Tut that it was indorsed by his son, who had authority \u201cto indorse for him,\u201d and who was authorized \u201cto sign for him,\u201d and who was his bookkeeper. He also said of his son:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1069-14\">\u201cHe has only a right to indorse checks for deposit; that is all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1069-15\">Even if the authority of the son was not so extensive that the plaintiff was bound by his acceptance of the check with the qualifying indorsement, the accompanying letter which the plaintiff received sufficiently indicated that the check was in settlement of the account after a dispute. On familiar principles, an accord and satisfaction was thus established.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-16\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Respondent\u2019s further claim that he is, at all events, entitled to recover for a further sum for \u201cextra work,\u201d is disposed of by the conceded fact that the so-called \u201cextra work\u201d was only a modification of the contract, changing the character of some of the work to be done, and that such modification was made before the contract was accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-17\">J\u00e1dgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
