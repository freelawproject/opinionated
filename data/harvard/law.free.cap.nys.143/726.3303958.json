Plaintiff claims that the loss was caused through the negligence of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-18\">The case seems to be one in which an inspection as provided in sec-, tion 803 of the Code is appropriate. See Chojnacki v. Int. R. T. Co., <em>76 </em>Misc. Rep. 427, 134 N. Y. Supp. 1090; Donoghue v. Callanan, 152 App. Div. 162, 136 N. Y. Supp. 657; Beyer v. Transportation D. Co., 139 App. Div. 724, 124 N. Y. Supp. 463. The ultimate merits of the entire case on debatable questions of law urged by the defendants should not be decided on this motion. There seems, however, absolutely no reason why photographs of the vault should be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-19\">The order should therefore be modified by permitting one inspec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>tion of the interior and exterior of the vault, not to exceed two hours, at some time convenient to defendants, which can no doubt be agreed upon between the respective counsel, by the -electrician and mason named in the order, in the presence of plaintiff\u2019s counsel. The order may also provide that there shall be no disturbance of the structure of the vault nor of any apparatus connected with it. As so modified the order is affirmed, without costs of this appeal to either party. Settle order on notice. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
