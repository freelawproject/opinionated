The answer, in addition to general denials,-, sets up as a defense and counterclaim the payment by decedent, on the same day on which the foregoing indebtedness was incurred, of over $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-13\">After plaintiff had proved his case, the defendant merely put in evidence two checks, aggregating $500, to the order of plaintiff\u2019s assignors, and indorsed by them, but signed by defendant\u2019s decedent <em>as executor of a named estate. </em>Whatever presumption of fact might have arisen from the giving of his individual checks by defendant\u2019s decedent under the circumstances (see 30 Cyc. 1271-1273), it can hardly be claimed, I think, that any presumption of payment of his individual debt arises from the giving by defendant\u2019s decedent of checks of an estate of which he was a trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-14\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
