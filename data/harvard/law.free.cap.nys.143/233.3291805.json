He was thereupon sentenced to be confined in the Erie County Penitentiary for a term of 240 days. It is claimed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>r\u00e9lator that the sentence exceeded that which the City Court, sitting as a Court of Special Sessions, could within constitutional limitations be given the power to impose, and was for that reason void.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The crime of which defendant was convicted was a misdemeanor (section 1299 of the Penal Law [Consol. Laws 1909, c. 40]), and in the first instance was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the court of Special Sessions of the City of Buffalo to hear and determine. Section 70 of Chapter 570 of the Laws of 1909, as amended by chapter 228, Laws of 1910. The court being a Court of Special Sessions, before the amendment above referred to, the judgment which might be imposed by the court upon conviction of a defendant was limited by the provisions of section 717 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, and could not exceed a fine of $50 and imprisonment for 6 months. That amendment in terms gave the court\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-6\">\u201cpower to impose sentence of fine or imprisonment, or both, in the discretion of the court in all cases within its jurisdiction, upon conviction, to the same extent as the County Court of the county of Erie could do in like cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The City Court of Buffalo is a local inferior court created by -the Legislature (chapter 570 of the Laws of 1909). Section 18 of article 6 of the Constitution provides that inferior local courts of civil and criminal jurisdiction may be established by the Legislature; but it is also provided that a court so created shall not be a court of record, \u25a0 neither shall it have any equity jurisdiction, nor\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-9\">\u201cany greater jurisdiction in other respects than js conferred upon County Courts by or under this article.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">The criminal jurisdiction of the City Court of Buffalo, sitting as a Court of Special Sessions, as extended by the amendment of 1910 above referred to, is therefore clearly within the letter of the Constitution, for it assumes to give that court power to impose sentence only to the same extent as the \u201cCounty Court of Erie county could do in like cases.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> But .it is claimed that this amendment violates another consti- \u25a0 tutional provision, which is found in section 2 of article 1, which so far as pertinent here is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-12\">\u201cThe trial by jury in all cases in which it has heretofore been used shall remain inviolate forever.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">It is conceded that this provision is to be read in connection with section 23 of article 6, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b266-14\">\u201cCourts of Special Sessions shall have such jurisdiction of offenses of the grade of misdemeanors as may be prescribed by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-15\">It is further conceded, and the cases so hold, that the Legislature may give such courts exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all cases involving charges of offenses of that grade. People ex rel. Comaford v. Dutcher, 83 N. Y. 243; People v. Austin, 49 Hun, 396, 3 N. Y. Supp. 578. The provision of the Constitution which preserves the right of trial by jury is limited by its terms to those cases \u201cin which it has heretofore been used.\u201d It does not apply to cases \u25a0heard in a Court of Special Sessions, for the reason that trial by a constitutional jury\u2014i. e., a jury of 12 men\u2014was not within the course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>of procedure in such courts, and had not been, when this provision first appeared in the Constitution. People ex rel. Murray v. Justices, etc., in and for the City and County of N. Y., 74 N. Y. 406. It follows, therefore, that the statute giving the City Court, sitting as a Court of Special Sessions, exclusive jurisdiction to try and determine charges of misdemeanors, is not violative of that provision of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-3\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> It is, however, urged that, because no greater jurisdiction can be given that court than is given the County Court, and because, if' relator had been prosecuted in the County Court, he would have been entitled to trial by a constitutional jury, the jurisdiction and power of the City Court as a Court of Special Sessions has been by the statute above quoted extended beyond that of the County Court, in that the Court of Special Sessions can try and determine such cases without a constitutional jury. It is difficult to appreciate the force of this contention. Except for the limitation by section 717 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, above referred to, of the power of Courts of Special Sessions to render judgment of fine and imprisonment in case of conviction, there could be little doubt that such courts would have the power to impose a fine or imprisonment, or both, within the limit prescribed by the statute as penalty for the particular misdemeanor of which defendant had been convicted. This limitation being statutory only, it may, of course, be extended, or entirely removed, by subsequent legislation. The limitation never applied to the power of the County Court. The amendment removes it from the City Court of Buffalo, sitting as a Court of Special Sessions. \u25a0 The same argument as to the unconstitutionality of this City Court statute as it now exists in the amended form would have been equally persuasive that the statute as it existed before the amendment was unconstitutional. Before the amendment it could fry and determine without a constitutional jury all charges of misdemeanors, which, if on proper application they had been directed to be prosecuted by indictment, could only have been tried and determined in a court of record with the aid of such a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">The order should be affirmed. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
