He was appointed under a City Court judgment recovered by the plaintiff, Phillips, against that corporation! by confession. In May, 1913, in an action in the Supreme Court by the appellant, Gordon, as plaintiff, against Phillips, the receiver, Kind-gen, and others, it was adjudged, among other things, that the City Court judgment was confessed with intent to hinder, delay, and defraud the appellant, and that the receiver\u2019s counsel in the court below-acted as one of the attorneys in entering the fraudulent confession of judgment, as well as other like confessions .of judgment, though there-was no finding that the receiver was a party to or was privy to any fraud. Because of the fraudulent acts of those instrumental in procuring his appointment, it was adjudged:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-13\">\u201cThat the moneys in possession o\u00a3 the defendant William J. Kindgen, as-receiver of the defendant Hudson Film Company, is and was held in trust for the said Blilton J. Gordon, the plaintiff herein, to the extent of the judgment in favor of said plaintiff\u201d for $3,641.50.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-14\">In disregard of this Supreme Court judgment, the receiver has procured the entry of an order on August 21, 1913, passing his accounts, and decreeing the payment of $360 of the moneys which the Supreme-Court judgment awarded to the appellant, to himself for commissions,. $470.30 thereof to the counsel who entered the fraudulent confessions, of judgment, and $125 thereof to his counsel on this appeal for counsel fees. The Supreme Court judgment has been appealed from, but. it still remains unreversed and in full force and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-15\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The counsel fee awarded to the receiver\u2019s attorney, who participated in the entry of what the unreversed judgment of the Supreme-Court holds to be fraudulent confessions of judgment, cannot be sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>tained in defiance of such judgment. Clapp v. Clapp, 49 Hun, 195, 200, 1 N. Y. Supp. 919.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> So long as the Supreme Court judgment holding the appointment of the receiver fraudulent as against the appellant\u2019s claim stands, the appellant is entitled to insist that as to him it should be deemed never to have been made, and the City Court cannot lawfully wrest from appellant what the Supreme Court adjudged and still adjudges to be the appellant\u2019s property, which is now in the receiver\u2019s hands, and direct the receiver\u2019s commissions and counsel fees to be paid out of it, without the appellant\u2019s consent.

Watts, 45 Hun, 219-222.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> As the final determination of the Supreme Court action may materially affect the receiver\u2019s rights, there should be no accounting herein until the final determination of that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and application denied, with $10 costs, without prejudice to a renewal thereof in whole or in part upon the final determination of the Supreme Court action.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
