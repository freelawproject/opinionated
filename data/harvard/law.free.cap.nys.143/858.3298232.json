The character of the testimony offered by plaintiff was far from satisfactory, but the weight to be given to it was essentially a matter for the jury, with whose verdict we should not be disposed to interfere, if the evidence, such\" as it was, from a standpoint most favorable to the plaintiff, disclosed any culpable negligence on the part of defendant\u2019s servant.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It is a well-established rule that the mere happening of the accident is not sufficient to establish negligence, and there is no other evidence thereof in the present case. That the driver of the car was not proceeding at an unreasonable rate of speed, and that he had his car well under control, is very satisfactorily established by the fact that plaintiff was not much more seriously injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-15\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> If a motion had been made for a dismissal of the complaint upon this ground, the court might well have granted it. In the absence of such a motion, the insufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict was brought up upon the motion for a new trial, which as we think should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-19\">Judgment and order appealed from reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event.
