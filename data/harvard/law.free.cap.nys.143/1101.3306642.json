The charges related to the respondent\u2019s misconduct in certain bankruptcy proceedings before the United States District Court, which upon that report has convicted the respondent, and ordered him suspended from practice for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-9\">The Association of the Bar of the City of New York has brought the matter to this court upon the testimony and report of the special master. The respondent has submitted an answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-10\">We think the charges are sufficiently serious to require an investigation.- If the respondent is willing to submit the charges to this court upon the testimony taken by the special master and his findings, they can be so submitted, and the court will determine what, if any, discipline should be imposed. If, however, the respondent wishes to have another investigation of the charges, the matter will be referred to an official referee.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
