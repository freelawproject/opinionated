It is alleged that defendant was organized under the laws of this state and \u201coperating a railroad in various parts of\u201d this state \u201cand the state of Pennsylvania, and at the places hereinafter specified,\u201d and that at the date of the accident the plaintiff \u201cwas in the employ of defendant as a conductor upon a train which was being run by defendant along the line of its railroad near Starlight, in the state of Pennsylvania.\u201d Then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>the cause of the accident and the statute of the state of Pennsylvania are pleaded. Issue was joined, but the action had not been tried at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s death on February 13, 1912. On October 29, 1913, letters of administration were issued to decedent\u2019s widow, and a motion was made in February, 1913, to substitute the administratrix as plaintiff and to permit her to serve an amended complaint, basing the action upon the federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act, entitled \u201cAn act relating to the liability of common carriers by railroad to their employes in certain cases,\u201d passed April 22, 1908, and the amendatory act of April 5, 1910.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\">The action was not brought under that act, but is specifically based on the common law as modified by the statute of the state. An action under the federal law must be begun within two years from the time the cause of action accrued (section 6), but after nearly three years it is sought to convert the action under the state law into an action under the federal law, thus extending the statute by a substituted cause of action. On April 5, 1910, the federal act was amended so as to provide \u201cthat any right of action given by this act to a person suffering injury shall survive,\u201d etc. But the right\" cannot survive the time limited for its exercise, and when the person to whom the right is initially given elects to proceed under the law of the state, the right to proceed under the federal .statute is at least dormant, and ceases . after the expiration of the two years. The federal statute is tendered to him who, entitled, chooses to employ it. He may prefer the law of the state, as the injured person did in the present instance. But such law cannot be exploited, and, upon emergency, the action be changed into, one under the federal law. There is not a suggestion of fact in the original complaint indicating intention to avail of the federal statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
