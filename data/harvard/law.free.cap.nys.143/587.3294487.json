Y., and as a part of his business he sold oats to farmers for planting purposes. The defendant, a corporation, was engaged in the general business of selling grain at wholesale, generally in car load lots. It had an agent, one Merriam, who went about soliciting orders. In January of that year Merriam called upon the plaintiff and obtained an oral order for a car load of oats, which order was given by the plaintiff in manner as follows (using his own words):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atk\">\u201cX asked Mr. Merriam to furnish me a car of extreme Northern grain seed oats; that our people were cranks on seed oats, and I wanted him to give us something nice, and I was willing to give him one or two cents over the feed oats price. Mr. Merriam said he would see I had an extra fine car. That was all that was said that day. Mr. Merriam had been in the habit of going there to my place of business, and knew what I was doing, selling seed oats and other things.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">Merriam transmitted this order to the defendant, who thereupon sent to the plaintiff a \u201cconfirmatory\u201d letter, partly printed and partly written, in which the defendant confirmed a sale to the plaintiff of \u201cone car * * * heavy fancy clip\u2019t seed oats * * * at 42%\u201d cents (a bushel), to be shipped \u201cEeb\u2019y 15th, or later; terms, usual.\u201d The defendant, as plaintiff well knew, did not raise the grain it sold, but simply purchased the same in the West, generally in the Chicago market, and had the car loads shipped directly from Chicago to its customers. The practice was to send along a bill of lading with the grain, and afford the customer an opportunity to examine the cargo before delivery and acceptance. The defendant bought on the Chicago market a car load of oats for delivery to the plaintiff on an order for \u201cfancy clip\u2019t seed oats.\u201d On said order, a car load of oats was shipped to the plaintiff at Pawling, where he received the same and stored the oats in his bins. He paid for the oats according to a bill rendered for \u201cfey. clip\u2019t seed oats.\u201d He sold to his various customers, farmers, for planting purposes, some 1,300 bushels of the cargo. It happened that the oats so sold to the farmers did not germinate when planted under ordinary conditions, and he was obliged to make good to his customers the moneys they had paid for the oats, and, as he.claimed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>he incurred obligations to said customers for their expenses in plowing and reseeding their lands.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">He brought this action to recover his losses, on the ground that the defendant had warranted that the oats in question were suitable for planting purposes and could and would germinate under ordinary-conditions of soil and culture. On the trial, the court held that there was no express warranty, and the case was submitted to the jury on the theory of an implied warranty that the oats were suitable for planting purposes. The defendant gave proofs that in the trade there were well known and simple processes for testing the germinating powers of the oats; but the plaintiff testified that he was ignorant of these processes, and had been informed by Merriam, after the oats had been received by him, that they had already been tested, and that therefore he made no tests himself before selling the oats to his customers. _ The defendant had never seen the oats in question, nor had them in its actual possession, except as they were in transitu. They had been selected and shipped at Chicago as \u201cfancy clip\u2019t seed oats,\u201d according to the usual methods of the general grain business. The proofs were that the words \u201cseed oats\u201d were descriptive of large or heavy berries which had been cleaned of chaff and foreign seeds, to fit them for planting. The plaintiff produced evidence to show that these oats had been \u201cpurified\u201d\u2014that is, treated by fumes of sulphur to such an extent as to impair or destroy their power of germination; but whatever such treatment had been used was not done by or known to the defendant, and must have been done, if at all, before the defendant bought the oats at Chicago for delivery to the plaintiff. The primary question involved in this appeal is whether, under these circumstances, the law will charge the defendant with an implied warranty that these oats were suitable for ordinary planting purposes. The defect in the oats was latent. It was due to causes unknown to the defendant. The oats delivered were selected as \u201cseed oats,\u201d and answered generally to the description of such; but their quality for planting purposes was inferior, according to the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The general rule as to an implied warranty in the sale of goods is that, unless the vendor is the producer or manufacturer of the articles, there is no implied warranty against latent defects, even if the vendor knows the purposes for which the goods are bought. Bartlett v. Hoppock, 34 N. Y. 118, 88 Am. Dec. 428; Dounce v. Dow, 64 N. Y. 411; American Forcite Powder Mfg. Co. v. Brady, 4 App. Div. 95, 38 N. Y. Supp. 545; Cafre v. Lockwood, 22 App. Div. 11, 47 N. Y. Supp. 916; Reynolds v. Mayor, Lane &amp; Co., 39 App. Div. 218, 57 N. Y. Supp. 106; Carleton v. Lombard, Ayres &amp; Co., 149 N. Y. 137, 43 N. E. 422. There are several authorities in this state relative to the question of an implied warranty in the sale of seeds; but all of these, so far as an implied warranty as to the quality of the seeds was declared, relate to cases where the sale of the seeds was made by the growers thereof, and not by middlemen in the ordinary course of business. White v. Miller, 71 N. Y. 118, 27 Am. Rep. 13; Landreth v. Wyckoff, 67 App. Div. 145, 73 N. Y. Supp. 388; Prentice v. Fargo, 53 App. Div. 608, 65 N. Y. Supp. 1114.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> There is, of course, an implied warranty on the part of every seller, whether manufacturer or not, to the extent that the article sold is identical with the article bought, as was held in Hawkins v. Pemberton, 51 N. Y. 198, 10 Am. Rep. 595, where one who sold an article as \u201cblue vitriol,\u201d which was in fact not \u201cblue vitriol,\u201d but a substance known as \u201csaltzburger,\u201d or mixed vitriol,' and which contained but a small portion of blue vitriol, was held liable on a breach of implied\" warranty as to identity, but not as to quality. In Allan v. Lake, 18 A. &amp; E. (N. S.) 560, one who had-sold turnip seed as \u201cSkirving\u2019s Swedes\u201d was held for a breach of an implied warranty, on proof that the seed sold was not \u201cSkirving\u2019s Swedes.\u201d A similar case is that of Van Wyck v. Allen, 69 N. Y. 61, 25 Am. Rep. 136, where one who had sold cabbage seed as \u201cVan Wycklin\u2019s Flat Dutch, raised at New Lots, Long Island,\u201d was held liable for a breach of implied warranty, on proof that the seed delivered was not \u201cVan Wycklin\u2019s Flat Dutch,\u201d which was a well known and specially valuable brand of cabbage seed; but here again the breach was as to an implied warranty of identity between the thing sold and. delivered and the thing bought.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The most recent authority on this point is Depew v. Peck Hardware Co., 121 App. Div. 28, 105 N. Y. Supp. 390. There a farmer bought seed as pure alfalfa seed. After it was planted, it turned out that the seed was mostly trefoil and dodder, both useless weeds, with but a very small mixture of alfalfa. The seller was held liable for breach of an implied contract because the seed was not alfalfa\u2014even impure alfalfa, although there was a small proportion of the latter present. The court, however, was careful to point out that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">\u201cIf the alfalfa seed had been defective, not up to the standard in quality, there would have been no implied warranty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-7\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> There the seller was not the producer of the seeds, but a mere middleman. Now, in the case at bar, the defendant was a middleman. It did not raise the oats, nor was it in the business of selling seeds for planting purposes. It had no knowledge, actual or constructive, of any latent defects in the oats in question. It did deliver oats of the general description of \u201cseed oats,\u201d and if there was any defect in them it was in their quality of germinating power, and not as to their identity as \u201cfancy clip\u2019t seed oats.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">The judgment and order, should be reversed, and a new trial grant\u00e9d; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
