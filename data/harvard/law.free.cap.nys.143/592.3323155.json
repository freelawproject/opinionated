I think the learned trial court exceeded his power when he undertook to fix the amount, of costs that should be awarded by the Special Term. But even if the learned trial court possessed the power, the order should have to be modified. The rule frequently enforced in this court is that, upon the facts presented, leave to amend should only be granted upon payment of full costs. Palazzo v. Degnon-McLean Contracting Co., 115 App. Div. 172, 100 N. Y. Supp. 682; Woolsey v. Brooklyn Heights R. R. Co., 129 App. Div. 410, 113 N. Y. Supp. 245; Audley v. Townsend, 131 App. Div. 79, 115 N. Y. Supp. 145; Carpenter v. Atlas Improvement Co., 132 App. Div. 112, 116 N. Y. Supp. 454.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-13\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> The appellant argues that this case is not within the rule cited, for the reason that the order permitted the plaintiff to read on any subsequent trial any testimony taken on former trials. The answer to this is that that right is not limited to the plaintiff, but is also secured to the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-14\">That part of the order of April 7th from which the appeal is taken must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the order modified, by striking therefrom the words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-16\">\u201cOrdered that these terms be inclusive for leave to amend the answer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-17\">The original order having been modified, the appeal from the order of May 20, 1913, should be dismissed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
