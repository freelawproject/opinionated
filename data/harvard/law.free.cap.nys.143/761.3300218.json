A $50 fine was imposed therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The order to show cause why appellant should not be punished for contempt set forth only the appellant\u2019s alleged stipulation in open court and its alleged violation, and said nothing about any City Court justice\u2019s verbal direction in amplification thereof. The moving affidavit set forth only the alleged stipulation and its alleged violation. The appellant denies the alleged stipulation, but admits making a different stipulation, which he insists he complied with in all respects. He was not formally charged with, and therefore was not required to affirm or deny, the violation of any verbal direction of the City Court justice. In its order the court found him guilty on both grounds. The proof is insufficient to show that he consciously disregarded any stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Even if, as contended by respondent, a justice\u2019s recollection of his directions to an attorney cannot be reviewed or questioned by any other tribunal, and following the rule that a person who, after any court has decided to restrain the doing of an act, does the act with notice, either actual or constructive, of its unformulated, because unwritten, decision, is guilty of a contempt, where the court acted within its powers (People ex rel. Platt v. Rice, 144 N. Y. 250, 260, 261, 39 N. E. 88), it is clear that the City Court had no power to restrain proceedings in the Supreme Court to enforce the judgment of the latter court in an action to which a City Court receiver was a party. This would, in effect, establish a system of appeals to the City Court from judgments of the higher court, which our system of judicial procedure does not contemplate.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion denied, with $10' costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
