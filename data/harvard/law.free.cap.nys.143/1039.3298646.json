But one witness, apart from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>\"herself, was examined on 'her behalf, and he testified that at the time of the accident she said she did not know what had caused her to slip, and that he himself looked all around, and saw nothing but sawdust \u25a0on the floor. It is altogether probable, therefore, that this judgment \u25a0should be set aside as against the weight of evidence. Klassen v. Interurban Co., 116 App. Div. 153, 101 N. Y. Supp. 581. It is plain, however, that no negligence on the part of defendant has been shown. The mere fact, if it was a fact, that there was a piece of meat on the floor at the instant that plaintiff slipped, is no proof that defendant did not use due care in maintaining his place of business. Kelly v. Otterstedt, 80 App. Div. 398, 80 N. Y. Supp. 1008; Kipp v. Woolworth, 150 App. Div. 283, 134 N. Y. Supp. 646. The evidence .of the defendant is. well-nigh conclusive that he used every known, and indeed every possible, effort to keep his place in a perfectly clean and safe condition. Shaw v. Webber, 79 Hun, 307, at page 308, 29 N. Y. Supp. 437, 438, cited by respondent, is not decisive, although the court does say that evidence analogous to that in the case at bar\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-5\">\u2022\u201cwas sufficient to sustain the finding that the negligence of the defendant or his servants permitted a piece of suet or fat to be left on the floor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1072-6\">It is plain that that remark is casual. The court says significantly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1072-7\">\u201cThe questions of defendant\u2019s negligence and of the plaintiff\u2019s freedom therefrom were not really litigated on the trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1072-8\">Thereafter follows a long discussion of the only question really raised, in that case, namely, of the right of the plaintiff to impeach a release executed by\u2019her, without restoration of a sum of money which \u25a0she alleged had been given to her by the defendant as a gift.</p>\n<p id=\"b1072-9\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant . to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
