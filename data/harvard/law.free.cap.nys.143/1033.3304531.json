Plaintiff, who contracted with the owner to construct the building, refused to continue after certain payments were in arrears, whereupon defendant promised that,, if plaintiff would resume and complete the work without filing a mechanic\u2019s lien, he would pay plaintiff the money due, and plaintiff, relying on such promise, completed the work. <em>Held, </em>that defendant\u2019s promise to plaintiff was not within the statute of frauds, as being one to answer for another\u2019s debt; an independent consideration having moved to de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1034\">*1034</page-number>fendant by the completion of the work by reason of his interests in the premises.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b1066-4\">[Ed.

He alleges that defendant and an- associate were mortgagees under both a first mortgage and a second mortgage or building loan; furthermore \u201cthat defendant * * * was interested in the perform- \u25a0 anee and progress of the work, * * * as said work tended to and did enhance the value of said premises,\u201d etc. Plaintiff, having made an agreement with the owner to do the construction work, declined to go on when certain payments became in arrears. Thereupon defendant promised that if plaintiff would resume the work and complete it, and abstain from filing a mechanic\u2019s lien, he would pay plaintiff the moneys due, at the same time saying that he had enough money on hand out of the new building loan to pay the amount which he promised. Plaintiff, relying on this promise, resumed the work, finished it, and abstained from filing a mechanic\u2019s lien. .</p>\n<p id=\"AMX\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The defense demurred to is that defendant\u2019s promise was one to answer for the debt, default, or miscarriage of another, was not in writing, and was, therefore, void under the statute of frauds. I think that the decision in Mechanics\u2019 Bank v. Stettheimer, 116 App. Div. 198, 101 N. Y. Supp. 513, is decisive of this case. The promise in the case at bar is an original promise, as described in the third category laid down by Mr. Justice Ingraham in the Mechanics\u2019 Bank Case, at page 202 of 116 App. Div., page 516 of 101 N. Y. Supp.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1066-16\">\u201cWhere, although the debt remains, the promise Is founded on a new consideration <em>which moves to the promisor.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1066-17\">Defendant\u2019s interest in the premises, as set forth, is sufficient warrant for holding that a benefit moved to him by the completion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>work. See Davis v. Patrick, 141 U. S. 479, 12 Sup. Ct. 58, 35 L. Ed. 826. This point is emphasized by the distinction drawn in Mallory v. Gillett, 21 N. Y. 412, where the promisor had no such interest. See, also, Bruce v. Burr, 67 N. Y. 240; Cardell v. McNiel, 21 N. Y. <em>336; </em>Milks v. Rich, 80 N. Y. 269, 36 Am. Rep. 615; Brookline National Bank v. Moers, 19 App. Div. 155, 45 N. Y. Supp. 997; Raabe v. Squier, 148 N. Y. 81, 42 N. E. 516; Almond v. Hart, 46 App. Div. 431, 61 N. Y. Supp. 849; Schild v. Eckstein Brewing Co., 108 App. Div. 50, 95 N. Y. Supp. 493; Breen v. Isaacs, 49 Misc. Rep. 127, 96 N. Y. Supp. 741.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-3\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> Respondent makes a claim that the complaint is not good, because it is not alleged that the defendant promised to the plaintiff to pay him. I think, however, that the allegations of the complaint sufficiently show an agreement made between plaintiff and defendant, and plaintiff\u2019s performance thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-4\">Judgment reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and demurrer of plaintiff sustained, with $10 costs, with leave to defendant to serve an amended answer within six days after service of a copy of the order entered herewith, with notice of entry of the same in the City Court, upon payment of costs in this court and in the court below.
