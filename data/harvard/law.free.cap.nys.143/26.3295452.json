J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaC\">The court refused, under exception by the defendant, to charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AX2\">\u201cIf the jury finds that this depression between the sidewalk and the dirt space did not exceed 3 inches in depth, and the plaintiff fell, assuming that he did fall, by simply putting his .foot into a depression 3 inches in depth, and so received his injury, the city is not liable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-17\">I think that the exception was well taken and is fatal to the judgment. The plaintiff, a man 46 years old, testifies that about 7 p. m. of November 7, 1910, when walking on a flagstone sidewalk of a street in the borough of Brooklyn, city of New York, he suddenly put his foot into a hole pretty near the center of the sidewalk and went down, or, in his own words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-18\">\u201cI felt my foot go down and I fell. * * * I don\u2019t know anything further about what caused me to fall, other than that I felt my foot go down on something, and I- fell.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-19\">There is no proof of any former accidents at this point. The proof presented by the defendant, that the depression was but 2J4 inches deep or less, was not the estimate of mere eye inspection, or of guess or surmise, but was the result of measurements or calculation. In Lalor v. City of New York, 208 N. Y. 431, 433, 102 N. E. 558, 559, Collin, J., writing for the Court of Appeals, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-20\">\u201cThere are no circumstances revealed by the evidence which lessen or mitigate the effect of our decisions as authority that as matter of law the existence of the hole, as described by the witness, did not charge the defendant with negligence. Hamilton v. City of Buffalo, 173 N. Y. 72 [65 N. E. 944]; Beltz v. City of Yonkers, 148 N. Y. 67 [42 N. E. 401]; Butler v. Village of Oxford, 186 N. Y. 444 [79 N. E. 712]; Terry v. Village of Perry, 199 N. Y. 79 [92 N. E. 91, 35 L. R. A. (N. S.) 666, 20 Ann. Cas. 796].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Examination of these cases cited shows that the depression in Hamilton\u2019s Case was about 4 inches in depth, that in Beltz\u2019s Case the hole caused by a break in the flagstone was 2% inches in depth, that in Butler\u2019s Case the surface of one walk was higher than that of the other by from 2^ inches at the center to 5 inches at the edge, and that in Terry\u2019s Case the difference in grade was % of an inch to_l% inches. The depth of the hole in Lalor\u2019s Case, supra, as determined by the credible evidence, was 4 inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">The limit named in the request in the case at bar is certainly within that in Lalor\u2019s Case, in Hamilton\u2019s Case, within the variance in Butler\u2019s Case, and but exceeds that in Beltz\u2019s Case by % of an inch. While it is declared in Terry\u2019s Case that \u201ceach case must stand upon its own peculiar facts,\u201d yet, if I read the opinion in Lalor\u2019s Case right, that case and the cases cited supra, are instances where the size or extent of the hole in each case was not sufficient in law to charge the respective defendants, on the principle that the defects were so slight as not to bring home negligence to the various municipalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">In Lalor\u2019s Case, Collin, J., as we have read, says that \u201cthere are no circumstances revealed which lessen or mitigate the effect of the decisions\u201d which he cites; i. e., Hamilton\u2019s Case and the other cases that follow in citation ut supra. Are there such circumstances in the case at bar? The character of such circumstances is not indicated in the opinion of the learned judge; but we have indication in the opinion in Terry\u2019s Case, supra, in that there are therein enumerated certain cases of exception. But none of such exceptional cases is analogous to the case at bar, save perhaps Gastel\u2019s Case, 194 N. Y. 15, 86 N. E. 833, 128 Am. St. Rep. 540, 16 Ann. Cas. 635, which, however, was placed expressly within the exceptions, because there was proof of other accidents, not as notice of the defect, but as indication of the danger of the defect. But in the case at bar the plaintiff, when walking in the evening of the day, fell into the depression or hole, as did Butler, Terry, and Beltz, respectively. In Hamilton\u2019s Case the accident happened in the daytime.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">The judgment and order must be reversed, 'and a new trial must be granted; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
