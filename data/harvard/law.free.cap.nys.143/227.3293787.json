Respondent does not seem to claim on this appeal that he, though not in fact the owner, was not the person responsible for the operation and management of the car. The evidence presented a fair question of fact both as to defendant\u2019s negligence and the contributory negligence of the deceased, and we should not be. inclined to disturb the verdict of the jury in defendant\u2019s favor, except that, as it appears to us, the substantial rights of plaintiff were on the trial prejudiced by certain rulings of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> The speed at which the car was running at the time of the accident. was a material factor in the evidence upon the question of defendant\u2019s negligence. No witness testified directly as to an estimate of the speed of the car, and the court in the course of the trial held that, there was no evidence warranting the jury in finding that the speed exceeded 4 miles an hour. This ruling was first made at defendant\u2019s- request, when the court was considering the question whether there was evidence to go to the jury on the question of a violation by defendant of the statute as it then existed, which limited the speed at. which it was lawful to run an automobile under the conditions which, the evidence disclosed were then present. To this ruling plaintiff\" duly excepted. When plaintiff\u2019s counsel was making his closing address to the jury, the court held that he had no right to suggest to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>them that the car was going at a greater rate of speed than 4 miles an hour. Again, in the charge of the court the jury were fully instructed that, though they could not urider the evidence find that the car was running at a greater speed than 4 miles an hour, yet, as the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-5\">\u201cIf the condition there, in view of the park being located on the right-hand side, the conditions as to the street lights, and the conditions as to the probability of persons passing from the park out into the street, were such that the chauffeur ought to have reduced the speed more than he did, ought to have had his car under better control than he did, so as to stop it in less time and less space than he did, then those are circumstances which you have a right to take into consideration on the question whether he was or was not negligent in the operation of that car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Exceptions to these rulings of the court were duly taken in behalf of plaintiff. We think the jury\u2019s consideration of the question of the speed of the car should not have been thus limited, and that there was some evidence of facts from which as an inference the jury might under proper instruction have determined that the car was running at a considerably greater speed than 4 miles an hour. It appeared that the car weighed 3,000 pounds and was equipped with a gasoline motor of 45 horse power. It was also equipped with both a foot and an emergency brake, which, as the chauffeur testified, \u201cacted quickly and were very forcible and powerful.\u201d He also testified that as soon as he saw the intestate, who 'was then directly in front of the left headlight of the car and but about a foot distant, he \u201cthrew on the brakes and pulled the throttle, which slackens the speed of the machine and stops her.\u201d He further says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-7\">\u201cX applied the foot brake just as soon as I saw the hoy. I put the other brake on after that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">And this brake was found to be on after the car had stopped. These is further testimony upon which the jury might have found that this car, notwithstanding these efforts of the chauffeur to stop it, ran, after the intestate was struck, more than 70 feet along a street having, as the exhibits indicate, a slight upgrade in the direction the car was moving. Under such circumstances it is apparent that the car had a considerable momentum when it struck the intestate; and, if it ran more than 70 feet after he was struck under the conditions shown by this part of the evidence of the chauffeur, it is not credible that its speed was not greater than 4 miles an hour. Though there was no evidence to show within what distance this or a similar car would be stopped under similar conditions when running at any designated speed per hour, yet it was for the jury to deduce as - an inference from these, facts the speed of the car, and not for the couft to hold as matter of law that the evidence did not warrant a finding that it was running more than 4 miles an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> We are also of the opinion that the court erred in charging the jury upon the question of the contributory negligence of plaintiff\u2019s intestate. In the body of the charge the jury were instructed correctly that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b261-10\">\u201cA boy of that age is not held to the same high degree of care that a person of mature years is held. He is held under the law to only that degree of care and caution for his own safety that a reasonably careful and cautious hoy of that age is accustomed to exercise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>And the court further at some length explained and elaborated this principle in its proper application to this case. But, after the completion of the main charge, the court, at the request of defendant\u2019s attorney, charged</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">: \u201cThat the burden is upon plaintiff to show that his intestate, Frank Ackerman, was incapable of taking care of himself in the street, in order to warrant the jury in finding that plaintiff\u2019s intestate was not guilty of contributory negligence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">The effect of this statement by the court was an instruction to the jury that plaintiff was required to establish that intestate, without reference to his age, intelligence, or the circumstances in which the evidence shows he was placed at the time of the injury, was actually incapable of taking care of himself in the street. That the court did not at the time fully appreciate the comprehensiv\u00e9 extent of this request to charge to which he acceded appears from the different statement of the law in the body of his charge, and also from some further requests which were charged at the suggestion of defendant\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\"><bracketnum>[3]</bracketnum> Recognizing, as we do, that error is not ordinarily to be predicated upon distinct parts of a charge, even though when, separately considered, they may be incomplete, or to some extent inaccurate, . statements of the law, if the charge, taken as a whole, contains correct instructions to the jury upon these points, yet we cannot say that this statement, addressed as it was to the jury among the last instructions they received, and coming with the added force of a distinct statement of what plaintiff must prove as to the capacity of deceased to care for himself in the street, else a finding that he was guilty of contributory negligence must be made, was not so prejudicial to plaintiff as not to present error for which a reversal of the judgment should be directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">The judgment and order should be reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to- the appellant to abide event. All concurred, except FOOTE, J., not sitting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
