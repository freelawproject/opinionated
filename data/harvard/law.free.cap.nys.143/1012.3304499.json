He was given a chair, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>the light turned on by the plaintiff\u2019s servant for him to read the meter. Instead of reading or inspecting the meter, he turned off the current. When asked why he was turning the lights off, he said, \u201cBecause you people do not pay your bills.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s wife immediately called up on the telephone the defendant\u2019s Hamilton Place station, where she paid her bills; but all proof of what was said by her or defendant\u2019s representative was excluded, to which plaintiff excepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-4\">She was allowed to testify that, as a result of what was said, defendant sent a man to her apartment, who at 6:30 p. m. the same evening turned on the current. She mailed her check in payment of defendant\u2019s bill on November 29, 1912. The indorsement thereon shows that it was deposited by defendant in the.bank on which it was drawn, and was also paid to defendant by that bank, on December 2, 1912. The defendant\u2019s bill was dated November 27, 1912, was received on November 27, 1912, part of the service charged therein was under date of November 11, 1912, and it seems to Have been paid promptly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-5\">The defendant\u2019s cut-out inspector testified that on December 2, 1912, he cut off the current as the result of a cut-off list he had had ever since November 29th, without, as he claims, either making any misrepresentations or using any force. His testimony is somewhat contradictory and unsatisfactory. But the direction of a verdict for the defendant establishes, for the purposes of this appeal, the truth of plaintiff\u2019s testimony in so far as there is any conflict as to details. Defendant\u2019s cashier testified to the receipt of plaintiff\u2019s wife\u2019s check for its bill, when he got to his office at 9 a. m. on the morning of December 2, 1912, in the first mail, and that he deposited it about noon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-6\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> Under the contract defendant had a right to enter plaintiff\u2019s apartment to read or inspect the meter at all reasonable times; under the statute it had a right to enter and cut off the current if bills were overdue and payment was refused after a demand; 4:30 p. m. on a Monday afternoon was a reasonable time to read or inspect the meter or to cut off the current because of an unpaid bill; but at that time there was no unpaid bill, and the entering of the apartment for the pretended purpose of inspecting the meter, and then wrongfully turning off the current without plaintiff\u2019s consent, constituted a trespass for which defendant would be liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-7\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> It is immaterial, except as to the amount of damages, whether such- a tortious entry is obtained by deceit, stealth, threats, force, or without actual consent; in any case it is a trespass.
