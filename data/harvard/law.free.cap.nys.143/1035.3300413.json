He testified that while in the employ of defendant, apparently on a weekly arrangement, he had a talk with the president of the defendant on June 30,1911, at which the following conversation occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1067-16\">\u201cMr. Bolton said: \u2018Butler, I don\u2019t want to lose you. We are very busy here. I am glad I got you back. I have got a year\u2019s work for you to do, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>I want you to do it.\u2019 I said: \u2018Mr. Bolton, if you tell me to stay,\u2019 I said, \u2018your word is' good enough for me. I will stick. I will turn down this other proposition.\u2019 Mr. -Bolton said: \u2018I want you to stay. We are busy, and we have-got this year\u2019s work. You are the man to do it, and I want you to do it\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">He further testified that the salary \u201cwas to be the same as before,\u201d1 namely, $40 per week. A few days later, July 5, 1911, plaintiff, on learning from the vice president, during the absence of. the president, that he was to be discharged, wrote Mr. Bolton a letter, in which he said, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1068-6\">\u201cOn Saturday we had a little talk together, and as above stated I gathered, that you wanted me to stay wit-h you. * * * Now, as you asked me not to do anything until you returned, and I promised not to, I do not relish being pitched out by the heels so summarily.\u201d -</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1068-7\">The motion to dismiss was made on the ground that \u201cupon the-plaintiff\u2019s own written admission and sworn testimony there was npevidence of any contract being in existence on June 30th,\u201d and the-written admission is specified as being the letter of July 5th, to which I have referred. It seems to me that the plaintiff gave ample evidence of an oral agreement of employment for a year, and that the significance of an admission to the contrary in his letter of July 5, 1911, if such it be, was a matter to be determined by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-8\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
