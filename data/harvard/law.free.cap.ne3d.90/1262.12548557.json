We conclude that CPLR 908 applies in the pre-certification context. As a result, notice to putative class members of a proposed dismissal, discontinuance, or compromise must be given.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff Geoffrey Desrosiers worked as an unpaid intern for Perry Ellis Menswear, LLC in 2012. In February 2015, he commenced a class action against defendants Perry Ellis Menswear and an affiliated entity (collectively, Perry Ellis), alleging that Perry Ellis improperly classified employees as interns. He sought wages on behalf of himself and similarly-situated individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In March 2015, Perry Ellis sent an offer of compromise to Desrosiers, which he accepted. On May 18, 2015, Perry Ellis moved to dismiss the complaint. By that date, the time within which Desrosiers was required to move for class certification pursuant to CPLR 902 had expired. Desrosiers did not oppose dismissal of the complaint, but he filed a cross motion seeking leave to provide notice of the proposed dismissal to putative class members pursuant to CPLR 908. Perry Ellis opposed the cross motion, arguing that notice to putative class members was inappropriate because Desrosiers had not moved for class certification within the required time. Supreme Court dismissed\n   the complaint but denied the cross motion to provide notice to putative class members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On appeal, the Appellate Division reversed the order insofar as appealed from by Desrosiers (\n   <em>\n    Desrosiers v. Perry Ellis Menswear, LLC,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290353,4290292\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/139/473/\">\n    139 A.D.3d 473\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290292\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/139/473/4290292/\">\n    30 N.Y.S.3d 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1st Dept. 2016] ). The court concluded that CPLR 908\"is not rendered inoperable simply because the time for the individual plaintiff to move for class certification has expired,\" and that notice to putative class members is \"particularly important under the present circumstances, where the limitations period could run on the putative class members' cases following discontinuance of the individual plaintiff's action\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 474,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4290292\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/139/473/4290292/\">\n    30 N.Y.S.3d 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiff Christopher Vasquez was employed by defendant National Securities Corporation (NSC) as a financial products salesperson in 2007 and 2008. In June 2014, he filed a class action against NSC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   on behalf of himself and all similarly-situated individuals who worked for NSC after June 2008. Vasquez alleged that the compensation paid by NSC fell below the required minimum wage, and he sought wage and overtime compensation for himself and similarly-situated individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The parties agreed to postpone a motion for class certification in order to complete pre-certification discovery. In February 2015, before Vasquez had moved for class certification, NSC made a settlement offer, which Vasquez accepted the following month. NSC thereafter moved to dismiss the complaint. Vasquez cross-moved to provide notice of the proposed dismissal to putative class members pursuant to CPLR 908. NSC opposed the cross motion, asserting that CPLR 908 applies only to certified class actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Supreme Court granted the cross motion to provide notice to putative class members and granted NSC's motion to dismiss the complaint, but directed that the action would not be marked disposed until after notice had been issued (\n   <em>\n    Vasquez v.

Defendants argue that the statute's reference to a \"class action\" means a \"certified class action,\" but the legislature did not use those words, or a phrase such as \"maintained as a class action,\" which appears in CPLR 905 and 909. Plaintiffs assert that an action is a \"class action\" within the meaning of the statute from the moment the complaint containing class allegations is filed, but the statutory text does not make that clear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Similarly, the statute's instruction that notice of a proposed dismissal, discontinuance, or compromise must be provided to \"all members of the class\" is inconclusive. Defendants contend that there are no \"members of the class\" until class certification is granted pursuant to CPLR 902 and the class is defined pursuant to CPLR 903. Yet the legislature did not state that notice should be provided to \"all members of the certified class,\" or \"all members of the class who would be bound\" by the proposed termination, or some other phrase that would have made the legislature's intent clear. In the context of these ambiguities,\n   we turn to other principles of statutory interpretation and sources beyond the statutory text itself to discern the intent of the legislature (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Albany Law School,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3750078\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/19/106/#p120\">\n    19 N.Y.3d at 120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3750078\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/19/106/#p120\">\n    945 N.Y.S.2d 613\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3750078\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/19/106/#p120\">\n    968 N.E.2d 967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Matter of Shannon,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318276\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/345/#p351\">\n    25 N.Y.3d 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 351,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318276\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/345/#p351\">\n    12 N.Y.S.3d 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4318276\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny3d/25/345/#p351\">\n    34 N.E.3d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2015] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   CPLR article 9 was enacted in 1975, replacing former CPLR 1005. The Governor's Approval Memorandum stated that the legislation would \"enable individuals injured by the same pattern of conduct by another to pool their resources and collectively seek relief\" where their individual damages \"may not be sufficient to justify the costs of litigation\" (Governor's Approval\n   Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1975, ch 207, 1975 N.Y. Legis Ann at 426, 1975 McKinney's Session Laws of N.Y. at 1748). With respect to CPLR 908, which the legislature has not amended since it was originally enacted in 1975, the State Consumer Protection Board observed that the purpose of that statute \"is to safeguard the class against a 'quickie' settlement that primarily benefits the named plaintiff or his or her attorney, without substantially aiding the class\" (Mem from State Consumer Protection Board, May 29, 1975 at 7, Bill Jacket, L 1975, ch 207).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The New York State Bar Association's Banking Law, Business Law, and CPLR Committees, which opposed the bill, recommended that CPLR 908 be amended such that its notice provisions would apply only to certified class actions (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Letter from N.Y. State Bar Association Banking Law, Business Law, and CPLR Committees, at 5, Bill Jacket, L 1975, ch 207). Those committees \"agree[d] that any settlement or withdrawal of an action commenced as a class action should be subject to court approval,\" but expressed the view that \"if the dismissal, discontinuance or compromise is effected prior to the determination that a class action is proper, the court should be permitted to dispense with notice to class members\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In addition, CPLR article 9 was \"modeled on similar federal law,\" specifically, Federal Rules of Civil Procedure rule 23 (Governor's Approval Mem, Bill Jacket, L 1975, ch 207;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Siegel,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Prac%20%C2%A7%20139\">\n    N.Y. Prac \u00a7 139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 247 [5th ed 2011] ). At the time, rule 23(e) was virtually indistinguishable from the current text of CPLR 908 ; it provided that \"[a] class action shall not be dismissed or compromised without the approval of the court, and notice of the proposed dismissal or compromise shall be given to all members of the class in such manner as the court directs\" (former Fed Rules Civ Pro rule 23 [e] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The majority of federal circuit courts of appeal to address the issue concluded that the prior version of rule 23(e) also applied in the pre-certification context, but that notice to putative class members before certification was discretionary, after consideration of factors such as potential collusion and the publicity the class action had received (\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Thus, under the current federal rule, mandatory approval and notice of a proposed settlement is now required only for certified classes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   That same year, the New York City Bar Association's Council on Judicial Administration recommended several changes to CPLR article 9, including amendments to CPLR 908. The Council opined that, unlike the updated federal rule, CPLR 908 should continue to require judicial approval of settlement at the pre-certification stage, but that notice to putative class members before certification should be discretionary, not mandatory, and should be provided when necessary to protect members of the putative class (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   New York City Bar Association, Council on Judicial Administration,\n   <em>\n    State Class Actions: Three Proposed Amendments to Article 9 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules,\n   </em>\n   58 Rec of Assn of Bar of City of N.Y. at 316 [2003], available at http://www.nycbar.org/pdf/report/Art9.draft.082703.MWord.pdf [last accessed Dec. 7, 2017] ).

McLaughlin, 1982 Supp Practice Commentaries, McKinney's Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR 908:1 [1976 ed], 2005 Pocket Part at 248-249), the 2003 amendment of the federal rule upon which CPLR 908 was modeled to address this situation, and\n   specific and repeated calls to the legislature to amend the statute, the legislature has not amended CPLR 908, either to state that\n   <em>\n    Avena\n   </em>\n   was not a correct interpretation of its original intent or to express its revised, present intent. Under these circumstances, and in light of the legislative history discussed above, we conclude that the legislature's refusal to amend CPLR 908 in the decades since\n   <em>\n    Avena\n   </em>\n   was decided indicates that the\n   <em>\n    Avena\n   </em>\n   decision correctly ascertained the legislature's intent (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alonzo M.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4409082\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/72/662/#p667\">\n    72 N.Y.2d at 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=536%20N.Y.S.2d%2026\">\n    536 N.Y.S.2d 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=532%20N.E.2d%201254\">\n    532 N.E.2d 1254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Knight-Ridder,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4407282\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/70/151/#p157\">\n    70 N.Y.2d at 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=518%20N.Y.S.2d%20595\">\n    518 N.Y.S.2d 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=511%20N.E.2d%201116\">\n    511 N.E.2d 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Any practical difficulties and policy concerns that may arise from\n   <em>\n    Avena\n   </em>\n   's interpretation of CPLR 908 are best addressed by the legislature (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Knight-Ridder,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4407282\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/70/151/#p157\">\n    70 N.Y.2d at 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=518%20N.Y.S.2d%20595\">\n    518 N.Y.S.2d 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=511%20N.E.2d%201116\">\n    511 N.E.2d 1116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), especially considering that there are also policy reasons in favor of applying CPLR 908 in the pre-certification context, such as ensuring that the settlement between the named plaintiff and the defendant is free from collusion and that absent putative class members will not be prejudiced (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Avena,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5600007\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/85/149/\">\n    85 A.D.2d at 152-155\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=447%20N.Y.S.2d%20278\">\n    447 N.Y.S.2d 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diaz,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10540278\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/876/1401/#p1408\">\n    876 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1409 ;\n   <em>\n    Glidden,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1369187\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/808/621/\">\n    808 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   627 ; Vincent C.

Even a cursory reading of the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Avena\n   </em>\n   reveals that it is not grounded in the unambiguous statutory text. We are not bound by the result in that case or by subsequent legislative inaction, and the passage of time does not alter that conclusion. Instead, it is within the province of this Court of last resort to interpret the statute as a matter of law, guided by our principles of statutory interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In that regard, the requirement in CPLR 908 that notice be provided \"to all members of the class\" is expressly limited to a \"class action.\" In each of the actions here, plaintiffs did not comply with the requirements under article 9 of the CPLR that are necessary to transform the\n   <em>\n    purported\n   </em>\n   class action into an\n   <em>\n    actual\n   </em>\n   class action, with members of a class bound by the disposition\n   of the litigation. Thus, there is no class action here, and no basis under the statutory scheme to mandate CPLR 908 notice to putative members of an undefined class that an individual claim-of which they had received no prior notice and in which they had taken no part-is being settled, but the settlement\n   is not binding on them.

CPLR 902 requires the plaintiff \"in an action brought as a class action\" to \"move for an order to determine whether it is to be so maintained\" within 60 days after expiration of the time in which a defendant must serve responsive pleadings. Thereafter, \"[t]he action may be maintained as a class action only if the court finds that the prerequisites under section 901 have been satisfied\" ( CPLR 902 ). In determining whether the action \"may proceed as a class action,\" the court must consider certain factors, including the interests of the members of the purported class, the impracticability or inefficiency of proceeding separately, any pending litigation, the desirability of concentrating the litigation, and class action management difficulties\n   that may arise (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   CPLR 902[1]-[5] ). If the court allows the action to proceed as a class action, the order \"permitting [the] class action\" must describe the class ( CPLR 903 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   CPLR 907 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Once the prerequisites of sections 901 and 902 have been met, reasonable notice of the commencement of the class action must be given to the certified class \"in such manner as the court directs,\" except in the case of class actions brought primarily for equitable relief, in which case, the court has discretion to determine whether notice is necessary and appropriate (CPL 904 [a], [b];\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   Vincent C. Alexander, Practice Commentaries, McKinney's Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR 904 ). Any judgment in a class action must describe the class, and such a judgment is binding only upon \"those whom the court finds to be members of the class\" ( CPLR 905 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   CPLR 909 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   CPLR 908 -the provision at issue here-prescribes that a \"class action shall not be dismissed, discontinued, or compromised without the approval of the court. Notice of the proposed dismissal, discontinuance, or compromise shall be given to all members of the class in such manner as the court directs.\" The question before us is whether this provision requires notice to putative class members if the action is\n   settled or dismissed\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to class certification. In my view, it does not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   CPLR 908 must be considered in the context of the statutory scheme set forth in the entirety of article 9. Inasmuch as \"[an] action may be maintained as a class action\n   <em>\n    only if\n   </em>\n   the court finds that the prerequisites under section 901 have been satisfied\" upon a motion brought within the specified time period pursuant to CPLR 902 (emphasis added), it follows that a purported class action is not actually \"a class action\" until so adjudicated by the court; concomitantly, prior to class certification, there are no \"members of the class\" to whom notice could be provided. Thus, there is no statutory basis for applying the CPLR 908 notice requirement when, as here, the litigation is resolved during the pre-certification phase without prejudice to the rights of putative class members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   There is nothing talismanic about styling a complaint as a class action. Indeed, any plaintiff may merely allege that a claim is being brought \"on behalf of all others similarly situated.\" However, under article 9 of the CPLR, the court, not a would-be class representative, has the power to determine whether an action \"brought as a class action\" may be maintained as such, and may do so only upon a showing that the\n   prerequisites set forth in CPLR 901 have been satisfied ( CPLR 902 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Logically, the converse of that proposition must also be true-i.e., if the court has not made an affirmative finding that the CPLR 901 prerequisites have been met, the action may not be maintained as a class action. Here, the fact that plaintiffs did not comply with CPLR 902 and did not obtain orders adjudicating their actions as class actions is fatal to their argument that notice of their settlements to purported class members is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   This Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    O'Hara v.

Instead, they accepted settlement offers, allowed the deadline for certification to pass, and declined to oppose defendants' motions to dismiss, but nonetheless subsequently asked the court to direct notice to putative class members under CPLR 908. As in\n   <em>\n    O'Hara,\n   </em>\n   by virtue of plaintiffs' failure to comply with CPLR article 9-and particularly CPLR 902 -there is no basis to impose the notice requirements of CPLR 908, which only apply to class actions, not purported class actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Directing such notice under these circumstances would lack practical significance. Indeed, the notice would essentially inform putative class members that an individual claim-of which they received no prior notice-was being resolved by an agreement that was not binding on them. Moreover, as defendants point out, because no class had been certified under CPLR 902, it is unclear to whom notice was purportedly required.

Further, noting that the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Avena\n   </em>\n   did not dispute the applicability of CPLR 908, the First Department broadly stated, without citation, that \"[t]he fiduciary obligations of the named plaintiffs\n   <em>\n    in instituting\n   </em>\n   ...\n   <em>\n    [a class] action\n   </em>\n   are generally recognized and not disputed\" (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5600007\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/85/149/\">\n    85 A.D.2d at 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=447%20N.Y.S.2d%20278\">\n    447 N.Y.S.2d 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [emphasis added] ).

To the contrary, the case has been followed by only a handful of lower courts (\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Astill v. Kumquat Properties, LLC,\n   </em>\n   2013 N.Y.

Moreover, as Supreme Court observed here, the \"wisdom\" of the rule announced in\n   <em>\n    Avena\n   </em>\n   \"has been questioned by many, including the CPLR commentary.\" Thus, the existence of\n   <em>\n    Avena\n   </em>\n   is no bar to this Court adopting a more reasoned approach based on the express language of CPLR 908.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, to the extent the majority relies on certain federal cases construing the pre-2003 version of Rule 23(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, each of those cases held that notice to putative class members prior to certification was\n   <em>\n    discretionary,\n   </em>\n   based on various considerations not included in the rule itself (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Diaz v.

The phrase \"class action\" is repeatedly used throughout article 9 in instances, like CPLR 908, where it is readily apparent that the intent of the legislature is to refer to an actual \"class action,\" not merely a purported class action (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    CPLR 903 [\"(t)he order permitting a class action shall describe the class\"], 904 [certification notice requirement referring to \"class actions\"], 907 [permitting certain court orders in the \"conduct of class actions\"] ).

While, in some cases, it may be easy to identify the putative class members, in others, it may be difficult and time-consuming, as well as expensive, to identify and provide notice to them.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-72\">\n    Any claimed virtue of plaintiffs' position that notice is required to protect putative class members is a distraction. If plaintiffs desired to obtain relief on behalf of the putative class members, they could have followed the proper procedure to certify the class. Instead, they settled their individual claims. Moreover, while it could reasonably be argued that mandating notice here amounts to no more than solicitation on behalf of plaintiffs' counsel, it is worth noting that directing notice prior to certification could, under some circumstances, actually inure to the detriment of a plaintiff's attorney. For example, a plaintiff's attorney could quickly conclude that a putative class action has little merit, and would not wish to bear the cost of notifying putative class members in a class that could not, for instance, be certified due to lack of typicality or predominance. Therefore, knowing that the majority's rule may impose the costs of notice even if no class is ever certified (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    CPLR 904[d] [presumptively placing the costs of notice on the plaintiff] ), members of the plaintiffs' bar may be less likely to commence some class actions in the first place. Relatedly, the majority's rule may also discourage settlement. If a plaintiff's attorney determines that there are deficiencies with either the named plaintiff's claim or the class claim, or both, the attorney would have an incentive to litigate and lose the class certification motion rather than to stipulate to a dismissal, because the stipulation of dismissal would require notice, whereas (presumably, although the majority is unclear about this), no notice would be required in the event that the court denied class certification.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    To the extent the\n    <em>\n     Avena\n    </em>\n    court expressed concern about the prospect of disingenuous plaintiffs using a frivolous class action claim as leverage in settlement negotiations, it bears noting that there are other mechanisms in place to prevent such abuse, including, of course, early certification (as required under article 9 of the CPLR) and sanctions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Similarly, the memorandum of the consumer protection board and the bar association letter cited by the majority lack persuasive force (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    majority op. at 495, 68 N.Y.S.3d at 395, 90 N.E.3d at 1266). To the extent the memorandum indicates that the purpose of CPLR 908 is to safeguard against a settlement benefitting only the named plaintiff or plaintiff's counsel to the detriment of the class (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Mem from State Consumer Protection Board, May 29, 1975 at 7, Bill Jacket, L 1975, ch 207), this concern is implicated only when the disposition would bind the class, i.e., after certification. For its part, the bar association advanced its interpretation of CPLR 908 within the context of its advocacy for a discretionary notice regime (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Letter from N.Y. State Bar Association Banking Law, Business Law, and CPLR Committees, at 5, Bill Jacket, L 1975, ch 207) [\"the court should be permitted to dispense with notice to class members\"] ). The legislature clearly rejected that approach.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
