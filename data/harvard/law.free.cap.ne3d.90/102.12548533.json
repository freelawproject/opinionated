Beachwood Pointe Care Center, (\"the Nursing Home\") appeals from the trial court's rulings on various motions concerning punitive damages, attorney fees, litigation expenses, and survivorship and wrongful death claims in this nursing home negligence case brought by Daniel Lang (\"Plaintiff\"), as the representative of Mary Stevens's (\"Mary\") estate. Plaintiff assigns the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   I. The trial court erred when it denied Beachwood Pointe's motions for directed verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on Lang's claim for punitive damages because there was insufficient evidence to support the essential elements of this claim, which, in turn, warrants vacating the award for attorney fees and any award of expenses that may be tied to the award of punitive damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   II. Alternatively, the trial court erred when it denied Beachwood Pointe's motion for a new trial on punitive damages because of errors of law in admitting evidence of insurance and gross revenue during this phase of trial, among other errors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   III. Alternatively, the trial court erred when it denied Beachwood Pointe's motion to enforce R.C. 2315.21.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   IV. Alternatively, the trial court erred when it granted Lang's motion for litigation expenses where those expenses were not part of the jury's award, nor are most costs under Civ.R. 54(D).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   V. Additionally, the trial court erred when it denied Beachwood Pointe's motion for new trial on the survivorship and wrongful-death claims because of errors of law in admitting evidence of federal regulations for Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement and the records of other residents, and in instructing the jury to disregard evidence of medical bills paid.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Having reviewed the record and pertinent law, we vacate the punitive damages, attorney fees, and litigation expenses awards and remand for a computation of costs under Civ.R. 54(D). The apposite facts follow.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Facts and Procedural History\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On March 1, 2012, Mary and her husband Jacob Stevens (\"Jacob\") became\n   residents of the Nursing Home. Mary had diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, and arthritis, was incontinent and in the end stages of renal disease, and had previously suffered a stroke and a heart attack. She was confined to a wheelchair, which she could not operate by herself. Mary also had cognitive impairment and dementia, and she required assistance in all of her daily living activities. As a result of these health issues, Mary had an increased risk for \"skin breakdown\" including pressure ulcers, which are more commonly known as bedsores. As part of Mary's treatment plan, the Nursing Home staff was to turn or reposition her every two hours and provide incontinence care. Also as part of her care, the Nursing Home sent Mary to an offsite kidney dialysis center three times a week, for three-to-five-hour dialysis treatments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On March 24, 2012, at approximately 5:15 p.m., Jacob, who was able to operate his motorized wheelchair, \"towed\" Mary, who was sitting in her manual wheelchair, by having her hold onto a belt that he threw over his shoulder. This was not the first time that the towing occurred, and Mary's nurse, Enid Harper (\"Harper\"), told Jacob to stop towing Mary. Jacob stopped at first, but subsequently resumed towing Mary, and as they were entering the dining room, Mary's wheelchair got caught in the doorway. Mary fell out of her chair onto the floor. The Nursing Home staff assessed Mary, who at the time, reported that she had no pain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The next day, March 25, 2012, Mary reported being in pain. The Nursing Home ordered x-rays, which came back negative. On March 26, 2012, Mary again complained of pain at her dialysis treatment. Mary was sent to the hospital, and this time, the x-rays revealed a nondisplaced hip fracture. The hospital records also noted that Mary had bedsores on her feet. On March 27, 2012, Mary returned to the Nursing Home, where her care plan continued to include turning, repositioning, incontinence care, and off-site dialysis. The Nursing Home had no documentation of bedsores or pressure ulcers at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On April 21, 2012, the Nursing Home staff noticed a bedsore on Mary's buttocks. This sore was documented and treated, a care plan was put in place, and Mary's doctor and family were notified. By April 26, 2012, the Nursing Home staff noticed another sore on Mary's buttocks. Additional treatment was ordered, however, Mary's condition continued to worsen, and several other pressure ulcers developed. On May 4, 2012, Mary was admitted to the hospital from the dialysis center with gastrointestinal bleeding and an infected pressure ulcer. On May 27, 2012, Mary passed away. The cause of death was listed as \"Infected Decubitus Ulcer\" due to \"Chronic Kidney Disease\" and \"Hypertension.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On March 22, 2013, Plaintiff filed a complaint against the Nursing Home on Mary's behalf claiming negligence, survivorship, and wrongful death. Plaintiff also claimed that the Nursing Home's \"conduct * * * constituted actual malice.\" The case went to trial, and on November 3, 2015, the jury found in favor of Plaintiff and awarded $440,000 in compensatory damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The case then proceeded to the punitive damages phase. Plaintiff presented one witness-Brian Colleran (\"Colleran\"), who owned the Nursing Home when Mary resided there. Colleran testified that he was not aware of Mary's stay at the Nursing Home or anything that \"happened\" to her there. Colleran's testimony was limited to how many nursing homes he owned and the fact that they were all self-insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The Nursing Home moved for a directed verdict arguing that there was insufficient evidence as a matter of law regarding the malice element required for punitive damages. The court denied this motion, and the jury awarded Plaintiff $560,000 in punitive damages. Additionally, the court awarded Plaintiff $400,000 in attorney fees and $31,010.64 in litigation expenses. The Nursing Home filed motions for a new trial, judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and a reduction of punitive damages. On March 10, 2016, the court denied the Nursing Home's motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 10} It is from these rulings that the Nursing Home appeals. Plaintiff's first four assigned errors address punitive damages, attorney fees, and litigation expenses under alternate theories of law and will be reviewed together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Directed Verdict and Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 11} A motion for a directed verdict \"tests the legal sufficiency of the evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    McKenney v.

It was unsafe, and if he wanted her to go somewhere, to ask.\" Jackson further testified that if Mary \"said it was dinnertime\" and the Nursing Home staff \"didn't come right in and get her, [Jacob] would just try to get her down there * * * instead of waiting and letting somebody take her.\" Jackson also testified that she reported these incidents to the nurse and that she heard other staff tell Jacob that \"it was not safe to pull his wife in a wheelchair.\" Asked if Jackson ever felt like she was \"doing anything that was inconsistent with [Mary's] dignity,\" she answered, \"No.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 20} As to the pressure ulcers, Jackson testified that the staff are taught that if a resident has \"an open sore,\" they are \"to be particularly careful\" if the resident is incontinent because of the potential for infection. \"[Y]ou can't be * * * sure when they had a bowel movement but you should be checking them every hour or so to see if they have been to the bathroom.\" If the resident needed care, she would \"clean them up, apply any kind of ointment, barrier cream to their bottom. Rediaper them, and reposition them if they are unable to move by their self, and raise their head, elevate their feet a little bit.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Jackson testified that she followed this procedure when caring for Mary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Jackson also testified that it was not her practice to document every episode of incontinence or every time she turned or repositioned a resident. Rather, it was something she did everyday and, after being an STNA for 25 years, \"[i]t comes naturally [and] automatically.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Cindy Marion, an LPN at the Nursing Home, witnessed the March 24, 2012 wheelchair incident. Marion, who was not Mary's assigned nurse, was passing out medication near the dining room when the following occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   I saw [Jacob] coming in his electric wheelchair, and then he went into the dining room door. And behind him was [Mary], and she was in a manual wheelchair, and her wheelchair-the side of her wheelchair caught on the doorway, the door frame. And she was holding onto-he had-I didn't notice at the time because it happened so fast, but he had a belt flung across his right shoulder, and she was holding onto the belt behind him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   So when her wheelchair hit the frame of the door, she was holding onto the belt, and he kept going and she didn't let go, so she ended up on the floor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   If it hadn't happened so fast, you know, I probably would have went over to try to stop him from pulling her * * *. I mean, it was just a matter of seconds, and he was through the door.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 23} According to Marion, she assessed Mary first, because procedure dictated that the staff not move a resident who may be injured. After determining that Mary could move her arms and legs, Marion called for Mary's nurse, Enid Harper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Harper testified that she was an LPN at the Nursing Home from 1994 to 2013, and she was Mary's nurse during Mary's stay at the Nursing Home. Harper testified that she saw Jacob towing Mary on the evening in question as they were headed toward the dining room. Harper approached them and told Jacob to stop, because she did not think it was safe. Jacob stopped towing Mary. Harper heard one of the aides say that this towing had happened before. Harper asked Jacob if the staff could take Mary to the dining room. Jacob replied, \"I'll do it.\" Harper asked if she could take Jacob's belt. Jacob said, \"No. How else am I going to do it\"?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Harper testified that she may have told a staff member to take Mary into the dining room, although she was unsure if she made this request. Harper then left the area to attend to another patient and did not see Mary fall from her wheelchair moments later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 26} When Harper was alerted to what happened, she went to the dining room doorway and learned that Mary was not in pain. Harper helped Mary back into her wheelchair, documented the fall, left a message with Mary's doctor's answering service, and notified Mary's daughter about the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Ebonie Davis, an LPN who worked at the Nursing Home as the wound and infection patrol nurse, testified regarding Mary's bedsores. On April 21, 2012, Davis first documented a single wound on Mary's coccyx area that reached to her left and right buttocks. Davis testified that she treated this bedsore, as evidenced in Mary's Treatment Administration Records (\"TAR\"), on April 23, 24, 25, and 26, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Davis additionally noted a \"new area of skin breakdown on April 26, 2012.\" Both bedsores were Stage IV wounds, which \"means muscle, tendon or bone is\n   exposed.\" At this time, Davis noted \"no signs of infection.\" Davis ordered Mary an alternating air mattress to relieve the pressure. Davis also noted that repositioning Mary had become more difficult since her hip fracture, because she complained of pain when lying on her left side.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Davis called Mary's dialysis center and requested that they use Mary's wheelchair cushion in the dialysis chair because of her sores. According to Davis, Mary sat in a \"hard chair\" at the dialysis center for three to five hours, three times a week. Davis called Mary's daughter to \"touch base with her and let her know what [Davis] and the nurses at the dialysis center talked about.\" Davis also notified Mary's doctors of the status of her sores.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Davis testified that she also treated Mary's bedsores on April 27, 2012, when Davis and the nurse practitioner changed Mary's treatment plan; however, this TAR was not written until April 28, 2012. Davis testified that Mary's incontinence increased the risk of developing pressure wounds and decreased the rate at which they healed, particularly if she was not changed and cleaned. Davis also testified that \"turning and repositioning is a standard of care. It's a practice,\" and is not something that the Nursing Home staff document on a TAR. Davis stated, \"I can't say I ever have seen documentation of anybody being turned and repositioned.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 31} In addition to the Nursing Home staff, Plaintiff called two medical expert witnesses to testify about Mary's case. During the liability phase of the trial, both experts testified that the standard of care in nursing homes, pertinent to the case at hand, is to provide residents with a safe environment and adequate supervision to prevent accidents. Additionally, nursing homes should ensure that a resident who entered the facility without pressure sores did not develop pressure sores unless the individual's clinical condition demonstrated that they were unavoidable. If pressure sores are present, the nursing home's duty is to provide necessary treatment and services to promote healing, prevent infection, and prevent new sores from developing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 32} Catherine Sinclair, who is a nurse practitioner, was the first expert witness to testify for Plaintiff. Sinclair concluded that, in her opinion, the Nursing Home fell below the standard of care in treating and caring for Mary. Sinclair looked at two main events-Mary's fall and her subsequent pressure ulcers. According to Sinclair, the Nursing Home was negligent by not taking \"the next step forward, which would be to go over to try to intervene\" when the staff saw Jacob towing Mary. Additionally, Sinclair opined that, other than reminding Jacob not to tow Mary, the Nursing Home was negligent by not changing Mary's care plan after the fall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Sinclair further testified that, as long as nursing home residents are \"cognitively intact,\" they \"must be permitted to exercise their rights free from interference or coercion from the nursing home.\" Sinclair agreed that not all falls or accidents are preventable and that there is \"not a one-on-one care in a nursing home.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Sinclair also testified that the Nursing Home was negligent regarding Mary's sores. Sinclair noted that there was no documentation of turning or repositioning Mary, which, in her opinion, fell below the standard of care. According to Sinclair, as the pressure ulcers developed, Mary needed to be repositioned more than every two hours. Additionally, there was no written documentation of Mary's wounddressings being changed on April 27, 2012. By April 30, 2012, Mary had developed multiple ulcers on her feet, and Sinclair's opinion was that the Nursing Home was negligent in not ordering special boots before\n   this happened, rather than after the sores were noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Based on the specific conduct detailed above, Sinclair concluded that the Nursing Home was negligent because it did not do enough to care for and treat Mary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 36} As to malice, the only testimony Sinclair provided is as follows: Asked if \"the conduct of these defendants in this case demonstrate[d] a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of others, including Mary Stevens,\" Sinclair answered, \"Yes.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Sinclair also provided an expert report, the last paragraph of which states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   [Plaintiff's counsel] specifically asked me if the conduct of the defendants in this case demonstrated a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of other persons including Mary Stevens that had a great probability of causing substantial harm. In my opinion the conduct of the defendants in this case did demonstrate a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of other persons including Mary Stevens that had a great probability of causing substantial harm and as a result substantial harm occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 38} Dr. Tim Klein, who is a doctor of internal medicine at a nursing home, also testified as an expert witness for Plaintiff. Similar to Sinclair, Dr. Klein testified in detail about his opinion that the Nursing Home was negligent in treating and caring for Mary. However, also similar to Sinclair, Dr. Klein's testimony about malice was limited to his conclusion. In Dr. Klein's expert report, his opinion on malice is covered in one conclusory sentence: \"The monitoring and care provided at Beachwood Pointe Care Center demonstrated a course of conduct and/or systemic problems which evidenced willful and wanton disregard for the health and safety of Ms. Stevens.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Asked to explain what he meant by that to the jury, Dr. Klein testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Willful and wanton is a term that frequently is used legally, but in my experience, I also use that because if something is willful and wanton, essentially there is a conscious disregard, a reckless disregard of safety of others. And there's either knowledge that something bad can happen, and you just disregard that possibility. And it's conscious. You know that that's not safe, but you don't do anything about it. And, to me, it's just basically an utter indifference. It's a conscious disregard of safety. So that's what I meant by that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Neither Sinclair nor Dr. Klein identified an act or omission by the Nursing Home that rose to the level of conscious disregard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Legal Analysis\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 41} \"An expert may not offer an opinion which embraces the 'ultimate issue' if that opinion is essentially a bare conclusion significantly lacking in supporting rationale.\"\n   <em>\n    Gannett v.

In other words, nobody testified that they disregarded the towing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   {\u00b6 57} At oral argument, plaintiff's counsel stated that \"seven or eight\" Nursing Home employees watched the incident, pointing their fingers at Mary and Jacob but doing nothing to prevent the towing. This is not what was testified to at trial. The only person to testify that she saw the fall was Marion, who stated that it happened so fast there was nothing she could have done about it. Harper testified that she saw Jacob tow Mary before the incident and agreed that there were other staff in the hallway when she approached the couple and told them to stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   {\u00b6 58} Additionally, plaintiff failed to present substantial, competent, and credible evidence of a great probability of harm.

Once again, this is simply\n   unsupported by the record. The Nursing Home staff members who cared for Mary testified that they turned and repositioned her as required, but that they were not in the practice of documenting this.

There is evidence in the instant case showing that the Nursing Home fell below the standard in caring for and treating Mary. However, this is not a case where the defendant intentionally acted, or failed to act, knowing that substantial harm will probably occur. There is no evidence of hatred, ill-will, or a spirit of revenge. There is no evidence that the Nursing Home was understaffed or deliberately apathetic about Mary's care. There is no evidence that the Nursing Home treated patients in a way to maximize profitability or minimize expenses.

Therefore, after construing the evidence in favor of plaintiff, as we must, we find that plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence of malice, which is a requirement in a punitive damages claim.

In addition, the court instructed the jury as follows: \"there will be some bills submitted to you that have scratch offs on them, and indications of payments.

In fact, it was so common place that the Nursing Home employees had a name for it-\"towing.\" Right before the incident occurred, Harper (Mary and Jacob's nurse) testified that she shouted out to Jacob that \"towing\" was not safe. However, Harper did not intervene and stop the \"towing,\" nor did the other employees who were in the hallway as Jacob and Mary passed by them. Nursing Home employees testified that Jacob has \"towed\" Mary before and this conduct was not safe, yet they continued to allow it to happen. The Nursing Home demonstrated that it tolerated this unsafe behavior by not preventing Jacob from repeatedly \"towing\" Mary. The Nursing Home did not have an employee accompany Jacob and Mary to the dining hall, and there was no reprimand to employees after this incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   {\u00b6 92} For these reasons, I would find that the trial court properly allowed the punitive damages claim to go to the jury.
