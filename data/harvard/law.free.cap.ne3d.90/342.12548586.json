For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In February 2015, Harris was named in a seven-count indictment charging him with aggravated murder (Count 1), murder (Count 2), two counts of felonious assault (Counts 3 and 4), discharge of a firearm on or near prohibited premises (Count 5), and two counts of a having weapon while under disability (Counts 6 and 7). Counts 1 through 5 contained one- and three-year firearm specifications, and Counts 3 through 5 contained repeat violent offender specifications and notices of prior conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Prior to the start of trial, the state dismissed Count 7, and Harris executed a jury waiver on Count 6 and the repeat violent offender specifications and notices of prior conviction attendant to Counts 3 through 5. All other counts were tried before a jury, who heard the following evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In the early afternoon of August 17, 2014, Tyler Spaulding was riding the bus home after work. Seated in front of him were three males and a female who, according to Tyler, were talking about robbing him. Fearing for his safety, he called his sister Mary, told her what he had overheard, and asked her to have his brother meet him at the bus stop. Mary testified that she called their brother Isaac Spaulding to meet Tyler.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Tyler testified that two of the males-the one with the tattoo under his eye and wearing blue jeans, and the other darker-skinned male with a backpack-got off the bus near East 123rd Street. The other male and the female stayed on the bus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} When Tyler got off the bus on Lakeview Road near Save-A-Lot, his brother Isaac and his cousin's girlfriend, Chastity Spencer, were waiting for him. Tyler told them what had happened on the bus. As they were walking away, Tyler and Isaac's brother Harry Spaulding, and friend James Parker, Jr., approached. Although Tyler told them what had happened, he indicated that it was over and to leave it alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Meanwhile, over on Osceola Avenue, Martinez Hunter was sitting on a porch when he received a call from his sister Mary that someone was trying to rob Tyler. After leaving the residence, he saw three males-one who he knew from the neighborhood as the \"CD dude.\" Martinez testified that the CD dude sells CDs and movies outside USA Food Mart. Because Martinez had worked at USA Food Mart, he had seen the CD dude numerous times. According to Martinez, the CD dude was wearing gray jogging pants with no shirt and carrying a book bag on his back. He also testified that the CD dude has a tattoo on his face. Martinez identified Harris in court as the \"CD dude.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} According to Martinez, one of the other males with Harris was shorter in height with darker skin and dreadlocks; Martinez could not remember much about the third male, except that he was short.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Martinez testified that when Harris and the other two men walked by him, Harris said \"what's up?\" and Martinez, not knowing that the males had been on the bus with his brother Tyler, responded the same. The males continued walking, not knowing that they were about to cross paths with Tyler's group, who were walking toward East 123rd Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} When Tyler saw two of the males from the bus, he pointed them out, and Parker started yelling at them that he wanted to talk to them; when the males did not stop, Parker questioned if they wanted to fight. The males started walking faster, and Tyler and his group of four followed. Within moments, Tyler's group of four grew to five when their friend, Marcus Burton, joined the pursuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Soon thereafter, Martinez saw Tyler, Marcus, Isaac, Harry, Chastity, and Parker. He could hear Tyler yelling out to him to \"stop them,\" pointing to the group of males and stating that they were the ones who tried to rob him. Martinez then witnessed a transaction between Harris and his friends involving a book bag-Martinez initially testified that he saw Harris retrieve a gun from the bag, but then later said the male with the dreadlocks pulled the gun from the bag. Nevertheless, Harris took possession of the gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} After the transaction, Harris and the other two males started running, and Marcus and Parker chased after them. Martinez also followed as they all ran toward the corner of Phillips Avenue and East 123rd Street by Satellite Cleaners. During the chase, Martinez saw Harris pull the gun off his hip. Martinez testified that the gun was a .38 that he had seen before when Harris was trying to sell it at USA Food Mart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} According to Martinez, when Harris pulled the gun, he told Marcus and Parker that Harris had a \"little ass gun.\" Parker was now in between Martinez and Harris, as he cut across Satellite Cleaners' parking lot and ran to the middle of Phillips Avenue. Harris was on the sidewalk about three or four houses down on Phillips Avenue when he started shooting in the direction of Martinez and Parker. Martinez testified that he heard a bullet go whistling by his ear. According to Martinez, the second gunshot hit Parker's hand, causing Parker to yell out that \"It hit my hand.\" Parker then retreated and took cover behind a tree. However, Harris kept firing while approaching Parker, this time hitting Parker in the arm area. Martinez testified that Harris was approximately three or four feet from Parker and fired the gun again, hitting Parker in the chest, causing Parker to spin around and ultimately collapse in Satellite Cleaners' parking lot. Parker was subsequently pronounced dead at MetroHealth Medical Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Dr. Joseph Andrew Felo, deputy medical examiner who performed Parker's autopsy, testified about the gunshot wounds to Parker's body. According to Dr. Felo, one wound was consistent with the gun pointed at an angle in a downward direction, and another wound was consistent with the gun being fired straight on. The exit wound of one of the gunshots was consistent with Parker's back up against something, like a tree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} A grainy surveillance video was played during Martinez's testimony that showed Parker and his group following another group of individuals across the parking lot of Satellite Cleaners. Martinez described to the jury his location in relation to Parker and the shooter. The jury could see a sudden retreat by the larger group, Parker retreating, and then collapsing in the parking lot. Detective Thomas Lynch also testified about the video, stating that after the first shot and everyone\n   scatters, about 10 to 15 seconds pass and the shooter approaches Parker, who is hiding behind a tree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} According to Martinez, he was \"right there\" next to Parker and witnessed the entire event. Detective Lynch testified that based on Martinez's statement and the surveillance video, Martinez was in the best position to witness the shooting. In fact, Detective James Raynard recovered a .38 caliber casing in front of the third house down on Phillips Avenue-the exact area where Martinez testified that he witnessed Harris firing the gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Sharon Collins, who lived four houses down from East 123rd Street on Phillips Avenue, testified that she was sitting in her living room when her attention was directed out her front window because she heard shouting. When she looked out her window, she saw a black male wearing gray jogging pants pointing a gun toward the corner of Phillips Avenue and East 123rd Street. She testified that she heard two to four gunshots. She could not recall any more identifying details about the shooter, except that the gun was not a revolver, and she could not identify the shooter at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 18} When the police arrived, Martinez was interviewed on scene by Detective Lynch. He told the officers that the shooter had a teardrop tattoo under his right eye, and pointed to his own left eye-the jury saw that Harris has a teardrop tattoo under his left eye. Detective Lynch testified that on the day of the shooting, Martinez described the shooter as a black male with a teardrop tattoo, wearing gray jogging pants with no shirt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Subsequently, Martinez was shown two photo arrays and asked to identify the CD dude-the man who shot Parker. In the first photo array, the photos were generated based on information of a possible suspect, and the second photo array was generated based on Harris's description. In the first photo array, Martinez identified another male and indicated that he was only 50 percent certain that he knew this individual. Martinez identified Harris in the second photo array. At trial, Martinez testified that the shooter wore gray jogging pants, and he was one hundred percent certain that Harris shot Parker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 20} The state also provided testimony from the five other members of Parker's group who witnessed various parts of the altercation from different vantage points. Each witness provided differing details regarding the identity of the shooter, who was carrying the backpack, and who handed the gun to the shooter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Like Martinez, Isaac knew Harris as the CD man, and stated that Harris shot Parker. Isaac testified that when Parker was trying to \"get to the guys,\" the three guys stopped and did a \"transaction\" with a book bag. Isaac described the males to the jury along with the roles they played in the transaction-the male with the dreadlocks passed the book bag to the man he knew as the CD guy with the tattoo on his face. According to Isaac, the third guy was of average height and wearing a ball cap. Isaac identified Harris as the CD guy, who he saw pull a gun from inside the book bag and subsequently shoot Parker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 22} However, Isaac was cross-examined with the formal written statement he provided to the police shortly after the murder. His statement provided that he did not know any of the males. Isaac testified that his statement was not true. Additionally, in his statement, he described the males to the police: (1) 15-18 years old, tall, slim to medium build, braided black hair, with a tattoo on the right side of his face, wearing camouflage pants and an\n   orange shirt carrying a backpack; (2) 18-year-old male, caramel skin color, wearing burgundy pants and a white and black shirt, and a ball cap; (3) under 20 years old, black male, average build wearing a blue shirt and black jean shorts. Additionally, the jury heard that Isaac told the police that he did not see any of the males with a weapon. Again, Isaac told the jury that his statement was not true.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 23} While Martinez and Isaac unequivocally identified Harris as the shooter, Marcus Burton and Harry Spaulding testified that Harris was not the shooter, but gave the shooter the gun from the backpack. Marcus testified he recognized one of the males-who had a tattoo and sold CDs at the USA Food Mart-from the neighborhood. Marcus identified Harris in the courtroom as the man he recognized. However, Marcus testified that Harris was not the shooter; rather, Harris took the gun out of the backpack that the darker-skinned male was wearing and handed it to the darker-skinned male.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Harry, Parker's best friend, testified that he only recognized one of the males-the one known as the \"CD guy,\" who was identified as Harris. Harry described another male as light-skinned with tight braids, and the third as a darker-skinned, heavy-set male with a \"little [A]fro\" hairstyle. Harry told the jury that Parker kept arguing with the group of males. During that time, he saw Harris take the backpack off his back and put it in front of him and then pass something to the darker-skinned male wearing a striped shirt. According to Harry, once Harris passed the backpack to the dark-skinned male, Harris and the other male ran away. However, when the scene escalated between Parker and the darker-skinned male, the male started shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Chastity testified that the male with the book bag handed something from his pocket to the male with the dreadlocks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Tyler's identification was made solely on the presence of the teardrop tattoo on Harris's face. He testified that he saw the \"tattoo guy\" pull a gun out from the other male's book bag. He identified Harris in court as the shooter-as \"the black guy with the teardrop tattoo.\" He made this in-court identification even though he had not identified Harris in the two photo arrays he viewed shortly after the murder. On one of the photo arrays, the officer wrote next to the photo that Tyler said: \"The teardrop. I'll never forget the teardrop. He's the shooter.\" Tyler admitted he picked those individuals because they each had a teardrop tattoo on their face. Additionally, Tyler admitted that he and his brothers discussed that the male with the teardrop tattoo was the shooter prior to talking with detectives on a later date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Detective Lynch testified that after the shooting, he received a telephone call from Parker's mother with information about the shooter and the name \"Byron.\" Based on the descriptions, photo array identifications, the surveillance video, and the information he received from Martinez and Parker's mother, Detective Lynch obtained a warrant for Harris's arrest. Harris was subsequently arrested in September 2014 in Texas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The jury found Harris guilty of all counts it considered, including the one-and three-year firearm specifications, and the trial court found him guilty of all counts and specifications tried to the bench. Harris was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 29 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Harris now appeals, raising five assignments of error, which will be addressed out of order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Sufficiency of the Evidence-Aggravated Murder\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Harris argues in his second assignment of error that insufficient evidence was presented to support his conviction for aggravated murder. Specifically, he contends that the state failed to present sufficient evidence that the shooter acted with prior calculation and design.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 31} A Crim.R. 29 motion challenges the sufficiency of the evidence. The test for sufficiency requires a determination of whether the prosecution met its burden of production at trial.\n   <em>\n    State v. Bowden\n   </em>\n   , 8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 92266,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009-Ohio-3598\">\n    2009-Ohio-3598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%202186608\">\n    2009 WL 2186608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12.

It stated in its syllabus, \"the elements of purpose and prior calculation and design are distinct, and the state must prove both to support a conviction of aggravated murder under R.C. 2903.01.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=574%20N.E.2d%20492\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at syllabus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 33} The Supreme Court reiterated that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [ R.C. 2903.01(A) employs] the phrase, \"prior calculation and design,\" to indicate an act of studied care in planning or analyzing the means of the crime, as well as a scheme compassing the death of the victim.

It concluded that witnesses provided testimony to the jury of speculation as to what had happened, but the videos show an assault that quickly escalated into chaos. For approximately 20 seconds of that chaos, Walker was obscured from the security cameras by a pillar. The court reasoned that a jury could reasonably infer that during that time, Walker decided to kill the victim by shooting him, but it could not reasonably infer that he planned the murder beforehand with prior calculation and design, because \"[t]he element of prior calculation and design requires evidence that supports more than the inference of purpose, [and] inferring prior calculation and design from an inference of purpose is mere speculation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Therefore, the existence of prior calculation and design is determined on a case-by-case basis analysis of the facts and evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although there is no bright-line test for determining prior calculation and design, the Ohio Supreme Court has found that several factors, including whether the accused and the victim knew each other, whether there was thought or preparation in choosing the murder weapon or murder site, and whether the act was \"drawn out\" or \"an almost instantaneous eruption of events\" should be weighed with the totality of the circumstances surrounding the murder to determine whether there was prior calculation and design.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 20, quoting\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   at 19,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=676%20N.E.2d%2082\">\n    676 N.E.2d 82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , quoting\n   <em>\n    State v.

After considering\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   , the cases cited above, the\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   factors, and the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we find that sufficient evidence was presented that Harris was the actual shooter and that he acted purposefully and with prior calculation and design.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 42} After shooting at Parker and Martinez once to ward off the chase that began a block over, Harris did not leave the scene. Instead, Harris made the calculated decision to come after Parker and continue shooting. Martinez testified that he heard four gun shots-the first one was the bullet that went whistling past his ear. He then saw Harris standing next to a fire hydrant, shooting in Parker's direction that hit Parker's hand, causing him to shout that he had been struck by the bullet. According to Martinez, Parker ran behind the a tree for protection; however, Harris shot at Parker again, hitting him in the arm area. Martinez testified that Harris kept \"coming up\" on Parker and then shot him again in the chest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Martinez's testimony is consistent with Dr. Felo's testimony that Parker suffered from three gunshot wounds -one to the hand, and two to the chest area. According to Dr. Felo, the exit wound of one of the gunshots was consistent with Parker's back being up against something, like a tree. According to Dr. Felo, this gunshot wound, which pierced Parker's lung causing it to collapse, would not have been immediately fatal and with medical attention, Parker could have survived. The second analyzed gunshot wound was more severe. The bullet pierced through Parker's lungs, heart, diaphragm, and liver. The bullet was recovered from Parker's body. According to Dr. Felo, this gunshot wound was fatal, but Parker would have been able to walk a distance before going into shock and collapsing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 44} Applying the\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   factors to this case, there was no testimony that Parker knew Harris or any of the men he was with prior to the day of the murder. However, the testimony revealed that a few of the witnesses, who also lived in the area, knew Harris as the \"CD man.\" Therefore, it is possible that Parker also knew Harris as the \"CD man\"; however, there was no evidence that Parker and Harris had a strained relationship before the day of the murder. Nevertheless, the events of this particular day unfolded to where any prior relationship or acquaintance status could have become strained due to Parker continuing to follow, taunt, and ultimately chase Harris and his acquaintances. Each of Parker's friends testified that Parker led the charge to follow Harris's group to \"talk\" to them about what happened on the bus with Tyler. In fact, Tyler testified that Parker was cussing at the group asking if they wanted to \"fight.\" During this time, Harris and his friends retrieved a gun from a backpack that one of them was wearing, and Harris placed the gun in his waistband. The jury could have reasonably inferred that the purpose behind retrieving the gun was to use or brandish it, thus choosing the murder\n   weapon. Accordingly, it also could reasonably be inferred that if any relationship existed, it became strained during the course of the altercation to the point that thought went into retrieving a gun from a concealed location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Additionally, a reasonable juror could have concluded that the shooting was not an instantaneous eruption of events. Parker's group followed Harris's group from at least Osceola Avenue to East 123rd Street and ultimately to Phillips Avenue, where the murder occurred. At some point, a gun was retrieved from a backpack, thus calculating its potential use. When the shooting actually occurred, Harris fired the weapon approximately four times, each time coming closer to Parker despite Parker's attempt to retreat or hide. Even after Parker was shot twice, Harris kept pursuing Parker and shooting. A rational trier of fact could find based on the totality of the circumstances surrounding the murder, that Harris acted with purpose and prior calculation and design when he retrieved the gun from a concealed location, fired the gun repeatedly at Parker, even though Parker had already been shot twice, and was retreating and attempting to hide. Harris kept approaching Parker, firing the weapon, and only after Parker yelled out \"I'm hit\" and collapsed on the ground did Harris stop shooting and leave the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Harris's actions of pursuing Parker, even after Parker was shot twice and seeking cover behind a tree, and then shooting him again, demonstrates Harris's quickly conceived plan to kill Parker. Accordingly, Harris's second assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Specifically, he contends that a reasonable jury could not have concluded, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he (1) was the shooter, (2) gave the shooter the gun, (3) shared the animus of the shooter, (4) did not renounce his involvement altogether, (5) acted with prior calculation and design, (6) was on the scene, or (7) was not acting, either directly or vicariously, in self-defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Harris contends that the jury's finding that he was the shooter and that he acted with prior calculation and design is against the manifest weight of the evidence. We disagree. As previously discussed under the sufficiency analysis, a reasonable jury could conclude that Harris was the shooter and acted with purpose and prior calculation and design.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 52} The identification of Harris as the shooter came from the witnesses who were in the best position to see who fired the weapon. The shooter was right outside Collins's home, and Collins remembered that the shooter was wearing gray jogging pants. Martinez also described the shooter as wearing gray jogging pants. From the video, Detective Lynch concluded that Martinez was in one of the best places to see who the shooter was. Further, Detective Lynch stated that most of the other people who attempted to identify what the shooter was wearing did not round the corner where the shooter would have been visible. Although Marcus and Harry each testified that Harris was not the shooter, it is within the jury's discretion to give more weight to certain testimony over other testimony. In this case, the jury, in its full discretion, gave more weight to the testimony of Martinez, Collins, and Isaac.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Additionally, the weight of the evidence supports that Harris acted with purpose and prior calculation and design. During the chase, Harris retrieved the gun from a concealed location and placed it in his waistband. After rounding the corner, Harris turned and opened fire on Parker with each shot being taken at a closer range. Harris continued shooting even after Parker was shot twice, yelled that he had been hit, and retreated behind a tree. Based on the evidence, the jury could conclude that Parker's back was up against a tree when Harris approached one final time and shot him in the chest. Based on the facts and evidence, we cannot say that the jury lost its way in finding Harris guilty of aggravated murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 54} If the jury did not believe that Harris was the shooter, but rather an accomplice to the murder, evidence was presented that Harris gave the shooter the gun. The act of providing the murder weapon to the shooter evidences that Harris acted with the same animus as the shooter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Davis\n   </em>\n   , 5th Dist. Richland No. CA-2133,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1983%20WL%207047\">\n    1983 WL 7047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Harris next contends that his convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence because no jury could reasonably believe that he was actually present at the time of the murder. The basis for this argument seems to be that the police supplied the witnesses with the description and identity of the shooter. There is nothing in the record or evidence to support Harris's accusation. Alternatively, he argues that if he was on the scene, his act of running away amounted to renunciation, and the jury lost its way in finding him guilty under a complicity theory. The evidence suggested that Harris either shot Parker or provided the shooter with the gun. Despite Harris's argument that he ran away, constituting renunciation, the case law is clear that a person who provides a firearm to the shooter can\n   be guilty under an aiding and abetting theory.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., Davis\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 56} We also find unpersuasive that Harris's convictions are against the manifest weight of the evidence because the jury could have reasonably believed that Harris was acting in self-defense. Harris did not argue self-defense, and the jury was not instructed on self-defense. This argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 57} Accordingly, this is not the exceptional case where the jury clearly lost its way in finding Harris guilty of aggravated murder, murder, felonious assault, or discharging a firearm over a public road.

The prosecutor merely commented on the defense's assertion that the state was hiding from the inconsistencies. Furthermore, immediately after discussing the existence of inconsistencies in the testimonies, the prosecutor reminded the jury that \"[y]our job is to sift through it. Look at the consistencies. Look at the opportunities for consistencies, like the people who are consistent about actions, to see the actions. Look at the inconsistencies. Look at the video-where these come from.\" (Tr. 701.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   {\u00b6 86} Moreover, upon a review of the entire closing argument by the state and the defense, we find that defense counsel also interjected his opinions on what he believed the evidence showed or did not show. Even after the state objected and a side-bar was held, defense counsel continued with his beliefs. Therefore, if the state commented on what it believed the evidence showed, it was only in response to what defense counsel repeatedly stated. Accordingly, it could be argued that any error Harris now argues about on appeal could be deemed invited error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   {\u00b6 87} Nevertheless, we find that the prosecutor's isolated comment was not prejudicial and did not amount to plain error. Furthermore, the trial court, immediately after the state ended its closing argument, instructed the jury that closing arguments are not evidence. It is presumed that the jury followed this instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   {\u00b6 88} Accordingly, the prosecutor did not engage in misconduct during his closing argument because the remarks did not rise to the level of misconduct that would substantively deprive Harris of a fair trial. Having found that the prosecutor's comments did not constitute misconduct, Harris's defense counsel was, therefore, not ineffective for failing to object to them. The fifth assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   {\u00b6 89} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   MARY EILEEN KILBANE, J., and FRANK D.
