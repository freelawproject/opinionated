By their terms, these orders endeavor to establish a hedge of protection around one person by restricting the actions or words of another. Thousands of faceless Hoosiers are currently subject to or shielded by protective orders like the one at the center of this case. Because violating a protective order amounts to a criminal act, the State must prove a mens rea element-that the person intended to violate the order. This case presents the question of what constitutes sufficient evidence to prove a person intentionally or knowingly violated a protective order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2008, a parishioner in a small Solsberry, Indiana church leveled accusations against the pastor, K.G. The parishioner, Defendant Shelly Phipps, alleged K.G. breached her confidence by revealing to other church members the personal, private information she divulged during counseling. She also alleged K.G. inappropriately hugged her on two occasions. Despite efforts from church leaders to remedy the situation and bring reconciliation, the relationship between Phipps and K.G. deteriorated. Phipps left the church and began writing to K.G. and other parishioners about her departure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Later that year, citing repeated \"harassment and emails and letters\" from Phipps, K.G. sought a protective order. The court issued a protective order that included standard statutory relief, prohibiting Phipps from \"harassing, annoying, telephoning, contacting, or directly or indirectly communicating with\" K.G. The order mandated that Phipps stay away from K.G.'s residence and the church.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2009, Phipps violated the order by speaking to K.G. In April of that year, she pleaded guilty to Invasion of Privacy as a Class A misdemeanor for this violation. In that case, the trial court sentenced Phipps to 180 days incarceration with 176 days suspended to probation. In 2010, Phipps violated the protective order a second time. She pleaded guilty in March 2011 and was ordered to serve one year in the Greene County Jail with all but sixteen days suspended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In January 2016, K.G. filed a petition to extend the original order of protection. The Greene County Superior Court granted the petition and extended the order for another two years. On February 28, 2016, Phipps emailed three elders at the church. The message reads in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   I originally sent this to my dad and now I am forwarding it. I'm off work Tuesday. I will give [K.G.] until Tuesday evening to comply. I have e-mailed channel 13 about doing a story. If Tuesday evening passes by then I will have him arrested for battery.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   If he puts me in jail again I will just hold a news conference from my jail cell. [K.G.] has choices: He can resign, retire, apologize or go to jail for battery. I hope he makes the right decision soon. I am more than willing to apologize for my part in this.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   State's Ex. 1. Upon learning of the email from a church elder, K.G. requested that the elder forward him the message. K.G. then contacted the police. On March 3, 2016 the State charged Phipps with two counts of Invasion of Privacy: one as a Class A misdemeanor and the second as a Level 6 felony. The charging information alleged she had knowingly or intentionally violated the order \"by harassing, annoying, telephoning, contacting, or directly or indirectly communicating with [K.G.]\" A jury found Phipps guilty as charged. The trial court merged the two verdicts and entered a judgment of conviction for the Level 6 felony. It sentenced Phipps to two-and-one-half years with one year in work release and the remaining one-and-one-half years suspended to probation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Phipps appealed, claiming the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. She also argued the trial court abused its discretion by considering her criminal history as an aggravating circumstance and that her two-and-one-half-year sentence was inappropriate in light of the nature of the offense and her character. In a split opinion, the Court of Appeals majority concluded that \"Phipps's email is a request to the church elders to take action for the alleged wrongful conduct of their employee, K.G. [and] [u]pon receipt of Phipps's email, the church elders had discretion to ignore her email or respond to her demands.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Phipps v.

I.C. \u00a7 35-46-1-15.1(2) (2014 Repl.). At oral argument, the parties agreed this case narrowly turns on the first element-intent. We, therefore, limit our review to that specific issue.

First, the content of her email suggests Phipps was aware she was communicating with K.G. Although she sent the e-mail to her father and church elders, the email placed demands on K.G. only. She gave\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     K.G.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   options in the email, \"[K.G.] has choices: He can resign, retire, apologize or go to jail for battery.\" And for the first time, Phipps placed a deadline for\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     K.G.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   to comply with her demands.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Second, although Phipps testified that she did not intend to communicate with K.G. through her email, the State pressed her on that point during cross-examination.

Vol II at 155-58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Based on these excerpts, we conclude that the jury acted within its discretion in discrediting Phipps's testimony. The jury apparently dismissed Phipps's declarations that she believed the church elders could ensure that K.G. complied with her wishes without relaying the contents of her email to him. Likewise, the jury rejected Phipps's proposed alternative intent-returning to the church. On the whole, the reasonable inferences drawn from the e-mail and the State's cross-examination of Phipps support the jury's finding that Phipps intentionally or knowingly communicated with K.G. through her email to the church elders. We, therefore, will not disturb the jury's verdict.

According to Phipps, since her criminal history includes the two prior invasion-of-privacy convictions, it was improper as a matter of law to find that her criminal history was an aggravating circumstance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   With regard to the trial court's finding, the trial court made the following statement at the sentencing hearing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   The aggravating circumstance is I think I have been dealing with this since I took the bench. So, I know based upon your last conviction and then this conviction it has been more than 7 years but I know it has been going on with the protective orders and everything for longer than that. So, [K.G.], has been dealing with this for over 8 years. You know this isn't a one-time violation. You have got now this is your third violation for it, your third conviction.\n   <em>\n    That is an aggravating circumstance that this behavior has gone over for over 7 years, a span of 7 years\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Tr. Vol. II at 211 (emphasis added). Although Phipps's criminal history is limited to the two prior convictions for invasion of privacy, we see from the sentencing-hearing transcript that the trial court did not find her convictions to be an aggravating circumstance. Rather, the trial court concluded that Phipps's behavior of harassing K.G., which \"has gone over for over 7 years,\" was an aggravator. Our jurisprudence provides that Phipps's convictions cannot be used to enhance her sentence, but the particular facts-the ongoing nature and length of her criminal conduct-can properly be considered as aggravation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Adkins v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10966223\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/561/787/#p789\">\n    561 N.E.2d 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 789 (Ind. 1990) (affirming enhanced sentence for felony murder based on the nature in which the crime was committed where \"the trial judge in his findings of aggravating circumstances did not use the mere fact of the shooting alone but described in detail the manner in which appellant responded when confronted by the owner of the station\");\n   <em>\n    Washington v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11062264\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/422/1218/#p1221\">\n    422 N.E.2d 1218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1221 (Ind. 1981) (\"The fact that the use of a weapon automatically raised the counts on confinement from class D to class B felonies does not preclude the court from also considering the manner in which the gun was used as an aggravating circumstance.\"). Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    III. We deny Phipps's request for 7(B) relief.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Article 7, Section 4 of the Indiana Constitution, implemented through Appellate Rule 7(B), gives this Court power to review and revise all criminal sentences. \"We may revise a sentence authorized by statute, if, after due consideration of the trial court's decision, we find the sentence inappropriate in light of the nature of the offense and the character of the offender.\"\n   <em>\n    Gibson v.

Appellate Rule 7(B) ). The defendant bears the burden of persuading the Court that her sentence is inappropriate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6794490\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/51/204/#p215\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Phipps requests that we revise her sentence, claiming the maximum two-and-one-half-year sentence she received is inappropriate given the nature of her offense and her character. Specifically, she directs us to the record evidence showing that, under the strain of mental illness, she committed a non-violent offense that threatened only K.G.'s reputation. While these are certainly sympathetic facts, they do not represent \"compelling evidence\" casting Phipps's offense or character in a better light.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stephenson v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6873976\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/29/111/#p122\">\n    29 N.E.3d 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 122 (Ind. 2015) (explaining that we will decline 7(B) relief absent \"compelling evidence portraying in a positive light the nature of the offense ... and the defendant's character\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Considering the nature of this offense, we note Phipps deliberately defied the protective order in place since 2009. What's more, this conviction constitutes her third violation of that order. She emailed K.G.'s superiors in an effort to force him to apologize, resign, or retire. Although Phipps's email did not portend physical violence, it threatened K.G. with job loss, jail time, and public humiliation. And as the trial court explained during sentencing, Phipps's inability to conform her behavior to court orders has resulted in a painful, protracted criminal drama for those involved, herself included. To be sure, Phipps's repeated violations have required K.G. to invoke the help of police and courts to restore order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   As to Phipps's character, we observe she has displayed admirable qualities. She achieved some college-level education and maintained a stable work history. We also note Phipps suffers from bipolar disorder, which impacts her behavior. We cannot overlook, however, that Phipps squandered prior chances at reform. Twice the trial court showed leniency and twice Phipps re-offended, carrying on the same harassing behavior. On this most recent offense, the trial court thought it appropriate to impose a two-and-one-half-year sentence but allow her to serve it on work release and probation. Since we are not convinced that Phipps's sentence proves inappropriate considering her offense and character, we will not revise it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   For the reasons discussed, we affirm Phipps's conviction and her sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Rush, C.J., and David, Massa, and Slaughter, J.J., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Because the Court of Appeals found this issue to be dispositive, it declined to address her sentencing claims.
