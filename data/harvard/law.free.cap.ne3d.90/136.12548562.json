For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In August 2015, Keith was charged in a 14-count indictment in connection with the February 12, 2014 drive-by shooting of a vehicle occupied by Arturio Young (\"Young\"), Young's girlfriend Dyshenia Cranshaw (\"Cranshaw\"), and Joseph Willis (\"Willis\") on I-480, and the shooting death of Young on August 7, 2014. Keith and Young were members of rival gangs-the J Park and the ATM Jack Boys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Count 1 charged Keith with the aggravated murder of Young. Count 2 charged him with the murder of Young. Counts 3, 4, and 11 charged him with the felonious assault of Young. Count 5 charged him with the attempted murder of Brandon Wiley (\"Wiley\"). Count 6 charged him with the felonious assault of Wiley. Counts 7 and 14 charged him with the discharge of a firearm on or near a prohibited premises. Count 8 charged him with the attempted murder of Young. Count 9 charged him with the attempted murder of Cranshaw. Count 10 charged him with the attempted murder of Willis. Count 12 charged him with the felonious assault of Cranshaw. Count 13 charged him with the felonious assault of Willis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The matter proceeded to a jury trial, at which the following evidence was adduced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Several witnesses testified at trial, including Daryl Jones (\"Jones\") and Jones's cousin Malcolm Edwards (\"Edwards\"), who were also charged in connection with Young's murder. Jones testified that on the night of February 12, 2014, he was visiting his Edwards and friends Keith and Ramel Lee \"Sharky\" in the area of East 138th Street and Harvard Avenue. They drove to a nearby gas station. Young was pumping gas when Lee approached him. Cranshaw, who was seated in the front passenger seat of Young's car, testified that Young dropped the gas pump onto the ground, jumped into his car, and sped away as fast as he could to get away from Lee. Young's friend, Willis, was a passenger in the backseat of Young's car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Meanwhile, Lee ordered Jones to hurry back into the car and follow Young's car. Jones, who was afraid of Lee, complied and a chase ensued. Edwards was in the front passenger seat, Lee was in the rear driver's side seat, and Keith was in the rear passenger's side seat. Jones followed Young's car onto I-480 where a chase ensued for approximately ten minutes. Jones drove alongside Young's car, and Keith and Lee both fired shots at Young's car from the back window. Jones drove away following the gunshots. No one in Young's car was injured. Police investigated the incident, but nothing materialized because of the lack of witness cooperation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Edwards testified that he was under indictment for the same drive-by shooting, but was hoping for a plea deal in exchange for his testimony. He testified that he, Keith, and Lee were affiliated with people from his neighborhood, who call themselves J Park. Jones was not affiliated with J Park. He was visiting from a different neighborhood. Edwards further testified that Lee wanted to \"get at\" Young because of \"[a] beef [they] had in the neighborhood.\" Edwards testified that Young was associated with the ATM Jack Boys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Several months later, in August 2014, Young was shot and killed at the corner of East 138th Street and Lambert. Young was hanging out with his friend Wiley and his brother Ryhad Muhammad (\"Muhammad\") before going to celebrate Cranshaw's birthday. Wiley testified that he, Young, and Muhammad were walking to a corner store at approximately 11:00 p.m. when three men rode past them on their bikes from the opposite direction. The three men then turned around and approached them from behind. Wiley, who admitted being a member of the ATM Jack Boys, immediately recognized Keith from high school and as a member of J Park. Keith and another individual, whom\n   Wiley did not recognize, pointed guns at Wiley and Young, who raised their hands. They were standing approximately eight feet from each other. Keith stated to Young, \"I'm about to body you.\" The other individual with the gun stated \"that's dead, that's dead.\" Wiley took this to mean that he was going to shoot or kill Young. Then, Keith and the other individual fired shots at Young and fled the scene. Wiley observed sparks coming from Keith's gun. Wiley and Muhammad ran away, uninjured. Wiley fired shots back at the shooters with his own gun, which was a .380 firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Young, who was shot in the chest, managed to walk to Cranshaw's house and entered through the front door calling for her. Cranshaw is the mother of Young's two children. Cranshaw's stepmother observed him entering the house, followed by Muhammad, who cried that Young was shot. Young then walked out of the house toward his car where Cranshaw and her stepmother found him gasping for air. Young passed away before Cleveland EMS could get him to the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Police questioned Wiley at the murder scene, but Wiley did not identify Keith as the assailant. He also did not tell the police that he fired his own .380 firearm at the scene. When the police later questioned Wiley about the incident, he identified Keith from a single photograph by his nickname \"Hot Dog.\" Wiley also admitted that he shot his own gun at the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Detective Colin Ginley (\"Detective Ginley\") of the Cleveland Police Gang Unit testified regarding his investigation of J Park, the ATM Jack Boys, and this case. Detective Ginley identified photos of several members of J Park based on a combination of factors, including police reports and databases, interviews of J Park members and members of the neighborhood, social media, and surveillance. He further identified gang graffiti and signs, including the J Park handsign. Detective Ginley described each gang's territory and explained that there was an ongoing \"beef\" between J Park and the ATM Jack Boys. According to Detective Ginley, a \"beef\" refers to a \"disagreement on a serious level.\" He explained that a \"beef\" between gangs usually refers to some form of violence. Detective Ginley created an organizational chart that he used to identify J Park as a gang and identified Keith as a member of J Park.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} At the conclusion of trial, the jury found Keith guilty of the aggravated murder (Count 1), murder (Count 2), attempted murder (Count 8), and felonious assault (Counts 3, 4, and 11) of Young, the attempted murder and felonious assault of Wiley (Counts 5 and 6), discharging of a firearm on or near a prohibited premises (Counts 7 and 14), the felonious assault of Cranshaw (Count 12), and the felonious assault of Willis (Count 13). The jury also found Keith guilty of all accompanying specifications, including one-, three-, and five-year firearm specifications and criminal gang specifications. The jury found him not guilty of the attempted murder of Cranshaw and Willis (Counts 9 and 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The parties stipulated and the court found that Counts 1-4 (the aggravated murder, murder, and felonious assault of Young) are allied offenses of similar import. The state elected to proceed with sentencing on Count 1. The parties further stipulated and the court found that Counts 5 and 6 (attempted murder and felonious assault of Wiley) are allied offenses. The state elected to proceed with sentencing on Count 5. The parties further stipulated that Counts 8 and 11 (the attempted murder and felonious assault of Young) are allied offenses. The state elected to proceed with sentencing on Count 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} The trial court sentenced Keith to twenty-five years to life in prison on Count 1, eight years in prison on Count 5, eight years in prison on Count 7, six years in prison on each of Counts 8, 12, and 13, and twelve years in prison on Count 14. The court sentenced Keith to an aggregate thirteen-year sentence on the specifications to be served prior to the sentences on the underlying felonies. Keith now appeals, raising the following three assignments of error for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error One\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   The trial court violated [Keith's] constitutional right to confrontation by allowing [Detective Ginley's] inadmissible\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   testimony.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Two\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   The state did not produce sufficient evidence to prove the elements of aggravated murder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Assignment of Error Three\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   The verdicts were against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Right of Confrontation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In the first assignment of error, Keith argues the trial court violated his constitutional right to confront his accusers when it allowed Detective Ginley to provide testimonial hearsay. Keith contends that Detective Ginley's testimony regarding Keith's role in J Park as well as the organizational chart of J Park that Detective Ginley created were based on inadmissible testimonial hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The state argues that because Keith did not specifically raise the Confrontation Clause in his objections to Detective Ginley's organizational chart, he waives all but plain error. Although defense counsel did not specifically cite the Confrontation Clause in his objections to Detective Ginley's testimony, a review of the record reveals that defense counsel did in fact object to certain portions of Detective Ginley's testimony. Therefore, we do not find that Keith has waived all but plain error, and we now review whether Detective Ginley's testimony and organizational chart violated the Confrontation Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 16} The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment provides that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\" The United States Supreme Court has interpreted the clause to bar admission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify and the defendant has had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\n   <em>\n    Crawford v.

He also used social media to identify individuals and observe common gang signs, symbols, territory, and paraphernalia. The organizational chart was not admitted into evidence. Detective Ginley did not use it for the purpose of establishing each member's particular rank or role in the organization, but rather to establish that these individuals acted together on many occasions. Detective Ginley often referred to photographs taken from social media to explain the individuals in the chart, including Keith. Detective Ginley testified that gang members never flash gang signs or wear gang clothing in public where they could be observed by police. Detective Ginley further testified that he could identify members with \"major roles\" in the gang because\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [t]hey were the ones who continually surfaced in our law enforcement databases, our RMS reporting system, committing crimes together, being together, as well as individuals that we had heard about the most and we had the most contact with.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Under these circumstances, Detective Ginley's knowledge of the organizational chart and gang-member identification was not based on testimonial hearsay and was admissible because it is based on Detective Ginley's personal knowledge or observation of data collected in police databases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Detective Ginley also identified several J Park members by name, and testified that Keith was a \"shooter,\" which meant that Keith was willing to do a shooting. Defense counsel objected to this testimony and the court sustained the objection. Before sustaining the objection, the court inquired of the witness as to the basis of his knowledge. Specifically, the court asked Detective Ginley the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Generally, you have learned what you've just testified to by either talking to some of these people themselves, or-and they admit, hey, I'm in a gang and I shoot, or talking to many people and learning things-learning a little bit from each person about somebody else, is that right?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [Detective Ginley]: Correct. That and as well as talking to other members of the gang.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   THE COURT: Here's the problem, members of the jury, with the testimony [Keith] is known as a shooter. All testimony from any witness has to be based on personal knowledge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   It appears to me, Mr. Ginley, that you don't-You've never seen Mr. Keith shoot a person, have you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   THE WITNESS: No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   THE COURT: I think we're going to sustain that one, and you're asked to\n   disregard the testimony describing him as a known shooter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Based on the foregoing exchange, we find that the trial court properly sustained the objection because Detective Ginley offered testimony that was not based on his personal knowledge. The court properly ordered the jury to disregard that testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 23} We also note that 12 of the counts Keith was charged with included gang specifications, which required the state to prove Keith \"committed a felony that is an offense of violence while participating in a criminal gang.\" R.C. 2941.142. As a result, evidence that Keith was a member of the J Park gang was relevant to prove the elements of the above specification.\n   <em>\n    State v. Peterson\n   </em>\n   , 10th Dist. Franklin No. 07AP-303,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008-Ohio-2838\">\n    2008-Ohio-2838\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%202390781\">\n    2008 WL 2390781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 37. In the instant case, the trial court advised the jury to\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   keep in mind that every charge here except Counts 7 and 14 includes a criminal gang activity specification where the prosecutor alleges that the crime in each count was an offense of violence committed while participating in a criminal gang as defined by the Ohio Revised Code. This testimony is being allowed for that purpose.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The evidence was also relevant to show the relationship between Keith and Young and to put the crimes in context.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   [T]he Ohio Supreme Court has held that evidence of a defendant's gang affiliation is admissible * * * where \"the interrelationship between people is a central issue.\" [\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Wiley testified that when he observed Keith approaching himself and Young prior to the shooting, his first instinct was to run because Keith was a member of J Park and there was a \"beef\" between the ATM Jack Boys and J Park.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Therefore, the first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Sufficiency of the Evidence-Aggravated Murder\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 27} In the second assignment of error, Keith argues that the state failed to present sufficient evidence to establish the elements of aggravated murder under R.C. 2903.01(A), which provides that: \"[n]o person shall purposely, and with prior calculation and design, cause the death of another [.]\" Specifically, Keith contends there was no evidence of prior calculation and design.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 28} The Ohio Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Wiley also testified that Keith was wearing an\n   orange and blue shirt with horizontal stripes at the time of the shooting. Young's brother, Muhammad, also observed the shooting and testified that the person who shot Young was wearing an orange and blue shirt with horizontal stripes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Keith contends the accounts of what he was wearing at the time of the shooting are unreliable because they were based on a Facebook photograph depicting Keith wearing a shirt with orange and blue stripes. The jury, however, was free to assess the credibility of the witnesses, and defense counsel pointed out on cross-examination that Wiley originally told police that Keith was wearing a gray and black striped shirt. The jury chose to give little consequence to the discrepancy in Wiley's description of the color of the stripes of Keith's shirt. Furthermore, other witnesses corroborate Wiley's and Muhammad's testimonies. Cranshaw, her stepmother, and a neighbor heard the gunshots. The neighbor and Muhammad observed Keith and his friends approach Young and Wiley before the shots were fired. Thus, there was competent, credible evidence to establish Keith's aggravated murder, murder, attempted murder, and felonious assault convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 40} Keith also argues the guilty verdicts on his attempted murder, felonious assault, and discharging of a firearm on or near a prohibited premises charges, resulting from the drive-by shooting on I-480 in February 2014, were against the manifest weight of the evidence. He contends there were no witnesses who observed Keith shooting at the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 41} A review of the record, however, reveals that several witnesses testified that Keith fired shots from the backseat of one car into another car driven by Young. Jones, who drove Keith's car, testified that he observed both Keith and Lee firing their guns at Young from the backseat of the car. Edwards also testified that he observed Keith with a gun at the time of the shooting, and Cranshaw testified that she heard more than one gun firing at the same time. Under these circumstances, it was reasonable for the jury to believe that Keith attempted to murder and seriously injure Young and his passengers. Therefore, Keith's attempted murder, felonious assault, and discharging of a firearm on or near a prohibited premises are supported by the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   {\u00b6 42} Accordingly, the third assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 43} Judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   EILEEN T.
