We disagree. Because the Department's decision to add Brevital to the lethal injection cocktail does not carry the effect of law-that is, the change does not impose standards regulating Ward's conduct-we hold the new three-drug protocol is not a rule and, therefore, not subject to the Administrative Rules and Procedures Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff, Roy Ward, sits condemned on Indiana's \"death row\" at Indiana State Prison in LaPorte County.

Code \u00a7 35-38-6-1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (2014 Repl.). The Code tasks the Indiana Department of Correction (the Department) with housing death-row offenders and administering executions by lethal injection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   I.C. chapter 35-38-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In May 2014, the Department announced a change to the lethal injection protocol. Specifically, the Department said it would alter the three-drug combination used for executions, replacing Sodium Thiopental with Brevital-a barbiturate anesthetic in the same class. Following that announcement, Indiana's three-drug execution protocol included Brevital, followed by Pancuronium Bromide and then Potassium Chloride.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 22, 2015, Ward filed a complaint in the LaPorte Circuit Court, naming as defendants Bruce Lemmon, then-Commissioner of the Department, and Ron Neal, the Superintendent of the Indiana State Prison.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The complaint alleged the Department's change to the lethal injection protocol violated Ward's rights under Indiana's Administrative Rules and Procedures Act (ARPA) along with his due course of law and due process rights under the Indiana and United States constitutions. All Ward's claims hinged upon his contention that the Department's new three-drug cocktail amounted to an administrative \"rule\" that must be adopted and promulgated pursuant to ARPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Defendants moved to dismiss Ward's complaint under Trial Rule 12(B)(6), arguing it failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Following a hearing, the trial court granted the State's motion. It concluded: \"Defendants were not required to go through ARPA as changing a drug in the lethal injection protocol is considered an internal policy and not rule promulgation.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ward appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's order dismissing\n   the complaint.\n   <em>\n    Ward v.

The Court of Appeals holding proved twofold. First, in response to a newly raised argument from the Defendants, the court held the Department must follow ARPA when promulgating rules.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12356738\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/79/383/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12356738\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/79/383/\">\n    at 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, it held the Department's execution protocol constituted a \"rule\" and since the Department failed to follow ARPA's requirements when adding Brevital to the three-drug combination, \"the changed protocol is void and without effect.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12356738\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/79/383/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12356738\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/79/383/\">\n    at 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Defendants then sought transfer, which we granted, thereby vacating the Court of Appeals opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ind. Appellate Rule 58(A). The central issue presented in this case concerns whether the Department's lethal injection protocol constitutes a \"rule\" for ARPA purposes. Ward contends the protocol is a rule and, therefore, must go through ARPA's notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements. On the other hand, the Defendants maintain the lethal injection protocol is an internal Department policy exempt from ARPA's strictures. For the reasons set forth below, we agree with the Defendants and affirm the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Since a 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim challenges only the legal sufficiency of the complaint, it presents a legal question that we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    Thornton v.

ARPA, however, does not apply to \"[a] resolution or directive of any agency that relates solely to internal policy, internal agency organization, or internal procedure and does not have the effect of law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%204-22-2-13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 4-22-2-13(c)(1).

Case law defines an administrative \"rule\" similarly, laying out four elements: (1) \"an agency statement of general applicability to a class;\" (2) that is \"applied prospectively to the class;\" (3) that is \"applied as though it has the effect of law;\" and (4) that \"affect[s] the substantive rights of the class.\"\n   <em>\n    Villegas v.

What's more, we see the \"effect of law\" requirement distinguishes agency rules from internal policies or procedures.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   I.C. \u00a7 4-22-2-3(b)(1) (instructing administrative rules carry the effect of law),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   I.C. \u00a7 4-22-2-13(c)(1) (instructing that internal\n   agency policies and procedures do not).

While we have not expanded upon that principle, we recently rephrased it by stating court rules \"have the force and effect of law ... and are binding on both the court and all litigants.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Adoption of J.T.D.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6896472\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/21/824/#p831\">\n    21 N.E.3d 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 831 (Ind. 2014) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).

Although we find this precedent instructive, we recognize its limitations since it considers court rules, not agency rules.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Our Court of Appeals had the opportunity to apply the term \"effect of law\" to agency rules in the ARPA case,\n   <em>\n    Villegas v.

Per the BMV requirements, the\n   <em>\n    Villegas\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs had to alter their conduct (provide certain documents) to receive the substantive benefits the law afforded (driver licenses, ID cards, or permits).

Alternatively, if the agency requirement primarily affects agency conduct (internal policies or procedure), then it is an agency directive or resolution without the effect of law. We recognize the Court of Appeals did not utilize its \"primary impact\" reasoning in the \"effect of law\" analysis, but we still find it instructive to our task here since the \"effect of law\" element distinguishes a rule from an internal policy or directive. In sum, gleaning what we can from Indiana jurisprudence, we understand that a rule having the \"effect of law\" primarily affects individuals' substantive rights or conduct and can be enforced in a court of law.

In\n   <em>\n    American Trucking\n   </em>\n   , the Court considered whether requirements adopted by the Port of Los Angeles carried the \"effect of law\" for purposes of federal preemption.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 648-49,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697065\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/641/#p649\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, the Port required that certain trucking companies enter into \"concession agreements\" that mandated the companies affix placards on some trucks and submit parking plans for unused trucks.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697065\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/641/#p649\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697065\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/641/#p649\">\n    at 645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697065\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/641/#p649\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Port prescribed penalties for noncompliance. For example, a company's failure to enter into these agreements could result in a \"misdemeanor ... punishable by a fine of up to $500 or a prison sentence of up to six months.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697065\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/641/#p649\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Port's requirements left trucking companies with a\n   choice, either conform their conduct to Port standards or face penalties. In determining whether the Port's requirements carried the \"effect of law,\" the Court explained the phrase \"targets the State acting as the State,\" that is, when the State regulates individual conduct.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697065\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/641/#p649\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697065\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/641/#p649\">\n    at 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697065\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/641/#p649\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, if an agency rule acts as a coercive mechanism or wields coercive power over people, it carries the effect of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697065\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/641/#p649\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697065\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/641/#p649\">\n    at 650-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697065\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/641/#p649\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ultimately, the Court held that since the Port's regulations imposed mandatory obligations on trucking companies, those regulations had the force and effect of law.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697065\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/641/#p649\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697065\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/641/#p649\">\n    at 652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697065\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/641/#p649\">\n    133 S.Ct. 2096\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Weaving together this federal and state precedent, we observe a common thread-a rule carrying the effect of law primarily affects individual rights and obligations by setting binding standards of conduct for persons subject to its authority. This \"effect of law\" concept manifests in everyday situations where Hoosiers must conform their conduct to meet agency standards. To be sure, when an agency standard requires citizens to alter their behavior-i.e., when it regulates their conduct-it necessarily affects the citizens' rights or obligations because it compels them to do something they would not do otherwise or face legal consequences for noncompliance. And so that agency standard carries the effect of law. We therefore settle on the following summation of the phrase \"effect of law\" for Indiana jurisprudence: An agency regulation carries the effect of law when it prescribes binding standards of conduct for persons subject to agency authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Since the Department's lethal injection protocol does not bind Ward's conduct, it does not have the effect of law.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Ward's complaint alleged the Department's three-drug execution protocol amounted to a rule subject to ARPA's notice-and-comment rulemaking requirements. In support of that allegation, the complaint thrice stated: \"The new rules have the effect of law.\" Notably, Ward attached and incorporated into the complaint five exhibits that either detail the lethal injection process or confirm the Department purchased Brevital. Three of those five-Exhibits C, D, and E-are confidential or restricted Department documents that list the drugs approved for use in executions. Because Ward cabined his claim to the three-drug cocktail-specifically, adding Brevital-we confine our \"effect of law\" analysis to portions of those three exhibits that discuss the drugs approved for lethal injections. In other words, we must determine whether the Department's lethal injection three-drug protocol prescribes binding standards of conduct for condemned offenders. It does not. In our view, the exhibits Ward presented as Indiana's lethal injection process represent an internal policy or procedure, not an administrative rule having the effect of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Exhibit C, for example, is a three-page document that identifies what drugs are used for lethal injections and outlines how the Department obtains, stores, prepares, and administers them. It instructs that one of the drugs that could be used during an execution is Brevital. Exhibit C places no requirements on the condemned offender's conduct. Instead, it informs Department personnel what they must do to prepare and use the pharmaceuticals during a lethal injection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Exhibit D is a longer Department document detailing the entire lethal execution protocol, including procedures the Department will use in the weeks, days, hours, and even minutes before an execution. But for our purposes here, we consider one\n   paragraph in Exhibit D's Section F, which states, Department \"[s]taff are trained by a licensed physician in the mixing, preparation, and administration of the Sodium Thiopental, Pentobarbital or Brevital, Pancuronium Bromide or Vecuronium and Potassium Chloride.\" Section F goes on to read: \"In the event of an unavailability of a sufficient quantity of Sodium Thiopental from available resources, a sufficient quantity of Pentobarbital, or Brevital will be acquired and administered in the place of the Sodium Thiopental.\" Exhibit D's one paragraph discussing the drugs used during lethal injections in no way regulates the offender's behavior or conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Exhibit E is a one-page document, akin to a checklist, designating and sequencing the drugs approved for lethal injections. Exhibit E directs that Sodium Pentothal, Pentobarbital, or Brevital must be placed in a yellow syringe, Pancuronium or Vecuronium must be placed in a blue syringe, Potassium Chloride must be placed in a red syringe, and Saline must be placed in a black syringe. Like Exhibits C and D, Exhibit E does not require an offender to do anything or alter his or her behavior in any way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In our view, none of these exhibits primarily affect an offender's rights or obligations. No exhibit prescribes binding standards of conduct that condemned offenders, like Ward, must follow to vindicate a substantive right. Unlike the\n   <em>\n    Villegas\n   </em>\n   plaintiffs or the\n   <em>\n    American Trucking\n   </em>\n   companies, Ward is not required to alter his conduct in any way. He is not faced with a choice of conforming his conduct to Department standards or foregoing a substantive right-his fate remains unaltered. Rather, the exhibits outline what Department personnel must do. They relate to the Department's internal policies and procedures that bind Department personnel and no one else. We therefore conclude that the Department's lethal injection protocol, as evidenced by these exhibits, does not carry the effect of law. Consequently, we hold the Department's lethal injection procedures do not constitute rules under Section 4-22-2-3(b) and are exempt from ARPA's rulemaking strictures. Because we resolve Ward's claims on this narrow ground, we decline to address the Defendant's alternative, broader argument that the Department is free to decide whether to follow ARPA when promulgating rules governing executions by lethal injection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We pause briefly to note that Ward does not raise an Eighth Amendment cruel-and-unusual-punishment argument here. His Indiana and federal constitutional claims cited only due process violations, which hinged upon whether the Department's lethal injection protocol amounted to a rule subject to ARPA. Since we hold the Department protocol does not carry the effect of law and therefore is not a rule subject to ARPA, his constitutional claims necessarily fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For these reasons, we affirm the trial court's judgment dismissing Ward's complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Rush, C.J., and David, Massa, and Slaughter, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    At some point during this litigation Robert E. Carter, Jr., replaced Mr. Lemmon as Commissioner and was substituted as a proper party in this appeal pursuant to Indiana Appellate Rule 17(C)(1).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
