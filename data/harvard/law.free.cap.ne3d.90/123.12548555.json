GALLAGHER, J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Plaintiff-appellant Angilique M. Love appeals the decision of the trial court to grant a motion to stay the case pending arbitration. Upon review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In September 2014, Love purchased an automobile from defendant-appellee Crestmont Cadillac (\"Crestmont\"). In the course of the vehicle purchase transaction, Love signed an agreement to binding arbitration. The agreement required all disputes \"arising out of or in any way related to this consumer transaction\" to be resolved by binding arbitration \"conducted by the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\") in accordance with the commercial rules and supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes.\" The agreement further stated that \"[b]inding arbitration shall be used to resolve all claims arising from the purchase * * * of the vehicle * * * financing, warranties, repairs, * * * service or maintenance agreements, or aftermarket products * * *.\" The agreement contained the following clear and conspicuous warnings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   THE RESULT OF THESE PROVISIONS IS THAT EXCEPT AS PROVIDED ABOVE, CLAIMS CANNOT BE LITIGATED IN COURT, INCLUDING CLAIMS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN TRIED BEFORE JURY OR AS PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   READ BEFORE SIGNING. DO NOT SIGN THIS DOCUMENT BEFORE YOU HAVE READ IT AND UNDERSTAND ITS CONTENTS. ARBITRATION IS NOT REQUIRED FOR THE PURCHASE OR FINANCING OF YOUR VEHICLE.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Love alleges that shortly after the purchase, she began experiencing significant problems with the vehicle that Crestmont was unable to diagnose, replicate, or resolve. Love also alleges that Crestmont made certain misrepresentations and sold her various products and services for excessive and unconscionable fees. She claims she incurred damages as a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In April 2016, Love filed a complaint against Crestmont alleging violation of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act (\"CSPA\"), negligent misrepresentation, violation of the Magnusson-Moss Warranty Act (\"MMWA\"), breach of express and implied warranties, beach of contract, breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, unjust enrichment, and fraudulent concealment. Crestmont filed an answer and a motion to stay the case\n   pending arbitration. Following additional briefing by the parties, the trial court granted the motion on July 12, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Love timely filed this appeal. She raises two assignments of error, under which she claims the trial court erred by (1) granting the motion to stay pending arbitration, and (2) failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The standard of review for a trial court's ruling on a motion to stay and compel arbitration depends on the type of questions raised in the challenge.\n   <em>\n    Wisniewski v. Marek Builders, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017-Ohio-1035\">\n    2017-Ohio-1035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=87%20N.E.3d%20969\">\n    87 N.E.3d 969\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00b6 42. Generally, we consider the issue of whether a party has agreed to submit an issue to arbitration or questions of unconscionability under a de novo standard of review.\n   <em>\n    Hedeen v. Autos Direct Online, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-4200\">\n    2014-Ohio-4200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20N.E.3d%20957\">\n    19 N.E.3d 957\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 9 (8th Dist.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Love argues that a substantial portion of her claims do not fall within the scope of the arbitration provision. She asserts that many of the alleged unfair, deceptive and/or unconscionable acts occurred prior to the execution of the agreement and, therefore, are not subject to arbitration. In support of her argument, Love cites\n   <em>\n    Zalecki v. Terminix Internatl.,\n   </em>\n   6th Dist. Lucas No. L-95-156,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1996%20WL%2076052\">\n    1996 WL 76052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Feb. 23, 1996), wherein the court held that CSPA claims involving deception and/or unconscionable acts in the procurement of the contract were not subject to arbitration. However, the Ohio Supreme Court has since held that \"to defeat a motion for stay brought pursuant to R.C. 2711.02, a party must demonstrate that the arbitration provision itself in the contract at issue, and not merely the contract in general, was fraudulently induced.\"\n   <em>\n    Abm Farms v.

No such allegation has been made herein. Furthermore, as this court has previously recognized, \" 'an arbitration clause that is very broad and purports to encompass \"all\" claims arising from the contract creates a presumption that the parties agreed to arbitrate all disputes, unless the dispute is expressly excluded, or if there is very strong evidence to show that the claim should be excluded.' \"\n   <em>\n    Wallace v.

Insofar as Love relies on the FTC's regulations and interpretation of the MMWA, we are not bound thereby.\n   <em>\n    McDaniel\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 17. As found in\n   <em>\n    McDaniel\n   </em>\n   ,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   [T]he appellee has not persuaded us that Congress intended to bar the arbitration of these sorts of claims. We find nothing in the text of the MMWA or in its legislative history to suggest that arbitration was intended to be barred under these circumstances. Moreover, as arbitration has become more accepted in this country as an alternative form of dispute resolution, Congress could have amended the MMWA but has taken no action to do so. For all these reasons, we join those jurisdictions that have held that the MMWA does not preclude binding arbitration of warranty disputes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Finally, we point out that sending this matter to binding arbitration does not circumvent the protections of the\n   MMWA. Appellee may still assert her legal rights under that act in the context of arbitration rather than a court of law. Compelling arbitration does not deprive a person of a legal right. Rather, it changes the forum in which those rights are asserted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2001%20WL%201075726\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 18 -19.

The terms of the arbitration agreement are commercially reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Nevertheless, Love asserts that the arbitration agreement fails to comply with the AAA's consumer due process protocol, which indicates that \"[t]he AAA will only administer your dispute if the arbitration clause meets certain fairness standards that are contained in the AAA Consumer Due Process Protocol,\" and further provides that \"[i]f the AAA has determined that the arbitration clause does not comply with the standards contained in the protocol, and the business does not comply, the AAA will not handle your claim.\" This language clearly provides that the determination as to whether the AAA protocol has been complied with is to be made by the arbitrator in the first instance. In the event arbitration is denied, the matter may be referred back to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Love also asserts that the arbitration provision is against public policy because the provision that \"no claim may be brought as a private attorney general action\" prohibits her from bringing claims under the CSPA. This provision does not hinder any of Love's substantive rights and remedies under the CSPA. As stated by one court, \"We do not consider this limitation alone, however, tantamount to substantive unconscionability, nor do we believe it eviscerates any substantive rights to which [plaintiffs] are entitled under the CSPA.\"\n   <em>\n    Bozich v.
