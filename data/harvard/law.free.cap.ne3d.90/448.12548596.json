The appellate court reversed the Commission's order on the grounds that the Commission had no authority under the Public Utilities Act (Act) ( 220 ILCS 5/1-101\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (West 2012)) to consider Rock Island's application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity because the company did not qualify as a public utility under Illinois law. The Commission and various entities involved in the Commission proceedings sought further review by our court through separate petitions for leave to appeal ( Ill. S. Ct. R. 315 (eff. Mar. 15, 2016)). We granted those petitions and consolidated the proceedings for briefing, argument, and disposition. For the reasons that follow, we agree with the appellate court that the Commission's order must be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \u00b6 2 BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00b6 3 Rock Island is a Delaware limited liability company with its principal offices in Houston, Texas. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Rock Island Wind Line, LLC, which is, in turn, a wholly owned subsidiary of Clean Line Energy Partners, LLC (Clean Line). Clean Line is owned in part by Grid America Holdings, Inc. Grid America is a subsidiary of National Grid USA, a business that owns and operates more than 8600 miles of high voltage transmission facilities in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \u00b6 4 Rock Island plans to construct and manage a high voltage direct current (DC) electric transmission line running from an alternating current (AC)-to-DC current converter station in O'Brien County, Iowa, to a planned DC-to-AC current converter station in Grundy County, Illinois. An additional four-mile segment of AC lines would run from the planned converter station to ComEd's existing transmission system at or near its Collins substation, which is also in Grundy County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \u00b6 5 The purpose of the proposed transmission line is to connect wind generation facilities in northwest Iowa, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Minnesota with electrical markets that utilize an electrical grid operated by PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM), the regional transmission organization (RTO) responsible for coordinating the movement of wholesale electricity to markets in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky, the District of Columbia, and eight states in the Northeast. Once completed, the line will extend for a total of 500 miles. Less than one-fourth of that distance, 121 miles, will be in Illinois. The remainder will be in Iowa.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \u00b6 6 Rock Island has never constructed a high voltage transmission line and does not yet own, control, operate, or manage any plants, equipment, or property in Illinois or elsewhere used or to be used in the transmission of electricity or for any other purpose related to utilities. Rather, it has an option to purchase certain real property in Grundy County. The property subject to the option is the proposed site for the DC-to-AC converter station at which the transmission line would terminate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \u00b6 7 Witnesses for Rock Island testified that the project will cost approximately $1.8 billion to construct, operate, and maintain. As of December 2013, shareholders had committed approximately $95 million of equity to Clean Line, one of Rock Island's parent companies. Only about $21.6 million of this sum, however, was specifically invested in the Rock Island project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \u00b6 8 Under the system currently in place in the United States, new transmission\n   lines are typically constructed after an RTO such as PJM has conducted a transmission study and concluded the new line is necessary for the reliability of the system or to relieve transmission congestion. When the necessity for the new line has been established by the RTO, the developer who constructs the line is entitled to recoup its costs and receive a regulated rate of return on its investment through cost-based rates billed to the customers who benefit from the improved service. Rock Island, however, is not a member of PJM or any RTO, and its proposed project is outside the RTO approval process. Because of that, it will not be eligible to recover any of its construction costs through cost-based electrical rates paid by ratepayers in Illinois. Rather, this is to be a \"merchant transmission\" project.

In contrast to traditional public utilities, which are allowed to recover a regulated, cost-based rate of return from electricity customers on transmission line projects and other investments, merchant transmission developers obtain revenue to cover the costs of constructing and operating transmission facilities exclusively from power-generating customers who purchase transmission capacity and utilize the transmission service pursuant to negotiated contracts.

As part of its initial planning, the company secured three interconnection queue positions with PJM to allow it to deliver 3500 megawatts of power to the grid PJM operates. The assignment of queue positions ensures that the existing grid system is capable of accepting the additional power, and obtaining a queue position is necessary before an entity may connect to PJM's grid. Since first obtaining its three queue positions, however, Rock Island has surrendered two of the positions and reduced the capacity it would add under the third to 1600 megawatts. It did so because it was unwilling or unable at this stage of the process to undertake the additional engineering and design work necessary before an interconnection agreement with PJM could be executed. The surrender of the positions does not foreclose Rock Island from requesting additional queue positions in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 11 Testimony established that the company cannot and will not move forward with the project unless and until a sufficient number of customers contract for power transmitted by the line to enable the company to attract the requisite financing. At the present time, no potential customers have obtained rights to buy service on the transmission line. Indeed, the wind generators that might use the transmission line and that serve as the basis for Rock Island's energy and financial simulation models do not yet exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \u00b6 12 Although there are not yet any customers for Rock Island's planned transmission service, the company plans to offer that service to any \"eligible customers\" under an open access transmission tariff (OATT) pursuant to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regulations. The FERC defines \"eligible customers\" broadly to include any buyer of transmission service, subject only to limitations contained in section 824k of the Federal Power Act ( 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824k(h) (2012) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6 13 The FERC has approved a proposal from Rock Island to \"pre-subscribe\" up to 75% of the proposed line's transmission capacity to anchor customers. Those customers will consist largely, if not entirely, of yet-to-be-built wind generators in the resource area of northwest Iowa, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Minnesota who seek to deliver the power they generate to the PJM grid. The remaining 25% of capacity will be sold at auction through a process known as \"open season bidding.\" The FERC has not mandated that Illinois entities participate in the bidding process, and the project does not designate any part of the energy transmitted along the proposed line for public use in Illinois.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   \u00b6 14 If any transmission capacity remains available after the open season bidding process concludes, any eligible customer may request service under the OATT. In handling such requests, Rock Island must comply with the FERC's open access requirements. The company will be prohibited from discriminating or showing undue preference in selling its transmission service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   \u00b6 15 The reason that the FERC is involved in the project is that under the Federal Power Act ( 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 791a\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (2012) ), the FERC has exclusive authority to regulate \"the sale of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20824\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (2012).\n   <em>\n    Hughes v.

In November 2014, Rock Island filed with the Iowa State Department of Commerce Utilities Board 16 petitions for electric transmission line franchises for the 16 different Iowa counties through which the proposed line would run. The Iowa Utilities Board established a procedural schedule to govern that state's regulatory review of the project. Under that schedule, Rock Island was required to file certain documents beginning in January 2017. On December 22, 2016, however, Rock Island asked the Iowa Utilities Board for leave to withdraw all 16 petitions it had filed in connection with the project. The Iowa Utilities Board granted that request the following day. Although Rock Island advised Iowa authorities that it might submit new filings in that state depending on how judicial review of the regulatory proceedings in our state was ultimately resolved, the Iowa section of the project is currently dead.\n   <em>\n    In re Rock Island Clean Line LLC\n   </em>\n   , Iowa Dep't Com.

No. E-22248 (Dec. 23, 2016), https://efs.iowa.gov/cs/groups/external/documents/docket/mdax/njew/~edisp/1610798.pdf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \u00b6 18 In addition to seeking regulatory approval in Iowa, Rock Island submitted an application to the Illinois Commerce Commission for issuance of a certificate of public convenience and necessity under section 8-406 of our Public Utilities Act ( 220 ILCS 5/8-406(a), (b) (West 2012)) to permit it to operate as a transmission public utility in Illinois and construct, operate, and maintain the electric transmission line just described. Rock Island also made a request pursuant to section 8-503 of the Act ( 220 ILCS 5/8-503 (West 2012) ) for entry of an order authorizing or directing construction of the proposed line. In addition, Rock Island sought authorization to use the FERC Uniform System of Accounts to file the annual financial information reports required by the Commission and requested permission to maintain its books and records at a location outside Illinois.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \u00b6 19 Numerous entities, individuals, and organizations sought and were granted leave to intervene in the proceedings. Among these were ComEd; four local unions of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (collectively referred to in this opinion as the IBEW); the Illinois Agricultural Association, a/k/a the Illinois Farm Bureau; and the Illinois Landowners Alliance, NFP. Commission staff members also participated in the application process by submitting evaluations, reports, and recommendations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \u00b6 20 The IBEW supported Rock Island's petition. ComEd, the Illinois Agricultural Association and the Illinois Landowners Alliance all opposed it. The Illinois Agricultural Association and the Illinois Landowners Alliance also each filed motions to dismiss. As grounds for those motions, the organizations asserted that Rock Island\n   did not meet the threshold criteria necessary to qualify as a public utility within the meaning of section 3-105 of the Act ( 220 ILCS 5/3-105 (West 2012) ) and that the company was therefore ineligible for the relief it sought from the Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \u00b6 21 Both motions were denied by a Commission administrative law judge (ALJ). The ALJ rejected the argument that Rock Island could not apply for a certificate of public convenience because it did not already have in place the transmission infrastructure that would qualify it as a public utility. Looking at the language of the applicable provisions of the Public Utilities Act, the ALJ held that nothing therein required applicants to own public utility plants, equipment, or property at the time they apply for certificates to construct public utility facilities. To construe the statutes as imposing such a requirement would, in the ALJ's view, create an unworkable \"Catch-22.\" Specifically, it would mean that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   \"an entity could not apply for a certificate to construct public utility facilities and transact public utility business unless the entity already owns public utility plant, equipment or property. Under Section 8-406(b), however, constructing the public utility facilities needed in order to apply for a certificate, without already possessing a certificate authorizing construction of those facilities, is prohibited.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \u00b6 22 The ALJ also found support for this conclusion in the past practices of the Commission. The ALJ pointed out at least one other case in which the Commission had granted a certificate of public convenience and necessity for construction of an electric transmission line and for operation as a public utility to an entity that was not yet a certified public utility within the meaning of the Public Utility Act at the time that it first filed to obtain certification for construction of the transmission line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \u00b6 23 Following denial of the motions to dismiss, the matter proceeded to a hearing. Extensive testimony was presented, and the matter was thoroughly briefed by the parties. Based on the evidence presented and the applicable law, the Commission issued a 226-page order in which it concluded that the ALJ had acted correctly in denying the motions to dismiss, found that the Commission had authority to consider Rock Island's application, and granted Rock Island the certificate of public convenience and necessity it had requested. The Commission also allowed the requests Rock Island had made regarding record keeping, subject to certain conditions. It did not grant the company's request for relief under section 8-503 of the Act (authorizing or directing construction of the line) but specified that its determination was without prejudice to the company's right to seek such relief in the future.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \u00b6 24 ComEd, the Illinois Agricultural Association, and the Illinois Landowners Alliance requested rehearing, which the Commission denied. They then sought administrative review in the appellate court. 220 ILCS 5/10-201(a) (West 2014). There, they raised two arguments: first, that the Commission lacked authority to grant Rock Island's application for a certificate of public convenience and necessity because Rock Island does not qualify as a public utility within the meaning of the Public Utilities Act ( 220 ILCS 5/1-101\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (West 2012)) and, second, that the Commission's findings in favor of Rock Island were not supported by substantial evidence.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20IL%20App%20%283d%29%20150099\">\n    2016 IL App (3d) 150099\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 31,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=406%20Ill.%20Dec.%20248\">\n    406 Ill.Dec. 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20N.E.3d%20150\">\n    60 N.E.3d 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \u00b6 25 The appellate court found the first of these arguments to be dispositive.

At the same time, however, such entities are foreclosed from the market protections and other advantages that the Public Utilities Act confers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \u00b6 33 In this case, the Commission did not reach out to compel Rock Island to submit to its regulatory authority. Rather, Rock Island has undertaken to place itself under the Commission's authority voluntarily. Why it has done so is contested. Opponents of the project assert that the company is motivated by a desire to obtain the eminent domain power available to public utilities under the Public Utilities Act. See 220 ILCS 5/8-509 (West 2012). Rock Island disputes this, arguing that it is not currently seeking eminent domain authority and may never do so if it succeeds in obtaining the easements it will need for the project through negotiated agreements with affected landowners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \u00b6 34 Rock Island's explanation for why it has proceeded as it has is twofold. First, it contends that it simply wants to comply with the law. It believes that if it ultimately moves forward with the project, its transmission system will, in fact, qualify as a public utility facility and that the service it provides will constitute a public utility service within the meaning of the Public Utilities Act and that it therefore needs to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity pursuant to section 8-406 of the Act ( 220 ILCS 5/8-406 (West 2012) ) before moving forward. While it may seem counterintuitive for a corporation to voluntarily submit to the state's regulatory authority, especially where, as here, it disavows any intention to exercise the primary benefit of doing so-obtaining eminent domain authority-there is one advantage to obtaining the proper certifications in advance. If the corporation were to proceed without first obtaining regulatory approval and was subsequently found to be a public utility within the meaning of the Public Utilities Act and operating without the\n   requisite legal authorization, the Illinois Commerce Commission could bring an action in circuit court to enjoin the company's violation or threatened violation of the law, and the project could be halted. See 220 ILCS 5/4-202 (West 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00b6 35 The company's second justification for seeking to place itself within the provisions of the Public Utilities Act and obtaining a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Commission is similarly pragmatic. If it is under state regulatory authority, it will avoid the need to obtain local approval from each governmental unit through which the project will pass.

It merely holds an option to acquire a parcel of real property. That is insufficient. Even though the parcel is the planned location for part of the yet-to-be-built transmission system, having an option to buy something is not the same as owning or even controlling it.

Under a prior version of the Public Utilities Act, such an interpretation would have been valid. Section 10 of the Public Utilities Act of 1913 (Ill. Rev.

Several Commission orders are cited, including decisions from 1970, 2003, and 2007. Appellants contend that because the legislature has not amended section 8-406 of the Public Utilities Act ( 220 ILCS 5/8-406 (West 2012) ) in light of these orders, we should deem it to have acquiesced in the Commission's interpretation of the law. This argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \u00b6 44 While appellees point out some significant factual distinctions between the administrative proceedings cited by appellants and the situation before us here, appellants' argument suffers from an even more fundamental problem. Cases where we have referenced the \"acquiescence rule\" in the context of administrative action have involved situations involving consistently followed, long-standing administrative rules, regulations, or interpretations of ambiguous statutes.

These factors are not present here. With respect to the requirement of present ownership, control, operation, or management, the provisions of the Public Utilities Act relevant to the issuance of certificates of public convenience and necessity are not ambiguous, and the smattering of administrative decisions cited by appellants, to the extent that they bear any factual similarity to this case, can scarcely be said to represent a long-standing, consistent, and uniform construction of the law. We note, moreover, that acquiescence requires knowledge. We may presume that the legislature is aware of decisions we issue (\n   <em>\n    Kozak v.

This argument must also fail. The facts relevant to the question on which this appeal turns-Rock Island's lack of ownership, control, management, etc. of property as specified in section 3-105 of the Public Utilities Act at the time it sought certification from the Commission-are undisputed. The real disagreement concerns the construction of law. Where, as here, the historical facts are admitted or established but there is a\n   dispute as to whether the governing legal provisions were interpreted correctly by the administrative body, the case presents a purely legal question for which judicial review is\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Goodman v.

The language of section 3-105 ( 220 ILCS 5/3-105 (West 2012) ) stands in clear contrast to its predecessor in plainly and unambiguously requiring present ownership, management, or control of defined utility property or equipment in order to qualify as a public utility. Because only public utilities are eligible to receive certificates of public convenience and necessity under section 8-406 of the Public Utilities Act ( 220 ILCS 5/8-406 (West 2012) ) and because Rock Island cannot meet the ownership test necessary to qualify as a public utility, the Commission's order granting Rock Island a certificate of public convenience and necessity fails as a matter of law and cannot be sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 48 Echoing the \"Catch-22\" concerns expressed by the Commission's administrative law judge, appellants protest that interpreting section 3-105 of the Act ( 220 ILCS 5/3-105 (West 2012) ) to require present ownership of utility infrastructure assets will effectively bar new entrants from qualifying as public utilities and obtaining certificates of public convenience and necessity under section 8-406 of the Act ( 220 ILCS 5/8-406 (West 2012) ) so they may transact business as such. This concern is not well founded. Nothing in the Public Utilities Act prohibits new entrants such as Rock Island from commencing development of transmission lines immediately as a purely private project. So long as they do not transact business as a public utility, they will not be subject to the Public Utilities Act and will not require Commission authority to proceed. Once their projects are further underway and they have obtained the ownership, management, or control of utility-related property or equipment required to qualify as public utilities, they may then seek certification to operate as public utilities if they wish to conduct their business in a way that would make them subject to the Public Utilities Act's regulatory framework.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   \u00b6 49 Requiring new entrants to proceed in this way may make the initial phase of their operations more difficult and cumbersome. For example, they will not have the benefit of eminent domain to obtain the property on which their facilities will be located. In Rock Island's case, however, that particular problem should be no obstacle. As we have noted, the company has not sought, is not seeking, and represents that it may never ask for eminent domain power.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \u00b6 50 In any case, the fact that there may be barriers and significant costs to new\n   companies wishing to enter the state to establish a new public utility is in no way incompatible with the theory and operation of the Public Utilities Act. The Act, after all, is based on a model of limited monopoly and reflects a policy of preventing rather than promoting competition with existing utilities.\n   <em>\n    Gulf Transport Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2617004\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill/402/11/#p19\">\n    402 Ill. at 19-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=83%20N.E.2d%20336\">\n    83 N.E.2d 336\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . One may disagree with that model, but the wisdom of this state's regulatory system is a matter for the legislature, not our court. Of all the principles of statutory construction, few are more basic than that a court may not rewrite a statute to make it consistent with the court's own idea of orderliness and public policy.\n   <em>\n    Board of Education of Roxana Community School District No. 1 v.

Should the company elect to move forward with the project and reapply for a certificate of public necessity and convenience as a public utility once it moves beyond planning and actually owns, controls, operates, or manages transmission assets, the question of public use can be revisited under the facts and circumstances then present. Any ruling on the question now would be purely advisory. That being so, there is likewise no need to address appellants' argument that the appellate court's construction of the public use requirement imposes an impermissible burden on interstate commerce in violation of the commerce clause of the United States Constitution ( U.S. Const., art.

The company does not qualify as a public utility under Illinois law and was ineligible for a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the Commission. The appellate court was therefore correct when it reversed the Commission's order granting a certificate of public convenience and necessity to the company, and it properly remanded the cause to the Commission with directions to enter an order consistent with its opinion.
