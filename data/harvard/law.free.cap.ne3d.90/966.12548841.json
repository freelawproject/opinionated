(\"RPM\"), and Rust-Oleum Corporation (\"Rust-Oleum\") on appellants' claims under Ohio's Business Opportunity Plans Act (\"BOPA\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   breach of contract, and related theories of liability. We affirm the trial court's findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Summary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} RPM is a multinational holding company whose numerous subsidiaries include manufacturers of sealants, coatings, building materials, and specialty chemicals. Rust-Oleum is a direct subsidiary of nonparty RPM Consumer Holding Company, a direct subsidiary of RPM. Rust-Oleum manufactures specialty floor coating products, including the EpoxyShield floor coating products (\"Products\") involved in this case. ROSC was formed in 2005 as a direct subsidiary of nonparty Rust-Oleum International, L.L.C., which is a subsidiary of Rust-Oleum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In 2004, The Home Depot (\"Home Depot\") and Rust-Oleum developed a pilot program for Home Depot's At Home Service Program (\"HD Program\"). ROSC was formed in 2005 to provide the Products and installation services for the HD Program. The parties later formalized the arrangement in a 2008 contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Warner Industries, Inc. d.b.a. Stone-To-Foam (\"Warner/STF\") was incorporated in Ohio in 1996 to sell and install flooring and foam insulation to a national market. Warner/STF outsourced its product installation services to third-party independent contractors such as appellants. In 2008, due to fiscal difficulties, ROSC contracted with Warner/STF to provide installation of the Products for the HD Program. Shortly thereafter, Home Depot contracted directly with Warner/STF for installation of the Products.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The 15 appellants, small business owners, had dealer agreements with Warner/STF to sell, promote, and provide installation services for the Warner/STF's products. Thirteen of the 15 appellants\n   entered into additional agreements with Warner/STF to perform installation services for the HD Program Products.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In 2009, Home Depot decided to terminate the HD Program. The termination had a domino effect, as will be detailed later herein, and appellants' services were no longer needed. Appellants filed suit against RPM, Rust-Oleum, ROSC, Warner/STF, and Warner/STF owner Alan C. Warner. Home Depot is not a party to the action. According to the record, several appellants entered into settlement agreements with Home Depot. The Warner/STF parties were dismissed under Civ.R. 41(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. HD Program Pilot-Home Depot, Rust-Oleum, and ROSC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Rust-Oleum and Home Depot entered into an April 22, 2004 agreement to implement a pilot program to determine the potential viability of the HD Program. Under the pilot program, Rust-Oleum would supply the Products to Home Depot and provide installation services to Home Depot's customers. ROSC was formed in furtherance of this effort.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The term of the agreement was for six months, identified Rust-Oleum as an independent contractor, and specified that the relationship was not one of \"franchisor-franchisee,\" or \"partner, joint venture, fiduciary or co-employer.\" Each party disclaimed authority to bind the other. The agreement was executed by Ed Voorhees, vice-president of sales, and Rust-Oleum Brands Company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Program Agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    1. October 11, 2007 Home Depot and ROSC Service Provider Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 9} The October 11, 2007 Home Depot Service Provider Agreement (\"HD-ROSC SPA\") formalized the pilot program. The agreement includes a \"service provider classification\" that indicates ROSC's role is to \"sell, furnish and install.\" ROSC's employees, agents and subcontractors are to provide \"services, products and/or materials\" to Home Depot's customers. The term of the agreement is for one year and automatically renews. The agreement is terminable for convenience by either party at any time upon 90 days written notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 10} ROSC is an independent contractor under the agreement. ROSC's obligations include compliance with Home Depot's Service Provider Reference Guide. William Spaulding (\"Spaulding\") signed the agreement as vice-president and general manager of ROSC. Spaulding was also vice-president of consumer sales for Rust-Oleum who explained that he was authorized to sign for ROSC and Rust-Oleum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    2. March 1, 2008\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    ROSC and Warner/STF Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On March 1, 2008, ROSC and Warner/STF entered into an agreement that references the service provider agreement between Home Depot and ROSC. ROSC agreed to \"sell, furnish, and install services for garage floor coatings and installations\" for \"the [HD] Program.\" Warner/STF, an independent contractor pursuant to the agreement, agreed to provide installation of the Products through its independent contractors such as appellants. Warner/STF also agreed to be bound by the terms of the HD Program,\n   attached as exhibits to the agreement. The agreement was terminable at-will by either party upon 90 days prior written notice. The agreement was also signed by Spaulding on behalf of ROSC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    a. ROSC and Warner/STF Program Letter\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 12} An April 1, 2008, a public announcement in the form of a \"To Whom It May Concern\" letter was issued by \"Paul Kiminski, New Business Development, Rust-Oleum Service Company\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Rust-Oleum Service Company has a national contract with The Home Depot to exclusively install Garage Floor Coatings. Rust-Oleum also offers two other programs through The Home Depot that will be offered to Stone to Foam [Warner/STF] through The Home Depot partnership: water-based concrete stains and garage storage [and] organization.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   Rust-Oleum's goal is to bring best in class products to Stone to Foam's dealers, offer training, and support in all areas. Rust-Oleum is looking forward to an excellent partnership with [Warner/STF].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    3. June 1, 2008 Home Depot and Warner/STF Service Provider Agreement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 13} On June 1, 2008, Home Depot and Warner/STF entered into a service provider agreement for the HD Program (\"HD-Warner/STF SPA\"). Warner/STF agreed to provide installation services for the Products under the HD Program. Warner/STF was required to \"source\" the Products, arrange for pick up and delivery of the Products and materials to Home Depot's customer's home for installation at the beginning of the job, and maintain required records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Warner/STF was listed as an independent contractor and the agreement is nonexclusive. The agreement was terminable at-will by either party upon 90 days prior written notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Warner/STF and Appellants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Between 2006 and 2009, appellants entered into dealer contracts with Warner/STF to sell Warner/STF's products and provide related services. In 2008 and 2009, 13 appellants also signed service agreements with Warner/STF that are specific to the HD Program installation services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 16} As exemplars of the standard agreement terms employed by Warner/STF, we summarize the October 3, 2006 dealer contract between Warner/STF and appellant GarCo (\"GarCo\"), and the July 31, 2009 dealer and service contracts for appellant Old Town Painting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    a. GarCo Dealer Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 17} The 2006 GarCo agreement established GarCo as a \"Dealer\" to provide services and products exclusively on behalf of Warner/STF in a specific market area. GarCo is required to meet a minimum purchase quota, purchase certain equipment from Warner/STF, pay fees for training, and pay a dealership fee to Warner/STF exceeding $60,000. The contract is for a ten-year term. Jerry Garcia testified to providing services under the dealer agreement for the HD Program, but did not sign a second agreement specifically relating to the HD Program. Home Depot, the HD Program, Rust-Oleum, and ROSC are not referenced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Old Town Painting Contracts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    (I) Dealer Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The Old Town Painting (\"Old Time\") dealer contract is similar in material respects to the GarCo contract. It establishes Old Town as a \"Dealer\" for Warner/STF to sell and promote Warner/STF's products and services. The relationship\n   between the parties is \"vendor and vendee.\" The contract includes a minimum quota for purchases of Warner/STF's products and services, has a ten-year term, includes a two-year noncompete clause, and references the scope and costs of training requirements, equipment costs, and payment of a dealership purchase fee of over $30,000. Home Depot, ROSC, and Rust-Oleum are not referenced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    (ii) Contract for Services\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   {\u00b6 19} The contract for services, entered into the same date as the dealer contract, also identifies Old Town as a \"Dealer.\" The contract states that Warner/STF \"has entered into a contract\" with Home Depot and Rust-Oleum\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   to \"furnish some or all of the Services\" listed in the contract. The services are described in Section I as: \"sales and installation [of] products and services, floor coatings, garage cabinetry [and] modular garage flooring.\" Warner/STF \"desires to contract such Services to a qualified Independent Dealer.\" The Dealer agrees to \"perform such Services as a Dealer\" for Warner/STF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 20} In Section 5 of the contract, the Dealer indemnifies Warner/STF, Home Depot, and Rust-Oleum for mechanic's liens. Section 6 specifies that the Dealer \"is an independent Dealer and not an agent, employee, partner, joint venture, or franchisee of [Warner/STF].\" The termination clause provides that the contract automatically terminates if the Warner/STF \"Agreement with Home Depot is terminated, regardless of the reason for such termination.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 21} \"Workmanship is to be free from defects in accordance with Rust-Oleum/Home Depot requirements\" as well as \"the specific instructions of the retail contract.\" The Dealer promises to provide \"sales and installation services\" for the listed Home Depot store locations. The remaining contract provisions set forth the Dealer's obligations to Warner/STF, to meet Home Depot's service requirements. The attached product warranty sheet is issued by ROSC. Home Depot, Rust-Oleum, and ROSC are not parties to the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Program Termination\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 22} On November 24, 2009, Home Depot issued a termination notice to Warner/STF, effective February 24, 2010. The termination had the domino effect of terminating the appellants' related agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Lawsuit\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 23} A series of lawsuits was filed by the appellants between 2010 and 2013, asserting common causes of action:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   <em>\n    Sam's Painting LLC and Samuel Kearse v.

No. CV-10-733355. Appellants assert damages in excess of $100 million.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 24} Appellants contend that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   ROSC acted as agent of the RPM Group and it formed a joint venture between the RPM Group and Warner/STF. Based on these legal relationships, the RPM Group is liable under three distinct legal theories[:]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (1) because the Joint Venture breached Dealer Agreements with Appellants,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (2) because appellants were third-party beneficiaries of the March 2008 Contract, and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (3) because the Joint Venture did not provide appellants with disclosures required by Ohio's Business Opportunity Purchasers Protection Act, R.C. 1334.01, et seq. (\"BOPA\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Home Depot is not named as a defendant. Warner/STF and/or Allen C. Warner have failed to enter an appearance and, on August 5, 2016, appellants dismissed the action against them under Civ.R. 41(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    A. RPM and Rust-Oleum Motions for Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 26} On February 22, 2016, appellees RPM and Rust-Oleum filed three motions for summary judgment. Separate motions were filed to simplify management of the issues for the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Motion One-General Claims for All Appellants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 27} The first motion defended claims common to all appellants. Appellees argued that appellants' breach of contract claims fails because there were no contracts between appellees and appellants. Appellees also argued that the claims are barred by the statute of frauds, and the negligence claims are barred by the economic loss doctrine. In addition, appellees asserted that appellants could not cite any duties owed by appellees to appellants that had been breached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Appellees refuted the existence of a joint venture and argued that, because appellants could not establish that any company served as the alter ego of Rust-Oleum or RPM, there was no evidence that could be used to pierce the corporate veil. Appellees denied that appellants could demonstrate privity of contract and refuted appellants' third-party beneficiary claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Motion Two-BOPA Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 29} The second motion focused on BOPA. Appellees asserted appellees did not meet BOPA's definition of a seller. Appellees also argued that certain appellants were excluded by BOPA's statutory definitions because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   Eleven appellants were engaged in ongoing businesses prior to purchasing their alleged Warner/STF business opportunity plans, rendering the Act inapplicable pursuant to an express statutory exception ( R.C. 1334.12(J) );\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Four appellants paid $50,000 or more for their alleged Warner/STF dealerships, so they do not meet the Act's definition of \"business opportunity plan\" ( R.C. 1334.01(D)(2) ); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Appellant Garcia/GarCo acquired his/its alleged Warner/STF dealership in 2006, nearly two years before getting involved in the Home Depot-related floor installation program at issue in this lawsuit ( R.C. 1334.01(A) ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Motion Three-Lost Profits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 30} The third motion addressed lost profits. Appellees asserted that appellants were barred from recovery due to: (1) the contractual limitation of liability clause; (2) the speculative nature of the claim; and (3) the unavailability of lost profits under BOPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Trial Court's Findings on Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 31} The trial court entertained hearings on the motions for two days, including the submission of more than 500 exhibits. Appellants decided to withdraw the tort claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 32} On April 21, 2016, the trial court entered judgment for RPM and Rust-Oleum, finding that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (1) there were no written contracts between appellants and RPM, Rust-Oleum or ROSC;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (2) appellants failed to identify what terms were breached;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   (3) appellants failed to establish third-party beneficiary status;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   (4) the Warner/STF and ROSC contract identified Warner/STF as an independent contractor, and the terms did not establish an equal right of control or contain other indicators of a joint venture or agent-principal arrangement; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   (5) ROSC's status as a wholly owned subsidiary of Rust-Oleum with separate assets, payroll, and employees did not support piercing the corporate veil to impute liability to Rust-Oleum and RPM.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Appellants filed the instant appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Appellant present three assignments of error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   I. The trial court erred by granting RPM's motion for summary judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   II. The trial court erred by granting Rust-Oleum's motion for summary judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   III. The trial court erred by granting ROSC's motion for summary judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
