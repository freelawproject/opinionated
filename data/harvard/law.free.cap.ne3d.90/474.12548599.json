She appealed her conviction. We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   \u00b6 2 FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 3 Defendant Elizabeth Clark pleaded guilty to burglary and unlawful use of a debit card and was sentenced to a term of 30 months' probation with a drug treatment requirement. Clark violated her probation and it was revoked. The trial court resentenced her to another term of 30 months' probation and 74 days in jail. She again violated the probation terms and admitted the allegations of probation violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 4 In January 2014, the trial court released Clark on a $50,000 temporary recognizance bond. The trial court's order included a number of conditions and provided that Clark \"be released from custody\" on January 10 \"in the custody\" of her father to attend substance abuse treatment at an inpatient facility. The order also required Clark to submit to a urine test \"immediately upon returning to custody.\" She successfully completed treatment, and in February 2014, the trial court modified the conditions of her bond. Its order stated that upon her release from treatment, Clark \"shall enter directly\" into an extended residential care halfway house. Under the modified bond conditions, Clark was able to leave the halfway house for employment, medical needs, and 12-step meetings. The order further provided that Clark, upon release or discharge from the halfway house, was to \"immediately return to the custody of Whiteside County Jail, using the most direct route of travel and without delay or departure therefrom.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 5 On June 5, 2014, Clark left the halfway house and failed to report to the jail. That same day, the State filed an application to increase Clark's bond, and the trial court issued a warrant in the amount of $50,000. The State filed an information on June 6, 2014, charging Clark with escape based on section 31-6(a) of the Criminal Code of 2012 (Criminal Code) ( 720 ILCS 5/31-6(a) (West 2014)). The information alleged that Clark, having been convicted of the felony offenses of burglary and unlawful use of a debit card, failed to report to the jail on June 6, 2014, as required under terms of her recognizance bond. On June 16, 2014, Clark turned herself into the Whiteside County jail, where the warrant was served.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 6 A stipulated bench trial took place in September 2014. A statement of facts was entered into evidence consistent with the facts as stated above. The facts also included Clark's admission that she did not immediately report to the jail after leaving the halfway house, although she was aware she was required to do so. The trial court found Clark guilty of escape, stating that per the terms of her recognizance bond, she was required to return immediately to the Whiteside County jail after discharge from the halfway house. The trial court further stated that Clark had been convicted of burglary and unlawful use of a debit card and was awaiting sentencing on those offenses. The trial court denied Clark's motion for a new trial and sentenced her to a 30-month term of probation. Clark appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 7 ANALYSIS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 8 The issue on appeal is whether Clark was proved guilty of escape beyond a reasonable doubt. Clark argues that she violated the terms of her bond but was not guilty of the offense of escape. She asserts that the escape statute does not apply because she was not in custody when she failed to report as ordered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 9 The State is required to prove the elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    People v.

The court's initial order stated Clark was released from custody to her father for transport to treatment. After her bond was modified following her successful completion of the treatment program, the court did not require that either jail or court personnel transport her to the halfway house. The modified bond conditions allowed Clark to leave the facility for various reasons, including work, medical needs, and 12-step meetings during her time there. The order did not require her movements be monitored by court or jail employees and they were not ordered to be involved in her return to the jail. The order stated that Clark was to \"return to the custody\" of the jail.
