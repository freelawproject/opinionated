For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial court's judgment, in part, and reverse, in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Sixty-seven-year-old Ronald Spitulski was employed by the Board of Education (\"the Board\") of the Toledo City School District (\"the District\") for nearly 25 years, most recently as a supervisor of the pupil personnel center. He was responsible for conducting suspension appeal and expulsion hearings. He reported to Heather Baker, the director of pupil placement and child adjustment services, and Baker reported to James Gault, then the chief academic officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Issues arise with Spitulski's work performance.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Between November of 2012, and May of 2013, Baker received complaints that Spitulski had acted unprofessionally in his treatment of a non-attorney \"parent advocate,\" several parents, and a character witness. In addition to this, on May 8, 2013, Spitulski admitted to Baker that he lost almost a year's worth of digitally-recorded hearings that he conducted during the 2012-2013 school year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The CBA outlines the disciplinary process.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Spitulski was an administrative employee of the Board, and as such, was a member of the Toledo Association of Administrative Personnel (\"TAAP\"). TAAP and the Board are parties to a collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\"). The CBA provides procedures for addressing disciplinary concerns. Those procedures call for progressive discipline where appropriate, and they set forth a three-step disciplinary process: (1) an informal level, (2) a continuing disciplinary investigation (\"CDI\"), and (3) a CDI report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Under step one, an administrator who wishes to informally discuss a matter which may lead to a CDI must consult with her supervisor and notify the employee and TAAP in writing on a prescribed form known as \"a buff sheet.\" The buff sheet must describe (1) the conduct in question, (2) the date, time, and place of the meeting requested, and (3) the right of the employee to have a TAAP representative present. Under the CBA, every effort must be made to resolve matters at the informal level. If the matter is resolved, a record of the meeting and the prescribed resolution must be placed in the employee's personnel file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 6} If the matter is not resolved at step one, or if it is a \"serious matter,\" step two provides for a CDI, also referred to as \"a hearing on the record.\" The supervising administrator or TAAP may submit a written request to the personnel office for a CDI within 10 days from knowledge of the serious matter, or within five working days from the date of the informal meeting. A TAAP representative shall be permitted to be present for a CDI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Finally, under step three, a CDI report is generated. A designated human resources representative may hear testimony, examine witnesses, and review all relevant material pertaining to the CDI. He or she must then issue a report to the superintendent (or his designee), who must render a decision or recommend action to the Board. A copy of the superintendent or Board's decision must be sent to all parties concerned and placed in the employee's file. The employee may submit a written response which shall be attached to the decision. The employee or TAAP may then appeal from the decision. If the decision is to terminate the employee's contract, such termination must comply with Article VII, section A of the CBA. This provision of the CBA requires compliance with the Ohio\n   Revised Code, including R.C. 3319.16, relating to the termination of a contract by a board of education.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 8} The CBA makes clear that an employee whose conduct is the subject of investigation is entitled to (1) timely and adequate notice of the conduct complained of on a prescribed form, (2) reasonable time to prepare a response, (3) representation by the TAAP; and (4) other reasonable procedures affording due process. If an investigation is not performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the CBA, it cannot be considered part of the employee's personnel file, and neither the fact of the investigation nor statements made during the investigation may be used in any subsequent Board proceeding. The CBA also specifies that while progressive discipline must be followed where appropriate-providing written warnings and suspensions in lieu of termination-a written warning is not always required and immediate termination may be appropriate in cases of serious misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Baker initiates the disciplinary process.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On May 23, 2013, Baker emailed Gault requesting a hearing on the record for Spitulski. She cited the following reasons for requesting the hearing: (1) failure to perform job duties, (2) failure to maintain professional relationships and behavior with parents and students, and (3) insubordination. On May 31, 2013, Gault contacted the District's chief human resources officer to request a hearing. He cited the following reasons for his request: (1) violation of licensure code of professional conduct for Ohio educators, (2) violation of board policy section G: Personnel; Title; Staff-Student Relations, (3) failure to perform job duties, and (4) insubordination. He further elaborated as to the conduct giving rise to his request as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Used inappropriate language during a suspension hearing for a student.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   Acted in a very unprofessional way towards parents in hearings and while scheduling hearings. Several parents have refused to allow him to hear their cases because they felt he was rude, unprofessional, and unfair. These cases had to be heard by an alternate hearing officer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   He has failed to maintain accurate hearing records or hearing dispositions. Parent and school personnel have verified that one particular disposition was incorrect and was not what was presented in the hearing. When questioned about it, he refused to adjust it, stating it was correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Upon request, Ron was unable to supply any audio hearing tapes from any hearings held in his office this school year up until the month of April. He states he is unsure of what happened to them. This is in violation of Ohio Revised Code 9.69 [sic].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 10} A hearing on the record took place on August 19, 2013. Gault presented the case to the District's hearing officer, Annmarie Heldt, and Baker and Spitulski testified. On September 9, 2013, Heldt issued a written recommendation to the Board, recommending that Spitulski be terminated. The District's chief human resource officer, Cheryl Spieldenner, recommended that Heldt's recommendation be upheld.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    D. The Board terminates Spitulski's employment.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 11} On October 4, 2013, the District's treasurer provided written notice under R.C. 3319.16 of its intent to terminate Spitulski's employment. Spitulski submitted a written request for arbitration to be conducted by an independent referee, and the Board invoked the hearing procedures provided\n   in R.C. 3319.16. The Ohio Department of Education appointed a neutral referee, attorney James Gucker. On May 5 and 6, 2014, Gucker considered evidence and heard testimony from a number of witnesses. On August 14, 2014, he issued a recommendation to the Board concluding that \"good and just cause\" did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   exist to terminate Spitulski's employment agreement. Notwithstanding the referee's recommendation, the Board passed a resolution on December 16, 2014, terminating Spitulski's employment contract. The contract otherwise would have expired on July 31, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Spitulski seeks recourse.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Spitulski dually filed a charge of discrimination with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission (\"OCRC\") and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") in September of 2013, alleging gender, disability, and age discrimination. He later sought permission to withdraw the charge so he could pursue the matter in the common pleas court. The OCRC granted his request on July 17, 2014. On January 13, 2015, following the Board's termination of his employment contract, Spitulski filed a complaint against the Board, Gault, and Baker alleging eight claims: (1) termination without good and just cause in violation of R.C. 3319.16 ; (2) tortious violation of rights; (3) age discrimination; (4) disability discrimination; (5) retaliation in violation of R.C. 4112.02(I) ; (6) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (7) false light invasion of privacy; and (8) intentional interference with business relationship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Relevant to the present appeal, Spitulski alleged in his complaint that Gault instructed Baker to \"marshal evidence to use in terminating Spitulski,\" and that Baker, at Gault's instruction, began creating documentation designed to lead to his discharge. Spitulski said that Baker told him \"They're asking me when you're going to retire,\" and \"you've got too much gray hair.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   And he claimed that the District tried to coerce him into signing an unlawful retirement agreement. He also alleged that after filing his OCRC charge, the District threatened to convert his paid suspension to an unpaid suspension, and that it rejected the independent referee's recommendation in retaliation for having filed the OCRC charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In an order dated May 29, 2015, the trial court dismissed counts two and eight of Spitulski's complaint. It dismissed count one in an order dated September 10, 2015. In an order dated February 3, 2016, it dismissed Spitulski's claim for punitive damages and attorney's fees. And in an order dated October 3, 2016, it dismissed counts four and seven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 15} In its October 3, 2016 judgment, the trial court denied summary judgment as to counts three (age discrimination), five (retaliation), and six (intentional infliction of emotional distress) of the complaint. In doing so, it rejected Gault and Baker's assertions that they were statutorily immune from liability under R.C. 2744.01 et seq. as employees of a political subdivision. Gault and Baker's present appeal is limited to this immunity determination by the trial court. They assign error as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   1. The Lucas County Court of Common Pleas erred in concluding that Appellant, James Gault and Heather Baker, are not immune from liability as to Plaintiff's claim of age discrimination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   2. The Lucas County Court of Common Pleas erred in concluding that Appellant, James Gault and Heather Baker, are not immune from liability as to Plaintiff's retaliation claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   3. The Lucas County Court of Common Pleas erred in concluding that Appellant, James Gault and Heather Baker, are not immune from liability as to Plaintiff's claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The parties' arguments.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   {\u00b6 24} In their first assignment of error, Gault and Baker insist that they are entitled to immunity as to Spitulski's age discrimination claims because \" R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(a) and (b) require an extreme level of self-interested misconduct to overcome a political subdivision employee's immunity.\" They deny that their conduct rises to this level. They urge that they were merely performing their job duties in response to multiple complaints from parents and guardians and Spitulski's unexplained loss of nearly a year's worth of recorded hearings. They further claim that for purposes of R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(c), civil liability is not \"expressly imposed\" under R.C. 4112.01(A)(2) and R.C. 4112.02(A) so as to defeat immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   {\u00b6 25} In their second assignment of error, Gault and Baker claim that they are entitled to immunity concerning Spitulski's retaliation claim based on the undisputed timing of their involvement relative to Spitulski filing his September 2013 OCRC charge. Specifically, they claim that aside from testifying at the referee hearing in May of 2014, Baker's involvement ended when she testified at the hearing on the record in August of 2013, and they maintain that there is no evidence of when or if Baker even learned of the OCRC charge. With respect to Gault, they claim that his involvement ended on October 4, 2013, when the District issued its notice of intent to terminate Spitulski, and even then, his involvement between September 2013 and October 4, 2013, was limited to recommending that the District follow through with issuing notice of intent to terminate based on the hearing officer's recommendation. They claim that everything after October 4, 2013, was governed by the statutorily-mandated process set forth in R.C. 3319.16, and under that statute, the Board members were solely responsible for the December 2014 decision to terminate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Finally, in their third assignment of error, Gault and Baker claim that they are entitled to immunity on Spitulski's claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress because R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(c) is inapplicable, and under R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(a) and (b), Spitulski cannot show that they acted outside the scope of their employment or maliciously, in bad faith, or wantonly and recklessly. They maintain that the complaints giving rise to disciplinary action came from parents, guardians, relatives, or supporters of the District's students-not from Baker or Gault themselves. They insist that Baker merely listened, documented, and reported the complaints up the chain of command to Gault (along with the information that Spitulski admittedly lost months' worth of recorded hearings); requested a hearing on the record; and obtained statements from the complaining parties. Gault merely arranged for the hearing and presented the evidence to the District hearing officer. Others made the decisions after this point. They claim that reasonable minds can conclude only that they acted, or attempted to act, in good faith in fulfilling their job duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 27} In response, Spitulski first argues that Baker and Gault lack statutory immunity under R.C. 2744.09(B) to the extent that they were sued in their official capacities. With respect to R.C. 2744.03(A)(6), Spitulski does not argue on appeal that R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(a) or (c) bars Gault and Baker's claims of immunity. He argues only that their acts were committed with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or wantonly or recklessly under R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Spitulski further contends that in the arguments in support of their assignments of error, Baker and Gault improperly address the merits of his claims. He insists that \"[n]owhere in R.C. 2744.03(A)(6) does it state that immunity centers upon the validity of the civil claim.\" He, therefore, identifies a number of \"fact issues\" that purportedly call into question whether Baker and Gault's conduct negated their claim of immunity under R.C. 2744.03(A)(6)(b) :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   \u2022 Whether Baker's emails of May 8, 2013, reflect that she was using Spitulski as a scapegoat to preserve her own reputation because she was concerned that Spitulski's \"inadvertent mislocation\" of recordings had put them in \"an ugly situation;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \u2022 Whether the true reason for the CDI was because Spitulski had \"too much gray hair\" and \"they\" wanted him to retire;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   \u2022 Whether Baker deprived Spitulski of due process and his contractual right to progressive discipline by failing to issue buff sheets relating to five of the complaints against him and his \"mislocation\" of the recordings;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   \u2022 Whether Baker purposely failed to properly investigate five complaints by not discussing them with Spitulski;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \u2022 Whether Gault deprived Spitulski of the due process right to confront his accusers by using their written statements at the CDI;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   \u2022 Whether Gault made an untimely request for the CDI hearing;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \u2022 Whether Baker falsely told Heldt that Spitulski violated FERPA and Gault falsely informed Heldt that Spitulski violated the non-existent R.C. 9.69;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   \u2022 Whether at the R.C. 3319.16 hearing, Baker and Gault exceeded the grounds for termination by prosecuting him with events \"not encompassed by the notice of such grounds;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \u2022 Whether Baker and Gault prosecuted him at the CDI and R.C. 3319.16 hearings with \"contractually illicit documents;\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \u2022 Whether Gault improperly relied on prior discipline and attempted to rely on an inapplicable Board policy; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   \u2022 Whether Gault's recommendation caused the Board to reject the referee's report following receipt of the OCRC notice of right to sue.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Our analysis.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 29} The trial court found that \"the record evidence and applicable law lead to the conclusion that Baker and Gault are not immune from liability because there was a sufficient causal link between their discriminatory words and actions and the Board's decision to terminate Spitulski.\" It never identified which, if any, R.C. 2744.03(A)(6) factor negated Gault and Baker's claim of immunity. Spitulski argues that provision (b) operates to negate Baker and Gault's statutory immunity. He does not argue that (a) or (c) apply. We, therefore, limit our discussion to this particular exception to statutory immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 30} As Spitulski points out, our review of this appeal is limited to the trial court's immunity determination.\n   <em>\n    Coterel v.

Having said this, we cannot simply disregard the relationship between the questions of fact identified by Spitulski and the nature of the claims that remain pending in the trial court. We must to some extent consider how the purported questions of fact relate to the remaining claims. The only claims that remain viable are Spitulski's age discrimination, retaliation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims. All his other claims were disposed of on summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 32} As to Spitulski's age discrimination claim, the trial court denied summary judgment because it found that Baker's questions about when he was going to retire and her statement that the district wanted to discharge him because he had too much gray hair created an issue of fact as to whether the action taken against\n   Spitulski was motivated by age animosity. As to Spitulski's retaliation claim, the trial court pointed to action taken by Spieldenner-not Baker or Gault-as creating an issue of fact as to whether the Board took action against him in retaliation for engaging in protected activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   And as to the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, the trial court cited alleged abuses of power by Baker and Gault during the disciplinary proceedings as creating questions of fact precluding summary judgment on the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Generally, issues regarding malice, bad faith, and wanton or reckless behavior are questions presented to the jury.\n   <em>\n    Schoenfield\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1048461\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/164/571/\">\n    164 Ohio App.3d 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005-Ohio-6407\">\n    2005-Ohio-6407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=843%20N.E.2d%20234\">\n    843 N.E.2d 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 24.

As to the age discrimination claim, while only Baker's statements were identified by the trial court in addressing the facts specific to that claim, the trial court pointed to evidence of Gault's participation in the proceedings leading to Spitulski's discharge in support of its decision to deny summary judgment to Baker and Gault individually. We, therefore, find that neither Baker nor Gault is entitled to statutory immunity as to Spitulski's age discrimination claim because there exists a question of fact as to whether they acted with malice, in bad faith, wantonly, or recklessly in pursuing disciplinary proceedings against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 35} Finally, we address Spitulski's argument that Baker and Gault lack statutory immunity under R.C. 2744.09(B) because they were sued both as individuals and \"in their official capacities.\" Ohio case law recognizes that \" R.C. 2744.09(B) removes immunity only as to the political subdivision and does not remove immunity from the employees of political subdivisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Kravetz v.
