We hold that a government agency may rely on this exemption only if the agency establishes (1) that an express promise of confidentiality was made to the source, or (2) that the\n   circumstances of the particular case are such that the confidentiality of the source or information can be reasonably inferred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Here, the Second Department applied the wrong standard when it held that the District Attorney of Nassau County properly denied petitioner Jesse Friedman's FOIL request for records relating to his conviction. The Court relied on its precedent that identifying information and statements gathered in the course of a police investigation from witnesses who do not testify at trial are presumptively confidential and, as such, are exempt from disclosure under FOIL. No other Appellate Division Department has adopted this interpretation of section 87(2)(e)(iii). Rather, the other Departments have properly required some express or implied assurance of confidentiality to justify withholding information, including the names or identities of sources. The federal courts have required a similar showing under the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We conclude that the Second Department misinterpreted section 87(2)(e)(iii), and respondent's denial of petitioner's FOIL request must be analyzed under the proper standard as set forth in this opinion. Therefore, we now reverse the Appellate Division order and remit the matter to Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This appeal is the latest in petitioner's efforts to overturn his decades-old child sex crime convictions. In this litigation, petitioner seeks information in the control of the Nassau County District Attorney's Office, including the victim statements and other information gathered during police interviews of child witnesses. Petitioner argues that this material is necessary to establish his claim of actual innocence. Before turning to the legal issues, we briefly summarize the events that led to petitioner's conviction and the procedural history of the matter before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    A.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 1987, then 18-year-old petitioner and his father were arrested on multiple counts of sexual abuse of several children between the ages of 8 and 12. According to the charges contained in the three indictments filed against petitioner, the abuse occurred over five years while the children attended an after-school computer class taught by petitioner's father at their family home. There was no forensic evidence of physical abuse and the prosecution relied heavily on the children's allegations made after questioning by the police, who employed tactics and interview techniques that the District Attorney concedes were \"not ideal\" and are no longer in use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Petitioner's father pleaded guilty to numerous sex crimes in 1988 and died in prison in 1995. A few months after his father's plea, petitioner also pleaded guilty to various sex crimes, and was sentenced to multiple concurrent terms with a maximum range of 6 to 18 years of incarceration. Petitioner did not appeal, and, after serving 13 years of his sentence, was paroled in December 2001.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    B.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Approximately one year after petitioner was paroled, the film \"Capturing the Friedmans\" was released. The movie suggested that the police had elicited witness statements using investigatory techniques that were unreliable or known to produce false testimony-including, in the case of one witness, hypnosis -and that petitioner was wrongfully convicted and actually innocent. The filmmaker had interviewed many of those involved in the original investigation, including detectives, attorneys, family members, and victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Based on new information petitioner learned from the film, he commenced the first of several state and federal court\n   proceedings. In 2004, petitioner moved unsuccessfully in state court to vacate his conviction. The Appellate Division denied him leave to appeal, and a Judge of this Court dismissed his application for leave to appeal (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20N.Y.3d%20894\">\n    6 N.Y.3d 894\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=817%20N.Y.S.2d%20629\">\n    817 N.Y.S.2d 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=850%20N.E.2d%20676\">\n    850 N.E.2d 676\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2006] ). Petitioner subsequently petitioned for a writ of habeas corpus in federal court, claiming, among other things, that he would not have pleaded guilty if he had known the details of the flawed investigatory procedures used to build the case against him. Petitioner asserted that he only learned about these methods from the filmmaker, who provided access to his materials including unredacted tapes and complete transcripts of witness interviews.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The federal district court dismissed the habeas petition as untimely, and the Second Circuit affirmed, also concluding that the proceeding was time-barred (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friedman v. Rehal,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775952\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/618/142/#p152\">\n    618 F.3d 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 152 [2d Cir.2010] ). The court's opinion, however, included an extensive discussion highlighting the judges' concerns with the process leading to petitioner's conviction. The court noted that \"[t]he magnitude of the allegations against petitioner must be viewed in the context of the late-1980's and early-1990's, a period in which allegations of outrageously bizarre and often ritualistic child abuse spread like wildfire across the country\" (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775952\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/618/142/#p152\">\n    618 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   155 ). This \"[v]ast moral panic fueled a series of highly-questionable child sex abuse prosecutions,\" based largely \"on memories that alleged victims 'recovered' through suggestive memory recovery tactics\" and investigatory techniques that, \"[t]he prevailing view\" now holds, \"are [in the vast majority of cases] false\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775952\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/618/142/#p152\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 155-156 ). The court observed that between 1984 and 1995 \"seventy-two individuals were convicted in nearly a dozen major child sex abuse and satanic ritual prosecutions,\" but \"almost all th[ose] convictions have since been reversed\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775952\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/618/142/#p152\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 156 ). The instant case was \"merely one example\" of that \"significant national trend,\" as it featured many of the same allegations, investigatory techniques, and developmental patterns seen across the country (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775952\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/618/142/#p152\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 158 ). The court intended that its \"lengthy discussion of the facts and circumstances that Friedman asserts led to his conviction\" would \"make the case that a further inquiry by a responsible prosecutor's office is justified despite a guilty plea entered under circumstances which clearly suggest that it was not voluntary\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775952\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/618/142/#p152\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775952\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/618/142/#p152\">\n    at 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [internal quotation marks omitted] ). The court ultimately concluded that \"[t]he record here suggests a reasonable likelihood that Jesse Friedman was\n   wrongfully convicted\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775952\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/618/142/#p152\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775952\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/618/142/#p152\">\n    at 159-160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [internal quotation marks omitted] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    C.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the Second Circuit issued its decision, then-Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen M. Rice announced she would reopen the case and convene a \"Friedman Case Review Panel\" to oversee the reinvestigation. Senior prosecutors in the Nassau County District Attorney's Office, who were not involved in the original case nor part of the prior administration that prosecuted petitioner, worked alongside an \"Advisory Panel\" of criminal justice\n   and wrongful conviction experts. The reinvestigation was conducted by the \"Review Team\" of prosecutors, which had access to the District Attorney's entire case file as well as the grand jury minutes. The Advisory Panel advised the Review Team on \"process issues,\" counseling the prosecutors on how best to conduct a reinvestigation and generally auditing whether the Review Team was operating in good faith. The Advisory Panel did not itself conduct the reinvestigation or weigh the credibility of witnesses, and it had access only to those documents, some redacted, provided to it by the District Attorney's Office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In the Review Team's final report, it concluded that petitioner \"was not wrongfully convicted\" and that none of the Second Circuit's principal concerns were substantiated by the evidence. It distinguished the case from the moral panic cases of the 1980s and 1990s on the grounds that the allegations in the Friedman prosecution were plausible, the children involved were older, and petitioner had pleaded guilty. The Advisory Panel prefaced the report with its own statement that \"the conclusions expressed in the Review Team's Report are reasonable and supported by the evidence it cites.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In 2012, before completion of the report but after the District Attorney announced the appointment of the Advisory Panel, petitioner filed a FOIL request for all documents provided by the Nassau County District Attorney to the \"Friedman Case Review Panel\" and for all records concerning whether Advisory\n   Panel members were \"members of the general public for purposes of [FOIL] and Civil Rights Law \u00a7 50-b.\" By letter, the Nassau County District Attorney's Office denied the request based on multiple grounds: (1) Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(e)(iii), which, the letter claimed, exempted all \"statements of witnesses compiled for law enforcement purposes, unless the witnesses have testified at trial\"; (2) Civil Rights Law \u00a7 50-b (1) (as applied to FOIL through Public Officers Law \u00a7 87[2][a] ), which exempts from disclosure any document which \"tends to identify\" the victim of a sex crime; (3) Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(e)(i), which the District Attorney claimed exempted from disclosure information that would interfere with an ongoing criminal investigation;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (4) Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(g), which exempted most inter- and intra-agency materials.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The letter also informed petitioner that the District Attorney did not believe a compelling and particularized basis existed for disclosing the grand jury transcripts, but that petitioner could move for their release on those grounds in state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On his administrative appeal from the denial of his FOIL request, petitioner argued that courts had rejected the type of blanket exemptions claimed by the District Attorney. The FOIL Appeals Officer nevertheless upheld the asserted exemptions as sufficiently particular.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    D.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Petitioner subsequently commenced this proceeding pursuant to CPLR article 78 against respondent, Kathleen M. Rice, in her official capacity as the Nassau County District Attorney,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking disclosure of\n   his entire case file and the grand jury minutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The District Attorney responded that the court lacked jurisdiction and sought dismissal of the petition, asserting that\n   petitioner had not yet exhausted his administrative remedies since he had only requested documents shared with the Advisory Panel rather than his entire case file. As to what had been shared with the Advisory Panel, the District Attorney reasserted that the material was exempt from disclosure under FOIL and Civil Rights Law \u00a7 50-b (1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   By this time, the reinvestigation was complete and the Review Team had elected to disclose inter- and intra-agency communications, rendering moot two of the prior four FOIL grounds for withholding disclosure. The District Attorney nevertheless maintained that the remaining documents were exempt, relying on Civil Rights Law \u00a7 50-b (1) and the confidentiality exemption contained in Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(e)(iii).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As for the grand jury minutes, the District Attorney argued that petitioner had failed to demonstrate a particularized and compelling need for their release, as required under Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7 190.25(4)(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Supreme Court granted the petition and directed the District Attorney to provide petitioner with all documents and records in his case file, as well as the grand jury minutes, with the names of three witnesses redacted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to CPLR 5519(a), Supreme Court's judgment was stayed pending respondent's appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Thereafter, the Appellate Division reversed, denied the petition, and dismissed the proceeding, with one Justice dissenting (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358198\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/134/826/\">\n    134 A.D.3d 826\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358198\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/134/826/\">\n    20 N.Y.S.3d 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2d Dept.2015] ). The Court held that petitioner did not need to exhaust his administrative remedies, since it\n   was clear from the District Attorney's response to the initial FOIL request that further administrative proceedings would have been futile. On the merits, the Court concluded that the case file was appropriately withheld under section 87(2)(e)(iii), which, according to Second Department precedent, exempted from FOIL disclosure the statements of nontestifying witnesses as presumptively confidential. The Court further held that petitioner did not demonstrate a compelling\n   and particularized need for the grand jury minutes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As discussed in her thoroughly-written opinion, the dissenting Justice would have modified the judgment to direct the specific disclosure of the redacted materials provided to the Advisory Panel, as well as the case file, investigatory notes, and grand jury minutes, subject to the redaction of the names of the witnesses who had objected to the disclosure of their identities (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358198\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/134/826/\">\n    134 A.D.3d at 831-832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358198\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/134/826/\">\n    20 N.Y.S.3d 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [Barros, J., dissenting] ). According to the dissent, the District Attorney failed to support the withholding of the documents under section 87(2)(e)(iii). The dissent identified a split between the Second Department's interpretation, which applies this exemption to all witness statements obtained in the course of preparing for trial unless used in open court, and decisions of the First, Third, and Fourth Departments, as well as the federal courts, which only recognize the exemption where the government can show an express promise of confidentiality or circumstances from which confidentiality can be inferred (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358198\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/134/826/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358198\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/134/826/\">\n    at 832-836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358198\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad3d/134/826/\">\n    20 N.Y.S.3d 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). We granted petitioner leave to appeal (\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20N.Y.3d%20903\">\n    27 N.Y.3d 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201312864\">\n    2016 WL 1312864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [2016] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    II.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Petitioner argues that the Second Department's interpretation of FOIL impermissibly creates a blanket exemption for all nontestifying witnesses and thus misinterprets the statute and undermines its purpose. He claims that the Second Department deviates from the interpretation of this provision adopted by every other Department and the federal courts. Petitioner also asserts that he established a compelling and particularized need for the grand jury minutes and that he should be permitted access to the witness statements in his case file in accordance with Civil Rights Law \u00a7 50-b (2)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   We conclude that the Second Department applied an incorrect standard in determining the applicability of FOIL's\n   confidentiality exemption to petitioner's request. Under section 87(2)(e)(iii), sources and information may be withheld only upon a specific showing of an express promise of confidentiality to the source, or a finding that, under the circumstances of the particular case, the confidentiality of the source or information can be reasonably inferred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    A. Exhaustion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As a threshold matter, we reject respondent's argument that petitioner's claim for his entire case file is unreviewable because he did not include that specific demand in his FOIL request. Petitioner's FOIL request sought \"the documents provided by the Nassau County District Attorney to the entity known as the 'Friedman Case Review Panel.' \" That language tracks the District Attorney's earlier press release that four experts had been appointed to a \"Friedman Case Review Panel\" who would \"join prosecutors in review of\" petitioner's case, to \"work alongside\" her office and \"oversee the investigation.\" Here, taken in context and under the circumstances, petitioner's request reasonably described, and therefore clearly sought, all documents that would be part of the reinvestigation process called for by the District Attorney (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Public Officers Law \u00a7 89[3] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Even if that were not the case, under the particular circumstances presented here, petitioner does not have to restart the FOIL process anew. The general rule requiring a party to exhaust administrative remedies before seeking judicial\n   review of an agency's determination \"need not be followed ... when resort to an administrative remedy would be futile\" (\n   <em>\n    Watergate II Apts. v. Buffalo Sewer Auth.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2339200\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/46/52/#p57\">\n    46 N.Y.2d 52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 57,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=412%20N.Y.S.2d%20821\">\n    412 N.Y.S.2d 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=385%20N.E.2d%20560\">\n    385 N.E.2d 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1978] ). As every judge who has considered the matter properly concluded, the District Attorney's letter denying petitioner's FOIL request clearly established that respondent's office would not release any documents to petitioner from the Friedman case file absent a court order, rendering futile any further attempts at administrative review. The letter informed petitioner that the information he requested was only being shared with the Advisory Panel because its members had sworn an oath of confidentiality and were operating \"as an extension of [the prosecutor's] office.\" As a general matter, the letter went on, the documents he sought were \"not available to the general public,\" were \"confidential under Civil Rights Law \u00a7 50-b,\" and so were \"not available to you or others who seek them under FOIL.\" As a\n   member of the general public-which is, as we have long maintained, the status of anyone seeking documents under FOIL (\n   <em>\n    see Matter of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    John P. v. Whalen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1577624,2342153\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/54/89/\">\n    54 N.Y.2d 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 99,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1577624\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys2d/444/598/\">\n    444 N.Y.S.2d 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1577624\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nys2d/444/598/\">\n    429 N.E.2d 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [1981] [\"one who seeks access to records under the Freedom of Information Law (does so) as a member of the public\"] )-petitioner was never going to receive access to any of the documents he wanted from the District Attorney's office. In other words, since the District Attorney did not grant the Advisory Panel access to the entire unredacted case file, it follows that she similarly would have denied access to petitioner. Indeed, the District Attorney's unwavering position throughout this litigation has been that all information sought by petitioner should be subject to a blanket exemption from disclosure. Thus, even assuming any ambiguity in petitioner's FOIL request, an additional request for information provided specifically to the Review Team that was not disclosed to the Advisory Panel would have been futile.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   \"The exhaustion rule ... is not an inflexible one,\" and should be applied where it \"furthers the salutory goals of relieving the courts of the burden of deciding questions entrusted to an agency, preventing premature judicial interference [with the work of the agency,] and affording the agency the opportunity, in advance of possible judicial review, to prepare a record reflective of its 'expertise and judgment' \" (\n   <em>\n    Watergate II Apts.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2339200\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/46/52/#p57\">\n    46 N.Y.2d at 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=412%20N.Y.S.2d%20821\">\n    412 N.Y.S.2d 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=385%20N.E.2d%20560\">\n    385 N.E.2d 560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [citations omitted] ).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Those goals would not be served by mechanical application of the rule to petitioner's case.

Of particular note, this prior version of FOIL made no reference to confidential sources or confidential information. That is to say, under the plain language of that statute, \"investigatory files compiled for law enforcement purposes,\" including witness statements, could be withheld from\n   disclosure irrespective of the confidential nature of the information or its source. That section of the statute was amended in 1977, and replaced with the enumerated categories set forth today in Public Officers Law \u00a7 87(2)(e)(i)-(iv), including the exemption at issue here. The legislature thus discarded the broad protections from disclosure found in the previous version of FOIL and adopted discrete, limited exemptions, reaffirming the law's general policy of public access to government documents (\n   <em>\n    cf.

Instead, the amendments \"state[d] that all records ... are accessible unless specifically listed as deniable\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   [internal quotation marks omitted] ). Members of law enforcement objected to the bill for this very reason, observing that it replaced a presumption of nondisclosure and broad protections\n   for all materials gathered in the course of law enforcement investigations with a presumption of disclosure and a narrow set of exemptions for only certain kinds of law enforcement materials, which could be invoked at only certain times (\n   <em>\n    see e.g.\n   </em>\n   William G.

This we cannot do, because \"[i]n the construction of a statute, meaning and effect should be given to all its language, if possible, and words are not to be rejected as superfluous when it is practicable to give each a distinct and\n   separate meaning\" (McKinney's Cons.

If the legislature intended for the exemption to apply to the statements of all witnesses, or even just those who do not testify at trial, it would simply have stated as much. It did not, and instead used the word \"confidential\" to delineate the type of statements and sources not subject to FOIL disclosure. Given that \"the Legislature established a general policy of disclosure by enacting the Freedom of Information Law\" (\n   <em>\n    Matter of Fink,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4371434\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ny2d/47/567/#p571\">\n    47 N.Y.2d at 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=419%20N.Y.S.2d%20467\">\n    419 N.Y.S.2d 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=393%20N.E.2d%20463\">\n    393 N.E.2d 463\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ), we cannot undermine that policy by exempting a large category of information from FOIL in a manner inconsistent with the plain language of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Were we to construe the law otherwise, we would be creating an unjustified and impermissible precondition on disclosure. Under respondent's proposed rule, the only witness statements accessible under FOIL are statements that have already been made public in open court. In practice, this restricts access to witness statements under FOIL to statements that have already been disclosed at a trial. Nowhere does section 87(2)(e)(iii), however, so much as mention the need for prior public disclosure, whether at a trial or any other judicial proceeding, as a disclosure precondition. The legislature did not limit disclosure under FOIL to information released through post-hoc publication, and we decline to impose such a limitation ourselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Respondent alleges that its proposed categorical exemption is essential to encourage the cooperation of individuals who might otherwise refrain from disclosing confidential information if they knew that they could be identified as the source. This circular reasoning is unpersuasive since the law by its terms protects confidential sources (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Public Officers Law \u00a7 87[2][e] [iii] [exempting \"confidential source(s)\" from disclosure under FOIL] ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Moreover, a blanket exemption for any statement made to law enforcement on the ground that it is inherently confidential admits of absurd results. There is no basis to assume that every person who communicates with law enforcement in the course of a criminal investigation expects that their name and each and every statement they make will be held in confidence. So interpreted, the exemption would cover even an innocuous\n   statement to a police officer or a comment that \"relates,\" but is obviously insignificant, to a criminal investigation. Consider, for example, a nontestifying witness who avers merely that \"I did not see anything,\" or a witness who merely corroborates undisputed and uncontroversial facts. Respondent concedes that statements of such nature are not \"confidential\" under any accepted understanding of the term, yet, the rule for\n   which respondent advocates would seem to place those statements under a \"cloak of confidentiality.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Unsurprisingly, respondent's interpretation of section 87(2)(e) (iii) is an outlier. Every other Appellate Division Department, in reliance on the current version of FOIL, has concluded that \"defendants are not entitled to a blanket exemption from disclosure\" (\n   <em>\n    Brown v. Town of Amherst,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1136265\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/195/979/#p980\">\n    195 A.D.2d 979\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 980,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1136265\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/195/979/#p980\">\n    600 N.Y.S.2d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [4th Dept.1993] ).

The Supreme Court has also precisely rejected respondent's argument here-that all law enforcement sources are inherently confidential. Instead, the Court has held that whether a source is confidential should be determined under a \"particularized approach,\" which may include consideration of \"the character of the crime\" and \"the source's relation to the crime\" (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11726\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/165/#p172\">\n    508 U.S. at 180, 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11726\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/165/#p172\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).

Therefore disclosure under FOIL can only be refused pursuant to section 87(2)(e)(iii) if the agency presents a \"particularized and specific justification for\n   denying access\" (\n   <em>\n    Matter of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Capital Newspapers Div. of Hearst Corp. v.

In determining whether information obtained in the course of a criminal investigation should be treated as confidential or\n   whether a source spoke on the assumption that the source's identity or statements would remain confidential, courts may consider, as they deem relevant, such factors as the nature of the crime, the source of the information in relation to the crime, and the content of the statements or information. Where the content of a statement or information and the circumstances surrounding its compilation by law enforcement convince a court that its confidentiality can be reasonably inferred, it may be withheld or released with appropriate redactions pursuant to section 87(2)(e)(iii). Otherwise, absent an explicit assurance of confidentiality, it may not be withheld or redacted under that FOIL exemption.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Here, because the Second Department majority misconstrued the FOIL exemption asserted by respondent, the order below must be reversed and the matter remitted for consideration under the correct standard. The People remain free, on remittal, to present evidence that the documents previously withheld are exempt under section 87(2)(e)(iii) in accordance with the standard articulated in this opinion. Since the Appellate Division did not reach petitioner's Civil Rights Law argument and Supreme Court did not review the grand jury minutes in determining whether petitioner met his burden to justify access to the minutes, we decline to reach those questions. Instead, we consider it prudent under the unique circumstances of this case to remit them, along with the FOIL matter, to Supreme Court for its consideration of all these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    IV.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   We recognize that petitioner seeks these documents to support his claim of actual innocence and that our decision does not answer whether respondent may deny disclosure. We are also acutely aware that petitioner filed his FOIL request years ago and it remains unresolved, despite the\n   legislature's intention to provide public access to government documents within a reasonable time frame. It is our intention that enunciation of the proper standard and our remittal to Supreme Court should facilitate the timely adjudication of petitioner's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be reversed, with costs, and the matter remitted to Supreme Court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   WHALEN, J. (dissenting in part).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   I agree with the majority opinion insofar as it holds that the Appellate Division read the confidentiality exemption of FOIL ( Public Officers Law \u00a7 87[2][e][iii] ) too broadly; that witness statements should be protected from disclosure pursuant to that exemption only where a witness was promised confidentiality or the circumstances were such that the confidentiality of the information provided could reasonably be inferred; and that this proceeding should be remitted for Supreme Court to determine the applicability of the confidentiality exemption to the material sought in petitioner's initial FOIL request under the proper standard. I further agree with the majority that upon remittal, the Civil Rights Law \u00a7 50-b issues raised by the parties may be considered, and petitioner's request for disclosure of the grand jury minutes should likewise be determined following an in camera review of the minutes. I respectfully dissent, however, from the majority's conclusion that petitioner was not required to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to his request for his \"entire case file,\" i.e., documents outside the scope of his initial FOIL request. I also write separately because I do not fully agree with the majority's discussion of how an agency can meet its burden of establishing that information was intended to be confidential for purposes of the FOIL confidentiality exemption in a case like this one that involves allegations of sexual offenses committed against children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Beginning with the exhaustion issue, I cannot agree with the majority that this record reflects that it would have been futile\n   for petitioner to seek his entire case file from the District Attorney through the FOIL process (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Town of Oyster Bay v.

The United States Supreme Court noted in\n   <em>\n    Landano\n   </em>\n   that the character of the crime being investigated may constitute a \"generic circumstance[ ]\" from which \"an implied assurance of confidentiality [to witnesses] fairly can be inferred\" (\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11726\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/165/#p172\">\n    508 U.S. at 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11726\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/165/#p172\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). As a matter of common sense, a witness who provides a statement alleging that he or she saw a sexual offense committed against a child does so with the reasonable expectation that the statement will be kept confidential \"except to the extent ... necessary for law enforcement purposes\" (\n   <em>\n    Landano,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11726\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/165/#p172\">\n    508 U.S. at 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11726\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/508/165/#p172\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2014\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The inference of confidentiality is even stronger when the statement is given by a child, and stronger still when the child witness is also the victim of the alleged sexual offense. Where an agency establishes that material requested under FOIL consists of statements made by children concerning the investigation of a claim of sexual abuse, the confidentiality exemption should apply in the absence of circumstances that demonstrate that confidentiality was not intended. Notably, child sex offense prosecutions often end in plea bargains for the very purpose of protecting victims from having to testify publicly. That purpose would be subverted if witness statements made in connection with those prosecutions were routinely discoverable under FOIL and thus available not only to former defendants like petitioner seeking to establish their actual innocence but equally to any member of the public regardless of the purpose for which the statements are sought (\n   <em>\n    see Matter of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gould v.

The difference in language between the FOIA and FOIL provisions does not diminish the usefulness of comparison with the federal analogue. Even though the federal statute does not by its terms apply to \"confidential information,\" federal courts have sometimes interpreted the statute to cover the same kind of \"confidential information\" protected in New York on a similar theory (\n    <em>\n     see e.g.\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pope,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"488359\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/599/1383/#p1387\">\n     599 F.2d at 1386-1387\n    </extracted-citation>\n    [withholding witness statements alleging attorney misconduct as confidential because \"disclosure of (the documents') contents would inevitably reveal their source\" and \"from the content and other circumstances\" surrounding the documents, the court concluded the information was provided on an inferred \"assurance of confidentiality\"] ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Of course other statutory exemptions may apply. The legislature has enacted specific provisions to protect witnesses and the accused from \"unwarranted invasion[s] of [their] personal privacy\" (Public Officers Law \u00a7 87[2][b] ) and, in some circumstances, the disclosure of their identity (\n    <em>\n     see e.g.\n    </em>\n    Civil Rights Law \u00a7 50-b ). The FOIL provision at issue here, though, was not primarily designed to protect victims, witnesses, or accused persons. As its text and legislative history make clear, this exemption is designed to balance the public's right to information with the need to maintain the integrity of police investigations involving confidential information and sources.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Contrary to the dissent's contention, our rule does not lead to the conclusion that \"witness statements made in connection with [child sex offense prosecutions will be] routinely discoverable under FOIL\" (dissenting op. at 486, 68 N.Y.S.3d at 18, 90 N.E.3d at 817). As we have explained, each FOIL request must be analyzed on its own terms, based on the specific facts and circumstances it presents. For the same reason, a court analyzing whether an agency's invocation of section 87(2)(e)(iii) is justified should not place \"additional weight on the nature of the crime\" as a categorical rule (dissenting op. at 486, 68 N.Y.S.3d at 18, 90 N.E.3d at 817), but must consider the specific facts and circumstances of each particular case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    Because the District Attorney preserved her exhaustion argument below, it is properly before us as an alternative ground for an affirmance of the Appellate Division's order in part (\n    <em>\n     see generally\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Parochial Bus Sys. v.
