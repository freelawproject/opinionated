When it comes to appellate court jurisdiction, missing a deadline can plunge an otherwise promising appeal into a nightmare. That is what has occurred here. The plaintiffs missed both the deadline for filing their notice of appeal and for filing a late notice of appeal. Defendants caught the oversight and took proper advantage of the appellate rules. We have no choice but to dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2 Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3 Fourteen-year-old Sellars Vines II went to the Flossmoor Library after school to work on his homework. When the library closed at 5 p.m., Sellars and a friend waited outside for a ride home near heavy metal grates placed atop ventilation shafts. Because it was chilly, the boys stood on one of the grates warming themselves with the exhaust air. The grate gave way, and Sellars fell 20 feet onto concrete, fracturing his scapula and three ribs and puncturing his lung. Sellars stayed in the hospital for two weeks, followed by rehabilitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4 Sellars's parents sued the Village of Flossmoor seeking damages for their son's injuries. Later they added the Flossmoor Library as a defendant. The defendants moved for summary judgment, denying all the allegations in the amended complaint. On August 31, 2016, the trial court granted summary judgment to both the Library and the Village. On September 30, the Vineses moved to reconsider, asserting the trial court erred and seeking leave to file a third amended complaint. On November\n   14, the trial court denied the motions to reconsider and for leave to file a third amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \u00b6 5 Notice of appeal was due on December 14, 2016. The Vineses did not file until December 21. No Illinois Supreme Court Rule 303(d) motion for leave to file a late notice of appeal was filed. Ill. S. Ct. R. 303(d) (eff. Jan. 1, 2015) (\"On motion supported by a showing of reasonable excuse for failure to file a notice of appeal on time, accompanied by the proposed notice of appeal and the filing fee, filed in the reviewing court\n   <em>\n    within 30 days after expiration of the time for filing a notice of appeal\n   </em>\n   , the reviewing court may grant leave to appeal and order the clerk to transmit the notice of appeal to the trial court for filing.\" (Emphasis added.)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00b6 6 On January 17, 2017, the Library moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction. The deadline had passed for filing a late notice of appeal under Rule 303(d). Three days later, on January 20, the Vineses' counsel received the motion to dismiss. That same day, counsel filed a \"Motion to Amend\" the December 21, 2016, notice of appeal. A different panel of this court denied the Library's motion to dismiss on January 31, 2017. That same panel, on February 15, 2017, denied the Village's motion to dismiss and granted the Vineses' motion to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 7 Analysis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \u00b6 8 This court has an independent duty to review our jurisdiction over an appeal and dismiss when it does not exist.\n   <em>\n    Archer Daniels Midland Co. v.

The filing of a Rule 303(d) motion is a mandatory requirement, regardless of whether the movant can show a reasonable excuse of lack of prejudice in its late filing of a notice of appeal. The Vineses had to file their late notice of appeal under Rule 303(d) by January 13, 2017. They missed the deadline. An admonition by the\n   <em>\n    Gaynor\n   </em>\n   court is worth reiterating: \"for this court to allow an appeal when jurisdiction is lacking would lessen the integrity of the appellate process as a whole.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1005,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=162%20Ill.%20Dec.%20409\">\n    162 Ill.Dec. 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=579%20N.E.2d%201223\">\n    579 N.E.2d 1223\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \u00b6 17 The Vineses' Petition for Rehearing argues our ruling on the motion to dismiss and the motion to amend was reached \"without the benefit of fully briefing or extensive oral argument on the specific issue which formed the basis of its opinion.\" Not so. The first point in the Vineses' reply to the Library's response brief acknowledges that \"this court has already been fully briefed on the question of jurisdiction * * *.\" and proceeds over the course of three pages to deflect the issue. In addition, at oral argument, we extensively questioned the parties on jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \u00b6 18 We are sensitive to the injuries suffered by Sellars, but we do not have the authority to excuse the filing requirements governing appeals.
