For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In June 2015, Glenn-Coulverson was indicted on two counts of murder in violation of R.C. 2903.02, with firearm and gang specifications, unclassified felonies; two counts of felonious assault in violation of R.C. 2903.11, with firearm specifications, second-degree felonies; two counts of having a weapon while under disability in violation of R.C. 2923.13, third-degree felonies; and one count of carrying a concealed weapon in violation of R.C. 2923.12, a forth-degree felony. Glenn-Coulverson pleaded guilty to one count of having a weapon while under disability, and elected to have the other count of having a weapon while under disability tried to the court. On the state's request, a nolle prosequi was entered for the carrying a concealed weapon count. The remaining charges were tried before a jury in February and March 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} As pertinent to this appeal, the following facts were adduced at trial. On March 20, 2015, friends Esak Gemeraw, Omar Sow, and Zadarrick Brooks drove together to a convenience store, \"De Store,\" on Chatterton Road in Franklin County. They arrived at the store's parking lot, which is shared with other businesses, when there was still daylight at approximately 6:00 p.m. They entered the store and soon returned to their vehicle. As they began to drive away, a gunman shot at them. Gemeraw was struck by a bullet in his torso, and he died as a result of the wound. Ten spent cartridge casings from the same firearm were found at the scene of the shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Sow, who was in the vehicle's rear passenger seat, testified as follows regarding the circumstances surrounding the shooting. As he, Gemeraw, and Brooks were about to enter the store, they passed a group of four or five individuals who were \"just saying, just little subliminal messages so they can get our attention.\" (Mar. 1, 2016 Tr. at 114.) Sow was not sure exactly what those individuals were saying, but it \"was like they was just rapping lyrics.\" (Mar. 1, 2016 Tr. at 114.) Sow described the nature of the lyrics as \"[j]ust gang and some-whole bunch of other stuff.\" (Mar. 1, 2016 Tr. at 114.) Sow did not know anyone in the group. Each member of the rapping group was black and was wearing either a black or gray \"hoodie.\" After passing the rapping group, and without anyone speaking between the groups, Sow, Gemeraw, and Brooks entered the store. After exiting the store, they loaded into their vehicle, with Brooks as the driver. Gemeraw was in the front passenger seat. As Brooks began to turn out of the parking lot and left on to Chatterton Road, there were gunshots. A window of the vehicle shattered, and Gemeraw\n   said he had been struck by a bullet. Sow heard numerous gunshots as Brooks drove away. He testified that he could not clearly see who was shooting, but he could see smoke near the shooter's hands and that the shooter was black and was wearing \"all black.\" (Mar. 1, 2016 Tr. at 123.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Brooks, who drove the vehicle, testified that after they purchased some snacks in the convenience store, Gemeraw and Sow exited the store before him. Brooks exited the store approximately one minute later and met them at the vehicle. Before the vehicle turned on to Chatterton Road, Brooks heard gunshots. Brooks turned left into traffic and then heard Gemeraw say \"I'm hit, I'm hit.\" (Mar. 1, 2016 Tr. at 158.) Brooks testified that he did not see the shooter as he drove away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On the day of the shooting, Shalaina Hunter went to the Little Caesars in the Chatterton Road shopping plaza with her family. She testified as follows. As Hunter was leaving to go home, she noticed a group of three young black males loudly \"rapping and just saying the 'N' word.\" (Mar. 2, 2016 Tr. at 216.) Their \"pants were down low\" and one was wearing black and the other two were wearing gray. (Mar. 2, 2016 Tr. at 216-17.) The man in black came within ten feet of her. After Hunter left the parking lot in her vehicle, she heard gunshots and looked in her rearview and side mirrors and saw a young black male shoot multiple times. Hunter pulled her vehicle to the side of the rode, and Brooks drove past her. Hunter got a good look at the shooter, who she described as \"a young guy, [with a] black sweatshirt, dreadlocks, brown skin, [and] jeans.\" (Mar. 2, 2016 Tr. at 221.) The shooter was one of the three rapping lyrics shortly before the shooting. After the shooting, the other two who had been hanging out with the shooter \"took off running.\" (Mar. 2, 2016 Tr. at 223.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Approximately one week after the shooting, Columbus police showed Hunter a surveillance video from inside De Store shortly before the shooting. Hunter was able to identify the shooter in the video and in a still frame taken from the video. The surveillance video, along with the still frame from the video, were again shown to Hunter at trial and she again identified the shooter from the video and still frame. Finally, in the courtroom, Hunter identified Glenn-Coulverson as the shooter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Aja Keyes was also in the Chatterton Road shopping plaza at the time of the shooting, and she testified as follows. Keyes went into De Store for a few minutes and then exited to go to her vehicle. She was in her vehicle when she heard a gunshot. She turned in the direction of the gunshot and saw the shooter. She also saw two or three individuals near the shooter run toward a housing development. The shooter remained in his spot, \"shooting towards a vehicle.\" (Mar. 2, 2016 Tr. at 264.) Keyes witnessed the shooter fire approximately six to ten shots at the vehicle. She had a clear view of the shooter, but she could not get a good look at his face. The shooter was wearing a black hoodie and had his hair in \"singles\" or \"dreads\" down between his eyes and chin. (Mar. 2, 2016 Tr. at 269.) The individuals who ran toward the housing development were wearing \"lighter hoodies, * * * gray, maybe.\" (Mar. 2, 2016 Tr. at 271.) Keyes was shown the convenience store surveillance video at trial and could not identify the shooter in the video, but she noted that one individual had a black hoodie and short braids like the shooter. She acknowledged however that the shooter's hairstyle and black hoodie are common.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Jeffrey Gillman was walking toward the Little Caesars at the Chatterton Road shopping plaza when the shooting began. He testified as follows. When Gillman\n   arrived at the shopping plaza, he noticed a small group \"just dancing and yelling,\" but he could not understand what they were saying. (Mar. 2, 2016 Tr. at 289.) As Gillman stepped on to the sidewalk in front of Little Caesars, he heard gunshots. He turned and saw \"a young man shooting five, six, eight times out into the street.\" (Mar. 2, 2016 Tr. at 290.) The shooter was wearing a \"black hoodie and blue jeans and braided hair.\" (Mar. 2, 2016 Tr. at 292.) He described the braided hair as \"[n]ot long * * * [s]hort. Shoulder length, maybe.\" (Mar. 2, 2016 Tr. at 292.) The others in the group, who were wearing gray hoodies, ran toward a housing development. Gillman had a clear view of the shooter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Approximately one week after the shooting, Columbus police interviewed Gillman and showed him the De Store surveillance video and then a still frame from that video. Gillman identified the shooter on the video and still frame from the video as the black male wearing a black hoodie. When asked at trial whether the shooter was in the courtroom, Gillman testified that the \"defendant looks like him, but I'm-I couldn't identify him today.\" (Mar. 2, 2016 Tr. at 306.) However, he had no doubt that he correctly identified the person in the video as the shooter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Shortly before the shooting, Pamela Woods arrived at the Chatterton Road shopping plaza to pick up her sons who were getting haircuts. She testified as follows. Woods was sitting in her vehicle in the shopping plaza when she saw three or four black males exiting De Store. One of the individuals wearing a gray hoodie looked similar to her nephew. One of the other individuals had \"dreads\" and was wearing \"all black,\" including a black hoodie. (Mar. 2, 2016 Tr. at 329.) The third individual was wearing a gray hoodie. Woods got a good look at the face of the individual wearing all black because he walked within approximately eight feet of her. When the individual in all black had walked near her vehicle, he was \"dancing, kind of like-almost as if he was listening to music and he was kind of just dancing around.\" (Mar. 2, 2016 Tr. at 346.) After the individuals walked by her vehicle, Woods heard a \"pop\" and then another \"pop.\" (Mar. 2, 2016 Tr. at 333.) She exited her vehicle and saw a man shooting a firearm until he had \"unload[ed] the clip.\" (Mar. 2, 2016 Tr. at 334.) The shooter was the individual in a black hoodie with \"dreads\" who had just walked past her vehicle. (Mar. 2, 2016 Tr. at 335.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Approximately one week after the shooting, Woods went to Columbus police headquarters and watched the De Store surveillance video. Woods identified the black male with a black hoodie in the video as the shooter. She also identified the black male with a black hoodie in the video still frame as the shooter. In the courtroom, Woods identified Glenn-Coulverson as the shooter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Columbus Division of Police Officer Derek Blaine testified as follows. There are multiple gangs that operate in the area of the shooting, including the Crips, James &amp; Livingston Hot Boys, East Main Money Gang, and East Haven Bloods. As a patrol officer, Officer Blaine interacted with members of these gangs on a regular basis. Officer Blaine had numerous interactions with Glenn-Coulverson over the previous few years, and he knew Glenn-Coulverson was in the James &amp; Livingston Hot Boys gang. Additionally, when Officer Blaine interacted with Glenn-Coulverson, Glenn-Coulverson was frequently with individuals with known ties to that gang. Many of the individuals connected with the James &amp; Livingston Hot Boys gang have the words \"Hot Boys,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"James Road,\" or \"Livingston Avenue,\" tattooed on their bodies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On August 11, 2013, approximately 19 months before the shooting, Officer Blaine encountered Glenn-Coulverson in connection with a traffic stop. Because there was marijuana in the vehicle, Officer Blaine and another officer at the scene required all four individuals to exit the vehicle. As he exited the vehicle, Glenn-Coulverson admitted to having two weapons on his person. The driver and two other passengers of the vehicle were all connected with the James &amp; Livingston Hot Boys gang, and they all had \"Hot Boys\" tattoos to indicate their affiliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 15} At trial, Officer Blaine was shown the convenience store surveillance video, and he identified Glenn-Coulverson on that video. Officer Blaine also identified a known associate of the PTSQ gang, Eric Smith Ross, on the video. According to Officer Blaine, it is not unusual for individuals of different gangs to hang out together.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Columbus Division of Police Detective Bill Best, a declared expert in criminal street gangs, testified as follows. For the past five years, Detective Best served in the Criminal Intelligence Unit, or Gang Unit, dealing with gangs and gang activity. Gang members use identifiers, such as wearing the same color, tattoos, and scarring, to indicate their affiliation. For example, it is common for James &amp; Livingston Hot Boys gang members to have tattoos on their hands to indicate their affiliation with the gang. The parties stipulated that Glenn-Coulverson has \"Hot Boys\" tattooed on his hands and \"James Road\" tattooed across his torso. Detective Best testified that having these types of tattoos is \"a way for people to see that you're a Hot Boy.\" (Mar. 2, 2016 Tr. at 395.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Detective Best also testified regarding the connection between criminal gangs and violence. He testified that criminal activity enhances a member's \"street value.\" (Mar. 2, 2016 Tr. at 376.) \"[W]hen it comes to the gang members, violence is what rules. If you're out on the street, you want to have the most violent reputation.\" (Mar. 2, 2016 Tr. at 377.) Committing acts of violence, such as carrying weapons and openly firing ten times at a moving vehicle, increases an individual's status on the street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Detective Best further testified that the James &amp; Livingston Hot Boys gang is linked to the nationally recognized Bloods gang, whose members normally wear red. In the De Store surveillance video, Glenn-Coulverson can be seen wearing a red bandana in his right back pocket of his jeans. Detective Best testified that Glenn-Coulverson's display of a red bandana in the right back pocket indicated his affiliation with the Bloods gang. The color red \"signifies * * * a Blood, and * * * wearing it in the right back [also] signifies a Blood.\" (Mar. 2, 2016 Tr. at 388.) Detective Best also acknowledged Ross' presence in the surveillance video, and he noted that he knew Ross to be an associate of the East Haven Bloods and PTSQ gangs. He testified it is not uncommon for East Haven Bloods to hang out with James &amp; Livingston Hot Boys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Lastly, Detective Best further testified that James &amp; Livingston Hot Boys gang members have committed felonious assaults, shootings, drug dealing, thefts, and robberies in Columbus. For example, in February 2014, James &amp; Livingston Hot Boys gang member Ted Vanhed was convicted of participating in a criminal street gang, two counts of aggravated robbery, and weapons charges. Additionally, in March 2015, Robert Broom, also a James &amp; Livingston Hot Boys gang member, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter as a result of his involvement\n   in a drive-by shooting. Detective Best testified that he had listened to an interview of Glenn-Coulverson in which he \"said that [Robert Broom] was his homey * * * that he rolls with the Hot Boys.\" (Mar. 2, 2016 Tr. at 393.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 20} At the conclusion of trial, the court found Glenn-Coulverson guilty of the tried count of having a weapon while under disability. The jury found him guilty of one count of murder, with firearm and gang specifications, and two counts of felonious assault, with firearm specifications. The jury found him not guilty of the other count of murder. The trial court sentenced Glenn-Coulverson to a total of 35 years to life in prison for the convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Glenn-Coulverson timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignments of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Glenn-Coulverson assigns the following errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [1.] The trial court abused its discretion by admitting irrelevant and prejudicial testimony by a police \"gang expert,\" in violation of Ohio Rules of Evidence 401, 402, 403, and 404 which amounts to reversible error.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [2.] Defendant-Appellant's convictions are not supported by sufficient, credible evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [3.] Defendant-Appellant's convictions are against manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [4.] The Defendant's right to the effective assistance of counsel was violated where counsel's performance was deficient to the Defendant's prejudice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [5.] The trial court erred in imposing the gang specification where there was no indication that the shooting was gang related thus unconstitutionally applying R.C. 2941.142 to the Defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    A. First Assignment of Error-Admission of Testimony Relating to Gang Activity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 23} In his first assignment of error, Glenn-Coulverson asserts the trial court erred in admitting into evidence testimony regarding gang activity and related conduct. Glenn-Coulverson argues that the gang-related testimony was inadmissible under Ohio Rules of Evidence 401, 402, 403, and 404 because it was irrelevant, unfairly prejudicial, and improper character evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 24} The admission or exclusion of relevant evidence rests within the trial court's sound discretion.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Relevance and Unfair Prejudice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Glenn-Coulverson argues that the state was erroneously permitted to present irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial testimony concerning gangs. In particular, he contends that the trial court should not have permitted Officer Blaine and Detective Best to testify regarding gangs and gang activity. He argues that their testimony was improper because there was no evidence that the shooting was gang-related, the testimony was not probative of the shooter's identity, and the testimony was inflammatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 26} Evid.R. 401 defines \"relevant evidence\" as \"evidence having any\n   tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" Generally, relevant evidence is admissible, and irrelevant evidence is inadmissible.

For example, whether Glenn-Coulverson was actively participating in a criminal gang was also a relevant issue because the state was required to prove that fact to meet the requirements of the charged gang specification. As set forth above, Glenn-Coulverson was indicted on two counts of murder, with a firearm and gang specification attached to both of those counts.

Officer Blaine testified that Glenn-Coulverson was a passenger in the vehicle he stopped that day. Officer Blaine and another officer determined there was marijuana in the vehicle and directed the driver and passengers to exit the vehicle. The other officer asked Glenn-Coulverson if he had any weapons on his person, and he admitted he was carrying two weapons. Officer Blaine testified that the driver and other passengers of the stopped vehicle were also members of the James &amp; Livingston Hot Boys gang.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   {\u00b6 36} Before Officer Blaine testified, Glenn-Coulverson's counsel generally objected to anticipated testimony on the basis of Evid.R. 404(B). However, this was not in response to a specific inquiry by the prosecution. Even assuming Glenn-Coulverson preserved this issue for review on appeal, he cannot demonstrate that the trial court admitted evidence in violation of Evid.R. 404(B). The testimony regarding the traffic stop in August 2013 supported the gang specification. Glenn-Coulverson was in the vehicle with known members of the gang, with guns and drugs, and Detective Best testified that the gang was involved in drug dealing and weapons offenses. The testimony regarding the presence of drugs in the vehicle with Glenn-Coulverson and three other James &amp; Livingston Hot Boys gang members generally related to the criminal activities of his gang. Additionally, the testimony that Glenn-Coulverson was in possession of two weapons at the time of the traffic stop in August 2013 tended to show that he was an active member of the gang. Thus, that testimony constituted evidentiary support for the charged gang specification and was not excludable as other acts evidence pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   {\u00b6 37} Accordingly, we overrule Glenn-Coulverson's first assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

He argues there was insufficient evidence to convict him of murder, felonious assault, and the gang specification because there was a lack of physical evidence, the eyewitness testimony was unreliable, and there was no evidence demonstrating that the shooting was gang related. Because the evidence was sufficient to support these convictions, and the convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence, these assignments of error lack merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 39} Whether there is legally sufficient evidence to sustain a verdict is a question of law.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The trial court found Glenn-Coulverson guilty of having a weapon while under disability on the date of the shooting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   He argues that his other convictions should be reversed because the only evidence that he was the shooter on March 20, 2015 was unreliable eyewitness testimony, and because there was no evidence linking the shooting to gang activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   {\u00b6 43} We find that sufficient evidence supported the guilty verdicts, and that those verdicts were not against the manifest weight of the evidence. The central issue raised at trial was identification-namely whether Glenn-Coulverson was the shooter. Testimony revealed that at approximately one week after the shooting, eyewitnesses Hunter, Woods, and Gillman reviewed the convenience store surveillance video and a still frame from the video. At that time, all three identified Glenn-Coulverson as the shooter. At trial, both Hunter and Woods identified Glenn-Coulverson as the shooter, though Gillman could not identify the shooter in the courtroom. Keyes, another eyewitness to the shooting, reviewed the surveillance video at trial and indicated she could not positively identify the shooter in the video. However, she noted that one individual had a black hoodie and short braids like the shooter. Sow, a passenger in the targeted\n   vehicle, could not identify the shooter, but he testified that the shooter was black and was wearing all black. Thus, multiple eyewitnesses identified Glenn-Coulverson as the shooter, before the trial and at trial. Additionally, the eyewitnesses to the shooting who could not identify Glenn-Coulverson as the shooter provided descriptions of the shooter that were consistent with the eyewitnesses who could identify him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   {\u00b6 44} As to Glenn-Coulverson's manifest weight argument that no physical evidence connects him to the crime, this court has concluded that a lack of physical evidence, standing alone, does not render an appellant's conviction against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    State v.

While there was no physical evidence linking Glenn-Coulverson to the shooting, multiple eyewitnesses identified him as the shooter. Determining the credibility of those identifications was for the jury to decide, and Glenn-Coulverson presents no persuasive reason for this court to find that the jury lost its way in reaching its findings that Glenn-Coulverson murdered Gemeraw and committed felonious assault against Sow and Brooks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 46} Glenn-Coulverson also contends that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of the gang specification because no evidence reasonably demonstrated a link between the shooting and gang activity. We disagree. To prove the gang specification, the state needed to show that Glenn-Coulverson committed the murder \"while participating in a criminal gang.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   R.C. 2941.142. Here, evidence demonstrated that the James &amp; Livingston Hot Boys gang is a criminal gang and that Glenn-Coulverson was a member of that gang. There was also evidence of factual circumstances tending to show that Glenn-Coulverson engaged in the violence for a gang-related reason. Testimony indicated that, shortly before the shooting, Glenn-Coulverson and others with him were seeking attention in the shopping plaza's parking area as they rapped lyrics that included some type of gang-related message. Glenn-Coulverson displayed a red bandana in his back right jeans pocket which is an outward demonstration of his membership in a Bloods affiliated gang. Also, Glenn-Coulverson made no attempt to conceal himself as he openly fired at the vehicle within view of numerous individuals,\n   including at least one other gang member. The convenience store's surveillance video shows that Glenn-Coulverson was hanging out with East Haven Bloods gang member Ross shortly before the shooting and eyewitness testimony puts him with the same individual at the time of the shooting. Testimony from a gang expert indicated that openly committing violence, such as by standing in a busy shopping plaza and firing ten bullets into a moving vehicle, is a means to increase status within gang culture. Collectively, evidence of these facts reasonably demonstrated that Glenn-Coulverson committed the act of murder, at least in part, for the purpose of furthering the interests of his criminal gang or his personal status within that gang. Therefore, sufficient evidence was presented at trial for the jury to find that the shooting occurred while Glenn-Coulverson was participating in a criminal gang.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 47} For these reasons, we find that sufficient evidence supported Glenn-Coulverson's convictions, and his convictions were not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Accordingly, we overrule Glenn-Coulverson's second and third assignments of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Fourth Assignment of Error-Alleged Ineffective Assistance of Trial Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 48} Glenn-Coulverson's fourth assignment of error alleges he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel. In order to prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, Glenn-Coulverson must satisfy a two-prong test. First, he must demonstrate that his counsel's performance was deficient.\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

Here, Glenn-Coulverson contends his trial counsel was ineffective in (1) failing to file a motion to suppress the pretrial identifications of him, (2) failing to request a jury instruction pursuant to R.C. 2933.83(C)(3), and (3) failing to request a jury instruction for the other acts testimony presented at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

No. 09AP-868,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010-Ohio-3892\">\n    2010-Ohio-3892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203292966\">\n    2010 WL 3292966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 31. The factors that must be considered when evaluating reliability under the totality of the circumstances test are as follows: (1) the witness's opportunity to view the offender at the time of the crime; (2) the witness's degree of attention at the time of the crime; (3) the accuracy of the witness's prior description of the offender; (4) the witness's level of certainty when identifying the suspect at the confrontation; and (5) the length of time that has elapsed between the crime and the confrontation.\n   <em>\n    Monford\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39, citing\n   <em>\n    Biggers\n   </em>\n   at 199-200,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6173155\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/409/188/\">\n    93 S.Ct. 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Even if Glenn-Coulverson's counsel had moved to suppress the identifications, it would have been proper for the trial court to deny the motion because the identification procedure was not unduly suggestive. According to Glenn-Coulverson, investigative authorities failed to comply with R.C. 2933.83, resulting in unduly suggestive identification procedures. We disagree. R.C. 2933.83 governs the administration of \"photo lineups\" and \"live lineups\" and is \"aimed at preventing the use of unnecessarily suggestive procedures.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, R.C. 2933.83 was not applicable to the identification procedure used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Furthermore, the identification procedure was not otherwise unduly suggestive. Showing the convenience store's inside surveillance video to the eyewitnesses was a valid and reliable investigative procedure as the video depicts actual events connected in time and space to the crime itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Also, a printed still frame from the video was only shown to the witnesses who could identify the shooter in the video, which depicts numerous individuals. The printed still frame served the functional purpose of enabling the witness to circle the shooter with a pen. Because the pretrial identification procedures were not unduly suggestive and the trial court would not have erred in denying any motion to suppress the pretrial identifications, Glenn-Coulverson's counsel was not deficient in not moving to suppress those identifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Jury Instructions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   {\u00b6 55} Glenn-Coulverson argues that his trial counsel should have requested a jury instruction pursuant to R.C. 2933.83(C)(3) and an instruction concerning other acts testimony presented at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Strategic and tactical decisions of trial counsel cannot form the basis of a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Columbus v.

We find no reason to deviate from this general rule in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   {\u00b6 57} Glenn-Coulverson's trial counsel's decision not to request an instruction under R.C. 2933.83 was reasonable. When there is evidence of noncompliance with the requirements of R.C. 2933.83, a trial court must \"instruct the jury that such noncompliance may be considered in determining the credibility of the witness identification.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Jones,\n   </em>\n   8th Dist.

The trial court charged the jury regarding eyewitness identification, including instructing the jury that the value of identification testimony depends on the opportunity of the witness to observe the offender, the strength of the identification, and the circumstances under which the identification was made. Glenn-Coulverson does not challenge the general eyewitness identification charge given to the jury, but asserts that his counsel should have requested the additional instruction regarding identification pursuant to R.C. 2933.83(C)(3). However, because R.C. 2933.83 was inapplicable, the trial court was not required to provide the additional R.C. 2933.83(C)(3) instruction. Thus, Glenn-Coulverson's trial counsel was not deficient in not requesting such an instruction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   {\u00b6 58} We are also unpersuaded by Glenn-Coulverson's argument that his counsel was deficient in not requesting a jury instruction regarding other acts testimony. The testimony regarding the August 2013 traffic stop was admissible because it supported and was offered to prove the gang specification. Furthermore, a limiting instruction regarding the testimony only being admissible in furtherance of the gang specification and not to prove the character of the defendant could have, in the view of trial counsel, unnecessarily\n   highlighted the existence of that evidence. Under these facts, his counsel's decision not to request a limiting instruction was within the realm of reasonable trial tactics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   {\u00b6 59} Accordingly, we overrule Glenn-Coulverson's fourth assignment of error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Fifth Assignment of Error-Constitutionality of Gang Specification As Applied to Glenn-Coulverson\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   {\u00b6 60} In his fifth assignment of error, Glenn-Coulverson argues that R.C. 2941.142 was unconstitutionally applied to him because there was no indication that the shooting was gang related. Glenn-Coulverson did not raise this argument in the trial court. Before Officer Blaine and Detective Best testified at trial, Glenn-Coulverson's counsel stated, \"I'd just make a general motion. I realize the weight of the case law is against this, but just a general motion to the admissibility to the gang specification, the constitutionality. Also 404(B) evidence, things like that. Just make that for the record.\" (Mar. 2, 2016 Tr. at 355.) While Glenn-Coulverson generally challenged the constitutionality of R.C. 2941.142, the gang specification statute, in the trial court he did not challenge the statute as being unconstitutionally applied to him or give the basis for such a challenge. \"A constitutional issue not raised at trial 'need not be heard for the first time on appeal.' \"\n   <em>\n    State v.

There was no legitimate basis for the testimony that the \"homey\" Robert Broom was convicted of involuntary manslaughter as part of the trial of Glenn-Coulverson. The testimony had minimal to no relevance and was highly prejudicial.
