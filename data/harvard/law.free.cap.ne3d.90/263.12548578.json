Asadi-Ousley (\"Asadi-Ousley\"), appeals his convictions and sentence for rape, felonious assault, kidnapping, and his sexually violent predator conviction. He raises the following assignments of error for review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   1. The trial court erred in failing to grant trial counsel's motion to continue trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   2. The evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that [Asadi-Ousley] was guilty of the sexually violent predator specification attached to [Counts 1, 2, and 7] of the indictment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   3. [Asadi-Ousley's] convictions for rape, felonious assault, kidnapping, and the\n   sexual predator specification were against the weight of the evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   4. The trial court erred when it failed to merge the sentences imposed in [Counts 1, 2, and 7] as they are allied offenses of similar import.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   5. [Asadi-Ousley] was denied his right to effective assistance of counsel guaranteed by Article I, Section 10 of the Ohio constitution and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution when his attorney failed to argue that [Asadi-Ousley's] convictions for rape, felonious assault, and kidnapping were allied offenses of similar import.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 2} After careful review of the record and relevant case law, we affirm Asadi-Ousley's convictions, but reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Procedural and Factual History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In July 2015, Asadi-Ousley was charged in a seven-count indictment. Counts 1 and 2 charged him with rape, and each count carried a sexually violent predator specification. Counts 3 and 4 charged him with aggravated robbery. Count 5 charged him with felonious assault, and Counts 6 and 7 charged him with kidnapping.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The matter proceeded to a jury trial, at which the following evidence was adduced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Sometime around October 2008, T.M. moved from Huron, Ohio, to Cleveland to live with her boyfriend and his father. They lived in a duplex near the intersection of East 140th Street and Kinsman in Cleveland. T.M. had never lived in Cleveland and was unfamiliar with the neighborhood. On December 31, 2008, T.M. decided to spend New Year's Eve with some friends she recently made. T.M. testified that she had consumed two alcoholic drinks and smoked some marijuana with her friends. Around 10:30 p.m., one of her friends drove her home so she could watch the New Year's festivities on television with her boyfriend. When she arrived, however, her boyfriend and his father were not home. The apartment did not have a phone so T.M. could not call anyone. Since no one was home, T.M. decided to walk to the corner store to buy some beer to drink while she watched the ball drop in Times Square on television. T.M. walked to the store around 10:45 p.m. and bought a can of beer. As she was walking back home, a man grabbed her from behind and held a knife against her neck. He told her not to scream or he would kill her. T.M. testified that she believed she heard two voices. The attacker covered her mouth with his hand. T.M. testified that she never observed her attacker's face because he approached her from behind. With the knife held to her neck, the attacker pushed T.M., forcing her into an alleyway. The attacker then struck T.M. in the back of her head and she lost consciousness. T.M. referred to the alley as \"the cut.\" She described it as an area between a house and a building.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 6} T.M. awoke to find herself on the ground in the alley, her lip and nose were bleeding, her vagina was sore, and her head hurt. Her shirt was ripped open and her pants and underwear were pulled down. She testified that she realized that she had been raped. Her can of beer and three dollars in change were gone. T.M. walked out of the alleyway and headed back home. She called her boyfriend from a payphone on her way back, but her attempt to reach him was unsuccessful. A\n   boy she recognized from the neighborhood saw her walking and helped her make it back home. When T.M. arrived home, the house was still empty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   She laid in bed and cried. T.M. testified that she had suffered from depression when she was a teenager. She stayed in bed until the morning of January 3, 2009, when she went to her neighbor's house and called her boyfriend and her mother, J.H. She told them what had happened. T.M.'s mother and boyfriend both advised her to go the hospital. J.H. testified that she remembered getting the phone call from T.M. She still remembers that phone call because of how distraught T.M. sounded. T.M. was scared and crying hysterically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 7} T.M. then called an ambulance and was transported to the hospital. She brought the clothes she wore on the night of the attack with her to the hospital. T.M. spoke with police officers at the hospital, and a nurse performed a sexual assault kit on T.M.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner Deanna Johnson (\"Nurse Johnson\") performed T.M.'s examination. Nurse Johnson testified that T.M. had vaginal pain and bleeding and was crying during the examination. Nurse Johnson further testified that T.M. disclosed she had been raped vaginally by strangers, one of whom had a knife, and had been struck in the head and lost consciousness. Nurse Johnson observed a scratch on T.M.'s neck consistent with T.M.'s report of having a knife held to her neck. Nurse Johnson collected samples for the sexual assault kit and collected T.M.'s clothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Cleveland Police Officer Jenae Treece (\"Officer Treece\") responded to the report of T.M.'s rape and spoke to T.M. at the hospital. T.M. told her that one or possibly two suspects were involved in the attack, one of which had a knife. Officer Treece testified that T.M. had a scratch on her neck consistent with a knife being held there. No suspect was identified during her investigation. Officer Treece described the area where T.M. was attacked as being between East 139th Street and East 140th Street, behind a beauty supply store.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 10} T.M. moved to West Virginia after the incident. Almost seven years later, sometime in 2015, Cleveland police contacted T.M. The officers had her look at some photographs to identify her attacker, but she was unable to do so because she never saw his face. T.M. could not identify Asadi-Ousley at trial as her attacker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Jade McDaniel, a forensic scientist employed with the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (\"BCI\") testified that T.M.'s sexual assault kit was delivered to the BCI lab on March 19, 2014, for DNA testing. She performed the DNA testing in this case. The vaginal samples revealed a mixture of DNA profiles consisting of T.M. and an unknown male. A sample from T.M.'s underwear had a mixture of DNA profiles consistent with T.M.'s and an unknown male.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 12} On March 6, 2015, the lab received a DNA sample from Asadi-Ousley. McDaniel compared Asadi-Ousley's DNA sample with the samples in the kit. McDaniel testified that Asadi-Ousley's DNA was found in T.M.'s vaginal samples and on T.M.'s underwear.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 13} At the conclusion of trial, the jury found Asadi-Ousley guilty of both rape counts, felonious assault, and both kidnapping counts. At sentencing, the trial court merged the rape counts into one count (Count 2) and merged the kidnapping\n   counts into one count (Count 7). The trial court sentenced Asadi-Ousley to 15 years to life in prison on each of Counts 2 and 7 and eight years in prison on Count 5. The court ordered that the sentences be served concurrently for an aggregate of 15 years to life in prison.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Motion to Continue\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 14} In his first assignment of error, Asadi-Ousley argues the trial court erred when it did not grant his December 29, 2015 motion to continue trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The decision to grant or deny a motion to continue trial is left to the broad and sound discretion of the trial judge, and an appellate court may not disturb the trial court's ruling absent an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Cleveland v.

On October 12, 2015, Asadi-Ousley filed a motion to continue the trial date. The trial court granted this motion and set a new trial date of December 2, 2015. On November 29, 2015, Asadi-Ousley filed his second motion to continue trial because defense counsel had not fully recovered from eye surgery on his right eye and had eye surgery scheduled for his left eye on December 4, 2015. Within the motion, defense counsel anticipated he would need 30 days to recover. The trial court granted Asadi-Ousley's motion to continue the second trial date and set a trial date of January 4, 2016. Then on December 29, 2015, Asadi-Ousley filed a third motion to continue trial because defense counsel had not fully recovered from the December 4, 2015 surgery. On January 4, 2016, the trial court addressed Asadi-Ousley's third motion on the record as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   THE COURT: [defense counsel], you made a motion to continue the trial once\n   again based on your eyesight once again, is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That's correct, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   THE COURT: We talked about this outside of the presence of the court reporter off the record and you correct me if I'm wrong, [defense counsel], I believe you indicated you could start today, that you are having trouble seeing and you sometimes need a magnifier or magnifying glass?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I'm using my eyeglasses today. I'm improving all the time, I'm just not all the way back.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   THE COURT: So what we had discussed outside of your client's presence and not on the record was that I would tell the jury at the beginning when I introduce you that you did have this recent cataract surgery and your eyesight is not 100 percent, so if you seem unsure or unsteady on your feet or it takes you awhile to read something, that's because of your surgery and not to make any inference.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: That is correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   THE COURT: Would that be sufficient for you, [defense counsel]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes. I just have the depth perception problem. I may reach for something that's a little bit further than it appears, so I'm sometimes unsteady on my feet.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   THE COURT: So I'll make my remarks, but certainly feel free to say what you would like to say about the situation during the course of your voir dire to the jurors.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, I fully discussed everything with my client and I'm-we are prepared to go forward.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 18} The court denied the motion and Asadi-Ousley went forward with trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 19} A review of this record reveals that Asadi-Ousley's defense counsel affirmatively waived Asadi-Ousley's third motion to continue on the day of trial when he told the trial court that they were, in fact, prepared to go forward that day. Moreover, when applying the\n   <em>\n    Unger\n   </em>\n   factors to the instant case, we cannot conclude that the trial court's denial of Asadi-Ousley's third continuance was unreasonable. The trial court continued trial on two prior occasions at Asadi-Ousley's request, and the multiple court dates caused inconvenience to the state's witnesses who had to travel to Cuyahoga County to testify (T.M. traveled from West Virginia, J.H. traveled from Huron, Ohio, and McDaniel traveled from Richfield, Ohio). The trial court held a brief hearing and inquired in depth of the continuance request. Given these facts, we cannot say that the trial court's decision to deny Asadi-Ousley's third motion for continuance was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Therefore, the first assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

For purposes of this division, convictions that result from or are connected with the same act or result from offenses committed at the same time are one conviction, and a conviction set aside pursuant to law is not a conviction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (b) The person has a documented history from childhood, into the juvenile developmental years, that exhibits sexually deviant behavior.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (c) Available information or evidence suggests that the person chronically commits offenses with a sexual motivation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   (d) The person has committed one or more offenses in which the person has tortured or engaged in ritualistic acts with one or more victims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (e) The person has committed one or more offenses in which one or more victims were physically harmed to the degree that the particular victim's life was in jeopardy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (f) Any other relevant evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 25} Asadi-Ousley argues there is no documented history of past sexually violent offenses, no proof that his behavior is chronic to a degree that it would be likely he would offend again, and no proof he behaved in a manner that could be construed as torturous or ritualistic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 26} While Asadi-Ousley has had several prior convictions for violent offenses, the convictions in the instant case were his first for sexually oriented offenses. This court, however, has previously held that the sexually violent predator statute does not require a defendant to have a prior conviction for a sexually oriented offense to be found guilty of a sexually violent predator specification.\n   <em>\n    State v.

The court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   [B]ased on the facts of this particular case and based on his violent record, I do find him to be a sexually violent predator and find him guilty of the sexually violent predator specification beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Obviously aggravated robbery, burglary, having a weapon under disability and robbery are all offenses of a serious nature and the one was with a weapon, a firearm, so obviously that's incredibly serious and in this particular case, he snatched a woman walking down the street at 10:30 or so at night and he didn't just restrain her of her liberty, that would be bad enough, but you actually dragged her into an alley and thereafter threatened her life and saying if she told anybody you would kill her and holding the knife to her throat and scratching her throat, you then raped her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   I know the defense was consent. However, the injuries described by the victim, the bleeding as described by [the state], the injuries as indicated to the hospital personnel when she went to the hospital, the great pain she suffered, the psychological harm she suffered as a result of this very, very violent act would indicate that his behavior is of such a nature that he is likely to re-offend.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   So I make that finding beyond a reasonable doubt and I will set this for sentencing at a later date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Based on the foregoing, we find sufficient evidence to support the sexually violent predator conviction.

I respectfully dissent, however, from the majority's conclusion in the fourth assignment of error that Asadi-Ousley's rape and kidnapping counts merge for purposes of sentencing. In finding that these offenses do not merge, I would also find that Asadi-Ousley did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   {\u00b6 51} Contrary to the majority's holding, I find the factual scenario in\n   <em>\n    Echols,\n   </em>\n   8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 102504,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015-Ohio-5138\">\n    2015-Ohio-5138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%208484088\">\n    2015 WL 8484088\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , distinguishable\n   from the instant case. In\n   <em>\n    Echols\n   </em>\n   , victim one was walking home late at night. As she passed a large tree or shrub, a person jumped out from the tree and came up behind her. The individual held a knife to her throat and threatened her. He moved her from the sidewalk to behind the tree and raped her. Another attack occurred approximately five years later, involving a different victim. Victim two was walking home when a car pulled up and an unknown individual told her to get into the car or he would hurt her. She complied. She was hit in the head with a brick and raped. Sexual assault kits were performed on both victims. DNA testing revealed that the defendant's DNA was consistent with that of the attacker in both victims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 3-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   {\u00b6 52} On appeal, we found that the asportation of victim one was slight. Victim one was moved from the sidewalk to behind a tree next to the sidewalk. There was no increased risk of harm associated with this movement apart from that associated with the sexual assault. This movement was done for the purpose of raping with no separate, identifiable harm. The movement was done in conjunction with the rape and was not separated by any significant length of time or distance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38. We reasoned, because \"the movement was slight, occurred close in time to the rape, and was done solely to facilitate the rape[,] the trial court erred when it failed to merge the rape and kidnapping counts related to [victim one].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   {\u00b6 53} We contrasted victim one's movement with the movement of victim two, who was abducted from the bus stop. With victim two, the defendant forced her to get into his vehicle, hit her with a brick once in the car, and he drove her away from the area. We found that the \"asportation of [victim two] constituted a separate crime for which [defendant] may be separately punished.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   {\u00b6 54} I would find that the facts surrounding T.M.'s attack are more analogous to victim two, rather than victim one, in the\n   <em>\n    Echols\n   </em>\n   case. Victim one was moved from the sidewalk to behind a tree next to the sidewalk, where she was raped. Based on the facts in\n   <em>\n    Echols\n   </em>\n   , the tree was on the tree lawn next to the sidewalk, which was not a concealed area. Whereas with victim two, the defendant forced her into a car and drove her to another location, where he committed the rape. Here, the inception of the crime was when T.M. was approached from behind by knifepoint as she was walking down the street. This act caused her to submit to being pushed into a secluded alleyway, behind a beauty supply store (kidnapping), where she was knocked unconscious by a blow to the head and then raped.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   {\u00b6 55} This movement, just as the movement of victim two, constituted a separate crime for which Asadi-Ousley may be separately punished. The movement was not slight and was separated by significant distance, and the confinement was attempted to be kept secret, subjecting T.M. to a substantial increase in harm separate from the rape. Specifically, Asadi-Ousley forcibly moved T.M. by knifepoint from a publicly visible area into a concealed alleyway, behind a beauty supply store, where he was more easily able to perpetrate the rape of an unconscious T.M. T.M. then awoke to find herself on the ground with her lip and nose bleeding, her shirt ripped open, and her pants and underwear pulled down.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Lovato\n   </em>\n   , 2d Dist. Montgomery No. 25683,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014-Ohio-2311\">\n    2014-Ohio-2311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202475593\">\n    2014 WL 2475593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (where court of appeals affirmed the trial court's decision finding that defendant's rape and kidnapping charges of victim two did not merge for purposes of sentencing). The\n   <em>\n    Lovato\n   </em>\n   court\n   found that the kidnapping was not merely incidental to the rape because the defendant dragged the victim through an alley to a nearby garage, while she was unconscious, and raped her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   {\u00b6 56} For these reasons, I would find that the rape and kidnapping convictions are not subject to merger.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
