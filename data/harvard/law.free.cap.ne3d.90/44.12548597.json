Sturgill appeals the \"Entry Overruling Jurisdictional Motion,\" dated September 21, 2016, in the Athens County Court of Common Pleas. In 2009, Sturgill was indicted on six counts which included rape and unlawful sexual conduct with a minor. In 2010, he pleaded to two counts of rape, R.C. 2907. 02(A)(2), felonies of the first degree, and was sentenced to a five-year mandatory prison term. He served his term and was released in 2014. On appeal, Sturgill asserts because he has served his prison sentence and has been released from custody, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to hold a sex offender reclassification hearing, pursuant to the dictates of Megan's Law. However, we find no merit to Sturgill's sole assignment of\n   error. Accordingly, we overrule the assignment of error and affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellant was indicted by the Athens County Grand Jury in Case Number 09CR0296, as follows: two counts of rape, in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(1)(b), and felonies of the first degree; three counts of rape, in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), and felonies of the first degree; and one count of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor, in violation of R.C. 2907.04(A), and a felony of the fourth degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On March 30, 2010 Appellant pleaded to two counts of rape, R.C. 2907.02(A)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In exchange for his guilty plea, the State of Ohio dismissed the remaining counts and there was a joint recommendation that Appellant be sentenced to a mandatory term of five (5) years in prison; that Appellant be ordered to register as a Tier III sexual predator with community notifications; and that Appellant have no direct or indirect contact with the victims or victims' family.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Appellant served his five-year prison sentence and was released from the custody of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections on September 4, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On September 25, 2015, Appellant filed a Motion to Remove Void Sex Offender Classification. Within the motion, Appellant argued that his sex offender classification as a Tier III sexual predator with community notification is void because his offenses occurred prior to the enactment of the Adam Walsh Act (S.B. 10).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   He further argued that once an offender has been released from prison, he cannot be subjected to another sentencing to correct a trial court's flawed imposition of the sex offender classification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On October 25, 2015, the State filed its response. The State conceded that Appellant was incorrectly classified under the Adam Walsh Act, but argued that the trial court did have jurisdiction to vacate his Tier III prior classification and advise him that he was now classified under Megan's Law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 2, 2016, Appellant filed an objection to jurisdiction. The State filed a response and the trial court ultimately denied Appellant's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On September 20, 2016, Appellant appeared for a sex offender classification hearing. The trial court proceeded to inform Appellant of his requirements to register, pursuant to Megan's Law, as a habitual sex offender subject to community notification. On September 21, 2016, the court journalized its entry overruling Sturgill's jurisdictional motion. This timely appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"I.

Straley\n   </em>\n   , at \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 10} In the sole assignment of error, Appellant argues the trial court lacked jurisdiction to hold the sex offender classification hearing due to the fact he has served his sentence and his been released from incarceration for approximately two years. In particular, Appellant argues that the trial court must have classified him as a sex offender \"before or at the time of sentencing.\" Former R.C. 2905.09(B)(1) directed a court to hold a sex offender classification hearing prior to or at the time of sentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 11} The jurisdictional question was raised in\n   <em>\n    State v.

There, Miller was convicted in May 2009 of five counts of gross sexual imposition and one count of kidnapping with a sexual motivation. The convictions stemmed from multiple incidents occurring in August, 2007. He was sentenced to concurrent sentences and was classified as a Tier II sex offender under the Adam Walsh Act. Miller completed his sentences and was released from custody in 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 12} In 2012, Miller filed motions to correct and amend the registration requirements. He argued that the trial court's classification of him as a Tier II Sex Offender was void because his crimes were committed prior to the effective date of the Adam Walsh Act. Based on the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Williams, supra\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   court ordered that a sex-offender reclassification hearing be conducted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 13} During his hearing Miller objected to reclassification as a sex offender because he had completed his prison sentence for the underlying offenses. As such, he argued the court was without jurisdiction to conduct a reclassification hearing. The State, however, argued that Miller's status as a sexually oriented offender under Megan's Law attached by operation of law and therefore the court had the authority to notify him of this status. The trial court agreed and advised he would be classified as a sexually oriented offender by operation of law under the version of Megan's law that was in effect at the time of the offense. The court proceeded to provide the pertinent notification and registration requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 14} On appeal, Miller again made the jurisdictional argument.

Bell, a foster parent convicted of sexual battery and imposition of two teenage boys committed to his care, was sentenced to a five-year prison term in April 2008. He was also designated a Tier III sexual offender pursuant to the Adam Walsh Act. Given the sentencing date, the trial court followed the sexual classification requirements set forth in S.B. 10 rather than applying the prior version, known as Megan's Law, in effect at the time of Bell's crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 17} However, prior to Bell's release from prison, he was \"automatically\" reclassified as a sexually-oriented offender pursuant to Megan's Law, but did not receive a hearing before his reclassification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Approximately\n   one year after Bell's release from prison, the State moved to reclassify him a sexual predator, asserting his prior classification pursuant to S.B. 10 was an improper retroactive application. Bell opposed reclassification and argued that the trial court lacked jurisdiction reclassify him once he was released from prison. Ultimately, the trial court determined jurisdiction was proper and the trial court held a hearing at which time both parties presented evidence and the trial court concluded by designating Bell a sexual predator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 18} On appeal, Bell raised the jurisdictional argument.
