His first trial resulted in a hung jury. The case was retried, and the jury found Wright guilty as charged. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole, plus three years' imprisonment on one of the specifications. He now appeals that conviction. We find no merit in his eight assignments of error, and we affirm his conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The record shows that on March 28, 2010, at approximately 12:15 a.m., police officers were dispatched to 506 East 12th Street in the Pendleton area of Cincinnati. At that time, Pendleton was a high-crime area, with a lot of drug trafficking and violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Cincinnati police officer Richard Longworth arrived on the scene to find an SUV that had rolled back and hit another car. An excited woman came out of a doorway wanting to know if the individual in the car was still alive. Longworth opened the door, turned the vehicle off and put it in park. He found the driver, later identified as Richard Parks, slumped over inside. Longworth attempted to take the victim's pulse, and the victim's head moved slightly. Longworth saw bullet holes in his head and knew that he had died.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} The woman was Shavonne Bonner, who had once lived in the Pendleton area, which the residents referred to as \"up on the hill.\" She had known Wright since she was a child and considered him to be \"like family.\" At one time, she had dated\n   Wright's friend, Calvin Bolton. Although she and Bolton had parted ways, they remained friendly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} In 2009, Bonner began dating Parks. Bonner knew that Parks sold drugs in his west-end neighborhood. She also knew that Wright sold drugs \"up on the hill,\" and that generally sellers only conducted business in their own neighborhoods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} Late on March 27, 2010, Parks drove Bonner in a rented SUV to 12th Street where she met up with friends. They sat on the steps outside of a house while drinking and chatting. Parks asked if anyone knew where Wright and Bolton were, and when no one there indicated that they knew, Parks made a phone call. Afterwards, he told Bonner that he was leaving to pick up Wright and Bolton. A short time later, Bonner accidentally dropped her phone in her drink. She called Parks and asked him to bring her a phone before he left. When Parks did so, Bonner did not see anyone with him in the SUV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} Bonner then saw Parks drive away. About 15 minutes later, Parks's SUV \"came flying down the street\" and stopped a short distance away, as if it was being parked. Bonner could not see who was inside because the windows were tinted. She heard a gunshot and ducked down. When she looked up, she saw two black men get out of the SUV and run up 12th Street.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} She then saw the brake lights come on as the SUV backed into another car. She rushed over to the SUV and opened the driver's side door. Parks was leaning over to the right, and she put her hand on his arm and shook him. Blood covered her hand and her jacket. She started screaming and called the police.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} After police officers had secured the scene, Detective Jacob Wloszek arrived and saw Parks seated behind the steering wheel in the SUV with his hands folded in his lap. He had gunshot wounds to the back right side of his head. Blood spatters, brain matter, and skull fragments were found inside the vehicle. The police also found a plastic cup, a hat, a cell phone, two cell-phone chargers, drugs and cash inside. Wloszek stated that the presence of cash and drugs with some value inside the SUV made it less likely that robbery was the motive for the crime. Further, there was no damage to the outside of the SUV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Forensic pathologist Dr. Karen Looman examined the body. She determined that Parks had died from being shot four times in the back of the head. Because she did not observe any stippling around the entrance wounds, she determined that the shots were fired from an indeterminate distance, meaning at least 18 inches away. She also stated that Parks could have been shot by somebody behind him or he could have been shot while looking to the side.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Officer Leigh Cherni photographed the evidence at the scene and lifted eight fingerprints from the outside of the SUV. When the fingerprints were compared with known fingerprints, no matches were found. Five years later, on the eve of trial, the police resubmitted the fingerprints to a more up-to-date system. It showed that four prints matched Wright's. A fingerprint expert confirmed the match. He stated that from the orientation of the prints as they were found on the SUV's exterior, they appeared to have been made when Wright was closing the rear passenger door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Wloszek testified that Parks had been known to sell drugs and had been a prime suspect in two other homicides. After interviewing witnesses, Wloszek learned that the last people to see Parks before the murder were Wright and Bolton. He also heard that Marquez Smith,\n   who had grown up in the same area as Wright and Bolton, had recently been charged with a crime committed in the Pendleton area. He then contacted Smith's attorney to see if Smith had any information about Parks's murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 13} When Smith did not appear at the second trial, the trial court declared him to be an unavailable witness. The court then allowed the state to read his testimony from the first trial to the jury. The court also allowed the state to play to the jury a recording of Smith's statement to the police, over Wright's objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 14} Smith told police that shortly before the shooting, he had seen Parks driving a light-colored vehicle \"like a little mini truck,\" that appeared to be rented. He stated that Wright and Bolton were in the car with Parks, and that Parks drove the car down 13th Street. After seeing them drive by, Smith walked to a store at the top of 13th Street and stood by some people he knew who were gathered there. Then he saw the SUV drive down 12th Street and pull over. Parks was still driving, and Smith believed that Wright was sitting in the back seat. Some women there heard a gunshot that Smith did not hear because music was playing. Two men dressed in black jumped out of the SUV and ran in separate directions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 15} Michael Lewis had met Wright while growing up in the Pendleton neighborhood. He knew of Parks, but did not know him personally. Several days after Parks was shot, Lewis and Wright were selling drugs. Lewis stated that Wright put his arm around Lewis and said that he had to \"straighten that nigga from the lot with tats on his face\" because he had been trying to \"take over\" Wright's territory. Lewis knew that Wright was referring to Parks, and that to \"straighten\" him meant to kill him. Lewis did not talk to the police at that time, but gave the information when detectives contacted him months later while he was incarcerated on unrelated charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   {\u00b6 16} Michael Douthit testified that he knew Wright from seeing him in the Pendleton neighborhood. They were not friendly, but they acknowledged each other. Douthit also knew Bolton and Parks, and he stated that he and Parks were good friends. Douthit heard about Parks's murder from Parks's friends and family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Douthit stated that while he and Wright were both incarcerated in Kentucky, they had talked about Parks's murder. Wright originally denied shooting Parks. Later, Wright discussed Parks's alleged involvement in the murder of Ramone Johnson. Wright stated that after Johnson's murder, he had called Parks and told him to \"come up to the hill.\" Then Wright said that he \"got in the back of the car and shot [Parks] in the back of the head.\" Douthit stated that Wright killed Parks because of the \"Ramone situation\" and because Wright \"didn't know if [Parks] was gonna get him before he got [Parks].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. Batson Challenge\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 18} In his first assignment of error, Wright contends that the trial court erred in overruling his objection to the state's use of a peremptory challenge to exclude an African-American juror from the jury panel. He argues that the state's use of that challenge without a valid race-neutral reason violated his right to equal protection. This assignment of error is not well taken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 19} In\n   <em>\n    Batson v.

He stated that (1) the juror had a religious background and some people \"connected to her\" ministered to prisoners; (2) she had a strong personality and the prosecutor was concerned that she might not listen and consider all of the evidence; (3) she was overly receptive to the defendant's point of view of the case as expressed during voir dire; (4) she stated that she would be angry \"to the point it would take control over her\" if someone suggested something that was not true about her; (5) the prosecutor was not satisfied with her answers when she was asked about people in jail getting case consideration; (6) she indicated that she had known a police officer and that they did not have a \"good rapport\"; and (7) she indicated that she was \"engaged in a profession of exactness.\" The prosecutor indicated that it was the \"cumulative effect\" of all these reasons that caused him to use the peremptory challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   {\u00b6 23} Thus, the prosecutor provided race-neutral reasons for the use of the challenge.

The burden is on the proponent to establish unavailability. A showing of unavailability must be based on the testimony of witnesses rather than hearsay not under oath unless unavailability is conceded by the party against whom the statement is being offered.\n   <em>\n    Keairns\n   </em>\n   at paragraph three of the syllabus ;\n   <em>\n    Nix\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 26-27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 26} In this case, the prosecutor did not present sworn testimony about its efforts to procure Smith's attendance at trial. But, the trial court stated that \"based on the off-record conversation that while defense is going to object, * * * they don't dispute what [the prosecutor] has said and they're not requiring him to put on any of the detectives as witnesses. It's just more a matter of objection to the testimony itself without necessarily refuting the facts.\" Wright's counsel did not contradict that statement, although he did not concede that Smith was unavailable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 27} Wright also did not object on the basis that sworn testimony was required. In\n   <em>\n    Nix\n   </em>\n   , this court, under similar facts, overruled an assignment of error in which the defendant alleged error in the trial court's finding that a witness was unavailable. We stated, \"we hold that the trial court and the prosecutor could have reasonably inferred from what Nix's attorney had said, and had not said, that a concession was made regarding the efforts made by the prosecution to locate\" the witness.\n   <em>\n    Nix\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32.

Smith was personally served with a subpoena. He appeared on the first day of trial. When he was not called as a witness that day, the prosecutor told him to return the next day. He was present the next day when the jury was viewing the crime scene, but left the courthouse. Police officers called Smith and sent him texts telling him to return, and he responded several times. When Smith did not appear at the time he said he would, the state asked the court to order a body attachment. The police contacted Smith's parole officer, who unsuccessfully attempted to locate him. Police officers also went to Smith's house and his parents' house in an effort to detain him, but could not find him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Smith had testified at the previous trial, but he was a reluctant witness. He maintained that he did not remember anything that he had told police. Consequently, he was called as a court witness, and the court allowed the prosecutor to cross-examine him. The prosecutor stated, \"I think the police would tell you that he's on the run and actively trying to avoid being brought before you for the purpose of testifying in these proceedings.\" Under the circumstances, we cannot hold that the trial court erred in determining that the state met its burden to show that Smith was unavailable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   {\u00b6 30} Evid.R. 804(B)(1) allows for a hearsay exception for a declarant's former testimony when the declarant is unavailable. Smith's testimony from the previous trial fell under this hearsay exception,\n   because it came from an adversarial proceeding and Wright had the opportunity and similar motive to develop the testimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Garnett\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist.

Consequently, the trial court did not err in allowing the state to read Smith's former testimony at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 31} Wright next contends that Smith's unsworn statement to the police should not have been read into the record. As the state contends, the testimony fell under the hearsay exception for recorded recollection set forth in Evid.R. 803(5).

But he acknowledged making the statement to the police and that, at the time, his knowledge was fresh. He denied lying to the police and stated that he was being as honest as he could when he talked to them. Consequently, the statement was admissible under the recorded-recollection exception to the hearsay rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 13-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Next, Wright argues that the state should not have been permitted to play the recording of the statement after having read it into the record.

On cross-examination, Wright's counsel implied Douthit had fabricated his testimony to receive favorable treatment. Consequently, the detective could testify about Douthit's prior consistent statement. Sufficient impeachment occurred to amount to a charge of recent fabrication at trial, therefore the statements were not hearsay under Evid.R. 801(D)(1)(b), and the trial court did not err in allowing the detective to testify regarding those statements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lukacs\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15 ;\n   <em>\n    Jones\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36-37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   {\u00b6 41} In sum, we find no reversible error in the admission of testimony of which Wright complains.

The record shows that Wright's attorney provided his client with a diligent and thorough defense. Wright has not demonstrated that his counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness or that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the results of the proceeding would have been otherwise. Therefore, he has failed to meet his burden to show ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   at 687-689,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Hackney\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 37-38.

Weight and Sufficiency\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   {\u00b6 57} In his seventh assignment of error, Wright contends that the evidence was\n   insufficient to support his conviction. Our review of the record shows that a rational trier of fact, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, could have found that the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt all of the elements of aggravated murder, along with the accompanying specifications. Therefore, the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

This argument ignores the fact that Wright's fingerprints were found on the outside of the SUV that Parks was driving. But even if his fingerprints had not been found, no rule of law exists that a witness's testimony must be corroborated by physical evidence.\n   <em>\n    Thomas\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist.

He also argues that the state's evidence was not credible. But in deciding if the evidence was sufficient, we neither resolve evidentiary conflicts nor assess the credibility of witnesses.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2013%20WL%206535216\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   {\u00b6 59} Wright also argues that the conviction was against the manifest weight of the evidence. After reviewing the record, we cannot say that the trier of fact lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that we must reverse the conviction and order a new trial. Therefore, the conviction was not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

Sentencing Notification\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   {\u00b6 60} Finally, in his eighth assignment of error, Wright contends that the trial court erred by failing to inform him at sentencing about the requirement to submit to DNA testing and the consequences for failing to do so under R.C. 2901.07(B). But he acknowledges that this court has held that the statute does not confer any substantive rights on the defendant. Therefore, the court's failure to notify Wright about DNA testing was harmless and did not prejudice him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Taylor\n   </em>\n   , 1st Dist.

Summary\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   {\u00b6 61} In sum, we find no merit in Wright's assignments of error. The trial court committed no reversible error, and Wright received a fair trial. Consequently, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Cunningham and Zayas, JJ., concur.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
