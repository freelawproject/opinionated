For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In 1989, Young was hired as a corrections officer with the State of Ohio, Department of Rehabilitation and Correction (\"DRC\"), and he continues to be employed in that capacity. Young is a member of the Ohio Civil Service Employees Association union (\"OCSEA\"), and his employment with DRC is subject to a collective bargaining agreement (\"CBA\") between the DRC and the OCSEA. DRC contracts with OSU Hospitals for the medical treatment of DRC's inmates. As part of that medical services agreement, DRC assigns corrections officers to work at OSU Hospitals to provide security in connection with the treatment of those inmates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 3} Since approximately 1990, DRC had assigned Young to work at OSU Hospitals. However, in September 2008, an incident occurred involving Young and staff at OSU Hospitals. The exact nature and fault relating to the incident are disputed. On November 13, 2008, OSU Hospitals formally requested that DRC no longer assign Young to its facilities. The next week, DRC informed OSU Hospitals that the request would be followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 4} Young filed a grievance through his union, OCSEA, based on his contention that DRC violated its agreement with the union to enable DRC employees to bid on workplace assignments based on seniority. According to Young, he was improperly denied his request to be assigned to OSU Hospitals. In December 2009, an arbitrator issued a decision upholding Young's grievance. The arbitrator ruled that DRC had violated its agreement with OCSEA regarding the assignment of employees, and the arbitrator directed DRC to assign Young to OSU Hospitals within one month of his decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Despite DRC's requests for OSU Hospitals to accept the arbitrator's decision, OSU Hospitals has refused repeatedly to permit Young back on its property to work. In January 2010, DRC informed OSU Hospitals of the arbitrator's ruling and indicated that it was planning to assign Young back to work at OSU Hospitals. OSU Hospitals acknowledged the arbitrator's decision but informed DRC of its unchanged decision not to permit Young to work at its facilities. A few days later, Young's DRC supervisor directed Young to go to an OSU Hospitals facility for work. When Young arrived at the OSU Hospitals facility, he was confronted by OSU Hospitals' security personnel who instructed him to leave the premises. In February 2012, DRC informed OSU Hospitals that Young again had requested to be assigned to its facilities, and DRC granted that request pursuant to the CBA. A few days later, OSU Hospitals informed DRC that its position regarding Young's assignment to its facilities had not changed, and Young would not be permitted to work on the medical center campus. Despite being notified of OSU Hospitals' position, Young apparently attempted to work on the medical center campus in July and August 2012, and both times he was escorted from the campus. In September 2012, OSU Hospitals warned Young that if he again entered the medical center campus in an attempt to work, he would be criminally trespassing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 6} In November 2013, Young filed suit against OSU Hospitals in the Court of Claims of Ohio. In February 2014, he filed an amended complaint against OSU Hospitals\n   in that court, asserting claims of libel, slander, tortious interference with a business relationship, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. OSU Hospitals filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(1) and (6). In July 2014, the Court of Claims granted, in part, OSU Hospitals' motion to dismiss. The Court of Claims dismissed without prejudice Young's tortious interference claim for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. As to Young's claims for libel, slander, and intentional infliction of emotional distress, the Court of Claims denied the motion to dismiss, and set the case for trial in the normal course. Young later voluntarily dismissed those remaining claims, and he did not appeal the Court of Claims' dismissal of his tortious interference claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 7} In October 2014, Young filed a complaint in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, asserting claims for libel, slander, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and tortious interference with a business relationship. In December 2014, OSU Hospitals moved to dismiss the matter pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(1). The trial court denied OSU Hospitals' motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction based on its finding that it had jurisdiction over the tortious interference claim pursuant to R.C. Chapter 4117. In resolving the motion to dismiss, the trial court did not analyze Young's other claims. The matter proceeded with discovery, and, in February 2016, OSU Hospitals moved for summary judgment pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C). In support of its summary judgment motion, OSU Hospitals again argued the court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, and it also argued Young's tortious interference claim failed as a matter of law because it was barred by the statute of limitations and because Young cannot meet the required elements for that claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 8} In June 2016, the trial court granted OSU Hospitals' motion for summary judgment. The trial court, again only analyzing Young's tortious interference claim, reconsidered the issue of its subject-matter jurisdiction and found that it lacked jurisdiction over that claim. The trial court also found that Young's tortious interference claim is time-barred based on the applicable statute of limitations. Further, the trial court determined that Young's tortious interference claim fails as a matter of law because OSU Hospitals was privileged to prohibit Young, as a DRC employee, from entering its premises. The trial court dismissed all of Young's claims against OSU Hospitals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 9} Young timely appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Assignment of Error\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} Young assigns the following error for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court committed error by granting defendant-appellee's motion for summary judgment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 11} Young's sole assignment of error asserts the trial court erred in granting OSU Hospitals' motion for summary judgment. In support, Young argues the trial court erred in finding that it lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over his tortious interference claim, that his tortious interference claim is barred by the applicable statute of limitations, and that he cannot, as a matter of law, prove the elements of tortious interference.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because the trial court properly dismissed Young's tortious interference claim for lack of subject-matter\n   jurisdiction, his assignment of error lacks merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   {\u00b6 12} The threshold issue before the trial court was whether it had subject-matter jurisdiction over Young's claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Turner v.
