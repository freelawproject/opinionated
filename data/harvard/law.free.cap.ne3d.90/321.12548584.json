(\"Bayview\"). For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Procedural History and Substantive Facts\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In June 2008, St. Cyr purchased a home in Cleveland, Ohio. He executed a promissory note in the amount of $106,575. The note was secured by a mortgage against this property, executed in favor of Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc. (\"MERS\") as nominee for Taylor, Bean &amp; Whitaker Mortgage Corp. and its successors and assigns. In May 2010, MERS assigned the mortgage to BAC Home Loans Servicing, L.P., f.k.a., Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, L.P. In March 2014, Bank of America, N.A., successor by merger to BAC Home Loans Servicing, L.P., f.k.a. Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, L.P., assigned the mortgage to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\"). Thereafter, in April 2014, HUD assigned the mortgage to appellee, Bayview, who was the current loan servicer at the time this action was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In July 2015, Bayview filed its complaint in foreclosure, seeking judgment on the note and foreclosure of the mortgage. Bayview alleged that it was entitled to enforce the note, it was in possession of the note, and it was the record holder of the mortgage at the time it filed the complaint. Bayview further alleged that St. Cyr's loan account had fallen into default and St. Cyr had not cured the default,\n   which resulted in the acceleration of the note and mortgage. Bayview stated that it was therefore entitled to foreclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 4} When St. Cyr did not answer the complaint, Bayview moved for default judgment. At the default judgment hearing, however, St. Cyr filed a motion for leave to file an answer instanter, which the trial court granted. Thereafter, upon the court's instructions, Bayview provided St. Cyr with a loss mitigation packet and trial payment plan offer. St. Cyr rejected Bayview's offer and requested a case management conference be scheduled. The court granted St. Cyr's motion for a case management conference and ordered all discovery to be completed by April 18, 2016, and all dispositive motions due by May 2, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 5} On February 29, 2016, St. Cyr served upon Bayview a request for admissions, among other discovery requests. On April 15, 2016, Bayview filed its first notice of service of discovery. On April 18, 2016, Bayview filed a \"combined motion to amend case management schedule and motion for extension to respond\" to St. Cyr's discovery requests. St. Cyr, however, filed a brief in opposition to this motion. Both motions were denied on April 20, 2016, and with this order, the court indicated that all \"nonexpert discovery is now closed.\" On April 21 and April 25, Bayview filed notices of service of discovery responses. Bayview filed a notice of service of supplemental discovery responses on May 9, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 6} After discovery was complete, St. Cyr moved for summary judgment, alleging, essentially, that because Bayview failed to timely respond to St. Cyr's discovery requests, Bayview admitted to certain facts and these facts establish that no genuine issues of material fact exist and he was therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Bayview then filed its own motion for summary judgment, a motion for default judgment, and a brief in opposition to St. Cyr's motion for summary judgment. Along with its reply brief in support of its summary judgment, Bayview moved the court to \"withdraw deemed admissions or for the court to rule that the same were not admitted and allow responses [the] plaintiff provided.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On June 6, 2016, the trial court granted Bayview's motion for summary judgment and motion for default judgment, and it denied St. Cyr's motion. The trial court issued a supplemental journal entry on June 13, 2016. St. Cyr now appeals, assigning two errors for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   I. The trial court erred in granting Bayview's motion for summary judgment and in denying St. Cyr's motion for summary judgment, particularly given the deemed admissions by Bayview.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   II. The trial court erred in granting Bayview's motion for summary judgment and in denying St. Cyr's motion for summary judgment, as Bayview failed to provide sufficient evidence of entitlement to foreclosure and/or damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Summary Judgment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 8} Summary judgment is appropriate when: (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) after construing the evidence most favorably for the party against whom the motion is made, reasonable minds can reach only a conclusion that is adverse to the nonmoving party.

St. Cyr contends that the trial court erred when it denied his motion for summary judgment and granted Bayview's motion for summary judgment because Bayview admitted it had no legal interest in the note or the mortgage by virtue of failing to timely respond to St. Cyr's request for admissions. In support, St. Cyr attached to his motion the request for admissions propounded to Bayview, which called upon the plaintiff to admit, among other statements, that it has no \"legal interest, a beneficial interest, or any other interest in the mortgage or note\" (Request No. 1); it has no documents demonstrating \"the note was physically transferred to the plaintiff before commencement of the instant matter\" (Request No. 9); the plaintiff \"was not the party who entered and maintained MERS records\" (Request No. 10); and the original lender, Taylor, Bean &amp; Whitaker \"had no right to assign any purported interest in the property, note, mortgage, or otherwise\" (Request No. 15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 13} St. Cyr also contends that even if the requests were not deemed admitted, there were no genuine issues of material fact and he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In support, he advances the following arguments: (1) Bayview's affidavit in support of summary judgment was insufficient; and (2) Bayview failed to provide sufficient evidence that it was a real party in interest, it had standing, it was entitled to foreclosure on the property, and it was entitled to damages in the amount of $104,717.43 with interest from January 1, 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 14} We first address St. Cyr's request for admissions propounded to Bayview. St. Cyr alleges that because Bayview's discovery responses were served upon him three weeks or more past the discovery deadline, the responses must be deemed admitted and, therefore, he is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In response, Bayview provides that, given the voluminous nature of the discovery requests, it required additional time in which to respond, and on March 24, 2016, it requested and received approval from St. Cyr's counsel to extend the time to file its discovery responses until April 18, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On April 18, Bayview requested another extension and it received approval from defense counsel to extend the time until May 9, 2016. Bayview further states that after it received defense counsel's consent, St. Cyr withdrew its consent that same day via an after-hours email from defense counsel. Bayview learned that its motion for extension had been denied on April 20, and it served its response to the defendant's first set of admissions the following day. Bayview served supplemental discovery responses (to a request for production of documents) that included a new payoff quote on May 9, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 15} It is well settled in Ohio that in accordance with Civ.R. 36(A), \" 'the matter set forth in the requests for admissions is deemed admitted if they are not answered within rule.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bank of N.Y. v.

Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, L.P. to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\"); and a copy of the assignment of mortgage from HUD to Bayview. St. Cyr was not a named party to any of the above assignments, nor a third-party beneficiary of the assignments. He therefore lacked standing to challenge the assignments or any of the circumstances upon which the assignments were created.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 41} Moreover, the allegation of an improper assignment is irrelevant because, under Ohio law, the mortgage \"follows the note\" it secures.\n   <em>\n    Najar\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 65, citing\n   <em>\n    U.S. Bank N.A. v.

Therefore, the negotiation of a note operates as an equitable assignment of the mortgage, even though the mortgage is not assigned or delivered.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   (Citation omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Marcino\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, the physical transfer of the note endorsed in blank constitutes an equitable assignment of the mortgage regardless of whether the mortgage is validly assigned.\n   <em>\n    Najar\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Marcino\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. v.

However, Bayview attached to its summary judgment a copy of the payment history, and Jackson attests in his affidavit that the attached payment history was a true and accurate representation of the account activity on St. Cyr's loan account. Jackson further attested to the default and the accuracy of the notices of default served upon St. Cyr, as well as a \"face to face\" notice dated September 14, 2011. These documents, and the affidavit that authenticates them, established the default and the amount due and owing as $104,717.43, with interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 43} In light of the foregoing, we find that Bayview provided evidence that it was entitled to enforce the note before filing the complaint in foreclosure and there is no genuine issue of material fact concerning its standing to commence this action as a real party in interest. St. Cyr's response to Bayview's motion for summary judgment, in which St. Cyr relies upon Bayview's deemed admissions, challenges Bayview's affidavit in support of its motion for summary judgment, and relied upon his own unsupported allegations, failed to meet his reciprocal burden to set forth specific facts showing there is a genuine issue that remains to be litigated. Accordingly, the trial court properly granted summary judgment in favor of Bayview and against St. Cyr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 44} St. Cyr's assignments of error are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 45} Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   PATRICIA ANN BLACKMON, J., and LARRY A.
