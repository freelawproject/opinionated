WRIGHT, J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Appellant, Corey O'Stricker, appeals two trial court judgments resulting\n   in the dismissal of his medical malpractice suit. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 2} In 2008, O'Stricker broke his right femur during a basketball game and was transported and admitted to Robinson Memorial Hospital. The following day, Dr. Michael L. Pryce, M.D. of Stow-Kent Orthopedics, Inc. advised O'Stricker that he needed surgery. Pryce is an orthopedic surgeon. During the surgery, O'Stricker began violently kicking his right leg which resulted in the pin that was being placed in his leg to bump his hipbone and fracture his hip. The hip fracture required a second surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   {\u00b6 3} O'Stricker originally filed suit in 2009, but voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice in 2010.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In October 2011, O'Stricker refiled his suit against Robinson, Pryce, Stow-Kent, and John and Jane Does 1-10 for medical negligence. The trial court subsequently dismissed the claims against Price and Stow-Kent based on O'Stricker's deficient affidavit of merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The trial court granted Robinson summary judgment as to all claims based on anesthesia services because O'Stricker did not timely name the anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist, who were independent contractors, within the applicable statute of limitations. O'Stricker does not take issue with this decision on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On July 5, 2016, the case proceeded to jury trial against the only remaining defendant, Robinson. At the close of O'Stricker's case, Robinson moved for a directed verdict, which the trial court granted. O'Stricker appeals the trial court's decision dismissing Pryce and Stow-Kent and its judgment granting a directed verdict in Robinson's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 7} He asserts four assigned errors:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 8} \"[1] The trial court abused its discretion and committed prejudicial error where it improperly directed a dismissal of defendants Michael L. Pryce, M.D. and Stow-Kent Orthopedics, Inc. without prior notice of intention to dismiss and hearing pursuant to Civ.R. 41(B)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 9} \"[2] The trial court committed error of law and abused its discretion in dismissing the complaint for lack of proper Affidavit of Merit where the cured Affidavit of Merit was properly attached and filed in a timely manner to the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 10} \"[3] The trial court abused its discretion and committed prejudicial error in failing to apply the doctrine of res judicata or collateral estoppels to the second motion by defendants-appellees, Michael L. Pryce, M.D. and Stow-Kent Orthopedics, Inc. to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 11} \"[4] The trial court committed error of law withdrawing case from jury and abused its discretion rendering judgment at end of plaintiff-appellant's direct case requiring specific expert testimony of orthopedic surgeon or anesthesiologist in establishing breach of the standard of care. (T-d 92).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Appellant's first two alleged errors challenge the trial court's decision dismissing his claims against appellees, Michael L. Pryce, M.D. and Stow-Kent Orthopedics, Inc. (Pryce and Stow-Kent). He argues the trial court failed to provide him any notice of its intention to dismiss these defendants, and that its dismissal was erroneous since his second affidavit of merit cured the alleged defects and complied with Civ.R.10(D)(2). We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 13} Pryce and Stow-Kent moved the court to dismiss the refiled complaint against them based on appellant's failure to attach a sufficient affidavit of merit to his complaint. Robinson did not join their motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   {\u00b6 14} O'Stricker was granted an extension of time to respond and filed a brief in opposition challenging the basis for the motion to dismiss. The trial court then permitted O'Stricker to file an amended affidavit of merit. In response, Pryce renewed his motion to dismiss based on the fact that the affidavit was still insufficient to satisfy Civ.R. 10(D)(2). Following a hearing, the trial court granted Pryce and Stow-Kent's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   {\u00b6 15} \"[P]ursuant to Civ.R. 10(D)(2), an affidavit of merit is required to establish the adequacy of a medical complaint, and the failure to file an affidavit of merit renders it subject to dismissal for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

On appeal, Woods argued that Civ.R. 10(D)(2) does not require an affidavit of merit to include facts regarding each named defendant and \"state specifically what each defendant did that would amount to medical negligence.

According to the language employed by Dr. Jones, he may be of the opinion that only one of the numerous [defendants] was negligent. At the very least, Dr. Jones could have indicated that the standard of care was breached by every defendant named in the complaint.

Instead, Nicholson simply recited the facts from O'Stricker's operative report and noted that the cause of O'Stricker's second fracture was O'Stricker \"getting light in anesthesia\" and his violent kicking during surgery. Appellant did not set forth any evidence showing that either Robinson or its employees breached any duty or standard of care owed to him. Furthermore, Robinson had previously been granted partial summary judgment for claims arising from anesthesia because O'Stricker failed to name the anesthesiologist or the nurse anesthetist, who were the hospital's independent contractors, before the statute of limitations ran.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   {\u00b6 64} Thus, the trial court properly directed a verdict in Robinson's favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   O'Stricker's final assignment of error lacks merit and is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   {\u00b6 65} The trial court's judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   DIANE V.
