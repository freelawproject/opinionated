CELEBREZZE, JR., J.:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   {\u00b6 1} Defendant-appellant, Michael Miller (\"Miller\") brings this appeal challenging the trial court's judgment classifying him as a sexual predator. Specifically, Miller argues that the trial court failed to conduct an adequate classification hearing, the state failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he is a sexual predator, and that his sexual predator classification violates due process and equal protection of the law. After a thorough review of the record and law, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} The instant matter arose from an August 2001 incident during which Miller attacked the victim, D.D., as she was walking to a friend's house. D.D. alleged that Miller grabbed her, forced her into an abandoned house, and raped her vaginally,\n   orally, and anally. D.D. submitted to a rape kit examination after the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On August 26, 2015, the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation received a DNA hit matching Miller's DNA to the sperm sample from D.D.'s rape kit. As a result, Miller was indicted on November 23, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} In Cuyahoga C.P. No. CR-15-601332-A, the Cuyahoga County Grand Jury returned a four-count indictment charging Miller with three counts of rape, in violation of R.C. 2907.02(A)(2), and one count of kidnapping, in violation of R.C. 2905.01(A)(4) with a sexual motivation specification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} The parties reached a plea agreement. The state amended the rape count charged in Count 1 to sexual battery, in violation of R.C. 2907.03(A)(1). The trial court advised Miller that by pleading guilty to sexual battery, Miller \"would be deemed a sexual offender.\" (Tr. 3.) On June 9, 2016, Miller pled guilty to the sexual battery count, and the remaining counts were nolled. During the change of plea hearing, the parties agreed that the trial court would hold a hearing to determine the appropriate sex offender classification. The trial court reviewed the registration requirements for sexual predators, habitual sexual offenders, and sexually oriented offenders. The trial court ordered a presentence investigation report (\"PSI\") and referred Miller to the court psychiatric clinic for a H.B. 180 sexual offender evaluation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} The trial court held a sentencing hearing on July 13, 2016. At sentencing, the trial court also conducted a sex offender classification hearing. After considering the parties' arguments regarding the appropriate classification, the PSI, and the court psychiatric clinic's report, the trial court classified Miller as a sexual predator. The trial court proceeded to the sentencing phase of the hearing and imposed a prison term of five years on the sexual battery count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On July 18, 2016, Miller filled the instant appeal challenging the trial court's sexual predator classification.

First, it is critical that a record be created for review. Therefore, the prosecutor and defense counsel should identify on the record those portions of the trial transcript, victim impact statements, presentence report, and other pertinent aspects of the defendant's criminal and social history that both relate to the factors set forth in R.C. 2950.09(B)(2) and are probative of the issue of whether the offender is likely to engage in the future in one or more sexually oriented offenses. If the conviction is old, as in this case, the state may need to introduce a portion of the actual trial record; if the case was recently tried, the same trial court may not need to actually review the record. In either case, a clear and accurate record of what evidence or testimony was considered should be preserved, including any exhibits, for purposes of any potential appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Second, an expert may be required, as discussed above, to assist the trial court in determining whether the offender is likely to engage in the future in one or more sexually oriented offenses. Therefore,\n   either side should be allowed to present expert opinion by testimony or written report to assist the trial court in its determination, especially when there is little information available beyond the conviction itself. While providing an expert at state expense is within the discretion of the trial court, the lack of other criteria to assist in predicting the future behavior of the offender weighs heavily in favor of granting such a request.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, the trial court should consider the statutory factors listed in R.C. 2950.09(B)(2), and should discuss on the record the particular evidence and factors upon which it relies in making its determination regarding the likelihood of recidivism.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Eppinger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1149039\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/91/158/\">\n    91 Ohio St.3d at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=743%20N.E.2d%20881\">\n    743 N.E.2d 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

He fails to identify any specific procedural inadequacy or irregularity, and suggests that the trial court's hearing was \"perfunctory in nature.\" Appellant's brief at 7, citing\n   <em>\n    Eppinger\n   </em>\n   . Furthermore, Miller contends that the trial court failed to make the necessary finding that he was likely to commit another sexually oriented offense in the future, nor created an adequate record reflecting the basis for the sexual predator classification. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The record reflects that all three\n   <em>\n    Eppinger\n   </em>\n   objectives were achieved during the trial court's classification hearing. The trial court requested \"some argument or evidence with regard to the House Bill 180 sexual predator classification.\" (Tr. 13.) Both the prosecutor and Miller's counsel discussed the pertinent aspects of the victim's statement, the PSI, the Static-99 report, the court psychiatric clinic's report, and Miller's criminal and social history.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 16} First, the prosecutor requested that the trial court find Miller to be a sexual predator based on the factors enumerated in R.C. 2950.09(B)(3). The prosecutor asserted that Miller's criminal history included convictions for robbery, felonious assault, drug trafficking, and having weapons while under disability. The prosecutor directed the trial court to the Static-99 report and expressed concern about Miller's antisocial personality disorder. The prosecutor asserted that Miller was found to be a \"moderate-high\" risk for reoffending and committing a sexual offense in the future. (Tr. 15.) The prosecutor provided the following account of Miller's conduct:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [this] was a stranger rape. The victim * * * was walking home from a friend's house when she was grabbed by [Miller]. She was pulled into an abandoned house. She was anally raped at that point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   She was-[Miller] tried to force her into the basement of the house. She would not go; [Miller] dragged her up into the second floor of the house and at that time he orally and vaginally raped her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   All while this is happening, your Honor, [Miller] is telling her not to make eye contact or he will kill her. This was a\n   sentiment that was repeated to her on multiple occasions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   When [Miller] was done, he told her to stay in the room or he would kill her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (Tr. 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   {\u00b6 17} Second, Miller's counsel opined that none of the R.C. 2950.09 factors were applicable. Miller's counsel emphasized that Miller was 14 years old when he committed the offense and that Miller was 28 years old at the time of sentencing. Miller's counsel asserted that Miller had never committed any sexual offenses, either as a juvenile or an adult. Miller's counsel stated that the victim, who was 36 years old at the time of the offense, was neither a child nor a teenager. Miller's counsel explained that the report from the court psychiatric clinic contained two different findings regarding Miller's likelihood of reoffending: \"low to moderate\" and \"moderate to high.\" (Tr. 19.) Miller's counsel argued that the state failed to meet its burden of demonstrating that Miller will commit sexual violations or offenses in the future by a preponderance of the evidence, nor presented clear and convincing evidence that Miller is a sexual predator. Miller's counsel directed the trial court to the \"nonrisk factors\" identified in the court psychiatric clinic's report:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [Miller] never had any prior sex offenses. He has no preference for children. He has never had nor did he before or has he since been required to have sexual offender treatment. * * * He has no deviance preference in terms of sexual orientation. * * * [Miller has] lived for a number of years with a partner who is here today, his significant other, by whom he has a child.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   (Tr. 20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Third, Miller addressed the court. He apologized to the victim and accepted responsibility for his conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 19} Because Miller pled guilty to sexual battery, there was not a trial transcript or record for the parties to introduce or the trial court to review. The trial court reviewed the statistics set forth in the court psychiatric clinic's report, which indicated that Miller was a \"moderate-high\" risk of reoffending. (Tr. 24.) The trial court reviewed the factors that indicated Miller was likely to reoffend and the mitigating factors regarding Miller's likelihood of reoffending. The trial court addressed Miller's antisocial personality disorder diagnosis: \"[t]he antisocial personality disorder diagnosis is also a great concern where the lack of empathy for others and [Miller's] acting out to the detriment of others and victimizing people. Those traits and behaviors would indicate more likely to recidivate.\" (Tr. 26.) Finally, the trial court acknowledged that the victim was \"terrorized and brutally assaulted.\" (Tr. 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Based on these factors, the trial court concluded that the state met its burden of presenting clear and convincing evidence that Miller is a sexual predator. The trial court classified Miller as a sexual predator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Accordingly, the trial court created a sufficient and thorough record for review. The record contains the court psychiatric clinic's report, which assisted the trial court in determining whether Miller was likely to reoffend in the future. Furthermore, the statutory factors set forth in former R.C. 2950.09(B)(3) were addressed by the prosecutor and Miller's counsel, and considered by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Miller's argument regarding the trial court's failure to specifically find that he was likely to commit another sexually oriented offense in the future is misplaced.

The trial court was well within its discretion to consider these reports and statements in making its sexual predator determination, and the state had no obligation to formally introduce these documents into evidence. Accordingly, Miller cannot demonstrate that the outcome of the classification hearing clearly would have been different but for the alleged error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   {\u00b6 28} Miller further argues that there was not clear and convincing evidence in the record indicating that he is a sexual predator. Miller emphasizes that he was 14 at the time of the incident, and asserts that \"[s]ince the age of 14, when this offense took place, [Miller] never re-offended.\" Appellant's brief at 9-10. Miller suggests that the evidence adduced at the classification hearing only supports a sexually oriented offender classification. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   {\u00b6 29} Miller's assertion that he did not reoffend after the August 2001 incident is belied by the record. In fact, Miller even acknowledges that he \"has had contact with the criminal justice system\" since the August 2001 incident. Appellant's brief at 9. However, he clarifies that the offenses he committed after the August 2001 incident were not sexually oriented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   {\u00b6 30} After reviewing the record, we find that multiple R.C. 2950.09(B)(3) factors support the trial court's classification of Miller as a sexual predator. Miller's criminal history consists of a 2011 conviction for felonious assault,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   a 2008 conviction for attempted escape,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   a 2007 conviction for robbery and having weapons while under disability,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a 2007 conviction for drug possession.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although both the prosecutor and the trial court expressed concern about Miller's antisocial personality disorder diagnosis, Miller's counsel did not address these concerns, present any evidence regarding Miller's mental health, or surmise how the diagnosis would impact the likelihood of reoffending. The Static-99 report placed Miller in the \"moderate-high\" risk category of reoffending. (Tr. 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   {\u00b6 31} The trial court considered the factors that indicated Miller is likely to reoffend:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   the factors related to whether that would indicate [Miller] would be likely to reoffend was the fact that this was an unrelated victim; that there's been at the very least mild substance abuse issues and the data, the information in the PSI and his prior criminal history would indicate that that's a very conservative estimate. In fact [Miller] indicates he can't even recall what happened back in that time period. He has other prior violent offenses, that is, prior to today. He had several violent juvenile arrests\n   as well prior to this incident. In fact the month of May, July and August 8th prior to this August 31st [2001] incident there [were] cases filed for robbery, aggravated menacing and assault. * * * And again [Miller was] adjudicated delinquent for an aggravated burglary in January from an arrest that occurred in January of 2002. * * * So those prior offenses would weigh in favor of him recidivating.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   (Tr. 24-26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   {\u00b6 32} The trial court also considered the factors that mitigate Miller's likelihood of reoffending:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   there's a lack of prior sexual offenses in [Miller's] criminal history. There's no deviant sexual preferences with respect to children or otherwise. He hadn't had an opportunity to complete any treatment. No male child victims. And the fact that he's had somewhat of a continuous romantic partner for two years or more although he's never been married.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   (Tr. 26-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   {\u00b6 33} Accordingly, after reviewing the record-including Miller's prior criminal and juvenile record, history of violence, \"moderate-high\" risk of reoffending, the nature of Miller's offense, and Miller's antisocial personality disorder diagnosis-we find that the trial court's sexual predator classification is supported by competent, credible evidence. Further, the trial court considered the relevant factors enumerated in former R.C. 2950.09(B)(3) in classifying Miller as a sexual predator. We cannot say that the trial court lost its way in determining that the mitigating factors did not outweigh the factors indicating Miller is likely to reoffend. Accordingly, the trial court's sexual predator classification is not against the manifest weight of the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 34} Finally, in light of his guilty plea to sexual battery, Miller takes issue with the prosecutor's description of his conduct as rape. Miller's counsel did not object to the prosecutor's description of Miller's conduct. It appears that Miller's counsel addressed the prosecutor's description during counsel's argument regarding classification. Miller's counsel explained, \"[t]he allegation is that [Miller] engaged in conduct other than what he pled to. [Miller's] plea was to a sexual battery.\" (Tr. 19.) Miller does not explain how he was prejudiced by the prosecutor's description.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 35} At the outset of the classification and sentencing hearing, the trial court correctly recognized that Miller pled guilty to sexual battery, a third-degree felony violation of R.C. 2907.03(A)(1).
