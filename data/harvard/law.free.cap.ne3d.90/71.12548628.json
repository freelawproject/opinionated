The relevant facts leading to this appeal are as follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   {\u00b6 2} Appellee MWCD owns certain real estate in Guernsey County and Noble County, in the vicinity of the Senecaville Reservoir. Appellants are the owners of real property in Senecaville, Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} On or about February 21, 2013, MWCD, as lessor, entered into an oil and gas lease with Appellee Antero Resources Corporation as lessee, concerning approximately 7,000 acres of land in Guernsey and Noble Counties. A memorandum of lease was recorded on February 22, 2013 in the Noble County Recorder's Office. An additional\n   memorandum of oil and gas lease was recorded on February 22, 2013 in the Guernsey County Recorder's Office.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   {\u00b6 4} On October 1, 2013, prior to the initiation of litigation in the present case, appellants filed a lawsuit in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. Among their claims in that suit was an allegation that MWCD lacks statutory authority to enter into oil and gas leases. Said case was removed to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio (in Columbus, Ohio), but it was voluntarily dismissed by appellants on December 29, 2014. Appellants indicated in their motion for voluntary dismissal in federal court that they intended to pursue their state law claims in the state courts of Ohio.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Furthermore, at the time of the commencement of the subject declaratory judgment action, appellants were plaintiffs in a separate federal False Claims Act case filed against appellees in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (in Akron, Ohio).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 6} On May 7, 2015, Appellee MWCD filed an action in the Guernsey County Court of Common Pleas (hereinafter \"trial court\") seeking declaratory relief. The complaint was later amended to include as defendants Antero Resources, Eclipse Resources, and the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. Specifically, MWCD requested a declaration that has the authority under Ohio law to enter into leases related to the extraction of mineral rights (potentially including horizontal hydraulic fracturing or \"fracking\"), and a declaration that the subject lease with Appellees Antero Resources and Eclipse Resources is valid and enforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   {\u00b6 7} On October 5, 2015, Appellee MWCD filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. On December 14, 2015, appellants filed a motion for summary judgment, with exhibits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   {\u00b6 8} On May 6, 2016, the trial court issued a judgment entry granting MWCD's motion for judgment on the pleadings, thereby holding\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   that MWCD was statutorily empowered to enter into the subject oil and gas lease. On the same day, the trial court issued a judgment entry denying appellants' motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   {\u00b6 9} On June 1, 2016, appellants filed a notice of appeal. They herein raise the following three Assignments of Error:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   {\u00b6 10} \"I. THE TRIAL COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION BY FAILING TO PROPERLY ASSESS THE JUSTICIABILITY OF DECLARATORY RELIEF AS AN APPROPRIATE REMEDY IN THE INSTANT CASE.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   {\u00b6 11} \"II.

Chapter 2721. In other words, appellants contend this matter lacks the requisite jurisdictional basis for a declaratory judgment action. They urge that Appellee Antero, being in contractual privity with MWCD, is not a \"genuine defendant\" in the declaratory judgment action, and that the Ohio Department of Natural Resources is also not in an adverse position versus MWCD. Appellants also urge that while they have been in a legally antagonistic relationship with MWCD in the past, it is not presently adversarial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   {\u00b6 17} We have generally recognized that an appellate court is not required to render an advisory opinion or to rule on a question of law that cannot affect matters at issue in a case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ambrose v.

Similar to MWCD, the General Assembly had granted MRTA certain express statutory powers, including the authority to lease transit facilities \"within or without its territorial boundaries, considered necessary to accomplish the purposes of its organization * * *.\"\n   <em>\n    Silver Lake\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14, quoting R.C. 306.35(G).

However, appellants appear to confuse the separate concepts of a conservancy district's statutory \"purposes,\" which pertain to the organizing and formation of the district, and its statutory \"powers,\" which pertain to its ongoing functioning as a legislatively-created corporation. The General Assembly has expressly granted conservation districts like MWCD the power to enter into contracts ( R.C. 6101.23 ) and to \"lease, use, and sell real and personal property\" ( R.C. 6101.15(K) ),\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   . Furthermore, Chapter 6101 \"shall be liberally construed to effect the control, conservation, and drainage of the waters\" of Ohio (R.C. 6101.80 ), and such liberal construction must be applied in addressing the District's powers, the only issue presently before us. While appellants consistently urge that the allowance of oil and gas drilling and potential \"fracking\" processes on MWCD lands does not fulfill the purposes of flood control and water conservation, the wisdom of the District's Board's decision to enter into the subject drilling leases and the possibility of future environmental impacts are not questions before us at this time and were not before the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   {\u00b6 53} Accordingly, upon review, we hold the trial court did not err in denying appellants' motion for summary judgment and proceeding to a declaratory judgment review in favor of appellees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   {\u00b6 54} Appellants' Third Assignment of Error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   {\u00b6 55} In their Second Assignment of Error, appellants maintain the trial court erred in granting a judgment on the pleadings in favor of MWCD. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   {\u00b6 56} Motions for judgment on the pleadings are governed by Civ.R. 12(C), which states: \"After the pleadings are closed but within such time as not to delay the trial, any party may move for judgment on the pleadings.\" Civ.R. 12(C)\"requires a determination that no material factual issues exist and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.
