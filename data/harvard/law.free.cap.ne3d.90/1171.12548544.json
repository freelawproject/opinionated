But the question remains: What is the precise boundary at which the State's ownership interest ends and private property interests begin?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Today, we hold that the boundary separating public trust land from privately-owned riparian land along the shores of Lake Michigan is the common-law ordinary high water mark and that, absent an authorized legislative conveyance, the State retains exclusive title up to that boundary. We therefore affirm the trial court's ruling that the State holds title to the Lake Michigan shores in trust for the public but reverse the court's decision that private property interests here overlap with those of the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Don H. Gunderson and Bobbie J. Gunderson, as trustees of the Don H. Gunderson Living Trust (\"the Gundersons\"), own lakefront property in Long Beach, Indiana, consisting of three lots in Section 15 of Michigan Township (the \"Disputed Property\"). The Gundersons' deed, the 1914 plat to which the deed refers, and the plat survey contain no reference to a boundary separating the Disputed Property from\n   Lake Michigan to the north. A designated survey of Long Beach from 1984 contains a plat map showing the Disputed Property and contiguous lakefront lots extending to the \"Lake Edge.\" App. 127-43. At the root of the Gundersons' deed is an 1837 federal land patent. This patent, in turn, originates from an 1829 federal survey showing Lake Michigan as the northern boundary of Section 15. The original survey notes indicate the northern boundary extends \"to Lake Michigan and set post.\" App. 589.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2010, the Town of Long Beach passed an ordinance adopting the Indiana Department of Natural Resources' (\"DNR\") administrative boundary which separates state-owned beaches from private, upland portions of the shore. Long Beach, Ind., Code of Ordinances \u00a7 34.30 (amended 2012);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=312%20Ind.%20Admin.%20Code%201\">\n    312 Ind. Admin. Code 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -1-26(2) (2017). The Gundersons, along with other lakefront property owners in Long Beach, protested that the artificial boundary line infringed on their property rights.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following unsuccessful attempts at changing the rule at the administrative level, the Gundersons, in 2014, sued the State and the DNR (collectively, \"the State\") for a declaratory judgment on the extent of their littoral rights to the shore of Lake Michigan and to quiet title to the Disputed Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alliance for the Great Lakes and Save the Dunes (\"Alliance-Dunes\") and Long Beach Community Alliance (\"LBCA\") (collectively, \"Intervenors\") successfully moved to intervene. All parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The Gundersons asked the trial court to rule that \"there is no public trust right in any land abutting Lake Michigan.\" App. 83. The State, in turn, requested the trial court to declare that Indiana owns the disputed beach in trust for public use. Intervenors urged the trial court to find that the State owns the disputed shore of Lake Michigan below the ordinary high water mark (\"OHWM\") in trust for public recreational use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In granting the State and Intervenors' cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court ruled \"that when Indiana became a State, it received, and held in trust for the public, all lands below the OHWM regardless of whether the land is temporarily not covered by the water.\" App. 25. The court further concluded that the Gundersons' property extends to the northern boundary of Section 15 while the State holds legal title, in public trust, to the land below the OHWM as defined by the DNR's administrative boundary. To the extent that these property interests overlap, the trial court declared that \"the Gundersons cannot unduly impair the protected rights and uses of the public.\" App. 28. Finally, the trial court concluded that \"Indiana's public trust protects the public's right to use the beach below the [OHWM] for commerce, navigation, fishing, recreation, and all other activities related thereto, including but not limited to boating, swimming, sunbathing, and other beach sport activities.\" App. 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Gundersons appealed while Intervenors moved to correct the trial court's findings on the administrative OHWM and\n   the overlapping titles. Alliance-Dunes moved for judicial notice of additional facts and to supplement the record, to which the State and the Gundersons objected. The court denied all pending motions and Alliance-Dunes and LBCA separately appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part. In a unanimous opinion, the panel held (1) that, absent an express legislative abrogation of public trust rights in the shores of Lake Michigan, those rights are controlled by the common-law public trust doctrine; (2) that the DNR's administrative boundary is invalid and the OHWM remains that defined by the common law; and (3) that the northern boundary of the Gundersons' property extends to the ordinary low water mark, subject to public use rights up to the OHWM, such as walking along the beach and gaining access to the public waterway.\n   <em>\n    Gunderson v.

The legal dispute relates to the precise location of that OHWM: whereas the Gundersons argue that it lies wherever the water meets the land at any given moment, the State and Intervenors locate the boundary further landward to include the exposed shore.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Resolution of this case entails a two-part analysis: First, we must determine the boundary of the bed of Lake Michigan that originally passed to Indiana at statehood in\n   1816. Second, we must decide whether the State has since relinquished title to land within that boundary.

By their theory, the water's edge is the legal boundary-a \"movable freehold\"-separating public trust lands from private property. App. 696. In support of their argument, they cite the Northwest Ordinance of 1787, the Submerged Lands Act of 1953, U.S. Supreme Court precedent, and other case law. These authorities, they contend, confine the State's public trust lands to the submerged lakebed, thus limiting public use to the waters only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The State and Intervenors, on the other hand, contend that Indiana holds exclusive title to the bed of Lake Michigan up to the OHWM, including the exposed shores as the water periodically recedes. Absent evidence of an express federal grant prior to 1816, they contend, this title passed to Indiana at statehood under the equal-footing doctrine to hold in trust for public use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, we agree with the State and Intervenors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    a.

That federal measure guaranteed the admission of new states to the Union \"on an equal footing with the original States\" and specified that \"[t]he navigable waters leading into the Mississippi and St. Lawrence ... shall be common highways, and forever free.\" Act of Aug. 7, 1789, ch. 8,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1%20Stat.%2050\">\n    1 Stat. 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , arts.

In holding that the State of Alabama acquired title to the lands underlying tidal waters within its borders, the\n   <em>\n    Pollard\n   </em>\n   Court cited both the Northwest Ordinance and the statehood clause\n   of the U.S. Constitution. 44 U.S. (3 How.) 212, 222-23 (1845). Despite this early reference and reliance on the Ordinance, however, the Court's equal-footing jurisprudence later curtailed-and eventually abandoned-that source of authority. In\n   <em>\n    Illinois Central Railroad Co. v. Illinois\n   </em>\n   , the Court, while acknowledging the Ordinance's equal-footing clause, concluded that \"the equality prescribed would have existed if it had not been thus stipulated.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564406\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/146/387/#p434\">\n    146 U.S. 387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 434,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564406\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/146/387/#p434\">\n    13 S.Ct. 110\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3564406\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/146/387/#p434\">\n    36 L.Ed. 1018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1892).
