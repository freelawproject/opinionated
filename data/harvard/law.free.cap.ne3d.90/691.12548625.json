Smith appeals the post-conviction court's dismissal of his petition for post-conviction relief for failure to prosecute. Smith presents the following dispositive issue for our review: whether the post-conviction court erred when it did not hold a hearing before dismissing his petition under Trial Rule 41(E).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We reverse and remand with instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [2] The facts underlying Smith's convictions were stated by this court on direct appeal:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2010, Misty Sell was living with David Smith.\n   <sup>\n    [ ]\n   </sup>\n   In November 2010, she broke up with David and began dating Anthony. In December 2010, she stopped dating Anthony and moved back in with David. When Sell broke up with Anthony, he threatened to kill Sell, David, and himself. Less than a week later, on December 17, 2010, Sell retrieved some of her belongings from Anthony, and Sell told Anthony that she did not want to get back together with him. She returned to David's apartment, and they went to sleep.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   In the early morning hours of December 18, 2010, Anthony left his house with a steak knife in the waistband of his pants, and McDaniel, Anthony's stepson, followed Anthony. Sell and David awoke to someone beating on the front door. As David put on his pants, Sell opened the door to Anthony and McDaniel. They pushed Sell out of the way and went into the apartment. David backed into a corner and asked what they were doing there. Anthony said, \"shut up you f****** faggot I'm going to kill you.\" Tr. p. 494. Anthony and David fought until Sell started to call the police, and then Anthony went toward the door. At that point, McDaniel and David began fighting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Anthony went toward David, but Sell yelled at him and shoved him out of the apartment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Sell saw Anthony and McDaniel each stab David on his left side. David was stabbed a total of three times and suffered a lacerated spleen and diaphragm, which required surgery to suture. Two knives were recovered from the scene.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The State initially charged Anthony and McDaniel with Class B felony aggravated battery. The informations were amended to include charges of Class A felony attempted murder and Class C felony battery, and the aggravated battery charges were dismissed. Anthony and McDaniel were jointly tried, and a jury found them guilty as charged. At sentencing, the trial court vacated the battery convictions. For the attempted murder convictions, Anthony was sentenced to forty-five years, with ten years suspended to probation, for an executed sentence of thirty-five years, and McDaniel was sentenced to thirty-five years, with fifteen years suspended to probation, for an executed sentence of twenty years.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Smith v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. 35A04-1112-CR-662,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%203222382\">\n    2012 WL 3222382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (Ind.

We affirmed his convictions and sentence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   [3] On November 25, 2015, Smith filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   petition for post-conviction relief, and the post-conviction court appointed a public defender to represent Smith. However, on January 19, 2016, the public defender filed a notice of nonrepresentation under Post-Conviction Rule 1(9)(c), whereby he declined to represent Smith. Two months later, Smith requested new counsel, but the trial court denied that request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [4] On October 13, 2016, the State moved to dismiss Smith's petition for failure to prosecute under Trial Rule 41(E). On October 14, the trial court ordered the parties to submit evidence by affidavits. On November 15, Smith filed a motion for additional time to respond to the State's motion to dismiss, and he filed an affidavit stating his intention to prosecute his petition and stating his reasons for asking for an additional sixty days to respond. The trial court granted Smith's motion and ordered him to respond to the motion to dismiss by January 14, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [5] On January 31, 2017, the State filed a notice to inform the post-conviction court that Smith had not filed a response by the January 14 deadline, and the State moved the court to grant its motion to dismiss. On February 21, Smith filed a motion for an evidentiary hearing on his petition for post-conviction relief, and he asked the court to issue subpoenas for witnesses to attend that hearing. On March 2, the post-conviction court granted the State's motion to dismiss without first holding a hearing. This appeal ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion and Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [6] Smith contends that the post-conviction court erred when it dismissed his petition for post-conviction relief pursuant to Indiana Trial Rule 41(E) without holding a hearing on the State's motion. We will reverse a Trial Rule 41(E) dismissal for failure to prosecute \"only for a clear abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Caruthers v.

Caruthers also filed a motion for evidentiary hearing and a request for transport order, which the trial court did not rule on.\n   <em>\n    There were multiple mechanisms that were available to the court to address Caruthers's motions, such as arranging a telephone conference or directing Caruthers to submit his case by affidavit\n   </em>\n   .
