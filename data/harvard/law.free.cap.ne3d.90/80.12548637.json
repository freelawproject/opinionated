The city's aim was to \"match state law and to increase regulations that limit discharge of weapon, increase awareness regarding the presence of weapons in school zones, promote law enforcement officer safety and most importantly will keep weapons out of the hands of children.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   {\u00b6 3} In response, on April 21, 2015, plaintiffs-appellants Ohioans for Concealed Carry, Inc. (\"OFCC\") and Danny L. McIntosh (\"McIntosh\") (collectively \"OFCC\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   filed a complaint for injunction, declaratory judgment, and mandamus against defendants-appellees, city of Cleveland and Barbara A. Langhenry, in her official capacity as the director of the Cleveland Department of Law. OFCC sought (1) to have the newly enacted Cleveland Codified Ordinances (\"C.C.O.\") deemed unconstitutional for violating R.C. 9.68 and to recover the fees and costs of bringing the suit, (2) to enjoin the expenditure of public funds to implement the alleged unlawful provisions, and (3) mandamus to compel the release of certain records pursuant to Ohio's public records law, R.C. 149.43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   {\u00b6 4} After discovery, both OFCC and the city moved for summary judgment. Upon considering the ordinances at issue, the trial court ruled that three of the ordinances were unlawful and that the others were valid, that the mandamus action failed pursuant to the statute of limitations, and that McIntosh does not have standing to pursue a taxpayer suit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the trial court's decision, OFCC filed an appeal and the city filed a cross-appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   {\u00b6 5} Many of the challenges raised on appeal concern the validity of the subject ordinances and whether they violate R.C. 9.68.

As members of the judiciary, we are tasked with applying the law as written. The city may not enact ordinances that conflict with Ohio's firearm ownership and possession laws, which are intended to provide uniformity throughout the state. If individuals on either side of the divide are unhappy with the law as written, the remedy lies with the Ohio legislature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   {\u00b6 12} Under its first, second, third, and fourth assignments of error, OFCC challenges the validity of the Cleveland ordinances at issue. OFCC's argument is broken into three sections: (1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   ordinance sections that allegedly violate R.C. 9.68 through the use of overly broad definitions that conflict with state law; (2) ordinance sections that violate R.C. 9.68 by mirroring state law; and (3) ordinance sections that allegedly conflict with R.C. 9.68 in other manners.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   {\u00b6 13} First, we address OFCC's claim that certain ordinances violate R.C. 9.68 through the use of overly broad definitions that conflict with state law. This argument pertains to the first and second assignments of error, which claim the trial court erred by rewriting the definitions of \"automatic firearm\" and \"dangerous ordnance,\" contained in C.C.O. 627.01, to make them constitutional, and by not declaring invalid the Cleveland ordinances that use the unlawfully defined term \"dangerous ordnance.\" We note that the term \"automatic weapon\" and \"automatic firearm\" have been used interchangeably by the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   {\u00b6 14} The city conceded to the trial court that its definition of \"automatic firearm,\" as well as the definition of \"dangerous ordnance,\" which includes the term \"automatic firearm,\" impermissibly includes certain semi-automatic weapons and differs from Ohio law. The term \"dangerous ordnance\" as defined under C.C.O. 627.01 was contained in C.C.O. 627.02, 627.06, 627.15, and 627.16.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The city argued that \"[t]hose ordinances are unconstitutional only in so far as * * * they cite to 'automatic weapons' or 'dangerous ordnance,' which includes automatic weapons. Once the definition of 'automatic weapons' is amended to mirror Ohio R.C. \u00a7 2923.11, these ordinances will be constitutional.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   {\u00b6 15} The trial court found that the offending terms were unconstitutional and proceeded to interpret the remaining Cleveland ordinances \"under the definition provided in the Ohio Revised Code when it relates to the definition of 'automatic firearm.' \" OFCC claims that by changing the definitions of the terms \"automatic weapon\" or \"automatic firearm\" and \"dangerous ordnance,\" the trial court made changes to the legislation that constituted a violation of the separation of powers. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   {\u00b6 16} A court may not invade the province of the legislature and violate the separation of powers by rewriting a statute or ordinance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pratte v.

Accordingly, the definitions of \"automatic firearm\" and \"dangerous ordnance\" in C.C.O. 627.01(a) and (d) are invalid, and the ordinances that use the unlawfully defined term \"dangerous ordnance,\" including C.C.O. 627.02, 627.06, 627.15, and 627.16, are unconstitutional. Appellants' first and second assignments of error are sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   {\u00b6 18} Next, we address OFCC's claim that certain ordinance sections violate\n   R.C. 9.68 by mirroring state law. This argument pertains to the fourth assignment of error that claims that C.C.O. 627.02, 627.04, and 627.08 each should be deemed invalid because they mirror state law. We have already determined above that C.C.O. 627.02 is unconstitutional because of its use of the unlawfully defined term \"dangerous ordnance.\" Therefore, we shall address the argument presented only as to C.C.O. 627.04 (Using Weapons While Intoxicated) and 627.08 (Underage Purchase of Handgun).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   {\u00b6 19} OFCC claims that the ordinances that repeat state law add needless redundancy and intrude upon areas that have been reserved exclusively to the state. OFCC argues that any slight change in Ohio law will create a conflict and render the provisions unconstitutional. Although OFCC has valid concerns, our review must focus on the existence or nonexistence of any conflict between the local ordinances and the state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   {\u00b6 20} Despite the General Assembly's intent to occupy the field of handgun possession in Ohio, municipalities retain home rule authority to enact local legislation that is not in conflict with general laws.\n   <em>\n    Clyde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3695829\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-st-3d/120/96/\">\n    120 Ohio St.3d 96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008-Ohio-4605\">\n    2008-Ohio-4605\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=896%20N.E.2d%20967\">\n    896 N.E.2d 967\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at \u00b6 29. Thus, the mere fact that an ordinance mirrors state law does not render the ordinance invalid. Accordingly, C.C.O. 627.04 and 627.08 are constitutional. Appellants' fourth assignment of error is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   {\u00b6 21} Finally, OFCC challenges ordinance sections that allegedly conflict with R.C. 9.68 in other manners. This challenge relates to the third assignment of error, under which OFCC claims the following ordinances should have been declared unconstitutional: C.C.O. 627.06, 627.07, 627.10, 627.13, 627.16, 627.18, and C.C.O. Chapter 628.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   {\u00b6 22} Both the Cleveland ordinances and state law regulate the same subject matter-the ownership and possession of firearms in Ohio. R.C. 9.68 expresses the General Assembly's intent to provide uniform laws throughout the state regulating \"the ownership, possession, purchase, other acquisition, transport, storage, carrying, sale, or other transfer of firearms, their components, and their ammunition\" and specifically provides that \"a person,\n   <em>\n    without further\n   </em>\n   license, permission, [or]\n   <em>\n    restriction\n   </em>\n   * * * may own, possess, purchase, sell, transfer, transport, store or keep any firearm, part of a firearm, its components, and its ammunition.\" (Emphasis added.)

OFCC claims the General Assembly expressed its intent to preempt local firearm legislation and that by imposing a differing level of punishment, the ordinance conflicts with the general law.

Not only does this provision include the invalid term \"dangerous ordnance,\" but also, it lowers the mens rea from its state counterpart, R.C. 2923.20, from reckless to negligent. C.C.O. 627.16 criminalizes conduct relating to the transfer of a firearm, which is permitted under the state statutes. The conflict renders C.C.O. 627.16 unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   {\u00b6 29} C.C.O. 627.18 requires the reporting of lost or stolen firearms within \"forty-eight (48) hours\" and provides that a violation is a misdemeanor of the second degree. R.C. 2923.20 requires a person to report the loss or theft of a firearm \"forthwith\" and provides that a violation is a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. Although the ordinance permissibly increases the degree of the offense, C.C.O. 627.18 implicates the possession and transfer of firearms and conflicts with the general law by imposing a different reporting time frame.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   {\u00b6 30} C.C.O.

Unlike the ordinance, the statute does not include restrictions on areas near the prohibited places. Therefore, C.C.O. 627.09(A)(4) places further restriction on the possession of a firearm and prohibits that which is authorized under state law. Because of this conflict, C.C.O. 627.09(A)(4) must be stricken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   {\u00b6 35} C.C.O. 627.12 permits an investigating officer to seize a person's weapon in certain situations if the investigating officer has reasonable cause to believe that the weapon may be used to cause bodily harm.
