Plaintiff claimed that three of the defendants who had liens upon the premises prior to the mortgage, had subordinated their liens to it by accepting and executing a deed to them of the premises in and by which they assumed and agreed to pay the mortgage. They denied the execution or acceptance of the deed, claiming that their signatures thereto were forged.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-11\">The following is an extract from the opinion:</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b575-12\">\u201c Upon the trial of the action, the claim of the plaintiff was that the defendant Mary A. Suiter had written her own signature, and the signatures of her mother and sister Ann, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>to the deed, and that then her mother and sister had each made her mark. She testified positively that she did not write the signatures; that she did not acknowledge the deed, and that she never heard of the deed until about the commencement of this action, when it was found in the county clerk\u2019s office by her attorney. The widow and the daughter Ann also testified that they did not execute the deed or acknowledge it. The defendants called expert witnesses who testified by comparison of the signatures on the deed with the signature of Mary A. Suiter to the verification of her answer in this action, that the signatures upon the deed were not written by the same person who wrote the name to such verification. The plaintiff called an expert witness who testified that he believed that the three signatures were written by the same person who wrote the name Mary A. Suiter to the affidavit upon the answer to the complaint; and the plaintiff also gave some evidence of statements made by the widow, and also upon her cross^ examination tending to show that the deed was actually <em>exe-. </em>\u25a0cuted and delivered to her.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-4\"><em>\u201c </em>While the defendants were putting in their evidence upon the trial, and for the purpose of having a larger number of Mary A. Suiter\u2019s genuine signatures in evidence for comparison with the alleged forged signatures, she produced a signature which she said she had written two years before; and the defendants\u2019 counsel offered to put it in evidence. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected to it as incompetent, immaterial and improper, and on the further ground that it was written with a pencil. The trial judge then remarked: \u00a3I don\u2019t think the signature of a party written on a loose scrap of paper at some time or another should be put in evidence. I will sustain that objection. It would be a most dangerous rule to adopt. I will sustain the objection on that particular piece of paper.\u2019 The same witness then produced two of her signatures written, one fourteen and the other twelve or thirteen years before the trial, and testified that she had written them at the times mentioned, and defendants\u2019 counsel offered to put them in evidence for the purpose of comparison. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected to them on the same grounds, as before, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>the trial judge said: <em>\u2018 </em>1 will exclude the evidence and give you an exception. I don\u2019t think this evidence is either admissible or safe.\u2019 It will be observed that these three signatures were not excluded upon the ground that they were not sufficiently proved, or that the judge was not satisfied that they were genuine. We agree with the General Term that these signatures should have been received in evidence for comparison. They would have given to the expert witnesses a wider range for comparison. As it was, the only signatures they had for comparison with the alleged forged signatures, were the signatures of Mary A. Suiter to her affidavit upon the answer, and the signature of Ann Suiter to her affidavit upon her answer in this action which was written by Mary A. Suiter. So that there were in evidence for comparison only \u25a0one signature of the name of Mary A. Suiter with which the experts could compare the alleged forged signature. We think the range of comparison was altogether too narrowly limited, .and that it could not be thus arbitrarily confined. It cannot be said that the exclusion of this evidence was harmless. It was rendered competent by the act, chapter 36 of the Laws of 1880, as amended by the act chapter 555, of the Laws of 1888, .and whatever the views of the trial judge may have been as to its value or safety, he should have received it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-3\">\u201c For the rejection of this evidence the judgment was properly reversed at the General Term and its order should be .affirmed and judgment absolute rendered against the plaintiff, \u2022with costs.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b577-4\"><em>William G.
