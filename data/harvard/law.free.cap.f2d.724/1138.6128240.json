BROWN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1129-13\">In February of 1981, appellant Helen Dorothy Johnson filed a petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code and later claimed certain exemptions from her bankruptcy estate. Jody Fenslage, a judgment creditor, objected to Johnson\u2019s claim that a tax-deferred annuity was exempt from the bankruptcy estate under a Texas statute which provided an exemption for life insurance policies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In an order issued June 21, 1982, the Bankruptcy Court found that the annuity was not exempt under the cited Texas statute. Further, the Court found that because Johnson had elected to claim exemptions under state law, her claim that the annuity was exempt under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(d)(10)(E) was without merit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1129-17\">Although Johnson failed to appeal this decision, she was granted leave to amend her exemptions after substituting counsel, and subsequently claimed that the annuity was exempt under various other provisions of Texas law. The Bankruptcy Court pointed out that she had taken a \u201c \u2018scatter-gun\u2019 approach\u201d to claiming exemptions, and found no cited authority applicable to her claim of exemption. Fenslage\u2019s objections were therefore sustained and the exemption denied. Because we find Johnson\u2019s contentions on appeal to be without merit, we affirm the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-18\">\n<em>The Annuity and Johnson\u2019s ERISA Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1129-19\">In November, 1976, appellant, a library employee at West Texas State University (WTSU), executed an application to participate in a group variable annuity that was maintained and operated by Lincoln National Life Insurance Company. The annuity was to provide retirement income, beginning in 1995, to appellant (and her spouse as beneficiary) in return for monthly salary deductions of $100. Although the annuity was established for WTSU as \u201cgroup master contract owner,\u201d the annuity is funded solely by the participants\u2019 earnings. The University\u2019s only involvement was to allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1140\">*1140</page-number>Lincoln National to promote its plan and to pay over the monthly salary deductions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-4\">In this appeal, Johnson asserts for the first time that her annuity is a plan or pension under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em>(ERISA). Although we ordinarily refuse to consider issues raised for the first time on appeal, <em>Jackson v. United States Postal Service, </em>666 F.2d 258, 260-61 (5th Cir.1982), we make an exception to this general rule when a pure question of law is involved and the refusal to consider it will produce a miscarriage of justice. <em>Coastal States Marketing, Inc. v. Hunt, </em>694 F.2d 1358, 1364 (5th Cir.1983); <em>Holiday Inns, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alberding, </em>683 F.2d 931, 933 (5th Cir.1982). We are not convinced, however, that in this situation our failure to consider this claim will result in a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-5\">We are further persuaded that consideration of this claim is improper due to the fact that the Bankruptcy Judge brought out the issue of possible federal claims during the hearing on Fenslage\u2019s objections to exemptions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When Johnson retained new counsel and amended her exemption claim, the availability of exemptions under Federal law other than those provided in the Bankruptcy Code had thus been made a part of the record in the case. Under these circumstances, we perceive no injustice in our refusal to consider appellant\u2019s tardy claim under ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-6\">\n<em>\u201cSpendthrift\u201d Provisions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-7\">Appellant also urges that her annuity is subject to exemption because the contract she executed contains an antialienation clause which makes it a \u201cspendthrift\u201d trust under Texas Law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1130-15\">We find this claim to be unfounded. We recognize that 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(c)(2) provides that restrictions on the alienation of trust funds which are enforceable under \u201capplicable nonbankruptcy law\u201d are likewise enforceable in bankruptcy proceedings, thus providing an exemption from the bankruptcy estate. We have specifically held that Section 541(c)(2) was intended to apply only to spendthrift trusts, <em>see Matter of Goff, </em>706 F.2d 574, 580 (5th Cir.1983), but we cannot find that the annuity here was such a trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-16\">In <em>Goff, </em>we found that the ERISA-quali-fied Keogh plan there could not be viewed as a spendthrift trust because the alleged \u201csettlors\u201d had created what was in essence a revocable trust for their own benefit. Although it is true that the petitioners in <em>Goff </em>were self-employed and thus there was no \u201cemployer\u201d involved who could be viewed as a settlor, we find the negligible amount of employer involvement here renders this situation legally indistinguishable from that in <em>Goff. </em>In <em>Goff, </em>the Court focused on the nature of the retirement plan. There, as here, participation in the plan was strictly voluntary and terminable at will by the settlor/beneficiary, who could then withdraw all or nearly all the funds paid in. More importantly, in <em>Goff, </em>as in this case, the \u201csettlor\u201d made all the contributions to the \u201ctrust\u201d <em>res. </em>We find that allowing an exemption under these facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1141\">*1141</page-number>would be contrary to the public policy notions we expressed in <em>Goff </em>and in <em>Matter of Witlin, </em>640 F.2d 661, 662 (5th Cir.1981). In those cases, we found that it would be unjust to allow any person to voluntarily place property in a \u201crevocable trust for his own benefit and claim it as exempt from the claims of his creditors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-4\">\n<em>State Law Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-5\">In her amended exemption report, appellant claimed that she was entitled to exempt the annuity from the estate under several state statutes. The Bankruptcy Court considered and rejected those claims. Appellant asserts error in the trial court\u2019s findings as to two of those statutes. For the reasons which follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-6\">Appellant argues that because she is employed by a State University, she is entitled to exempt the annuity from her bankruptcy estate under the Texas State College and University Employees Uniform Insurance Benefits Act (the Act). Tex.Ins.Code Ann. art. 3.50-3 \u00a7 9(a) (Vernon 1981). As appellant points out, Article 6228a-5 (Tex. Civ.Code Ann. (Vernon Supp.1983)), which authorizes educational agencies to purchase annuities for their employees and provides for salary reduction payments, is mentioned in Article 3.50-3 \u00a7 4(b)(4)(J) of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-7\">We cannot agree, however, with appellant\u2019s contention that all benefits mentioned in the Act are subject to the proscription of attachment or garnishment. As the Bankruptcy Court recognized, one of the stated purposes of the Act was to provide for \u201cgreater uniformity\u201d in the administration of tax-sheltered annuities. Tex. Ins.Code Ann. art. 3.50-3 \u00a7 2(g) (Vernon 1981). A separate purpose, however, was to reward the \u201cfaithful service and dedication\u201d of University employees by providing \u201chealth insurance and other group insurance benefits\u201d to those employees. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2(f). Significantly, the Act requires that the educational institution \u201ccontribute monthly to the cost of ... coverage,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 12, and specifies that neither employer contributions nor employee contributions may be used to pay the cost of administering any program under the Act. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-9\">In light of this statutory framework, we find that the Bankruptcy Court properly construed the Act to mean that tax-deferred annuities might be made <em>available </em>to University employees. The Act did not require, however, that the employer contribute to appellant\u2019s annuity as it was not a \u2022\u2018health ... or other group insurance benefit\u201d within the meaning of Section 2(f). Indeed, Section 3 of the Act provides separate definitions for \u201cgroup life, accident, or health insurance\u201d and \u201cretirement annuity insurance.\u201d We find, therefore, that Section 9 of the Act, which provides that \u201cinsurance benefits and other payments or transactions made pursuant to the provisions of this Act <em>to any employee ... </em>shall be exempt from execution, attachment or garnishment,\u201d was intended to exempt only <em>employer-provided </em>benefits (emphasis added). Because the annuity here was \u201cprovided\u201d by the employee herself, we agree with the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s holding that it is not exempt under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-10\">We emphasize here that our conclusion might be different if appellant had demonstrated that the University was required by the Act to contribute to her annuity as an insurance benefit, but had failed to do so. Although she states that this is so, she offers no possible construction of the Act which convinces us that her statement is true. She argues, for example, that the employer chooses whether he will pay a higher salary and then reduce it to make an annuity contribution, or chooses to pay a lower salary and make the contribution himself. This is contrary to the expressed intent of the Act, which we have pointed out was to offer <em>additional </em>benefits to University employees in the <em>form of at </em>least partial contributions to certain, but not all, employee benefit programs. She further argues that her employer\u2019s failure to contribute to the annuity results in an unjust forfeiture of her exemption rights under the Act. This circular reasoning ignores the Act\u2019s differentiation between those benefits to which the employer <em>must </em>contrib<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>ute, and those benefits which should be made <em>available </em>at the employees\u2019 option. We find she is simply wrong in contending that the exemption provision applies to both.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-4\">Finally, appellant asserts that the Bankruptcy Court erred in holding that the annuity was not exempt under Texins. Code Ann. art. 21.22 (Vernon 1981). She urges that because the University\u2019s agreement with Lincoln National called for future retirement payments in installments, the plan complies with the provisions of Article 21.22, which mandate that insurance benefits or annuities that are paid on a periodic or installment basis are not attachable. However, appellant\u2019s annuity provides that she can elect to receive the benefits in a lump sum \u2014 not in installments \u2014 if she chooses to terminate her participation in the plan prior to the date she will begin receiving the payments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-5\">In <em>Union Savings, Building &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Smith, </em>62 S.W.2d 175 (Tex.Civ.App. Tex-arkana 1933 <em>writ ref\u2019d), </em>the Texas Court interpreted Article 21.22\u2019s predecessor, former Article 5068a, and found that the exemption was applicable to those benefits which are paid on a periodic or installment basis, but not those payable in a lump sum. Appellant argues, however, that because she has not elected to terminate the plan, she should not be held to the rule respecting lump sum payments. We disagree. Were we to find otherwise, she would be able to terminate the plan at any time before the payments are scheduled to begin (in 1995) and would then receive the lump sum in contravention of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-6\">In finding appellant\u2019s contentions under state law to be meritless, we recognized our duty to construe these previously-uninterpreted state statutes liberally in favor of the debtor. <em>In Re Thompson, </em>103 F.Supp. 942 (D.C.Tex.1952). We believe, however, that a different construction of the Texas statutes would fly in the face of the distinctions made therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1129-14\">.
