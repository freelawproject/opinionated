Because the district court\u2019s order is based on Eleventh Circuit precedent which the United States Supreme Court has overruled, we reverse and remand to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-26\">Appellants, Trustees, seek to collect contributions allegedly owed by defendant Southern Stress Wire Corporation (Southern Stress) to their Fringe Benefit Funds pursuant to the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 185 and 186, and the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1132.</p>\n<p id=\"b1536-27\">By order dated June 26,1980, the district court held that the evidence established the existence of a pre-hire agreement between the parties. After its June order, the district court several times examined the question of whether the union was required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1459\">*1459</page-number>show that it represented a majority of the workers in the employer\u2019s work force in order to convert the pre-hire agreement into a valid collective bargaining contract, binding on Southern Stress. On August 5, 1982, the court noted <em>McDowell, </em>a newly issued decision dealing with the majority requirement. <em>Laborers District Council v. McDowell Contractors, </em>680 F.2d 94 (11th Cir.1982). In <em>McDowell, </em>the Eleventh Circuit affirmed a district court\u2019s holding that in the absence of a showing of union majority at a specific project, the terms of an area-wide pre-hire agreement are not enforceable against the employer with respect to the project in question; if the union cannot enforce the terms of the pre-hire agreement, neither can its pension fund. In this case, Trustees conceded their inability to establish the union\u2019s majority status; therefore, the pre-hire agreement could not be converted into an enforceable collective bargaining contract. On August 26, 1982, based on <em>McDowell, </em>the court dismissed Trustees\u2019 cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-4\">The United States Supreme Court recently addressed the issue of majority support. <em>Jim McNeff, Inc. v. </em>Todd, - U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 1753, 75 L.Ed.2d 830 (1983). In <em>McNeff, </em>the Court distinguished between \u201can employer\u2019s obligation under the Act to bargain with a representative of the majority of its employees and its duty to satisfy lawful contractual obligations that accrued after it enters a pre-hire contract.\u201d <em>McNeff, </em>- U.S. at -, 103 S.Ct. at 1757, 75 L.Ed.2d at 836. Noting that concerns regarding the rights of employees to select their own bargaining representative and the voluntariness of pre-hire agreements are not present, the Court concluded that monetary obligations assumed by construction industry employers under a pre-hire contract authorized by section 8(f) of the National Labor Relations Act may be recovered in a section 301 action despite the fact that the union has not obtained majority support <em>in) </em>the relevant unit. Thus, <em>McNeff </em>overrules <em>Laborers District Council </em>v. <em>McDowell Contractors, </em>upon which the district court based its order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-12\">On appeal, Southern Stress argues that the holding in <em>McNeff </em>assumes the existence of a valid contract; because the district court erroneously concluded that a valid contract existed between Southern Stress and the union, the district court\u2019s dismissal should stand. Although Southern Stress failed to cross-appeal as to the validity of the contract, we may properly consider this point. Absent a cross-appeal, an appellee may not attempt to enlarge his own rights or decrease the rights of his adversary; however, he may advance a matter in the record- which is in support of the district court\u2019s order, including arguments previously rejected by the district court. <em>United States v. American Railway Express Co., </em>265 U.S. 425, 435, 44 S.Ct. 560, 563, 68 L.Ed. 1087 (1924); <em>Alford v. City of Lubbock, Texas, </em>664 F.2d 1263, 1272-73 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 975, 102 S.Ct. 2239, 72 L.Ed.2d 848 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-13\">The district court\u2019s finding that a valid contract existed will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous. <em>Matthews v. United States, </em>713 F.2d 677, 681 (11th Cir. 1983); Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). In reviewing this finding, we note that federal courts have liberally applied contract law in determining whether an enforceable labor agreement exists. <em>See John Wiley &amp; Sons v. Livingston, </em>376 U.S. 543, 550, 84 S.Ct. 909, 914, 11 L.Ed.2d 898 (1964); <em>Capitol-Husting Co., Inc., v. NLRB, </em>671 F.2d 237, 243 (7th Cir.1982); <em>Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co. v. NLRB, </em>659 F.2d 87, 89 (8th Cir.1981). Further, a union and employer\u2019s adoption of a pre-hire contract is not dependent on its reduction to writing. <em>NLRB v. Haberman Construction Co., </em>641 F.2d 351, 355-56 (5th Cir.1981). Instead, conduct manifesting an intention to abide by the terms of an agreement is required. <em>Id., </em>at 356. It is clear from the December 31,1973, pre-hire agreement with the union that Southern Stress adopted the collective bargaining agreement of August 29, 1968, between the union and the Association of Steel Erectors and Heavy Equipment Operators, Inc.; this specifically bound Southern Stress to the fringe benefits trust.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Further, Southern Stress mani<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1460\">*1460</page-number>fested an intent to abide by this agreement. The district court found that from December 31, 1973, until early 1979, Southern Stress secured virtually all of its labor from the union hiring hall. Southern Stress\u2019s pay to its employees was in conformance with the pay scale established by the collective bargaining agreement. Southern Stress made fringe benefit reports and paid monies to and for the benefit of its employees to the trust fund for hospitalization benefits and frequently for other trust benefits. Trustees conducted at least two audits of Southern Stress\u2019s records pursuant to the trust promulgated by the trustees after the passage of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Based on this evidence, we hold that the district court\u2019s finding of a valid contract is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-4\">Because the precedent on which the district court based its dismissal has been overruled by <em>McNeff, </em>we reverse the district court\u2019s order and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-5\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1537-9\"><em> </em>The terms of the agreement between the union and Southern Stress Wire Coro, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1537-14\">AGREEMENT OF BRIDGE, STRUCTURAL AND ORNAMENTAL IRON WORKERS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1460\">*1460</page-number>LOCAL # 387 AND UNDERSIGNED EMPLOYER</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1538-8\">1.
