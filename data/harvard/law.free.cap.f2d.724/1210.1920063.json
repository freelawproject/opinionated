The parties consented to a trial before a United States Magistrate. At the close of all evidence, the magistrate found that Sylvester had carried his initial burden of proving prima facie racial discrimination, but that the defendant employer had successfully rebutted the allegation that the discharge had been racially motivated. The magistrate entered judgment for the employer and Sylvester appealed. Finding the magistrate\u2019s fact-findings to lack the specificity required to enable our meaningful appellate review, we vacate the judgment and remand the action for additional findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-17\">I. BACKGROUND FACTS:</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-18\">In November 1980 Call\u00f3n Energy Services, Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hired Jessie Sylvester to work as a \u201cfloor hand\u201d in the servicing of oil wells. At the time, Sylvester was the small firm\u2019s only black employee. Sylvester was an experienced floor hand, and for the first three weeks of his employment his work performance was considered to be above average. Thereafter, however, Sylvester\u2019s performance began to decline. In the words of Sylvester\u2019s supervisor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1289-19\">On up there for a while then he just got to where he was kind of slowing down and, I don\u2019t know, just coming to work, you know, he would get to work and he didn\u2019t act like he was too enthused about working. * * * And then he just got to where, you know, average or below, below average.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1289-20\">R.3, 152-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b1289-21\">On the morning of November 28 \u2014 the day after Thanksgiving \u2014 Sylvester failed to show up for work. Later in the day Sylves<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1212\">*1212</page-number>ter called in to the office to explain his absence; he followed up the call with a personal visit to the company president. The company president noticed that Sylvester appeared to have been drinking. Sylvester explained that he had been up all night drinking following a domestic quarrel, during which his wife had struck him on the head with a brick. Although company policy provided that an employee\u2019s absence without prior approval was grounds for immediate dismissal, the company president gave Sylvester a second chance. Sylvester returned to his active duties as a floor hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-4\">As a member of a \u201cworkover rig\u201d crew, Sylvester was required to travel to well sites wherever the firm\u2019s services were needed. On two occasions during Sylvester\u2019s employment, the crew was required to stay overnight in a distant town. The firm practice was to pay for only two double rooms for the four-man crew. On the first overnight trip, Sylvester shared a room with his Caucasian friend Julius Rogers. Rogers later explained that crewmember Bruce Spence had threatened to quit if forced to share a room with a black man. (R.3, 94). Rogers further noted that rig operator and supervisor Danny Martin made sure that Rogers would share Sylvester\u2019s room:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1290-5\">Well, before we ever left the yard Danny more or less got it straight that I was going to sleep in the room with Jessie, that he wasn\u2019t sleeping with no nigger. That\u2019s the exact words that were put to me before we ever left town.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1290-6\">R.3, 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-7\">Sleeping arrangements once again became a problem on Sylvester\u2019s second and final overnight trip. This time, however, Rogers was not a member of the crew. A dispute arose among the white crewmem-bers as to who would be required to share a room with a black man. After two crew-members refused, supervising crewmember Danny Martin agreed to share the room with Sylvester. The next day the men completed their job and returned home. When Sylvester reported to work the next morning, January 16,1981, Martin informed him that he was fired.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Martin hired a white male to take Sylvester\u2019s place.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-10\">Convinced that he had been discharged solely because of his race, Sylvester filed a complaint with the EEOC. The Commission declined to bring suit, and Sylvester commenced this action in federal district court, alleging violations of \u00a7 706 of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5 (1976), and the Civil Rights Act of 1866, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 (1976). Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c) (Supp.1982), the parties agreed to try the case before a United States Magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-11\">The trial evidence conflicted sharply. In addition to testimony concerning the work-over crew\u2019s out-of-town sleeping arrangements, Sylvester adduced evidence of four instances of disparate treatment: first, that he was continually called names such as \u201cJabbo,\u201d \u201cdog,\u201d and \u201cbozo,\u201d and that the word \u201cnigger\u201d was used in his presence in reference to others; second, that on one occasion he did not receive a free box of work gloves, as did white employees; third, that he was not allowed to sleep in the crew truck while en route to a job, as were white crewmembers; and fourth, that a white employee of the same job title received an hourly wage greater than his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-12\">Call\u00f3n Energy Services did not refute Sylvester\u2019s evidence establishing that the company\u2019s employees had refused on racial grounds to share a room with him. The company did adduce controverting evidence on each of Sylvester\u2019s additional charges of disparate treatment, moreover offering three reasons for the discharge: excessive absenteeism, inadequate job performance, and drinking on the job. The magistrate entered judgment in favor of the employer, and Sylvester appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-13\">II. DISCUSSION:</p>\n<p id=\"b1290-14\">In a disparate treatment case involving a claim of discriminatory discharge, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1213\">*1213</page-number>the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of intentional discrimination. The employer must then rebut the presumption of discrimination by producing evidence of a legitimate reason for the plaintiff\u2019s discharge. Consistent with the plaintiff\u2019s unshifting burden of persuasion, the plaintiff bears the responsibility of proving that the employer\u2019s proffered reason is a mere pretext for invidious discrimination. <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1094-95, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981); <em>Redditt v. Mississippi Extended Care Centers, Inc., </em>718 F.2d 1381, 1385 (5th Cir.1983). A fact-finding on the issue of the employer\u2019s discriminatory intent is subject to the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of review. <em>Pullman-Standard v. Swint, </em>456 U.S. 273, 102 S.Ct. 1781, 72 L.Ed.2d 66 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-4\">In the instant case, the magistrate\u2019s bench opinion concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-5\">It is the opinion of the United States Magistrate that plaintiff made a prima facie case of discrimination upon his showing that he was terminated by the company and that, thereafter, a white employee was hired to replace him; however, the Court finds that the company has articulated a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for his discharge which the plaintiff has wholly failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence was a mere pretext for actual discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AB2\">R.3, 217-18; R.2, 8. We construe the magistrate\u2019s conclusion as a factual finding that Call\u00f3n Energy Services did not intentionally discriminate against Jessie Sylvester. We are constrained to review this finding, as well as the \u201csubsidiary\u201d findings of fact, under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a). <em>See Pullman-Standard v. Swint, </em>456 U.S. at 287-90, 102 S.Ct. at 1789-91; <em>Williams v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co., </em>718 F.2d 715, 718 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-6\">The controlling factual inquiry in a Title VII case of this nature is whether the employer intentionally discriminated against the employee, treating him less favorably than others because of his race. <em>See U.S. Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. </em>Aikens, - U.S. -, 103 S.Ct. 1478, 1482, 75 L.Ed.2d 403 (1983); <em>Furnco Construction Corp. v. Waters, </em>438 U.S. 567, 577, 98 S.Ct. 2943, 2949, 57 L.Ed.2d 957 (1978). To prevail at trial, Sylvester was required only to prove that the reasons proffered by the company to justify the discharge were pretexts. As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Bur-dine:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1291-10\">The plaintiff retains the burden of persuasion. [H]e now must have the opportunity to demonstrate that the proffered reason was not the true reason for the employment decision. This burden now merges with the ultimate burden of persuading the court that [h]e has been the victim of intentional discrimination. [H]e may succeed in this either directly by persuading the court that a discriminatory reason more likely motivated the employer or indirectly by showing that the employer\u2019s proffered explanation is unworthy of credence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1291-11\">450 U.S. at 256, 101 S.Ct. at 1095. Thus when the ultimate question of discrimination <em>vel non </em>turns on the employer\u2019s intent, the fact-finder acquires an affirmative obligation to \u201cdecide which party\u2019s explanation of the employer\u2019s motivation it believes.\u201d <em>U.S. Postal Service Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, </em>103 S.Ct. at 1482.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-12\">Sylvester contends that the company\u2019s three proffered reasons for the discharge are mere pretexts, unworthy of credence, and that the magistrate clearly erred in ignoring the evidence that the racially-charged bedroom-sharing incidents precipitated the dismissal. In an effort to understand the magistrate\u2019s resolution of the conflicting evidence concerning the company\u2019s motive for discharging Sylvester, we turn to the magistrate\u2019s findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b1291-13\">We begin by noting that, of the three reasons proffered in support of Sylvester\u2019s dismissal, the magistrate found only one persuasive. The magistrate\u2019s bare factual recitation that \u201cthe company has articulated <em>a </em>legitimate non-discriminatory reason for [the] discharge,\u201d however, lends us no guidance as to which one of the three as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1214\">*1214</page-number>serted bases for the discharge was ultimately persuasive. An examination of other portions of the magistrate\u2019s opinion assists in the elimination of two of the company\u2019s reasons. First, as regards Sylvester\u2019s allegedly inferior work performance, the opinion merely summarized the relevant testimony without drawing from it any fact-finding: \u201cIt was the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s supervisor, Martin, that the plaintiff was an above average employee for the first few weeks of his employment, but thereafter his performance steadily declined.\u201d R.3, 211-12; R.2, 3. As for the second, Sylvester\u2019s alleged absenteeism, the magistrate once again simply summarized the evidence without drawing from it any factual conclusion:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-4\">The company records introduced at trial indicate that plaintiff was absent from work on December 9,1980 and portions of two additional days that same week. Plaintiff vehemently denied that he was absent those days. In an effort to ascertain exactly what occurred, the Court sought to obtain information from other company records to see if the plaintiff was working on another rig on those days as he claimed; however, the Court was blocked in its inquiry by the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys\u2019 objection to this procedure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-VX\">R.3, 212-13; R.2, 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-5\">It is therefore quite clear that the magistrate considered neither absenteeism nor unsatisfactory job performance to be a legally-sufficient reason for the dismissal. As for the third proffered reason, however, the company did offer some circumstantial evidence that Sylvester may have consumed intoxicating liquor while on the job or while on the way to work. A careful reading of the magistrate\u2019s opinion reveals that the magistrate placed great importance on the evidence of Sylvester\u2019s job-related drinking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1292-10\">On January 15, 1981, the plaintiff was fired after Martin found an empty Vodka bottle belonging to Sylvester in the truck used by the crew in servicing the equipment of the customers of the company. Testimony is conflicting as to whether the plaintiff was drinking at the job site or in the company truck on the way to the job site. In view of the fact that no employee was allowed to work on a rig after having taken any intoxicating beverages whatsoever, it is unnecessary to resolve this conflict in the testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtG6\">R.3, 213; R.2, 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1292-11\">Upon examination of the record evidence, we conclude that this finding is plagued by considerable defects. First, we note in passing that all testimony indicated that Sylvester and the crew returned from the overnight trip on January 15, and that Sylvester was fired not on that day, but on the very next day. This discrepancy may not by itself impugn the fact-finding. Even were we to excuse this discrepancy as immaterial, nonetheless the fact-finding would remain infected by its own incurable vagueness and sullied by its own unjustifiable innuendo. An example of the finding\u2019s open flaw is displayed in the recitation of facts contained in the appellee\u2019s own brief: \u201cJessie Sylvester ... was discharged January 16, 1981, one day after his rig supervisor [Martin] found evidence that Jessie had been drinking either during work or on the way to the job.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellee\u2019s brief at 4. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1215\">*1215</page-number>The record simply does not support a conclusion that Martin discovered an empty vodka bottle in the truck and, imputing ownership to Sylvester, fired him on the next day. There is simply no record evidence of <em>when </em>Martin found the bottle, although that missing component' would seem vital to the magistrate\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the proffered reason. Further, on the crucial issue of Martin\u2019s motive in firing Sylvester, there is absolutely no evidence that Martin\u2019s discovery of the vodka bottle precipitated the discharge, and little if any indication that the empty bottle played even a remote role in Martin\u2019s firing decision. Indeed, there is a paucity of specific evidence, and surely no fact-finding, establishing that Martin actually knew that Sylvester had engaged in on-the-job or before-the-job drinking. And, any inference to the contrary is expressly rebutted by Martin\u2019s own statements that \u201cthere never has been any smoke on the job that I knowed of, or drinking either,\u201d and that he never saw Sylvester drinking on the job.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When viewed in light of the record evidence, therefore, this key fact-finding is simply so ambiguous and misleading that it fails to assist our review of the employer\u2019s motivation, the essential component in the ultimate question of the employer\u2019s discrimination <em>vel non. </em>Accordingly, we find that the magistrate\u2019s opinion fails to conform to the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a). <em>See Redditt v. Mississippi Extended Care Centers, Inc., </em>718 F.2d at 1386; <em>Corley v. Jackson Police Dept., </em>566 F.2d 994, 1000 n. 8 (5th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1293-29\">In the instant case both parties offered evidence on the crucial issue of pretext. The magistrate declined to enter any meaningful fact-findings on the incidents surrounding the workover crew\u2019s hotel room arrangement, which Sylvester contended had precipitated his discharge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The magistrate moreover entered a misleading and inaccurate finding on the company\u2019s central justification for the discharge, and did not consider the two remaining proffered reasons to be sufficient (or perhaps necessary) to support a judgment in favor of Call\u00f3n <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1216\">*1216</page-number>Energy Services. Therefore, we cannot accurately determine whether the magistrate has properly satisfied his obligation to \u201cdecide which party\u2019s explanation of the employer\u2019s motivation [he] believe[d],\u201d <em>see Ai-kens, </em>103 S.Ct. at 1482, and which (if any) proffered explanation is worthy of credence, <em>see Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 256, 101 S.Ct. at 1095. Once the magistrate complies with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) and issues adequate fact-findings, an appeal would call for their review under the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard. At the present time, however, the conflict in the testimony remains acute, and on the basis of the few established facts, we are powerless to affirm.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlVq\">As we recently noted:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1294-4\">In reviewing the district court\u2019s finding of no discrimination under the clearly erroneous standard, this Court cannot be left to second guess the factual basis for the district court\u2019s conclusion. This Court cannot determine whether the district court\u2019s finding that plaintiff failed to demonstrate pretext was clearly erroneous when the district court\u2019s finding is not expressed with sufficient particularity. It is not the function of this Court to make credibility choices and findings of fact. We are therefore left with no choice but to vacate the judgment of the district court for failure to comply with Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a) and remand for findings of fact which indicate the factual basis for the district court\u2019s conclusion on the issue of pretext.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1294-7\"><em>Redditt v. Mississippi Extended Care Center, </em>718 F.2d at 1386. In this instance, we are likewise constrained to vacate the judgment and to remand for such additional proceedings, if any, as the district court or magistrate shall deem necessary to enable findings of fact establishing the factual basis for the conclusion on the issue of pretext. In this regard we advert to the fact-finder\u2019s express power \u201cto change, modify, or reassert its ultimate conclusion,\u201d unim-pugned, of course, by clear error. <em>Id. </em>at 1387. While we here acknowledge the fact-finder\u2019s broad powers to resolve conflicting evidence, we recognize that the fact-finder may very well wish to consider the substantial evidence underlying Sylvester\u2019s two paramount contentions: that he was expected to perform his job in an atmosphere charged with racial discrimination, and that the verifiable motive for his dismissal rested on the invidious grounds of race. Our ultimate review of this matter \u2014 if necessitated \u2014 would certainly profit from the resolution of these difficult questions of fact, upon which this dispute continues to thrive. At this time, however, unaided by any meaningful distillation of the controlling facts, we express no further view on the merits of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1217\">*1217</page-number>The judgment is VACATED, and the cause is REMANDED to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1289-13\">.

At no time did Martin \u2014 who did the firing \u2014 explain how the discovery of an empty vodka bottle was linked to his decision to discharge Sylvester. Sylvester admitted that while on the way to a job one day he shared a half-pint of vodka with Rogers. Rogers denied it. There is no evidence that anyone saw Sylvester drinking.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1293-41\">. <em>See </em>note 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1293-42\">. The magistrate\u2019s opinion merely stated: \u201cThere was testimony to the effect that a crew member voiced an objection to staying with plaintiff on overnight trips, but on the two trips he took while employed with Newman this plaintiff roomed with Rogers once and with Martin once.\u201d R.3, 216; R.2, 6-7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1294-5\">. We do not mean to suggest that Call\u00f3n Energy Services is charged with the burden or proving that it acted without a discriminatory motive in discharging Sylvester. Neither, of course, do we imply that the company in this case must adduce evidence that the discharge of Sylvester was in fact precipitated by Martin\u2019s discovery of the liquor bottle. As we recited above, to rebut Sylvester\u2019s prima facie case, the company needed only to adduce evidence sufficient to raise \u201ca genuine issue of fact as to whether it discriminated against the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Tex. Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. at 254-55, 101 S.Ct. at 1094-95; <em>Redditt v. Mississippi Extended Care Centers, Inc., </em>718 F.2d at 1385; <em>see Board of Trustees of Keene State College v. Sweeney, </em>439 U.S. 24, 99 S.Ct. 295, 58 L.Ed.2d 216 (1978). In adducing some evidence on the issues of Sylvester\u2019s absenteeism, his work performance, and his drinking practices, the company clearly discharged that slight burden. Yet it remains the province of this Court to review the lower court\u2019s findings of fact, subject to the strictures of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a). Here, the magistrate\u2019s failure to enter adequate findings of fact on the issue of whether the articulated reasons are pretexts has frustrated our attempt to discharge our responsibility to review the trial evidence under the light of Sylvester\u2019s contention that each reason is \u201cunworthy of credence.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Redditt v. Mississippi Extended Care Centers, Inc., </em>718 F.2d at 1386; <em>Corley v. Jackson Police Dept., </em>566 F.2d 994, 1000 n. 8 (5th Cir.1978). <em>Cf. Avant v. South Central Bell Telephone Co., </em>716 F.2d 1083, 1087 (5th Cir.1983) (holding that the record broadly supported the district court\u2019s decision on the question of which party\u2019s explanation of the employer\u2019s motivation it should believe).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
