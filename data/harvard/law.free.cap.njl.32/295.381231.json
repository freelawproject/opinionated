Nix.

Inasmuch, however, as the practice in' this matter appears to have heretofore been unsettled,-we think it best to decline quashing the writ for this defect, provided the prosecutor shall enter into a proper recognizance, and cause the same to be filed within sixty days. It must be understood that hereafter writs of <em>certiorari, </em>in bastardy cases, are not to be allowed, unless the prosecutor enters into a recognizance, with sufficient securities, as required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">Motion denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b305-11\"><em> Rev., p. </em>98, \u00a7 7</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
