The information was filed on the 1st of October, 1885, and on the following day the defendant was arraigned. On the 5th of December, 1885, the defendant moved to dismiss the prosecution, for the reason that he had not been brought to trial within sixty days after the filing of the information, and that the trial had not been at any time \u2022 continued or postponed on his application or with his consent; but that the same had been postponed against his protest. The motion was denied for the reason that the delay in bringing the defendant to trial was caused by the illness of the judge during a portion of the sixty days, and by his engagements in the trial of other cases during the remainder of that period. The further facts are stated in the opinion of the court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b568-9\"><em>J. M.
