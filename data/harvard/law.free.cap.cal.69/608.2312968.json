but the constitution expressly gives it the power by general laws to vest in the corporate authorities of the counties, cities, towns, or other public or municipal corporations, the power to assess and collect taxes for those purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">The fact that the petitioner here has, under a valid ordinance of the city of Modesto, paid a license tax as a liquor-dealer, which ordinance was authorized to be enacted under the statutes of 1885, p. 127, by the corporate authorities of said city, the same being of the sixth class, does not, in our judgment, exempt him from paying a tax also of such kind to the county of Stanislaus, properly levied, as in this case, by the board of supervisors thereof, under the constitutional provisions cited <em>supra, </em>and the act of 1883, p. 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>The ordinance under which he was obligated to pay this tax was a \u201claw of this state\u201d in the sense in which those words are used in section 435 of the Penal Code, and therefore under that statute the petitioner could be prosecuted for a misdemeanor.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">The writ should be dismissed and petitioner remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">Belcher, C. C., and Searls, C., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion, the writ is dismissed and petitioner remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Morrison, C. J., Myrick, J., Sharpstein, J., and Thornton, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
