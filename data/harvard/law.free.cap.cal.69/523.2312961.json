The only difficulty with the original complaint was that it did not sufficiently allege the presentation of the claim to the board of supervisors, which was but a condition precedent to the plaintiff\u2019s right to present his cause of action to the court. The allegation of the amended complaint in respect to that matter is, that the affidavit accompanying the claim presented to the board contained the statement that the claim \u201c is true and correct; that the same is due and owing from said county to deponent,\u201d etc. It is contended that this is not a compliance with the provision of the statute which requires the affidavit to such a claim to state \u201cthat the amount claimed is justly due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">In our opinion, the verification to the effect that the claim, which was for a certain number of dollars, \u201cis true and correct, and that the same is due and owing from said county to deponent,\u201d is a substantial compliance with the provision of the statute. It results that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded to the court below for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">So ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Morrison, C.
