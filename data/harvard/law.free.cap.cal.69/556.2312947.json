That a Justice\u2019s Court has jurisdiction of an action to recover a sum of money less in amount than three hundred dollars, for a fine, penalty, or forfeiture, given by statute or ordinance of a municipal corporation, provided no question of the legality of any tax, impost, assessment, toll, or municipal fine is raised;</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">2. That if any such question is made, it must be by answer, verified by the oath of the defendant; and</p>\n<p id=\"b586-9\">3. Unless so raised, no evidence as to such legality can be received.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-10\">As the answer in the present case raised no question touching the legality of the municipal ordinance or proceedings under which the indebtedness accrued, we must, for all the purposes of the cause, presume there was in fact no controversy on that subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">It was then simply an action to recover $123.50 in a case where the Justice\u2019s Court had jurisdiction, and in which the Superior Court acquired jurisdiction by virtue of the appellate jurisdiction conferred upon it, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>not under section 76 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which confers original jurisdiction only in such cases of this character as involve the <em>legality </em>of taxes, fines, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-3\">As the legality of the proceedings were not made an issue, and could not be inquired into in the Justice\u2019s Court, so upon the same pleadings in the Superior Court on an appeal from the former court no such inquiry could be had. <em>(Schroeder </em>v. <em>Wittram, </em>66 Cal. 636.)</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Causes originating in Justice\u2019s Court cannot be brought by appeal to this court, except cases of forcible entry and detainer, cases involving the title or possession of real property, or the legality of a tax, impost, assessment, toll, or municipal fine; and save in cases of forcible entry and detainer, these questions are not involved unless raised in the Justice\u2019s Court by a sworn answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">It follows that this appeal should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">Foote, C., and Belcher, C. C., concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b587-7\">The Court.</author>\n<p id=\"At0\">For the reasons given in the foregoing opinion, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
