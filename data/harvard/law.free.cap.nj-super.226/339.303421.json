Following an evaluation by the Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center at Avenel, defendant was sentenced to a term of seven years to the Center and assessed a $250 penalty made payable to the Violent Crimes Compensation Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">On appeal defendant contends:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-11\">\n<em>Point I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-12\">It was error for the trial court to admit the September 1984, October 5 (October 6), 1984 and October 28, 1984 statements by the victim to her mother in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-13\">\n<em>Point II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-14\">It was error for the trial court to deny defendant\u2019s motion for acquittal at the conclusion of the State\u2019s case concerning aggravated sexual assault.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-15\">\n<em>Point III</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-16\">It was error for the trial court to deny defendant\u2019s request to charge the lesser offense of lewdness to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-17\">\n<em>Point IV</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-18\">The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive and an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-19\">The facts of this case are fully detailed in the two reported Law Division opinions concerning the court\u2019s challenged rulings. <em>See State v. Ramos, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>197 (Law Div.1985); <em>State v. Ramos, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>206 (Law Div.1985). Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>careful review of the record persuades us that defendant\u2019s point III is meritless, substantially for the reasons expressed by Judge Menza in his April 23, 1985 opinion published at 203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>206. We also regard defendant\u2019s point I, respecting the child-victim\u2019s statements of October 6 and October 28 to be meritless. Judge Menza\u2019s finding that these statements represented admissible hearsay as excited utterances pursuant to <em>Evid.R. </em>63(4) is amply supported by the record. 203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">We recognize that in <em>State v. J.S., </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>247 (App.Div.1988), we expressly overruled the Law Division judge\u2019s ruling admitting testimony including the child\u2019s statement of September 1984. We there rejected his opinion that \u201cfresh complaint\u201d may be considered \u201c \u2018as corroboration of the victim\u2019s assertion that she was assaulted \u2014 a way to bolster her testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 257. Our review of the judge\u2019s actual charge, however, persuades us that, taken in its entirety, it did not contravene the rules of \u201cfresh complaint\u201d. The judge gave the jury the following instructions,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">Ladies and gentlemen, the witness just testified that her daughter Prances, after discussing the guidelines from the school, stated to the mother that Angel Ramos had touched her. The reason for allowing this testimony is based upon the nature of the dignity of a person undergoing such act [who] will be expected to complain to a parent or other person of authority to whom she would probably turn to in that event and express her feelings because of the insult to the child\u2019s dignity. Such evidence, though hearsay, is justified by the Court for the purpose of supporting the victim\u2019s complaint of the alleged occurrence. It\u2019s also because it is natural for one to complain of an act such as this that might occur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Although the judge failed to advise the jury that the only purpose of the testimony was to permit the State to rebut an inference created by silence and did speak of \u201csupporting\u201d the child\u2019s credibility, contrary to the admonition of <em>State v. J.S., supra, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 257, the jury was immediately alerted to the fact that the particular testimony had a limited purpose. <em>Evid R. </em>6.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">The trial of cases charging abuse of children represents perhaps the most difficult evidentiary dilemma facing our crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>nal courts today. <em>See State v. D.R., </em>109 <em>N.J. </em>348, 358-359 (1988).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A balance must be struck between protecting children and the danger of false accusation. We are persuaded that the cumulative trial errors in <em>State v. J.S., supra, </em>particularly the multiple hearsay, the use of interrogation to elicit the victim\u2019s complaints, and the excessive and exacerbating detail in the \u201cfresh complaint\u201d testimony, combined with that court\u2019s emphasis on \u201cbolstering\u201d the credibility of the child-witness, make that case distinguishable. In any event, we conclude that, if error in this case, the jury instruction concerning \u201cfresh complaint\u201d was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. We cannot find a \u201cdegree of possibility that [the error] led to an unjust verdict.\u201d <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 335 (1971)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Defendant also contends that it was error for the trial court to deny his motion for a judgment of acquittal of the charge of aggravated sexual assault under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a(1), because there was no evidence of sexual penetration. At trial the victim, Frances, testified that defendant, a close friend of the family with whom she stayed on the weekends, would undress her, touch her \u201cin my pasita\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with his hands and \u201click\u201d her pasita. A pediatrician testified that she examined Frances and that the child\u2019s hymen (membrane covering the vagina), normally intact in a six-year old, was broken, a condition usually caused by the insertion of a foreign body.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">\u201cSexual penetration\u201d is defined to include the insertion of any object into the vagina as well as \u201ccunnilingus\u201d for which vaginal penetration is unnecessary. <em>State v. Fraction, </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>532, 535 (App.Div.1985). Affording the prosecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>the benefit of all favorable evidence and its inferences, therefore, persuades us that the court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal. <em>See State v. Brown, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>587, 591-592 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">Finally defendant contends that his sentence is manifestly excessive and an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. Defendant was found to be a repetitive and compulsive sex offender and was sentenced accordingly. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:47-3. He was found guilty of a second-degree crime and received the presumptive sentence. Nothing in the record suggests that imprisonment was a serious injustice, <em>see State v. Sanders, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>609, 622 (1987), or justified sentencing defendant for a crime of a lower degree. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-1f(2). Defendant\u2019s lack of prior criminal history, good employment, and willingness to undergo treatment were known to and considered by the court. <em>Cf. State v. Porter, </em>210 <em>N.J.Super. </em>383, 396 (App.Div.1986), certif. den. 105 <em>N.J. </em>556 (1986). We find the sentence accorded with relevant guidelines. <em>See State v. Hodge, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>369, 377-378 (1984). <em>See also State v. Chapman, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>582, 587-589 (1984); <em>State v. Partusch, </em>214 <em>N.J.Super. </em>473, 480 (App.Div.1987); <em>State v. Hamm, </em>207 <em>N.J.Super. </em>40, 42-44 (App.Div.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b374-7\"><em>See also </em>Note, \u201cThe Testimony of Child Victims in Sex Abuse Prosecutions: Two Legislative Innovations,\" 98 <em>Harv.L.Rev. 806 </em>(1985); Note, \"A Comprehensive Approach to Child Hearsay Statements in Sex Abuse Cases,\" 83 <em>Colum.L.
