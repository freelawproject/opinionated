E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., </em>101 N.J. 161 (1985). There the Court held that the New Jersey Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-1 <em>et seq, </em>precluded plaintiffs from maintaining a separate tort action against their employer E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. (du Pont) and its physicians for failure to warn plaintiffs of the known risks of asbestos and their resulting asbestos-related medical conditions. The Court further held, however, that the exclusive remedy of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-8 did not bar plaintiffs\u2019 tort claims for aggravation of those conditions, to the extent that such aggravation resulted from defendants\u2019 fraudulent concealment of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">Following a five-week trial concerning those claims, a jury rendered verdicts in plaintiffs\u2019 favor;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the jury awarded compensatory damages for the following asserted periods of concealment as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b609-29\">The jury awarded punitive damages of $200,000 respecting each plaintiff employee. Total damages awarded were $1,382,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-30\">Defendants\u2019 motions for judgment n.o.v. or, alternatively, for a new trial, were denied. Defendants appeal from the ensuing judgment and from the denial of their motions, contending that the verdicts were unsupported by the evidence, and were the product of improper evidentiary admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-31\">Plaintiffs are all past or present employees at two du Pont New Jersey plants, Chambers Works and Repauno. Each plant contained extensive piping which was insulated with asbestos-containing material. Millison, Agar; C. Schwebel and H. Schwebel worked as pipecoverers or \u201claggers,\u201d installing and removing pipe and tank insulation. Kronmaier and Baptiste were pipefitters. They installed, repaired and removed the underlying pipes. In so doing, they removed old insulation from pipes. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>Each plaintiff, therefore, worked with and around asbestos-containing material on a frequent basis during relevant time periods. Each plaintiff received annual or semi-annual physical examinations and chest x-rays from du Pont\u2019s doctors. Each received notices from these doctors describing the state of his health following these examinations. At relevant times defendant Dr. Neeld was the medical director at Chambers Works and defendant Dr. Reichwein was a plant doctor at Repauno.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Plaintiffs proffered three experts at trial. Dr. Joseph Wagoner, an expert in epidemiology and in the development of knowledge of asbestos-related diseases; Dr. Auerbach, an expert in asbestos-related disease, and Dr. Sokolowski, an expert in pulmonary medicine. Dr. Miller, an expert in radiology, and Dr. Epstein, an expert in pulmonology, were the only witnesses for defendants. All of the experts acknowledged that, judged by modem medical knowledge, plaintiffs\u2019 past x-rays demonstrated asbestos-related conditions. The most common symptom was thickening of the pleura, or membrane covering the surface of the lung. Plaintiffs\u2019 experts testified that evidence of pleural thickening (or pleural plaque if localized) in plaintiffs\u2019 x-rays at relevant times should have alerted defendant doctors to the presence of asbestos-related conditions and that continued exposure to asbestos aggravated the condition. Defendants\u2019 experts, on the other hand, said that evidence of pleural changes did not justify a diagnosis of an asbestos-related condition at relevant times. It was Miller\u2019s opinion that, although many radiologists knew in the 1950s that asbestos exposure caused interstitial lung disease, radiologists did not associate pleural plaque or thickening with asbestos exposure until 1977 and 1978. Defendant\u2019s experts further gave the opinion that, once an asbestos-related condition was incurred, deterioration was inevitable and not related to further exposure. That underlying difference of expert opinion was related to each plaintiff\u2019s particularized claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>\n<em>William Millison</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">William Millison was employed almost continuously at du Pont\u2019s Chambers Works plant from 1953 to the time of trial. Millison\u2019s 1974 du Pont x-rays demonstrated to the experts asbestos-related changes if judged by 1987 medical knowledge. He worked under further asbestos exposure between 1974 and 1979. Following each du Pont physical examination, he, in accord with undisputed du Pont procedure (applicable to all plaintiffs), received written notice that he suffered from no relevant medical problem and was fit for continued asbestos-related work.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">In 1979, du Pont sent Millison\u2019s x-ray history to be read by outside radiologist specialists.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Three months after these 1979 x-rays, du Pont scheduled Millison for additional x-rays at the request of the outside radiologist. Millison testified that this made him suspicious that du Pont was hiding something from him. He therefore consulted his own pulmonary specialist, Dr. Morowitz, who informed Millison that he had asbestosis and advised him not to work in any asbestos environment. At Neeld\u2019s request, Neeld and Millison met. When Millison told Neeld what Morowitz said, Neeld said that Millison did not have asbestosis because he did not have all the \u201csymptoms.\u201d Neeld refused to recommend that Millison be removed from his work assignment so long as he used available protective equipment. Millison testified that when he asked for a transfer, Neeld said \u201cIf I do it for you, I\u2019ve got to do it for everybody.\u201d Millison testified, \u201cHe told me that the company was going to take care of me. So when I asked him how they were going to take care of me, ... he said the company was going to pay my burial expenses.\u201d Neeld\u2019s August 13, 1979 letter identified Millison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>as having \u201cbenign asymptomatic abnormalities\u201d based upon pleural thickening \u201cas identified in May 1979.\u201d He there described Millison as a \u201clifetime ... lagger [who] had the <em>probability </em>of exposure to asbestos.\u201d [emphasis added].<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ay3\">\n<em>Frank Baptiste</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Baptiste worked at du Pont\u2019s Repauno plant from 1951 until his retirement in 1980, but was not exposed to asbestos after 1972 or 1973. In May 1951, du Pont\u2019s Dr. Zahn (not a defendant) noted several abnormalities in Baptiste\u2019s pre-employment x-ray (enlarged hilus shadows on both lungs and increased parenchyma markings). According to du Pont records, Zahn did not find any active pathology and approved Baptiste as an employee. In 1976, defendant Reichwein\u2019s records described these abnormalities as \u201cunchanged for several years.\u201d According to plaintiffs\u2019 experts, Baptiste\u2019s 1970 x-rays revealed asbestos-related disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">In April 1979, Baptiste pulled a chest muscle and his family doctor (Dr. Valecchi) referred Baptiste to a pulmonary specialist, Dr. Joseph Sokolowski, who, in May 1979, found a \u201crestrictive ventilatory defect, consistent with asbestos exposure.\u201d Baptiste testified that when he asked his supervisor, John Davis, why he wasn\u2019t told of his condition, Davis stated, \u201cWhat the hell good would it do you?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">\n<em>Edward Agar</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Agar worked at the Chambers Works plant from 1961 to his retirement in 1985, save for a period in 1965. Agar\u2019s February 1975 x-ray showed pleural plaque and pleural thickening. He continued to be exposed to asbestos between 1975 and 1979. On February 15, 1979, defendant Neeld, in response to a request concerning whether Agar\u2019s medical record demonstrated any pulmonary problems, noted in Agar\u2019s medical records, \u201cHe has none.\u201d According to Neeld\u2019s records, he recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>mended, however, an updated physical, because the last one was received in July 1977. Following receipt of Agar\u2019s April 3, 1979 x-ray analysis from Drs. Allen and Oglesby, his records were sent to the outside specialist, Dr. Egoville. Following June of 1979 x-ray analysis identifying calcifications as \u201cconsistent with changes which could be due to previous exposure to asbestos or other irritant materials,\u201d Neeld wrote in Agar\u2019s medical record that he told Agar that \u201cwe do not identify any \u2018abnormal physical findings.\u2019 \u201d After receiving Dr. Egoville\u2019s report, however, du Pont characterized Agar\u2019s case as one of \u201casbestos-related benign symptomatic illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Agar testified that, when he attended a safety meeting in February 1979, he found the cigarette smoke unbearable, so he left. Neeld refused to excuse him. Neeld told the general foreman that he had no pulmonary problems and he was suspended for two and one half days without pay for leaving a meeting without permission. His April 1979 annual physical was followed by a card saying that \u201cthere was nothing wrong with me\u201d. He said he had complained of chest pains to du Pont beginning in 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">\n<em>Clarence Schewebel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">C. Schwebel worked almost continuously at the Repauno plant from 1951 to the trial date. Pleural thickening was evident in his 1973 x-ray; 1976 x-rays showed \u201cquite apparent pleural changes\u201d and the 1977 x-rays were \u201cobviously not normal.\u201d C. Schwebel was further exposed to asbestos between 1976 and 1978. In 1978, C. Schwebel\u2019s daughter, a respiratory therapist, heard noises in his chest and advised him to see his family doctor, Dr. Brower, who took x-rays and informed C. Schwebel that he thought that he had asbestos-related disease. C. Schwebel was also referred to Dr. Egoville in May 1978. Dr. Egoville made a presumptive diagnosis of asbestosis. C. Schwebel then confronted defendant Reichwein with this information. C. Schwebel testified that Reichwein denied that he had visible asbestosis, but said, \u201cyou got it from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>the coal mine or you got it from the rock quarry or you had pneumonia.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to medical records, Reichwein advised C. Schwebel that, while the reports were consistent with asbestosis, they were not specifically diagnostic of asbestosis.</p>\n<p id=\"AAG\">\n<em>Vernon Kronmaier</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Kronmaier worked at the Repauno plant from 1951 to October 1981, when he took a disability pension (for apparently unrelated reasons). He ceased working as a pipefitter in 1977, when he asked to be transferred to light duty. Kronmaier\u2019s 1965 x-rays showed pleural plaque and thickening in the left mid-lung field, a condition unchanged in the 1966 and 1968 x-rays. He was exposed to asbestos from 1965 to 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">\n<em>Harold Schwebel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">H. Schwebel worked at the Chambers Works plant from 1946 to 1948, again from 1950 to 1951, and then almost continuously at the Repauno plant from 1951 until he retired in 1976. He stopped working with asbestos, however, in 1975. H. Schwebel died on March 21, 1984, of cancer (not claimed in this litigation to be caused by defendants). Pulmonary changes were visible in H. Schwebel\u2019s 1965 x-rays, although there was evidence that the changes could be attributed to non-asbestos-related causes. His expert testified, however, that in H. Schwebel\u2019s 1971 x-rays, pleural changes appeared asbestos-related. H. Schwebel was exposed to asbestos between 1971 and 1975. Du Pont\u2019s 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969 and 1972 medical reports listed abnormalities in H. Schwebel\u2019s x-rays, but attributed them to \u201cold inactive lung disease\u201d. At deposition H. Schwebel said that defendant Reichwein told him he had an asbestos-related condition before his retirement (not indicated in the record as asbestos-related). Miller testified that calcifications in H. Schwebel\u2019s lungs, visible in 1971, should be attributed to tuberculosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>We have earlier noted the nature of the expert testimony. In addition to the expert opinion concerning what defendants should have known, plaintiffs proffered considerable evidence of corporate knowledge from corporate records. In 1964, Dr. Gordon Stopps (then chief of physiology at du Pont\u2019s Haskell laboratory)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> attended an international conference held by the New York Academy of Sciences on the biological effects of asbestos. Stopps prepared a report which he forwarded to Dr. J.A. Zapp, Director of the laboratory, and to Dr. C.A. D\u2019Alonzo, du Pont\u2019s corporate Medical Director. Stopps recommended pulmonary function testing for \u201call workers exposed to a definite [asbestos] risk,\u201d including those installing and ripping out insulation, based on du Pont\u2019s use of \u201croughly 200,000 pounds of pipe insulation\u201d of which \u201c70 per cent\u201d was asbestos.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">A copy of Stopps\u2019 1964 report went to each du Pont plant physician, and by further memo (dated November 12, 1964), Stopps informed D\u2019Alonzo of his intention to examine the health records of insulation workers at the Chambers Works plant. There followed extensive correspondence between Stopps and du Pont plant medical personnel concerning the very long incubation period of asbestosis, the need to identify exposed workers and how to monitor their health. (In June of 1966 Stopps urged that all pipe insulation workers wear respirators.) There was correspondence between Stopps and D\u2019Alonzo on the need for corporate funds to pursue the study of existing personnel health. His suggested sample review of Chambers Works employees was conducted by Haskell\u2019s Dr. Mary Max-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>field who made a report in August of 1966. She reviewed the physical examination cards and x-rays of 52 pipecoverers (presumably including Millison and Agar, in accord with Neeld\u2019s simultaneous analysis). Her analysis of the 1955-1966 x-rays at Chambers Works catagorized the workers by observable conditions, including pleural thickening, fibrosis, emphysema, bronchiectasis, atelectasis, pneumoconiosis and tuberculoma. This report was sent to Neeld. Stopps wrote Neeld that, \u201cWhile it would appear that there is no cause for concern as to an undue incidence of cancer among these workers, any other conclusion would be of doubtful validity until more data are obtained.\u201d Stopps recommended a corporate meeting to \u201cwork out a plan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Maxfield\u2019s 1966 report to Stopps, among other medical literature, precipitated an October 25,1966 meeting of medical executives of du Pont which Stopps arranged. Neeld attended that meeting. Stopps memorialized the October 25, 1966 meeting\u2019s purpose, which was to formulate an asbestos strategy with the corporation\u2019s medical officials, including a plan to compare the medical records of asbestos-related employees with non-asbestos-related employees, to develop a registry of all such workers and to develop pulmonary function tests to become part of the annual physical examination for targeted workers. Stopps also mentioned funding as a problem, although a small one, when compared with the risk to health and the risks of worker suits. In November 1966, D\u2019Alonzo wrote to all plant physicians that a pilot study concerning pulmonary tests was being implemented at the Chambers Works plant under the guidance of a pulmonary specialist from the Ohio State University Medical Center. Plant physicians were advised not to buy expensive equipment or initiate \u201cany definitive program until recommendations [were] received.\u201d In February 1967, however, Stopps wrote, \u201cCertain of the proposals made at [the October 25] meeting are being carried out ..., but in general the medical recommendations have not been implemented.\u201d He noted that past incidence of cancer did not adequately reflect the current <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>problem to the exposed population because of the long incubation period of asbestos-related conditions. He urged that the \u201cexposed population\u201d be monitored. In May 1970, du Pont held a company-wide conference on the potential health hazards of asbestos, expressly excepting the question of compensation of employees. Stopps identified an August 1970 set of guidelines which spoke of informing employees who worked with insulation about potential health problems. Stopps left du Pont in 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">A second company-wide conference was held in June 1972, and a third in May 1974. On the 1972 agenda was the topic of medical surveillance of asbestos workers. (The 1974 conference was intended, in part, to educate management concerning compliance with the recently enacted Occupational Safety and Health Act and the recent standards on asbestos promulgated by the United States Department of Labor.)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">It was undisputed that these conferences resulted in various company changes: the use of procedures for controlling dust and meetings with plant employees concerning the use of safety devices and practices. Millison testified that in 1977 he attended a meeting where employees were instructed on safety procedures and the use of safety equipment, but it was not until 1980 that he was informed of the dangers of asbestos. Millison further testified that employees installing or removing asbestos were not required to wear respirators until the \u201clate 1970s\u201d and prior to that time very few respirators were available for those who desired to wear them (two or three for approximately 100 employees). Kronmaier testified that he was never given a respirator nor any safety instructions (he stopped pipefitting in 1977). C. Schwebel testified that respirators were not required until the \u201clater years\u201d and only when one was in the \u201csaw room\u201d (a room sectioned off from the plant in later years for sawing asbestos blocks). Masks<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> were avail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>able prior to this time, but they, as well as respirators, were ineffective because of the lack of a \u201cgood seal.\u201d C. Schwebel said he complained about this but nothing was done. Agar also testified that respirators were not required until the late 1970\u2019s. Agar further testified that in the mid-to-late 1970\u2019s, safety procedures were imposed, such as wearing certain clothing, wetting down a dusty area, etc. Baptiste (who was not exposed to asbestos after 1972) testified that he was never required to wear a respirator. He admitted attending safety meetings concerning dust exposure in 1973 or 1974.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">The only evidence presented by defendants concerning their communications to plaintiffs about asbestos was a 1977 memo on removal of asbestos-containing insulation and a 1976 film on the use of respirators. No du Pont executive, medical or otherwise, testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Defendant Neeld, who was introduced to the jury at opening, but who did not testify, was Medical Director of the Chambers Works plant (where Millison and Agar were employees) at all relevant times. Plaintiffs conceded that, as Medical Director, Neeld was rarely personally involved in the individual medical exams of plant employees, but as Director, he reviewed the reports, received the 1964 and 1966 memos and attended the 1966 meeting. Prior to the October 1966 meeting, on August 19, 1966, Neeld responded to D\u2019Alonzo\u2019s inquiry (initiated by Stopps) to review Chambers Works employees\u2019 records for possible exposure to asbestos. Neeld said he reviewed the medical files of the 56 pipecoverers, including Millison and Agar, and found only one man with pulmonary disease (not a plaintiff). His 1966 report reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">Presently, we have 56 employees whose job classification is pipecoverer or lagger (Addendum #2). Their medical classification is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">Class I - 45 [Including Millison and Agar]</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">Class II - 10</p>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">Class III - 1</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Of these, only one, a Class II man ... has any pulmonary disease. He has no work restrictions. His diagnosis is pulmonary fibrosis with compensatory emphysema and it is known to be nonoccupational in origin. A review of the records of the remaining men show x-ray findings which describe \u2018mild parenchymal changes consistent with early fibrosis.\u2019 Of course, this minor degree is often subjective and based on the feelings of the physician describing the x-ray.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">On December 9,1966, defendant Neeld responded to D\u2019Alonzo\u2019s follow-up request for the numbers of any employees who had experienced asbestosis, mesothelioma or carcinoma. His reply was \u201c0.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He said that his records showed only one pipefitter dying between 1950 and 1966, for pulmonary reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">In a June 12, 1972 memo, Neeld stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-8\">... In 1968 I undertook an indepth study of the problem [asbestos exposure] and of our experience on Chambers Works.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-9\">My conclusions then parallel my belief now and that is that Chambers Works has no health problem as it relates to asbestos____ [T]here were no deaths in any workers for lung reasons who had ever been laggers or construction employees whose work exposure might occasionally be around asbestos.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-12\">Of all the 85 cases of cancer of the lung there is not a single case of the cancer category mesothelioma which purportedly is caused by asbestos.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-13\">Reichwein, who was also introduced to the jury, but who did not testify, was a physician at the Repauno plant at all relevant times, where C. Schwebel, Baptiste, Kronmaier and H. Schwebel worked. Reichwein personally reviewed x-rays of these four plaintiffs. He reviewed Kronmaier\u2019s annual and semi-annual x-rays from 1966 through 1978; he reviewed the annual and semi-annual x-rays of H. Schwebel from 1966 to 1975; he reviewed Baptiste\u2019s annual and semi-annual x-rays from 1966 to 1976, and he reviewed C. Schwebel\u2019s annual x-rays from 1967 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>1978, each time stamping the record, \u201cthere is no evidence of active cardiac or pulmonary pathology.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Between July 1978 and March 1979, OSHA investigated du Pont\u2019s Repauno plant, and cited du Pont for non-compliance with asbestos regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Defendants first assert that the verdict was not supported by the evidence. Plaintiffs concede that they were required to prove \u201caggravation of [occupational-disease] illnesses resulting from defendants\u2019 fraudulent concealment of already-discovered disabilities\u201d <em>(Millison, supra, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>at 166) and that, \u201c[p]roofs that the doctors negligently misdiagnosed plaintiffs\u2019 x-rays or estimated poorly concerning the seriousness of plaintiffs\u2019 maladies [would] be insufficient to establish a cause of action outside the Compensation Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183. Plaintiffs acknowledge that they had the \u201cunenviable burden of proving a deliberate corporate strategy to conceal plaintiffs\u2019 asbestos-related diseases that were discovered by defendants-doctors in corporate physical examinations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 183. This was the burden which was charged to the jury and against which the proofs must be measured.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">The following proofs were virtually undisputed: (1) each plaintiff evidenced symptoms of an asbestos-related condition during his du Pont employment between 1965 and 1979; (2) none was informed of his symptoms until 1978 or 1979, after OSHA conducted its investigation (except H. Schwebel, retired); (3) du Pont management and physicians, including defendant doctors, knew of the dangers of prolonged asbestos exposure and its relationship to pulmonary disease as early as the 1960s, yet they gave targeted employees (known to them) minimal information concerning those risks beginning only in the mid to late 1970s; (4) defendant doctors either examined or reviewed the x-rays of each plaintiff, knowing each was vulnerable, after each evidenced an asbestos-related condition and after the symptoms shown were referred to in du Pont studies, including some of the same employees; (5) each plaintiff was continually <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>advised by defendants that he had no relevant health problems and returned to work for du Pont in the asbestos environment, and (6) no responsible corporate official or doctor denied individual or corporate knowledge respecting a medical understanding of the significance of plaintiffs\u2019 x-rays at relevant times. While du Pont did dispute that plaintiffs had established that their conditions worsened after defendant doctors assured them of their health and they continued to be exposed to asbestos, there was contrary evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">It is well settled that a conspiracy can be proved by circumstantial evidence alone, because rarely will there be direct evidence. <em>See Interstate Circuit, Inc. v. United States, </em>306 <em>U.S. </em>208, 221, 59 <em>S.Ct. </em>467, 472, 83 <em>L.Ed. </em>610, 617 (1939); <em>U.S. v. Trotter, </em>529, <em>F.2d </em>806 (3d Cir.1976); <em>State v. General Restoration Co., </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>366, 375 (1964); <em>State v. Sherwin, </em>127 <em>N.J.Super. </em>370 (App.Div.1974), certif. den. 65 <em>N.J. </em>569 (1974), petition dism. sub. nom., <em>Loughran v. N.J., </em>419 <em>U.S. </em>801, 95 <em>S.Ct. </em>9, 42 L.Ed.2d 32 (1974). The evidence need not lead to certainty, as long as the inferences drawn are \u201cgrounded in a preponderance of the probabilities according to the common experience of mankind.\u201d <em>Joseph v. Passaic Hospital Ass\u2019n, </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>557, 575 (1958). The inference cannot be mere guess or conjecture. It must be grounded in logic. <em>Ibid. </em>The line between the two is often difficult to draw and is, of course, a decision to be made by the trier of fact. <em>Ibid. </em>In the absence of any contrary testimony concerning defendants\u2019 asserted knowledge and concealment, the jury was free to treat silence as evidence. <em>Baxter v. Palmigiano, </em>425 <em>U.S. </em>308, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>1551, 47 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>810 (1976); <em>Mahne v. Mahne, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>53, 60 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Respecting the individual defendants, plaintiffs assert that defendant Neeld was responsible, if at all, under the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior </em>because he conducted no actual review of the x-rays. As noted, Neeld did not testify. The jury was instructed to find against him, however, only if he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>actual knowledge of plaintiffs\u2019 conditions and conspired to keep that information from them. We thus find Neeld\u2019s reliance upon <em>Wirth v. Gabry, </em>122 <em>N.J.L. </em>95 (E. &amp; A. 1939) and <em>Little v. Caterpillar Tractor Co., </em>169 So.2d 654 (La.App.1964) misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">In addition to challenging the sufficiency of evidence of individual and corporate knowledge, defendants contend that there was no evidence that plaintiffs\u2019 initially-contracted asbestos-related conditions were aggravated by workplace exposure during the period of alleged concealment. Alternatively, they urge that, if evidence of aggravation existed, it was insufficiently quantified. In support of that contention, defendants argue that plaintiffs\u2019 experts\u2019 testimony to that effect constituted \u201cnet opinions.\u201d <em>See Buckelew v. Grossbard, </em>87 <em>N.J. </em>512, 524 (1981). We disagree. We find defendants\u2019 reliance upon <em>Ayers v. Jackson Tp., </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>557 (1987) misplaced. In <em>Ayers, </em>the court refused to recognize a cause of action for the unquantified enhanced risk of a disease which had not occurred, and which might never occur. <em>Id. </em>at 597-598. In so holding, the court distinguished the problem of quantifying an injury for an intentional tort representing an injury that had occurred and could be proven at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The scope of review in a challenge to a jury verdict as being against the weight of the evidence is limited to a determination of whether the verdict resulted in a miscarriage of justice. <em>R. </em>2:10-1; <em>Carrino v. Novotny, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>355, 360-361 (1979); <em>Baxter v. Fairmont Food Co., </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>588, 599 (1977); <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. 2, </em>6-8 (1969); <em>Pekter v. Price, </em>206 <em>N.J.Super. </em>355, 357 (App.Div.1985). While an appellate court must make its own determination whether there is a miscarriage of justice, and defer to the trial judge only with respect to those \u201cintangible aspects\u201d such as witness demeanor and the \u201cfeel of the case,\u201d <em>Rivera v. Westinghouse Elevator Co., </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>543, 548 (App.Div.1986), aff\u2019d. as mod. 107 <em>N.J. </em>256 (1987), \u201ca jury verdict is impregnable, unless so distorted and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>wrong, ... as to manifest with utmost certainty a plain miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Carrino, supra, </em>78 <em>N.J. </em>at 360. Our careful review of the record persuades us that the verdict was supported by the evidence and we have no warrant to disturb it.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">We now turn to the real and troublesome issue in the case: the improper admission of the OSHA citations as substantive evidence. In August of 1978, OSHA investigators Vincent Gallagher and Myra Hess were sent to the Repauno plant (at the insistence of the employees' union) to investigate a complaint of chemical exposures to the employees. Gallagher testified that, while he was at the plant, Union President Watson told him of employee complaints of unsafe work conditions due to asbestos. Gallagher returned for a few more visits and said he observed \u201ctons of asbestos insulation on miles of pipe as well as other heat generating equipment.\u201d Samples of insulation were tested by OSHA. At the request of OSHA, Repauno plant employees\u2019 x-rays and medical histories were reviewed by a doctor from the University of Pennsylvania, and Chambers Works plant employees\u2019 x-rays and medical histories were reviewed by Dr. Miller (who testified for defendants).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">As a result of the information collected, Gallagher participated in the writing of a report which was submitted to his supervisors, and whieh, in turn, resulted in the issuance of OSHA citations against du Pont on April 13 and 16 of 1979. The citations charged that du Pont had \u201cwillfully\u201d violated the law. One page read that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">(a) Employer [du Pont] failed to correlate the available medical data of the x-rays and pulmonary function tests. This data, concerning pulmonary and radiological changes, gives evidence of seven cases of pleural thickening and two eases of asbestosis. The nine insulators involved were not notified by employer of their medical conditions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-9\">(b) The administration and organization, within employer\u2019s management hierarchy, did not insure that medical data was competently evaluated and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>viewed, and in addition, did not ensure that effective treatment or preventative action was taken when warranted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Pursuant to 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>sec. 659(a), du Pont contested the citations with the Department of Labor, resulting in a settlement which eliminated the \u201cwillful\u201d designation, and provided that the alleged violations had been abated. The stipulation further provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">That the Citation and Notification of Penalty, Complaint, Answer, Stipulated Settlement, Respondent\u2019s Notice of Contest, Respondent\u2019s withdrawal of its Notice of Contest, Respondent\u2019s failure to continue to contest, Respondent\u2019s abatement of the alleged violations, Respondent\u2019s payment of any penalty and the Commission\u2019s Pinal Order entered herein shall not constitute any evidence or admission upon the part of Respondent, or be admitted into evidence, in whole or in part, in any proceeding or litigation in any court, agency or forum, except in proceedings brought directly under the Act by the Secretary, inasmuch as the contents of the Stipulated Settlement are for the exclusive benefit of the parties hereto; nor shall they constitute an admission upon the part of Respondent that any of the conditions alleged in the Citations or Complaint existed or were the cause, or a cause proximate or otherwise, of any accident, or damages, if any, resulting therefrom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Plaintiffs-employees\u2019 union, represented by plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, objected to this language. They petitioned the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC) for a discretionary review.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On February 13, 1981, OSHRC affirmed the settlement as written. No appeal was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">Before trial, defendants moved to bar \u201c(1) all documents and/or testimony regarding the administrative proceedings conducted by [OSHA] with respect to du Pont\u2019s Repauno ... and Chambers Works ... plants and (2) the testimony ... and/or all reports authored <em>by ... </em>[OSHA investigators and/or agents].\u201d The judge ruled that the texts of the citations, although hear<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>say, were admissible as official documents under <em>Evid.R. </em>63(15). He further said that the citations were tantamount to a \u201cworkplace survey\u201d under the Worker and Community Right to Know Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:5A-16. The judge ruled, however, that the terms of the settlement itself were inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">As a result of this ruling, many trial references were made to the fact that du Pont had been cited by OSHA. The citations themselves were admitted into evidence. No instruction limiting their use was requested by defendants nor given to the jury-</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">There can be no question that the OSHA citations were hearsay. <em>Evid.R. </em>63; <em>State v. Johnson, </em>216 <em>N.J.Super. </em>588, 600 (App.Div.1987), and were improperly admitted under <em>Evid.R. </em>63(15), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b625-9\">... [A] statement is admissible if in the form of (a) a written statement of an act done, or an act, condition or event observed by a public official if it was within the scope of his duty either to perform the act reported or to observe the act, condition or event reported and to make the written statement, or (b) statistical findings made by a public official whose duty it was to investigate the facts concerning the act, condition or event and to make statistical findings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">The citations neither contained a report nor were they the finding of a public official. Although based on Gallagher\u2019s report (not in evidence), they were signed by OSHA Area Director Harry D. Allendorf, who observed nothing. Any relevant underlying medical reports were prepared by doctors who were consultants, not \u201cpublic officials,\u201d <em>see Evid.R. </em>62(3). Most important, the citations were unsubstantiated charges of law violation. Defendants correctly compared them to an arrest record.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">The Occupational Safety and Health Act (The Act) of 1970 was designed to insure safe and healthful working conditions in employment (29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>sec. 651(b)), in part by authorizing the Secretary of Labor to set safety standards and by creating a review commission to adjudicate disputes (29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>sec. 651(b)(3)). <em>See also Taylor Diving and Salvage Co., Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>599 <em>F.2d </em>622 (5th Cir.1979). Section 658(a) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>of the Act mandates the Secretary of Labor to issue citations if upon inspection or investigation he believes that an employer has violated any standard, rule or order promulgated under the Act. If the employer doesn\u2019t contest the citation within 15 days of its issuance, it is deemed a final order of the Commission and not subject to review by any court or agency. 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>sec. 659(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">It is well settled that the OSHA regulations were intended neither to create nor to destroy common law rights and liabilities of employers or employees arising out of employment. 29 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>sec. 653(b)(4); <em>Frohlick Crane Serv. Inc. v. Occupational S. &amp; H.R.C., </em>521 F.2d 628, 631 (10th Cir.1975); Annotation, <em>OSHA Violation by Employer or Third Party as Providing Cause of Action for Employee, </em>35 A.L.R.Fed. 461 (1977). The Act was intended to be preventive, <em>B &amp; B Insulation, Inc. v.

International Harvester Co., </em>754 F.2d 573, 581, 581 n. 5 (5th Cir.1985); Annotation, <em>Violation of OSHA Regulation as Affecting Tort Liability, </em>79 A.L.R.3d 962 (1977), OSHA citations are the opinions of investigators and ordinarily do not \u201ccarry with [them] the indicia of reliability that is inherent in government adopted safety standards.\u201d <em>Dixon, </em>supra, 754 F.2d at 581 n. 5.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>In <em>Phillips v.

Plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>State v. Moore, </em>158 <em>N.J.Super. </em>68 (App.Div. 1978) is misplaced. We there held that the report at issue would be admissible, if at all, as the best available secondary evidence under <em>Evid.R. </em>70. <em>Id. </em>at 77-78. We expressly refused to rule on the admissibility of the report under <em>Evid.R. </em>63(15).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Nor were the citations admissible as a business entry under <em>Evid.R. </em>63(13). While \u201cbusiness\u201d includes governmental activity, <em>Evid.R. </em>62(5), a report is not admissible simply because it was made in the regular course of a business, government or otherwise. <em>See Brown v. Mortimer, </em>100 <em>N.J.Super. </em>395 (App. Div.1968). The report must be otherwise reliable. <em>See McCormick supra, </em>sec. 308 at 877. As noted, this was not a report. Reasons for excluding factual conclusions derived from investigatory proceedings under <em>Evid.R. </em>63(15), apply equally under <em>Evid.R. </em>63(13) <em>see Phillips, supra, </em>107 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 594.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The judge cited the Supreme Court\u2019s referral to the Worker and Community Right to Know Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:5A-1 <em>et seq. (see Millison v. E.

Macon, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>325, 338-340 (1971). In <em>Meadoux v. Hall, </em>369 So. 2d 240 (La.Ct.App.1979), writ den. 369 So. 2d 1366 (1979), plaintiffs\u2019 counsel referred to an OSHA investigation and the resulting citations, including a reference to a finding of guilt and payment of fine. The court held that the improper admission was harmless because the trial judge instructed the jury that the fine was paid based on an administrative decision that it would be cheaper to pay it than contest it. He further instructed that the fine was paid without admission of guilt. <em>Id. </em>at 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">In <em>Lenoir v. C.O. Porter Machinery Co., </em>672 A.2d 1240, 1247-1248 (5th Cir.1982), the court held that the admission of an OSHA citation as evidence of negligence was harmless error, as it merely tended to prove that a particular area of the plant was safe because it was not included. In <em>Dixon v. Internad Harvester Co., supra, </em>the court stated that if evidence of a violation of an OSHA regulation proffered against a defendant who was not the employer was error, it was harmless because of other overwhelming evidence. 754 F.2d at 582.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">There can be no question that Gallagher\u2019s relevant testimony concerning what he saw and what the employees complained to him about was admissible, because the evidence related to <em>what </em>du Pont knew, and <em>when </em>it first learned what it knew. Millison\u2019s 1979 du Pont employment record contained the words, \u201cdo <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>not enter on OSHA log,\u201d and OSHA advised plaintiffs of their asbestos-related conditions. Defendants\u2019 witness was one of the doctors requested by OSHA to review du Pont\u2019s medical records. Clearly, certain references to OSHA\u2019s involvement were inevitable and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">During the trial the judge told the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">Members of the jury, prior to the time that you were excused, Mr. Gallagher, the witness presently on the stand, incorporated into an answer the use of the term violations. It\u2019s the recollection of the court that this was at or about the time he said he put the data that he collected into a report and it was the impulse of the court at that time to interrupt and correct that term violations and it properly should read [\u201c]alleged[\u201d] violations so that you are instructed to accept that phraseology and to put out of your mind the other terminology.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">Thus the jury knew the charges outlined in the citation were unproved. Moreover, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel limited the use of the citation in his closing argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-9\">OSHA came on in 1978 and citations were issued, United States Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-10\">Do you know what the <em>real importance of that is, not the citation, not the language, </em>this is evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-11\">... [B]ut the importance of this is that this is <em>what </em>\u2014 this <em>is how these men came to know that they were sick in each and every case. </em>Some guys, because of fortuitous events like breaking a rib or hearing noises, found out a little sooner____ In each and every case OSHA came on to Repauno in \u201978 and in Chambers Works in \u201979.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-14\">In the summer of '79 OSHA came on and said let\u2019s look at his records. And in July of \u201979 [Neeld] said I change my mind, you\u2019re sick now. What a coincidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-15\">While the wording of the citation was hearsay, the <em>fact </em>of OSHA\u2019s investigation and the timing of the citation was not hearsay. It was admissible for the purpose that plaintiffs asserted, to demonstrate that defendants, who claimed no prior knowledge of plaintiffs\u2019 asbestos-related conditions, developed new related policies of employee communication only after OSHA investigated.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>The real error was a lack of limiting instruction to the jury under <em>Evid.R. </em>6.

Assoc., </em>51 <em>N.J. </em>62 (1968).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In view of the limiting circumstances of the proffer, the failure of defendants to request a limiting charge and the weight of the other evidence, we are persuaded that the admission of one erroneous document among over 5,000 exhibits<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and 2,700 pages of testimony did not lead to a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The judgment and order appealed from are accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b608-11\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaints against defendant-manufacturers and suppliers of asbestos listed in the caption were not tried in the Law Division nor are they involved in this appeal.

E.I. du Pont de Neumours &amp; Co., supra, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>at 180 n. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b628-7\">In <em>Dixon, </em>754 F.2d at 581, n. 5, the <em>Lenoir </em>rejection of OSHA citation admissibility was distinguished from the propriety of admitting OSHA regulations into evidence. In both cases the Fifth Circuit held the admission harmless error. The <em>Dixon </em>court also noted that the <em>Lenoir </em>court erroneously applied state evidence rules rather than federal rules. We note that under either our <em>Evid.R. </em>63(15) or the more liberal <em>Fed.Evid.R. </em>803(8)(C), the citation at issue was inadmissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b629-16\">We note that, at trial, defendants did not acknowledge the possible admissibility for a limited purpose of any OSHA related documents or testimony. (When asked by the Court whether he objected to the first admission into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>evidence of the letter from OSHA to Millison, counsel said, \"No. I made my objection to anything OSHA did. I was overruled on that. He [Millison] got this document in '80 or '81. It speaks for itself.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b630-8\"><em>Cf. also Milton v.
