He was fined $750 as a second offender. <em>Id. </em>On his <em>de novo </em>appeal, the Law Division again found him guilty and reimposed the $750 fine. Defendant appeals from the Law Division judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">The facts are undisputed. On July 5, 1987, defendant was a front-seat passenger in a vehicle operated by his brother, Patrick. Patrick was not a licensed driver, but held a permit allowing him to operate an automobile under the supervision of a licensed driver. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-13. Defendant was not licensed to drive, for his license had been revoked. Defendant\u2019s attorney conceded that he was in the car \u201cto accommodate what he believed was a permit driver.\u201d A police officer stopped the vehicle and, after ascertaining the facts, charged defendant with violating <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-40, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-9\">No person to whom a driver\u2019s license has been refused or whose driver\u2019s license or reciprocity privilege has been suspended or revoked, or who has been prohibited from obtaining a driver\u2019s license, shall personally operate a motor vehicle during the period of refusal, suspension, revocation, or prohibition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-10\">Relying on the statutory definition of \u201coperator\u201d as a person \u201cin actual physical control of a vehicle\u201d <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>39:1-1), de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>fendant says that he did not \u201cpersonally operate\u201d the car. In response, the State urges that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-40 must be read in conjunction with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-13, which provides that a permit-tee may operate a vehicle only \u201cunder the control\u201d of a licensed driver and that both the permittee and the licensed driver \u201cshall be held accountable for all violations\u201d of the motor vehicle and traffic laws. Since defendant undertook to supervise Patrick as a permittee, the State argues, he exercised control of the car, accepted responsibility for its operation and thus \u201cpersonally operated\u201d it within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">We find the State\u2019s argument unpersuasive. By purporting to validate Patrick\u2019s operation of the car as a permittee, defendant may be said to have assumed \u201csupervision\u201d and \u201ccontrol\u201d of Patrick, albeit in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-13. And it may follow that defendant thereby became accountable for all violations of the motor vehicle and traffic laws, since a driver with a revoked license who undertakes responsibilities reserved to a licensed driver should not be any less accountable than a duly licensed driver. But supervision and control of Patrick, and accountability for his driving, do not establish that defendant \u201cpersonally\u201d operated the car within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-40. \u201cPersonally\u201d means without the intervention of another, not through an agent or substitute. <em>See Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, </em>1686 (1976); <em>Funk &amp; Wagnall\u2019s New Standard Dictionary </em>1844 (1952). Since defendant\u2019s \u201coperation\u201d of the car was through Patrick, he cannot be said to have \u201cpersonally\u201d operated the car that Patrick himself was personally operating.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The judgment of conviction is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
