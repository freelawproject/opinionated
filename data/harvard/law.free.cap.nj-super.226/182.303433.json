Decedent had served as a part-time adjunct professor of mathematics at Brookdale Community College. Brookdale\u2019s academic year was divided into four terms, two long and two short. The two longer terms, fall (September-December) and winter (January-mid-May) were the regular school terms. Spring (mid-May-June) and summer (July-August) were the short terms held during the usual summer vacation period. No adjunct professors were retained for the spring short term, since sufficient regular professors were available at that time. Decedent taught a class at the college in each of the following terms: fall 1983, winter 1984, summer 1984, fall 1984, winter 1985, summer 1985, fall 1985 and winter 1986. At the end of the 1984-1985 regular academic year he was required to join the P.E.R.S. and did so. This membership continued through the date of his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">In May 1986, at the end of the winter 1986 term, the mathematics team leader, Professor Schmid, recommended decedent to continue to teach courses in the summer 1986 term to be conducted during July and August. In mid-June, however, decedent telephoned Professor Schmid to inform him that he was ill and unable to teach the summer course. As found by the administrative law judge, \u201cProfessor Schmid told decedent that he hoped he would make a speedy recovery and that he (Schmid) would hold open the fall courses for decedent in anticipation of decedent\u2019s return to active teaching.\u201d Although this finding is supported by the record, the State Board noted merely that \u201cSchmid told Hagel he would keep him in mind for the Fall 1986 term.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">While the decision to hire faculty is vested in the Board of Trustees of the college, the administrative law judge determined that the practice had been for the Board to accept \u201cthe hiring recommendation of the heads of the various departments.\u201d The judge noted specifically that decedent had been hired on Professor Schmid\u2019s recommendation, that decedent was very reliable and had routinely been appointed and reappointed, and that Schmid had no doubt that but for decedent\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>illness and death, decedent would still be teaching at the college. The State Board, however, stated that the official</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4Z\">approval process was repeated each semester for all adjunct faculty members and all approvals were subject to sufficient enrollment to justify offering the course the adjunct was approved to teach____ At no time was Hagel guaranteed a class to teach.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">There is no basis in the record to find that continued employment was as problematic as found by the State Board. Professor Schmid\u2019s testimony permits no other conclusion but that the job was available to decedent if his health permitted him to teach.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">Hagel died August 10, 1986, and upon plaintiff\u2019s application for death benefits, defendant denied the benefits pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-108a. That statute reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-9\">For the purpose of sections <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-41c, 49e and 57], a member of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System shall be deemed to be an active member ... (2) for a period of no more than 2 years while on official leave of absence without pay if satisfactory evidence is presented to the retirement system that such leave of absence without pay is due to the member\u2019s personal illness____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">Under the referenced sections, death benefits are payable only to active members. <em>Rogers v. State, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>516 (App. Div.), aff\u2019d o.b. 64 <em>N.J. </em>40 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">The administrative law judge correctly determined that petitioner was not on \u201cofficial leave,\u201d since this leave was granted only to full-time staff of the college. He found, however, that petitioner had been given a <em>de facto </em>leave of absence, and the death benefits were thus properly payable. The State Board declined to accept the judge\u2019s recommended decision.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The State Board determined that at the end of each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>teaching assignment petitioner had no right to the next assignment unless a new contract had been tendered. The Board found that during any hiatus decedent could have protected his rights by exercising the death benefit conversion privilege by which private insurance could have been secured to cover the disputed benefits. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">We determine, however, that there are two separate bases under which petitioner should have been paid the death benefits. First, given the nature of his job and the short, regularly-occurring breaks between periods of reasonably expected continued employment, decedent was still an active member at the time of his death; and, second, decedent was still covered by the death benefits policy under its conversion terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">The administrative law judge approached his analysis in the spirit of the benchmark case of <em>Getter v. Dept. of Treasury, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>591 (1969). There the Supreme Court recognized that the pension laws were remedial social legislation to be \u201cliberally construed and administered in favor of the persons intended to be benefited thereby.\u201d 53 <em>N.J. </em>at 598. The administrative law judge further properly noted the line of cases granting to the governing boards of the various pension systems discretion in appropriate circumstances to waive specific time limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">We perceive in the State Board\u2019s opinion, however, a measure of rigid interpretation unrelated to the practical reality of the case before it. Decedent had taught semester after semester for years, and was told by the professor who supervised his program that a course would be held open for him in the fall semester. The fact that decedent did not. teach during the usual summer vacation period after teaching the semester before, coupled with the college\u2019s articulated expectation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>he would continue to teach in the fall, demonstrated that there was no real interruption of his \u201cactive service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\"><em>NJ.A.C. </em>17:2-8.11 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-7\">A member employed on other than a 12-month contract year will continue to be insured during the summer vacation period provided a bona fide employee-employer relationship exists during this period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">Although the section is headed \u201cTen Month Members,\u201d it is usual in the college setting for the summer break to exceed two months, and the section speaks of \u201cthe summer vacation period.\u201d The section further requires a \u201cbona fide employee-employer relationship\u201d during the period. This cannot mean that the employee must continue to work or even that he must not obtain supplemental employment, since we can take notice that most teachers at all levels either take actual vacations or find outside summer employment. Under <em>NJ.A.C. </em>17:2-8.11, an employee with a formal continuing contract clearly is insured during the summer months. But what of the teacher who has taught year after year without a contract, expects to continue in the fall, and has not elected to terminate his P.E.R.S. membership by withdrawing his contribution or otherwise evidencing any intent to end his service? Can there be a <em>de facto </em>(and bona fide) employee-employer relationship which continues over the summer months? We think so.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">The State Board in its opinion found that such an interpretation of either continued active service, or of a <em>de facto </em>official leave, would subvert the purpose of the statute and give no meaning to the term \u201cofficial leave.\u201d \u201cOfficial leave\u201d was available only to full-time employees and would protect such employees for up to a two-year period. The \u201cleave\u201d here was for a much shorter period and was conditioned upon the expectation of both decedent and the college that he would return after the summer break, albeit a longer (full summer) break than he had taken in the past. Yet it is certainly not unusual in a college setting for an instructor not to teach for more than the fall and winter terms. While we agree with the Board that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>there was no \u201cofficial leave,\u201d we see no problem under these facts with finding continued actual service.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">We therefore determine that since decedent had been specifically notified in May at the end of the winter term that he had a reasonable expectation of teaching his usual courses in the fall term, the type of employment here being considered should continue to carry with it <em>de facto </em>\u201cactive service\u201d insurance protection over the brief hiatus during the spring or spring and summer terms.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Such an interpretation does no violence to the principles of the statute, carries out the broad aims of the pension laws, and fills in a gap obviously not recognized when the statute was drafted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Notwithstanding the Board\u2019s contention that decedent could have protected his rights by exercising his death benefit conversion privilege, we conclude that, except upon an expected termination of employment, this conversion right provided little if any protection. The conversion privilege is intended generally to be exercised upon termination of employment. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:15A-93 provides that if upon reemployment a privately purchased conversion policy is in effect, any death benefits are subject to proof of insurability. Therefore, even if petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>was forced to purchase a private annual or semiannual policy for the interim periods, he would have lost a portion of his noncontributory death benefits during the period of overlap.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This obviously cannot be what the Legislature intended. We therefore have examined the applicable statutes, and determined that (a) there must be adequate notice, not here present, of the conversion option, and (b) under the specific facts of this case, the conversion period had not expired as of decedent\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">There was no showing that petitioner received notice each year during the brief period he did not teach that conversion to a private insurance plan was the only way he could continue to preserve his death benefits. For a man suffering from leukemia, we have no doubt that this coverage was important, and, had interim coverage been offered, there would have been some mention in the record concerning its having been rejected after proper notice. We see little benefit in offering a conversion option, if notice of this option was omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">The Board in its supplemental brief contends that the \u201cblue booklet,\u201d supplied at the time of decedent\u2019s initial P.E.R.S. enrollment, gave adequate notice. We have reproduced the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>sections of the booklet which the Board asserts provided this notice.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">DEATH BENEFITS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-6\">Most members are covered for the noncontributory as well as the system\u2019s contributory plan. Possible exceptions involve certain optional enrollees and employees who enroll after the first year of compulsory membership or after attaining age 60; they must prove insurability before coverage is approved. If such member fails to report for a scheduled examination or if the medical examination does not establish insurability, the coverage is not extended. (See note below regarding insurability.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-7\">In fact, during a member\u2019s first year (12 months) of membership in the system, such member normally will be required by statute to participate in the system\u2019s contributory plan. Thereafter, a member may cancel the contributory coverage by filing an appropriate notice of withdrawal form with the system in advance of the desired termination date. Once cancelled, however, it cannot be reinstated. The current contribution rate for this coverage is three-fourths of 1 percent of salary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">If your position permits you to enroll in the retirement system and you are less than 60 years of age, you will be covered by both noncontributory and contributory coverages without medical examination, if your application for enrollment in the system is filed within one year of your original eligibility for enrollment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-9\">NOTE: If evidence of insurability is required, the retirement system will arrange for the necessary medical examination at no cost to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-10\">AMOUNTS OF DEATH BENEFITS \u2014 not applicable CONDITIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-11\">A member\u2019s death benefit coverage will continue in full force for the following approved leaves of absence without pay:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-12\">a. up to two years while on official leave of absence for personal illness, including maternity (as this covers the member\u2019s personal illness, it does not include a leave for child care);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-13\">b. up to one year: (1) to fulfill a residency requirement for an advanced degree or (2) as a full-time student at an institution of higher education;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-14\">c. up to 93 days while on official leave for reasons other than personal illness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-15\">No contributions for the contributory plan will be required from you to continue your contributory coverage during the periods of approved leave set forth in (a) above; contributions will be required to continue coverage for the periods detailed in (b) and (c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-16\">A member who goes on leave of absence must be granted an official leave by the employer and such specific employer action shall be reported to the system. Members required to make contributions while on leave must arrange with the system within 31 days to make such payments for their contributory coverage for the periods indicated in (b) and (c) above.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>A member\u2019s death benefit coverage will continue for the time in which the member\u2019s claim for disability retirement benefits is being processed, provided the claim was filed within 30 days following the member\u2019s termination of active service; no charges are required for the contributory insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">Members still on leave after the expiration periods indicated above may wish to arrange with the insurance company to convert all or part of their coverage. This may be done without medical examination but must be done within 31 days following the end of the expiration period, or earlier, at the termination of the leave due to resignation or dismissal. This is known as \u2018conversion.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-7\">Conversion is also available within 31 days to members who resign, but not to those applying for retirement benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-8\">Conversion should be considered by those who are ill and who are not likely to be able to obtain an individual life insurance policy by passing a medical examination. For those who can prove insurability and meet the insurance company\u2019s medical requirements, conversion may be unnecessary or unduly restrictive in benefits. (Conversion is possible only to a whole life policy with no disability provisions.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-9\">NOTE: If a member returns to covered employment after conversion, such member must either cancel the private policy or prove insurability by medical examination to be covered again by the system\u2019s death benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-10\"><em>Death Benefit Coverage While Receiving Worker\u2019s Compensation </em>\u2014 not applicable</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-11\"><em>Payment </em>\u2014 not applicable</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGS\"><em>Accidental Death </em>\u2014 not applicable</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AL1\">BENEFICIARY DESIGNATION \u2014 not applicable</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afr\">SUPPLEMENTAL VARIABLE ANNUITY \u2014 not applicable</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-12\">The conversion \u201ccondition\u201d is stated to be applicable after the expiration of a leave of absence or after the termination of a leave of absence by resignation or dismissal. \u201cConversion is also available within 31 days to members who resign, but not to those applying for retirement benefits.\u201d There appears to be no mention that conversion insurance is even offered during a summer break to an employee who is hired for successive periods and expects to continue such service.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-13\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27-24 requires notice \u201cat least 15 days prior to the expiration date\u201d of the period within which the employee can convert to a private plan. Even if the \u201cblue booklet\u201d had contained an adequate description of what the Board contends were decedent\u2019s options, such notice would not have satisfied the Legislature\u2019s direction. <em>Cf. Wells v. Wilbur B. Driver Co., </em>121 <em>N.J.Super. </em>185, 196 (Law Div.1972) (where<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>in then Judge Handler determined that there must be notice at the time of termination or else there will be the additional 60 days of coverage provided by the statute). <em>And cf. Keane v. Aetna Life Ins. Co., Hartford, Conn., </em>22 <em>N.J.Super. </em>296, 309-310 (App.Div.1952) (where the lack of notice was upheld only because <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:34-32.2, the predecessor to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:B:27-24, was inapplicable). We reject the notion that the notice envisioned by the Legislature could be satisfied by giving a new employee a booklet of approximately 43 pages at the time of P.E.R.S. enrollment, often many years before the event.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If respondent chooses a different course of action, <em>i.e., </em>to give the omitted notice and require the private purchase of insurance during each brief period of inactivity, then this insurance must be made available at monthly, weekly or even daily rates, with adequate notice to each affected member. <em>Cf. McKenna v. Prudential Ins. Co., </em>224 <em>N.J.Super. </em>172, 180-181 (App.Div.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">As noted in <em>McKenna, N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27-24 (there applied to parallel sections of Title 18A) requires notice, omitted here,' of conversion rights under group life insurance. <em>Ibid. N.J. S.A. </em>43:15A-93 provides that \u201cif a member dies during the 31-day period during which he would be entitled to exercise the conversion privilege,\u201d the claim should be paid under the group policy. <em>See also N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27-21. The 31-day conversion period in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27-19b is extended up to 60 days if notice has not been given. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27-24. Since petitioner\u2019s last day of active service was May 15, 1986, the combined 31 and 60-day extended periods available to him if there had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>been no notice of his conversion rights, did not expire until August 14, 1986. Petitioner died August 10, 1986. Therefore under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27-21 he should have been considered as still covered by the group policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The decision of the Board of Trustees of the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System is reversed and the matter is remanded to the Board for the payment of the appropriate death benefits to petitioner.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-12\">While the action of the State Board was timely, its reasons were given to petitioner well after the expiration of the 45-day period during which the State Board was required to act upon the judge\u2019s recommendations. Petitioner has argued that the decision of the State Board includes its reasons, and therefore the late filing of the reasons constituted an automatic approval of the administrative law judge\u2019s recommended decision. We disagree. But since we have in any event determined that the substantive determination of the State Board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>failed to afford decedent and petitioner their appropriate remedies, this issue is moot. <em>See Belleville </em>v. <em>Coppla, </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>147, 152-153 (App.Div.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Since decedent's contact at the College had informed decedent that the job was being held open for him in the fall term, the Board should not be heard to claim that decedent should have considered his continuing employment to be uncertain. There was no reason for decedent to have assumed that his employment had been \"terminated,\" and that he should therefore seek other insurance coverage, even putting to one side the statutory notice requirements discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b220-8\">We realize that there would have been no pension contributions during these interim periods. Respondent well may wish to provide an option to its members to continue to make payments over brief periods of inactivity such as in the case before us, if such payments are not accrued during the active teaching period. In this case the benefits may be offset by the amount of such appropriate continued payments that would have been made during the summer months up to the date of Hagel\u2019s death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b221-9\">Decedent never taught for the two-month spring semester, but he did teach during the remaining 10 months of the year. During the summer he died he expected to take off the full summer due to his illness. To continue his benefits for the interim period, petitioner would have had to convert the policy to a private plan each year for a two-month period, and then, if the insurer permitted such a short policy, terminate the private plan two months later in order to resume the death benefits available during the next semester when petitioner again taught. The same principle would have applied if there was a week\u2019s break between the fall and winter or summer and fall sessions. Even a shorter-term policy would have been required to cover these gaps. While the State Board asserts that a private policy was decedent\u2019s remedy, nowhere is there a showing that such a plan in fact exists for coverage over these short periods. The \"blue booklet\u201d given each new enrollee in P.E.R.S. does not cover the issue of short interim coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b224-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>17B:27-24 describes the method of notice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-7\">Written notice presented to the individual, or mailed by the policyholder to the last known address of the individual, or mailed by the insurer to the last known address of the individual as furnished by the policyholder, shall constitute notice for the purposes hereof.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
