The caps being kept in this position may be emptied from the carton directly into a feeding shoot of an applying machine where the caps can be applied for sealing bottles and various kinds of vessels.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-19\">The claims wore rejected on a patent to ono Dyer, April 18, 1922, which shows a ear-ton of similar shape which he used for inclosing a tooth paste tube, in which the bottom of the tube is longer than its diameter; and the tube is positioned in the square carton with its longer dimension fitting into the two diagonal corners, thus preventing the tube from shifting from its original position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-21\">The Spiller patent of November 22, 1910, discloses circular jar sealing paper caps with laterally projecting tabs similar to those of appellant. These are assembled in alignment and inclosed in a carton of different shape from that of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-22\">In view of tlie references and the common use of sealing paper caps and paper cartons, we deem the device of appellant unpatentable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-23\">The decision of the Board of Patent Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
