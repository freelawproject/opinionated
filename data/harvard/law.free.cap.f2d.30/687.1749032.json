S. Criminal Code (18 USCA \u00a7 338). Upon the appeal from that conviction, we affirmed. Kastel v. United States, 23 F.(2d) 156. Appellant\u2019s present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>plea is based upon, the claim of former jeopardy. It is grounded upon the contention that at one of the trials, bad prior to the trial resulting in bis conviction, tbe jury, in disagreement, was discharged by a clerk of the court without their request to be relieved from further deliberations; that they at no time declared their inability to agree. We considered this question when the case was here before. The present record differs only in that affidavits are submitted as to what occurred in the jury\u2019s deliberation and at the time of their discharge. But they add nothing new to the former record. They do supplement affidavits offered in support of the plea of former jeopardy at the trial which resulted in appellant\u2019s conviction. But a fundamental objection requires our affirming the order of dismissal. The plea of former jeopardy may not be reviewed on habeas corpus. Ex parte Bigelow, 113 U. S. 328, 5 S. Ct. 542, 28 L.
