L. 233 (28 USCA \u00a7 227). It.is not now reviewable. The correctness of such an order may not be tested until the rights and liabilities of the parties have been determined, leaving only the question of damages for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-18\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
