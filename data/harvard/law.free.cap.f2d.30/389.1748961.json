Allen, clerk of the District Court, to meet the composition payments; that, after distribution to creditors, there remained and is now a substantial sum on deposit to the credit of the clerk, belonging to the bankrupt; that, due to the appeal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>creditor, the $103,944.61 remained on deposit in the bank from April 2, 1927, to April, 1928, about 13 months, before distribution began; and that the bank refuses to pay interest on the deposit during this period.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The petition of the bankrupt of May 28, 1928, sets out these facts, and requests the court to order the bank to credit the account of Allen, the clerk, with such interest as may be found due, and pay the balance of the account thus found to the petitioner., It is the denial of this petition, for want of jurisdiction, that is brought in question \u25a0by this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The only question presented is the jurisdiction of the District Court to hear and determine the amount remaining due the clerk on his deposit account, there being a balance still due to him that has not been distributed to creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Why the District Court was without jurisdiction to hear and determine the question is not apparent. The composition offer was made in bankruptcy, and the fund to meet that offer came into the possession of the court as a bankruptcy court, where a balance, the amount of which is in dispute, still remains. It is true that what remains belongs to the bankrupt, but, under section 12e of the Bankruptcy Act (11 USCA \u00a7 30 (e), it is the duty of the court to determine wh'at the amount is and order its payment to the bankrupt. Until that is done the composition proceedings are not closed, or the jurisdiction of the court terminated. It is clear that jurisdiction does not cease so long as any portion of the composition fund remains undistributed in the possession or control of the court, as is the case here. United States v. Sondheim (D. C.) 188 F. 378; In re Bickmore Shoe Co. (D. C.) 263 F; 926, 929, 930; In re Fox, 6 A. B. R. 529; Collier on Bankr. (13th Ed.) pi 458; 7 Remington on Bankr. (3d. Ed.) p. 174, \u00a7 3133. The balance due could only be paid to the bankrupt on the order of the court, and then only on a check signed by the clerk and countersigned by the judge of the court. General Order 29 (set out under 11 USCA \u00a7 53).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">See, also, In re Kalnitzsky Bros. &amp; Oppenheim (D. C.) 285 F. 649; Id. (C. C. A.) 285 F. 652; In re J. C. Winship Co. (C. C. A.) 120 F. 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">The decree of the District Court is reversed, and the ease is remanded to that court, for -further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion, with costs to the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
