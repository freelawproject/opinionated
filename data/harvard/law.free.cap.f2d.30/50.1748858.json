Metzger, against the Western Maryland Railway Company, to recover damages for personal injuries under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (45 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 51-59). The lower court sustained a demurrer to the amended declaration, and plaintiff appealed. We shall refer to the parties in accordance with the positions occupied by them below.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-20\"> The facts, as set forth in the amended declaration, are as follows: Plaintiff was a carpenter employed by defendant to repair and keep in repair its grain elevator used in interstate and foreign commerce at Baltimore, Md. While so engaged he sustained an injury to his left knee. He was thereupon ordered by the foreman in charge of the work to report for treatment to defendant\u2019s physician and surgeon, which he did on the following day. The allegation is that the physician was guilty of negligence in examining the injured limb, diagnosing the injury and prescribing treatment therefor, and that this negligence resulted in so aggravating the condition of the injured limb as to necessitate its amputation. Damage is claimed not on account of the original injury, but solely on account of the negligence of the physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-21\">We think that the demurrer was properly sustained. The action was instituted under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act (45 USCA \u00a7 51), and it is perfectly clear that the declaration did not state a cause of action thereunder for three reasons: (1) Because the defendant, in furnishing medical attention to an injured employee, was not engaged in interstate commerce; (2) because the employee, in seeking and accepting treatment for his injury, was not engaged in such commerce; and (3) because the physician, in advising and treating the employee, was not an \u201cofficer, agent or employee\u201d of the defendant within the meaning of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-22\">In determining whether plaintiff or defendant was engaged in interstate commerce at the time of the injury complained of, it is not sufficient to inquire generally whether the defendant was engaged in such commerce, or whether plaintiff\u2019s employment on other occasions related thereto. The question is: Was defendant, in furnishing medical treatment to plaintiff, and was plaintiff, in seeking and accepting such treatment, engaged in interstate commerce within the meaning of the act? As said by the Supreme Court in Shanks v. D., L. &amp; W. R. .Co., 239 U. S. 556, 558, 36 S. Ct. 188, 189 (60 L. Ed. 436, L. R. A. 1916 C, 797), \u201cWhat his employment was on other occasions is immaterial, for, as before indicated, the act refers to the service being rendered when the injury was suffered.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-23\">It would seem to be too clear for argument that consultation with a physician by an injured employee, and advice and treatment of such employee by the physician, do not constitute engaging in interstate commerce within the meaning of the act. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>treatment of the injury is not an aet m furtherance of or incidental to interstate commerce. It is an aet in furtherance of the health of the employee. The health of the employee may be of benefit to interstate commerce, if he remains in the service of the employer; but the connection is entirely too speculative and remote to form the basis of an action under the statute. Shanks v. D., L. &amp; W. R. Co., supra; Erie R. Co. v. Welsh, 242 U. S. 303, 37 S. Ct. 116, 61 L. Ed. 319; Ill. C. R. Co. v. Behrens, 233 U. S. 473, 34 S. Ct. 646, 58 L. Ed. 1051, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 163; D., L. &amp; W. R. Co. v. Yurkonis, 238 U. S. 439; 35 S. Ct. 902, 59 L. Ed. 1397; Ill. Cent. R. Co. v. Cousins, 241 U. S. 641, 36 S. Ct. 446, 60 L. Ed. 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">And we think, also, that defendant is not liable under the statute for the negligence of the physician, for the reason that the physician is not an \u201cofficer, agent or employee,\u201d for whose negligence the company is made liable. He is obviously not an officer or agent; but, as he is employed by the company to treat its employees, the question arises whether such employment does not constitute him an employee. We think not. The word \u201cemployee\u201d is used in the statute to designate one within the relationship of master and servant, one whose work is subject to the order and control .of the company, not an independent contractor or a physician, who exercises his own judgment free from the company\u2019s control or supervision. C., R. I. &amp; P. R. Co. v. Bond, 240 U. S. 449, 36 S. Ct. 403, 60 L. Ed. 735. And see Quinn v. Kansas, etc., R. Co., 94 Tenn. 713, 30 S. W. 1036, 28 L. R. A. 552, 45 Am. St. Rep. 767; Union Pac. R. Co. v. Artist (C. C. A. 8th) 60 F. 365; Pearl v. West End Street Ry. Co., 176 Mass. 177, 57 N. E. 339, 49 L. R. A. 826, 79 Am. St. Rep. 302 (opinion by Holmes, C. J.); Powers v. Mass. Hom. Hospital (C. C. A. 1st) 109 F. 294, 298 (65 L. R. A. 372); Ill. Cent. R. Co. v. Moodie (C. C. A. 5th) 23 F.(2d) 902.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">As hearing upon the status of a physician employed by a company to treat its employees, it was said in the Quinn Case, supra:</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">\u201cIf it be, as these authorities indicate (and it cannot he otherwise), that the decisive test of this relationship, or even one of its decisive tests, is that the master has the right to select the mode of the servant\u2019s employment, and that the master\u2019s uncontrolled will is tho law of the servant \u2018in the means and methods\u2019 by which this end is to be reached, then it cannot be maintained that these surgeons were the \u2018servants\u2019 of this corporation. They were not employed to do ordinary corporate work, but to render services requiring special training, skill, and experience. To perform these services so as to make them effectual for the saving of life or limb, it was necessary that these surgeons should bring to their work not only their best skill, but the right to exercise it in accordance with their soundest judgment and without interference. Not only was this the right of these surgeons, hut it was a.s well a duty that the law imposed. If the railroad authorities had undertaken to direct them as to the method of treatment of the injured man, and this method was regarded by them as unwise, they would have been \u2018bound to exercise their own superior skill and better judgment and to disobey their employers, if in their opinion the welfare of the patient required it.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">And in the Powers Case, supra, Judge Lowell said:</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">\u201cThere is another class of cases In which the courts of this country have held that a railroad company, having in its regular employ physicians and surgeons whose duty to the corporation requires them to care for the sick and injured among the corporation\u2019s employes, is not liable to those employes for the malpractice or other negligence of these medical men. [Citing eases.] The obligation of the railroad has been said to extend no further than the employment of doctors competent to do the work proposed. It has also been said that the doctor is not the servant of the corporation, for the reason that, in treating the patient, he does not take his orders from the corporation, but is guided altogether by his own judgment. \u2018The re&gt;lation of master and servant exists only between persons of whom the one has the order and control of the work done by the oilier. A master is one who not only prescribes to the workman the end of his work, hut directs, or at any moment may direct, the means also, or, as it has been put, retains the power of controlling the work; and he who does work on those terms is in law a servant, for whose acts, neglects, and defaults, to the extent to he specified, tho master is liable.\u2019 Pol. Torts (4th Ed.) p. 72.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">There was no error, and the judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
