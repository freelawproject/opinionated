The Commissioner, in supposed compliance with a decree of the United States Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, published the mark in the Official Gazette of November 23, 1926. Thereupon appellant\u2019s counsel, on December 23, 1926, filed in the Patent Office an unverified paper, signed by him, entitled \u201cProtest against Grant of Certificate of <em>Registration.\u201d The </em>Commissioner refused to accept this paper as a notice of opposition, \u201cin view of the court decision referred to in such protest.\u201d Request for reconsideration was filed, to which the Commissioner replied that he adhered to Ms former decision, and that \u201cthe protest cannot be construed as an opposition under the statutes and rules.\u201d Thereafter the mandamus proceeding was instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-15\">Section 6 of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905 ,(33 Stat. 726; 15 USCA \u00a7 86), provides that \u201cany person who believes he would be damaged by the registration of a mark may oppose the same by filing notice of opposition, stating the grounds therefor, in the Patent Office within thirty days after the publication of the mark sought to be registered, which said notice of opposition shall be verified by the person filing <em>the same </em>before one of the officers mentioned in section two of this act. An opposition may be filed by a duly authorized attorney, but said opposition shall bo null and void unless verified by the opposer within a reasonable time after such filing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-16\">It is apparent that it was the Commissioner\u2019s duty and within his jurisdiction to determine primarily whether the requirements of this statute had been complied with by appellant. See Hall\u2019s Safe Co. v. Herring-Hall-Marvin Safe Co., 31 App. D. C. 498; U. S. ex. rel. Lang v. Moore, 37 App. D. C. 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-17\"> If the Commissioner erred in his decision, an appeal to this court was available to appellant. It is familiar law that a writ of mandamus cannot take the place of an appeal. Donner Steel Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 52 App. D. C. 221, 285 F. 955; United States ex rel. Kansas City Southern Ry. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 55 App. D. C. 389, 6 F.(2d) 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-18\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
