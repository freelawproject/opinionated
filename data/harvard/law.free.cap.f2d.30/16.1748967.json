The bill as amended alleged that since 1921 plaintiff had been engaged in manufacturing and selling toy vehicles and devices throughout tho United States; that at the time of the filing of the bill it was selling thirty different toy vehicles; that these toys were of larger-size, heavier materials, and were <em>better </em>finished and <em>more </em>expensive than any similar hand-operated toys theretofore sold in the United Stales; that they were known as \u201cBuddy-L\u201d toys, and that one of the plaintiff\u2019s best sellers was a dump track, which was known as a \u201cBuddy-L\u201d dump-truck; that it was a miniaturo replica of an actual device, and similarly proportioned; that it was sold under distinctive marks and colors, having the name \u201cBuddy-L\u201d on its radiator and having a hood, fender, and seat all painted black, with wheels of the disc typo painted red; that defendant, in order to deprive plaintiff of its business and trade in these toys, and particularly in its dump trucks, \u201ccommenced <em>the </em>selling\" and has offered for sale dump tracks simulating the plaintiff\u2019s said dump track heretofore sold by the plaintiff throughout the United States,\u201d the defendant\u2019s trucks being \u201cso, constructed and conformed and painted and having\" such general appearance\u201d as to lead the ordinary purchaser of toy trucks to believe that it is the Buddy-L <em>dump track </em>sold by <em>the </em>plaintiff. It was further alleged that in order to deceive the public, and in infringement of plaintiff\u2019s rights in the word \u201cBuddy-L,\u201d the defendant had placed the word \u201cSonny\u201d upon the radiator of; its truck; that it had offered to sell its truck at a less price than that at which plaintiff was selling its truck; and that it had sent out circulars and advertisements claiming that its track was a new idea., all in pursuance of its plan to injure plaintiff\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-13\">It was further alleged that with like intent to deprive plaintiff of its business and infringe upon its rights, defendant was putting on the market and advertising to <em>the </em>trade a. toy wagon bearing the name \u201cBuddy\u201d upon it, and thus further infringing\" upon plaintiff\u2019s established trade name of \u201cBuddy-L\u201d used by it in connection with its various toys.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-14\">On defendant\u2019s motion so much of the bill was dismissed as alleged unfair competition resulting from defendant\u2019s use of the word \u201cSonny,\u201d or from its imitating' the plaintiff\u2019s toy miniature replicas of actual vehicles. The motion was- overruled as to so much of the bill as alleged infringement of plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark \u201cBuddy-L\u201d by the use of tho word \u201cBuddy\u201d by defendant upon its toy wagons, but the order recited that as there was only a technical infringement in that respect, without any of tho characteristics of. unfair competition or without damage to plaintiff, and further that as defendant had discontinued the use of such word in connection with its product and did not desire to plead further, it was ordered that no accounting for profits or damages he allowed, but that a perpetual injunction issue enjoining and restraining defendant from further using the word or its equivalent upon any of the toys which it was making.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-17\">It. appears from tho averments to which we have referred that there are two aspects to plaintiff\u2019s complaint of the uso of the name \u201cSonny\u201d: One is limited to the name itself as it may or may not be taken for plaintiff\u2019s trade-name, \u201cBuddy-L\u201d; the other includes the additional consideration of location on the track. As to the first, it seems sufficient to say that while each of the names suggests a small hoy, there is no- such similarity in appearance or sound between the two as would likely result in the confusion of ono with tho other. Tho allegations as to the other go no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>further than to say that defendant has placed the name on the radiator of its truck, whieh is the same place that the name \u201cBuddy-L\u201d is put upon plaintiff\u2019s truck. It is not alleged that it is unusual so to locate the name on the actual device, or that in doing it here the defendant imitated plaintiff\u2019s lettering or background. There must he resemblance,. and no facts showing resemblance were alleged. Hence there was no unfair practice on this account. Block v. Brace Co. (6 C. C. A.) 300 F. 308; Liggett <em>&amp; </em>M. T. Co. v. Finzer, 128 U. S. 182, <em>9 </em>S. Ct. 60, 32 L. Ed. 39b.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">We do not go into the question of defendant\u2019s prices and methods of advertisement. The bill is too indefinite on those points to merit consideration. It is also indefinite in its statements of fact concerning the size, conformation, and coloring of defendant\u2019s truck. It is fairly to be inferred, though, from, what is averred, that defendant\u2019s truck is the same size and conformation as plaintiff\u2019s; that it is like plaintiff\u2019s in coloring \u2014 that the hood, fenders and seat are painted black and the wheels-are painted red; and that both have land were intended to have the appearance of a real truck, in color and otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Plaintiff was admittedly the first to make a miniature truck identical in appearance with an actual device. In doing this it acted under a right that belonged to and is still open to the public. It acquired no patent rights in its structure, and claims none. So defendant may also make and sell such trucks. It may not use on its trucks any unique design or coloring, lacking functional utility, whieh has beeome identified with plaintiff\u2019s product. It may use any forms, colors, or copied details that plaintiff uses whieh give the device the appearance of the model.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In using them, as it does, it is seeking the good will, not of plaintiff\u2019s device, but of the thing whieh both are copying. See Saxlehner v. Wagner, 216 U. S. 375, 30 S. Ct. 298, 54 L. Ed. 525. Defendant has no right to use the name \u201cBuddy-L\u201d or its equivalent. That is the trade-mark of plaintiff. It does have the right to use the name \u201cSonny,\u201d which neither in sound nor appearance is likely to be confused with Buddy-L. That it places this name on the radiator of its device, so far as the bill-alleges facts to show, is nothing but a detail in the general scheme which both it and plaintiff have followed in seeking identity of appearance with the model.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">The other article which defendant manufactures and sells is a toy wagon. It places the name \u201cBuddy\u201d on its wagon. It is alleged that plaintiff has acquired a technical trade-name in the word \u201cBuddy-L,\u201d and although it is not alleged that plaintiff makes a toy wagon, it has the right, we think, to extend its business to and to use its trade-name in the manufacture of that kind of toy. The judgment recites that defendant has ceased using the name \u201cBuddy,\u201d but as that does not appear in the bill, we cannot consider it. The use of the name on, defendant\u2019s wagon was an infringement of plaintiff\u2019s name \u201cBuddy-L,\u201d and after the court below so held, defendant wasl given leave to- plead further. As it refused to do so, the court properly issued the injunction. It was not alleged that plaintiff had already suffered any computable damages from the infringement. Therefore it was rightly ordered that there be no accounting.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-6\"> Compare Globe-Wernicke Co. v. Macey Co.
