The spool or beam upon which the warp threads are wound is driven by a driving drum which is moved at slow speed by planetary gearing contained in the drum and controlled by the operator by means of a treadle. The drum can also\u2019 be driven <em>a\\ </em>high speed through a clutch which has its friction surfaces compressed by pressure of a spring to lessen slipping. Speed responsive means are provided to control the high speed driving means while the rotation of the beam is being accelerated. This control consists of a centrifugal governor in which weighted arms are mounted in such a way as to counteract the pressure of the spring in the event of too rapid acceleration of the drum and winding beam.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-17\">Appellant\u2019s application contained 36 claims, of which claim 30 is the only one now upon appeal. It reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"A00\">\u201c30. A high-speed warper having, in combination, a drum for supporting and rotating a section beam, means to drive the drum at low speed, means to drive the drum at high speed, and speed-responsive means to control the high-speed driving means, while the beam is being accelerated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-18\">The claim was rejected upon the following references: Tobie, 134541, December 24, 1872; Beregh, 1342525, June 8, 1920; Catueei, 1101726, June 30, 1914.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-19\">The patent to Tobie shows a low speed and a high speed driving device for driving a warp beam, consisting in part of a shaft operated through a friction clutch compressed by a spring. His invention, however, contains no centrifugal governor with weighted arms like that of appellant\u2019s machine. With this exception Tobie\u2019s patent clearly anticipates the appealed claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-20\">\u25a0 The patents to Beregh and Catueci, however, disclose such a governor used in other arts, which by the application of mere mechanical skill may he made to function exactly like appellant\u2019s device. Moreover, it is a matter of common knowledge that governors of this character are used in various mechanisms to prevent excessive speed, of which the most common is the steam engine. Accordingly, to supply a governor broadly to govern the speed of a machine needs merely the skill of a mechanic and not invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-21\">We agree, therefore, with the unanimous decisions of the Patent Office that claim 30 should he rejected, and affirm the decision of the Commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
