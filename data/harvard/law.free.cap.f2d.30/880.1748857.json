It would also not involve invention to connect the secondaries of the transformers so that they may be adjusted simultaneously by a single adjusting device, as shown by references to a number of patents.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-20\"> The board, in briefly disposing of the ease, said: \u201cWe agree with the Examiner that it would not amount to invention to substitute, for the transformers and variable condensers of Alexanderson, another design of transformer in which the distributed capacity of the coil plays a greater part in securing resonance, as in Reisz. Nor would it involve invention to connect the secondaries of the transformers that they may be adjusted simultaneously by a single adjusting piece, in view of Fessenden, Hogan, Bradley, and the French patent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b912-21\">A careful examination of the specifications and claims of the applicant, in the light of the prior art, convinces us that the decision of the board is right, and we deem it unnecessary to enter into any extended review of the ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-22\">' The decision-of the Board of Patent Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
