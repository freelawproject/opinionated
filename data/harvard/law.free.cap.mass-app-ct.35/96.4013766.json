L. c. 123, \u00a7 15, as appearing in St. 1986, c. 599. Section 15(a) authorizes a court house examination of a defendant to be conducted by \u201cone or more qualified physicians or psychologists\u201d and \u00a7 15(c) provides that \u201c[a]t the conclusion of the examination . . . [the examiner] shall forthwith give to the court written signed reports of . . . findings bearing on the issue of competence to stand trial.\u201d Next, \u00a7 15(if) instructs that \u201c[i]f on the basis of such reports the cpurt is satisfied that the defendant is competent to stand trial, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>case shall continue according to the usual course of criminal proceedings; otherwise the court shall hold a hearing on whether the defendant is competent to stand trial; provided that at any time before trial any party to the case may request a hearing on whether the defendant is competent to stand trial.\u201d We read the section to give a judge considerable latitude in determining whether to conduct an evidentiary hearing. In the circumstances of this case, the judge did not abuse his discretion by denying the defendant an opportunity to present the testimony of the examiner and limiting his consideration of the competency issue to reviewing the reports and questioning the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">The material facts are not in dispute. On April 2, 1989, the defendant, Roger Martin, was arrested and charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, his third offense (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On July 20, 1990, defense counsel brought to the court\u2019s attention that, as a result of a severe head injury sustained after his arraignment, the defendant might not be competent to stand trial. A judge, who did not preside at the defendant\u2019s trial, continued the case for a preliminary examination pursuant to G. L. c. 123, \u00a7 15(c). A qualified psychologist, appointed by the court, examined the defendant and submitted her first written report on August 13, 1990. Contained in her account was the conclusion that the defendant \u201chas no knowledge or memory of the alleged incident and therefore has been unable to assist his attorney in his defense.\u201d She opined that the defendant \u201chas severe deficits in his competence to stand trial.\u201d On October 12, 1990, the same examiner submitted a second report which stated, in essence, that the defendant minimally passed the test of competence as set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>375 Mass. 50, 52 (1978), and <em>Dusky </em>v. <em>United States, 362 </em>U.S. 402 (1960).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>The case was called for a jury-waived trial on December 3, 1990. At the defendant\u2019s request, the judge read both reports, discussed the contents with counsel, and conducted a brief colloquy with the defendant. At the conclusion of the colloquy, defense counsel stated that he expected that the examining psychologist would arrive soon; counsel allowed that she would testify that the defendant was not competent because he had no memory of the events surrounding the offense. There was objection when the defendant urged the judge to delay trial so that the testimony could be presented. The judge, somewhat perplexed, noted that no written motion for an evidentiary hearing had been filed. He questioned whether the defendant had waived the right to raise the competency issue because he had not filed a motion but, also, noted that the judge has an independent responsibility on the competency issue. He ruled that the defendant did not exhibit any behavior or verbal responses which gave him pause to question the defendant\u2019s competency. He observed that amnesia alone did not render the defendant incompetent. Trial commenced and the defendant was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">From the decisional law interpreting \u00a7 15, we glean two governing principles. First, \u201c[a] judge is required to hold an evidentiary hearing on his own motion, where there is a \u2018substantial question of possible doubt\u2019 about the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rise, </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 106, 107 (1979), quoting from <em>Rhay </em>v. <em>White, </em>385 F.2d 883, 886 (9th Cir. 1967). However, not every instance of abnormal behavior or sign of mental disorder constitutes a sufficient basis to trigger the hearing requirement. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldman, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 699, 707-709 (1981). Second, failure to hold a full hearing where there is a \u201csubstantial question of possible doubt\u201d of the defendant\u2019s competence is error. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>375 Mass. 50, 54 (1978). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>399 Mass. 385 (1987). See also <em>Pate </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>383 U.S. 375, 385 (1966) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>(where there remains \u201cbona fide doubt\u201d as to competence, a full hearing is required); <em>Drope </em>v. <em>Missouri, </em>420 U.S. 162 (1975). The issue may require further inquiry, despite early findings of competence, if subsequent events or testimony raise doubt. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vailes, </em>360 Mass. 522 (1971); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burkett, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 901, 902-903 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tarrant (No. 1), </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 1020 (1982) (defense counsel\u2019s assertion of irrationality not sufficient, without more, to require hearing); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 1, 2-3 (1982) (\u201cinappropriate remarks or disruptive behavior\u201d [of the defendant] not sufficient to require hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">We are satisfied that the judge in this case, cognizant of these standards, did not abuse his discretion in refusing to conduct a full evidentiary hearing to consider the testimony of the qualified examiner, and in limiting himself to considering her written reports. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chubbuck, </em>384 Mass. 746, 752 (1981) (no abuse of discretion in failing to grant an evidentiary hearing where the judge relied on first-hand observations of the defendant and psychiatric reports compiled prior to trial). Here the psychologist\u2019s reports did not express grave doubts about the defendant\u2019s competence. Apparently, the defendant also did not display any unusual conduct throughout the trial. There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b127-6\">The defendant was also found responsible for a marked lanes violation, G. L. c. 89, \u00a7 4A. This violation was filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b127-7\">She did state, however, that in her opinion, \u201cRoger\u2019s lack of memory constitutes a deficiency in his present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding.\u201d The case law is clear, however, that \u201c[a]mnesia, in and of itself, does not render an accused per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>son incompetent to stand trial.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDonald, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 368, 375 (1986), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lombardi, </em>378 Mass. 612, 613, 615-616 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
