On the first two, the jury found for the defendant. On the tortious interference count, they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>found for the plaintiff in the amount of $60,000. The case is before us on cross appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">1. The defendant\u2019s appeal is based on a fact stipulated by the parties: that the plaintiff suffered no pecuniary loss as a result of the defendant\u2019s campaign. There was evidence that the plaintiff\u2019s professional reputation was harmed within the gay and lesbian community but that she retained her paid position as president of Pride Institute, a gay and lesbian alcohol and drug treatment center that she and the defendant founded, and her position with its parent, Addiction Recovery Corporation. There is authority for the proposition that noneconomic damages, such as damages for emotional distress, may be recovered on a count for intentional interference with business relationships. See <em>Mailhiot </em>v. <em>Liberty Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 525, 528 (1987); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 774A(1)(c) (1977). Nevertheless, it is clear, under decided cases, that the essence of the tort is damage to a business relationship or contemplated contract of economic benefit. <em>Owen </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>322 Mass. 356, 360 (1948). <em>Comey </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>387 Mass. 11, 19 (1982). <em>ELM Med. Lab., Inc. </em>v. <em>RKO Gen., Inc., </em>403 Mass. 779, 787 (1989). <em>Ryan, Elliott &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Leggat, McCall &amp; Werner, Inc., </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 686, 689 (1979). <em>Chemawa Country Golf, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wnuk, 9 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 506, 509 (1980). Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 766, 774A. In the words of \u00a7 766, comment t, \u201cThe cause of action is for pecuniary loss resulting from the interference. Recovery may be had also for consequential harms for which the interference was the legal cause. (See \u00a7 774A).\u201d The latter section, as well as Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 47 (1965), makes clear that recovery for emotional distress is not allowed unless the elements of the tort are made out: i.e., actual damage to an economic relationship or prospective relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">We recognize that language from an early case, <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Cronin, </em>107 Mass. 555, 564-565 (1871),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> might have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>made the starting point for recognition of a broader tort, comprehending not only relationships of economic benefit, but those of nonpecuniary professional or social benefit as well. The law has not developed that way, however. In the words of Professor Prosser, \u201cWhen the attempt has been made to carry liability for interference beyond such commercial dealings, and into such areas as exclusion from social organizations . . . , the courts have been disturbed by a feeling that they were embarking upon uncharted seas, and recovery has been denied . . . .\u201d Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts \u00a7 130, at 1006 (5th ed. 1984). Applying the law of tortious interference as it is reflected in present law, we think that the judge erred in submitting that count to the jury in the absence of proof of damages to the plaintiff\u2019s economic interests. The jury\u2019s verdict on that count cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">2. The plaintiff\u2019s cross appeal is based on the judge\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury, on the count for intentional infliction of emotional distress, that the \u201cextreme and outrageous conduct\u201d that is an element of the tort, see <em>George </em>v. <em>Jordan Marsh Co., </em>359 Mass. 244, 253-255 (1971); <em>Agis </em>v. <em>Howard Johnson Co., </em>371 Mass. 140, 145 (1976), may be made out on a showing of \u201c[rjepeated harassment [, which] may compound the outrageousness of incidents which, taken individually, might not be sufficiently extreme to warrant liability for infliction of emotional distress.\u201d <em>Boyle </em>v. <em>Wenk, </em>378 Mass. 592, 595 (1979). The judge instead instructed the jury that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s conduct may be considered extreme and outrageous if it may be reasonably viewed as an attempt to intentionally shock and harm a person\u2019s peace of mind by invading that person\u2019s mental or emotional tranquility. . . . Thus, if you find that the defendant engaged in conduct that in the totality of the circumstances was intended to, or a reasonable person should have known would, harm . . . <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Ratner\u2019s peace of mind, then you may find that the defendant is liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\u201d If this instruction may be faulted for diluting the concept of \u201cextreme and outrageous conduct\u201d (cf. <em>George </em>v. <em>Jordan Marsh Co., </em>359 Mass. at 254-255), we agree with the judge that the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d concept was adequately adapted to the evidence. The \u201crepeated harassment\u201d language requested by the plaintiff may be particularly suitable to the dunning tactics of a bill collector, as in <em>George </em>v. <em>Jordan Marsh Co., supra, </em>or the psychological thumbscrews applied by a private detective, as in <em>Boyle </em>v. <em>Wenk, </em>378 Mass. at 595. See also <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 97 (1982) (pattern of indifference by landlord to repeated sewer backups over a long period). Here the defendant was responsible for essentially two actions: (1) the anonymous mailing of a psychological thriller (Misery, by Stephen King) to the plaintiff\u2019s housemates with a note warning them that the book described the plaintiff\u2019s future treatment of the housemates; and (2)., mailing to the plaintiff\u2019s professional colleagues and peers an anonymous letter with materials disparaging the plaintiff and suggesting falsely the existence of a boycott of Pride Institute to protest the plaintiff\u2019s connection with it. Although the boycott letter was sent in two or more batches, the case was appropriately viewed by the judge as one invoking two discrete, outrageous acts. The \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d instruction correctly told the jury that they were not required to view them in isolation. While the judge might have employed the \u201crepeated harassment\u201d language from <em>Boyle </em>v. <em>Wenk (id. </em>at 595), appellate courts have traditionally accorded the trial judge considerable discretion framing jury instructions, both in determining the precise phraseology to be used, <em>Dobos </em>v. <em>Driscoll, </em>404 Mass. 634, 655, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Kehoe </em>v. <em>Dobos, </em>493 U.S. 850 (1989), and in determining the appropriate degree of elaboration needed, <em>Julian </em>v. <em>Randazzo, </em>380 Mass. 391, 397 (1980). There was no error in the instructions on this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>The judgment for the plaintiff on the tortious interference count of the complaint is reversed.

In [such] cases, the damage for which the recovery is had is not the loss of the value of actual contracts by reason of their non-fulfilment, but the loss of advantages, either of property or of personal benefit, which, but for such interference, the plaintiff would have been able to attain or enjoy.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
