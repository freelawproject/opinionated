The accident occurred at 4:00 p.m., during practice by the lacrosse team. Greta had just finished her track practice and was waiting with a classmate for her father to take her home. After the accident, the city erected a fence between \u201cthe mall\u201d and the goal end of the lacrosse field.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-11\">Alleging negligence on the part of the city in failing to take reasonable precautions to protect her from the hazard of lacrosse balls, Greta brought this action. Her parents joined as plaintiffs seeking damages for loss of consortium. At trial there was evidence that the mall was a gathering place for students and that lacrosse balls were thrown into the walkway or the mall \u201cfairly often,\u201d at least once every practice. An expert called by the plaintiffs described the risk to students in the mall as a definite hazard. A Superior Court jury found the city negligent and awarded Greta damages of $22,465 but found no damages for her parents for loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-12\">The city appeals from the judgment entered upon the verdict claiming that: (1) the judge erred in denying its motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>for summary judgment because the city\u2019s failure to erect a fence or issue warnings was within the \u201cdiscretionary function\u201d exception of G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10(6), inserted by St. 1978, c. 512, \u00a7 15, and, therefore, the city is immune from liability<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>; (2) the judge also erred in refusing to permit the jury to decide whether the city\u2019s decisions not to erect a fence or place warnings were discretionary functions; and (3) in any event, G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C, the recreational use statute, also provides the city with immunity. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">1. <em>Discretionary function, G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10(b).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">a. Prior to trial, the city filed a motion for summary judgment urging that it was immune from suit under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10(6),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because the \u201calleged negligence consisted of a failure to erect a fence, a decision which clearly constitutes discretionary decision making on the part of public officials.\u201d In support of its motion, the city filed an affidavit of Martin J. Ford, the director of support services for the city, portions of Ford\u2019s deposition, and portions of the deposition of Robert A. Hunt, a design engineer for the city. Hunt\u2019s deposition testimony recounted that the athletic complex was designed in 1976 and that, at that time, at least one member of the design review committee did not want any fences at all. \u201cWe specifically did not consider a fence there because the fire department at the time requested that the end of that field be left open as a fire lane.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Ford\u2019s deposition indicated that a fence costing $10,000 or more would be a capital expenditure requiring approval of the board of aldermen.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>In opposition to the city\u2019s motion, the plaintiffs filed answers to interrogatories and other documents. In response to an interrogatory seeking the facts supporting the claims of negligence, the plaintiffs listed a number of failures in addition to the failure to erect a fence: a failure to reposition the net on the lacrosse field so that the goal would not face the walkway and the mall; a failure to post warnings; and a failure to bar persons from the area during lacrosse games or practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">Because of the relationship between a school and its students, the city had a duty of care to the plaintiff to provide her with reasonably safe school premises. See <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>373 Mass. 208, 223 (1977); <em>Mullins </em>v. <em>Pine Manor College, </em>389 Mass. 47, 54 (1983); <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>392 Mass. 745, 756 (1984); Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts \u00a7 56, at 383 (5th ed. 1984). Accordingly, unless each of the failures alleged by the plaintiffs fell within the discretionary function exception, or, unless the city showed a policy reason for not choosing any means to protect its students, the city would not have been entitled to summary judgment. Cf. <em>Dillon </em>v. <em>Barnard, </em>328 Mass 53, 55 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">The most recent discussion by the Supreme Judicial Court of the discretionary function is <em>Harry Stoller &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>412 Mass. 139 (1992), a case involving a decision of fire fighters in fighting a fire. While recognizing that fire fighters had a choice whether to pour water on the buildings through hoses or through a sprinkler system, the court held that this type of choice did not fall within the discretionary function exception. Since \u201c[ajlmost all conduct involves some discretion, . . . [i]f allegedly tortious conduct were to be immunized from causing liability simply because there was some element of discretion in that conduct, the discretionary function exception would go a long way toward restoring the governmental immunity that G. L. c. 258 was designed to eliminate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141. The discretionary function exception is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>\u201cfar narrower, providing immunity only for discretionary conduct that involves policy making or planning.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Citing <em>Whitney </em>v. Worcester, 373 Mass. at 216-220, as establishing guiding principles for determining the scope of the discretionary function exception, subsequently enacted in \u00a7 10(6), the <em>Stoller </em>court reiterated some of the considerations (set forth in the margin<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>) to be taken into account in determining whether the exception is applicable. The court also analyzed the facts in a number of previous Massachusetts cases and concluded that, even where discretionary actions were involved, unless policy considerations were implicated, the governmental unit was held liable for the negligence of its agents. Turning to specific aspects of fire fighting, the court suggested some decisions that would have \u201can <em>obvious </em>planning or policy basis\u201d (emphasis supplied). 412 Mass. at 145. These would include \u201c[t]he number and location of fire stations, the amount of equipment to purchase, the size of the fire department, the number and location of hydrants, and the quantity of the water supply . . . [and] especially the allocation of financial resources.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Contrasted with those decisions, or, for example, contrasted with a determination of what property to attempt to save in situations where fire fighting resources seem insufficient to save all threatened property, the court considered the conduct at issue in <em>Stoller </em>not to involve a policy or planning decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">In the case before us, the initial decision at the time of the field\u2019s construction was, according to Hunt\u2019s deposition testimony, not to erect a fence because of the fire department\u2019s request. That 1977 decision was \u201can integral part of governmental policymaking or planning.\u201d <em>Stoller, supra </em>at 142. See <em>Patrazza </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>398 Mass. 464, 466-467, 469-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>470 (1986) (unburied guardrails shown to be policy decision shielded by \u00a7 10 [6]); <em>Sanker </em>v. <em>Orleans, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 410, 412 (1989) (location of utility poles held to be decision within \u00a7 10 [6]). See also the discussion of fences in <em>Gage </em>v. <em>Westfield, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 681, 686 (1988), and in <em>Tryon </em>v. <em>Lowell, 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 720, 724 (1991), indicating that in some circumstances the failure to erect a fence is a policy decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The alleged negligence by the city in failing to warn of the danger does not, however, come within the exception of \u00a7 10(6). There was no \u201cobvious planning or policy basis\u201d for that failure, <em>Stoller, supra </em>at 145, nor has the city presented anything to suggest that the failure \u201cwas an integral part of governmental policymaking or planning,\u201d or any other consideration discussed in <em>Stoller </em>(see note 6, <em>supra). </em>See <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>373 Mass. at 223. It is difficult to imagine the city justifying a decision not to place warning signs to high school students on economic or other policy grounds. In the absence of evidence that the city made such a decision based on policy, it may not here invoke the exception of \u00a7 10(6). See <em>Dube </em>v. <em>Pittsburgh Corning, </em>870 F.2d 790, 799-800 (1st Cir. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Other Federal cases<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> also hold that in the absence of a showing that a failure to warn is a policy decision or that such a policy is obvious, the discretionary function exception does not apply. See, e.g., <em>Caplan </em>v. <em>United States, </em>877 F.2d 1314, 1316 (6th Cir. 1989); <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>United States, </em>881 F.2d 895, 897-898 (10th Cir. 1989); <em>Andrulonis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>924 F.2d 1210, 1219 (2d Cir. 1991), cert. denied sub nom. <em>New York State Dept. of Health </em>v. <em>Andrulonis, </em>112 S.Ct. 2992 (1992); <em>Summers </em>v. <em>United States, </em>905 F.2d 1212, 1215 (9th Cir. 1990). Contrast <em>Myslakowski </em>v. <em>United States, </em>806 F.2d 94, 97 (6th Cir. 1986), cert. denied, 480 U.S. 948 (1987), and <em>Zumwalt </em>v. <em>United States, </em>928 F.2d 951, 955 (10th Cir. 1991), both cases where policy decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>supported the application of the discretionary function exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The reasons that the city may not rely on \u00a7 10(6) with respect to its failure to warn apply equally to its failure to reposition the net or to take other precautions during lacrosse practice. Since at least some of the claims of negligence were not entitled to protection under \u00a7 10(6), the judge did not err in denying the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">b. Because of his ruling on the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the judge, at the commencement of trial, stated that he would not permit the jury to consider whether the decisions of the city were within the discretionary function. Although the city claims this was error, both Federal and State cases hold that the application of the discretionary function exception is a question of law for the court. <em>Hart </em>v. <em>United States, </em>894 F.2d 1539, 1544 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 980 (1990). <em>Garcia </em>v. <em>United States, </em>826 F.2d 806, 809 (9th Cir. 1987). <em>Peavler </em>v. <em>Commissioners of Monroe County, </em>528 N.E.2d 40, 46 (Ind. 1988). <em>Gillam </em>v. <em>Lloyd, </em>172 Mich. App. 563, 576 (1988). Accordingly, the judge did not err in precluding the city from introducing evidence for jury consideration on the discretionary function issue.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">c. After the city had rested its case, it again urged that it was entitled to judgment and moved for a directed verdict on the basis of \u00a7 10(6), as well as on other grounds. The city at no time requested that the issue of the fence be treated differently from the other claims of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">The reasoning in our discussion of the city\u2019s motion for summary judgment disposes of the claim that the motion for a directed verdict should have been allowed. Since there was evidenc\u00e9 that the city was negligent in failing to warn and in failing to reposition the lacrosse net, and no policy grounds for these failures were apparent or presented, the city was not entitled to a directed verdict based on \u00a7 10(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>2. <em>Recreational use statute, G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C. </em>The city also urges that it is immune from liability because of G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which, as inserted by St. 1972, c. 575, provides that an owner of land,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cwho permits the public to use such land for recreational purposes without imposing a ... fee . . . shall not be liable to any member of the public\u201d who uses the land for such purposes for injuries sustained while on that land.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The difficulty with the city\u2019s argument is that the plaintiff was not just a member of the public, but was, as discussed earlier, a student to whom it owed a duty of care. See <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>373 Mass. at 223; <em>Mullins </em>v. <em>Pine Manor College, </em>389 Mass. at 54; <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>392 Mass. at 756; <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Minidoka Sch. Dist. No. 331, </em>116 Idaho 586, 588 (1989); Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts \u00a7 56, at 383. As stated in <em>Bauer </em>v. <em>Minidoka Sch. Dist. No. 331, supra </em>at 588-589, \u201cif the recreational use statute were applied to injuries children suffered while on school premises as students,\u201d the special relationship of the school to its students would be substantially impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">That the accident occurred at the end of the school day while the plaintiff was waiting for her father does not absolve the city from liability. Hers was a legitimate use of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>premises within the scope of a student\u2019s traditional relationship with her school.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-7\">That section provides that \u00a7\u00a7 1-8 of c. 258 shall not apply to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-8\">\u201cany claim based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty on the part of a public employer or public employee, acting within the scope of his office or employment, whether or not the discretion involved is abused.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b174-9\">The city had previously filed a motion to dismiss which had been denied without prejudice to the filing of a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b174-10\">Hunt also stated that, while the fire department sought a fire lane, it did not request that there not be a fence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b174-12\">At the motion for summary judgment there was no evidence as to the cost of the fence in 1977 or in 1988.
