Kelly, a State trooper, was writing out a ticket to a motorist whom he had stopped for speeding in Marlborough. Kelly\u2019s police cruiser and the motorist\u2019s car were stopped in the southbound breakdown lane of highway Route 495. As Kelly was returning to his cruiser a southbound vehicle driven by Sergio Peluffo unaccountably veered to the right off the road and struck the unfortunate State trooper. Peluffo, it turned out, had fallen asleep at the wheel.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-15\">The ensuing action by which Kelly sought compensation for his injuries resulted in an aggregate jury verdict of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>$2,000,000<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> against Peluffo and his employer, Middlesex Corporation (Middlesex).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Peluffo was driving from his home in Leominster to Attleboro to pick up a paycheck when the accident occurred. At the close of the plaintiffs\u2019 evidence and at the close of all the evidence, Middlesex moved for a directed verdict, and its motion in each instance was denied. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 50(a), 365 Mass. 814 (1974). A timely motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (see Mass.R.Civ.P. 50[b], 365 Mass. 814 [1974]) was also denied. We think the evidence cannot support a finding by the jury that Peluffo was acting within the scope of his employment by Middlesex when the accident happened; the motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict should have been allowed; and we reverse the judgment against Middlesex.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The day of the accident was a Friday. Peluffo had arrived at the job site in Attleboro around 7:00 a.m., but rain had begun to fall. Approximately at 9:00 a.m., Peter J. McLel-lan, Middlesex\u2019s job superintendent, shut the job down for the balance of the day and sent the work force home. Paychecks were not yet available. They were normally delivered to the Attleboro job site at about 3 to 3:30 p.m. on Fridays. McLellan told the workers who were leaving that they could, if they wished, pick up their checks at the trailer office on the job site at the usual midafternoon time or receive them when they came to work the following Monday. Peluffo went home to Leominster and had some repair work done on his car. He decided to pick up his paycheck so that he could pay some bills, and it was on the trip back to Att-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>leboro that the accident involving the plaintiff Kelly occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">In order to recover from Middlesex on the basis of vicarious liability established through the idea of respondeat superior, it was the plaintiff\u2019s burden to prove that Peluffo was acting on behalf of or upon the direction of his employer, Middlesex, when the accident occurred, i.e., that he was acting in the scope of his employment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Wang Labs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Business Incentives, Inc., </em>398 Mass. 854, 859 (1986). An employee\u2019s tortious conduct may come under the \u201cscope of employment\u201d umbrella if the employee\u2019s tortious activity is driven, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the employer. <em>Ibid. </em>See also <em>Pinshaw </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Commn., </em>402 Mass. 687, 694 (1988); Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 228 (1958). If the employee\u2019s acts are driven by purely personal purposes, unconnected in any way with the employer\u2019s interests, then the employee is ordinarily acting outside the scope of his employment. <em>Pinshaw </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Dist. Commn., supra </em>at 694-695. Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts 506 (5th ed. 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">It has long been settled \u2014 as the plaintiff recognizes \u2014 that travel back and forth from home to a fixed place of employment is not ordinarily regarded as incident to employment and the employer is not answerable for an employee\u2019s torts in the course of such activity. <em>Chernick\u2019s Case, </em>286 Mass. 168, 172 (1934). <em>Smith\u2019s Case, </em>326 Mass. 160, 162 (1950). <em>Gwaltney\u2019s Case, </em>355 Mass. 333, 335 (1969). This is the \u201ccoming and going\u201d rule. See <em>Wormstead </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Saugus, </em>366 Mass. 659, 666 (1975). The limiting case occurs when the purpose of travel between the place of residence and place of business is a mission to further the purposes of the employer, such as when an employee is directed to come to a particular company meeting, as in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number><em>Caron\u2019s Case, </em>351 Mass. 406, 409-410 (1966). See also <em>Wormstead </em>v. <em>Town Manager of Saugus, supra </em>at 666, involving a police officer travelling during his duty hours to his home for lunch; and <em>Swasey\u2019s Case, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 489, 493-494 (1979), where the nature of the employment involved dispatching the employee to distant places, in that instance to Poughkeepsie, New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">With those principles in mind, we consider whether, without weighing the credibility of the witnesses or the weight of the evidence, there was evidence from which the jury could reasonably draw the inference that, at the time of the accident, the employer\u2019s purposes had impelled Peluffo\u2019s travel. <em>Poirier </em>v. <em>Plymouth, </em>374 Mass. 206, 212 (1978). <em>McEvoy Travel Bureau, Inc. </em>v. <em>Norton Co., </em>408 Mass. 704, 706 n. 3 (1990). <em>Rubel </em>v. <em>Hayden, Harding &amp; Buchanan, Inc., </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 252, 254 (1983). <em>International Totalizing Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>PepsiCo, Inc., 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 424, 429 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">McClellan, the job superintendent, had testified that he told his men when he sent them home that if they wanted their paychecks they could come back and get them at around 3 p.m. or receive them on Monday when they were back on the job. Peluffo\u2019s testimony at trial was consistent, i.e., he said that he had the option to come back for his check or wait until Monday. What the plaintiff relies on as evidence that Peluffo was directed to return for his check is a portion of testimony Peluffo gave at a pretrial deposition, which was read into the record. In the first of the extracts which we reproduce, the questioner is the plaintiff\u2019s lawyer, Mr. Keenan:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-7\">Q: \u201cAnd were you then told by one of your bosses to go home?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">A: \u201cYeah, I go back and pick up my check, that\u2019s what he told me.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-9\">Q: \u201cWere you told to come back to get your check?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-10\">A: \u201cYeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-11\">Q: \u201cWho told you to come back and get your check?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-12\">A: \u201cPeter [McClellan], . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Q: \u201cAnd what did he tell you?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">A: \u201cI had to come by later to pick up my check. This is what he told me. If I wanted my check I had to . go later.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">In isolation, the excerpted deposition testimony could possibly be stretched to a direction to Peluffo to return for his check. Peluffo, who lacked English language skills (he was a native of Uruguay), was not asked by plaintiff\u2019s counsel whether he was given the alternative of picking up his check on the next work day, Monday. Later in the deposition, however, he was asked that follow-up question by one of the defense lawyers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-8\">Q: \u201cOn this particular day they closed the job down?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-9\">A: \u201cYeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-10\">Q: \u201cIn the morning?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-11\">A:' \u201cYeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-12\">Q: \u201cAnd if you wanted your money that day, you were to come back for it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-14\">A: \u201cYeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-15\">Q: \u201cAnd if you wanted to wait, you could pick it up on Monday?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-17\">A: \u201cYeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-18\">Q: \u201cAnd you decided you wanted your money, so you came back for it?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-20\">A: \u201cYeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-21\">This second extract, which was also read to the jury, does not contradict the first; it fills it out. When the second quoted portion of the deposition is included, there is no inconsistency between Peluffo\u2019s trial testimony, that he had a choice of picking up his check on Friday or Monday, and his deposition testimony. A jury could not reasonably conclude from his entire testimony that Middlesex instructed Peluffo to make a special trip for his check on Friday and, thus, impelled his travel. Middlesex no doubt had a duty under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 158, to make a paycheck available to its weekly wage earners on Friday, but it was not in derogation of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>interest of Middlesex if a worker chose to pick up a check the following Monday.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">To the voluntary nature of Peluffo\u2019s travel certain additional factors may be considered as bearing on whether Peluffo, at the time of the accident, was engaged in his own business or in his employer\u2019s. Peluffo at the time of the accident was off duty with Middlesex; he was not being paid; he was driving his own vehicle without mileage allowance from Middlesex; he was not on call to be back at work in the event the weather changed for the better or to perform other duties. As Peluffo\u2019s conduct at the time of the accident was independent of the requirements or interests of his employer, Middlesex was entitled to allowance of its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant Middlesex Corporation.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b61-6\">A sum of $1,700,000 for Kevin J.

The grounds raised on the motion \u2014 no master/servant relationship, not subject to employer\u2019s control, and not subject to employer\u2019s direction \u2014 added up to whether Peluffo was acting within the scope of his employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
