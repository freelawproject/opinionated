(Quannapowitt), had an indemnity clause in its subcontracts: i.e., a provision by which Quannapowitt would not be bound to pay any damages on account of injuries claimed by any person working on the construction job.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March 3, 1989, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Harnois, an employee of the subcontractor, C &amp; R Development Corporation (C &amp; R), fell down a flight of stairs at the construction site. He brought a third-party action to recover damages for the injuries based on allegations of negligence against Quannapowitt because of its failure to provide a safe work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Quannapowitt impleaded C &amp; R as a third-party defendant. As general contractor it sought enforcement of the indemnification provision contained in its subcontract with C &amp; R. Several weeks before the underlying case was scheduled for a jury trial, C &amp; R moved for summary judgment. With a nod to G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29C, a Superior Court judge decided that under the circumstances C &amp; R could not be required to indemnify Quannapowitt and ordered dismissal of the latter\u2019s third-party complaint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Trial of Harnois\u2019 case was had before a Superior Court jury. While the jury deliberated, Harnois settled his claim against Quannapowitt for $125,000. For reasons that do not appear in the record, the jury were then asked by special verdict to find who had been negligent, as between Harnois and Quannapowitt. The jury, in answer to the first and second questions, responded that both parties were negligent and that Quannapowitt\u2019s and Harnois\u2019 respective negligence was a contributing cause of Harnois\u2019 injury. No percentage apportionment of negligence was reported even though G. L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>c. 231, \u00a7 85, and the special verdict form submitted to the jury in accordance with Mass.R.Civ.P. 49(a), 365 Mass. 812 (1974), called for that response. After the jury returned its verdict, the trial judge entered final judgment for C &amp; R upon the earlier order of the motion judge with respect to Quannapowitt\u2019s third-party complaint. Quannapowitt\u2019s appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">Quannapowitt\u2019s position is that G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 29C, voids an indemnification agreement only where there is no negligence found on the part of the subcontractor or its employees. The jurors\u2019 assessment of at least partial fault on Harnois\u2019 part in bringing about his own injuries \u2014 so the argument goes \u2014 negates the prophylactic effect of \u00a7 29C. We do not read \u00a7 29C as requiring such a predicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">From the plain language of \u00a7 29C and the legislative history, see <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Vappi &amp; Co., </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 77, 81 (1989), it appears that a contractual obligation to indemnify is void whenever it provides for indemnification by a subcontractor regardless of the fault of the indemnitee, or its employees, agents or subcontractors, and this is so even if the indemnitee could prove at trial that the injured employee of the subcontractor was negligent. We have previously noted that by enacting the statute, the Legislature allowed a shifting of the risk of loss for construction wprkers\u2019 injuries to the general contractor in this particular situation. See <em>Speers </em>v. <em>H.P. Hood, Inc., </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 598, 601 n.8 (1986); MacNab, Tort Based and Implied Contractual Indemnity in Massachusetts, 71 Mass. L. Rev. 189 n.1 (1986). If the focus is on the indemnity agreement itself rather than on the facts of any particular accident, that purpose would be achieved without unduly burdening the courts and the parties with time-consuming assessments of negligence and comparative negligence. Thus interpreted, the statute also has the advantage of clarifying for parties to a construction contract where the burden of acquiring insurance lies. See <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Bay State Gas Co., </em>383 Mass. 218, 223 (1981), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Here, the indemnification clause is void under \u00a7 29C because it contains a provision requiring the subcontractor to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>indemnify the general contractor for an injury that may not have been caused by the subcontractor or its employees, agents, or subcontractors \u2014 a circumstance prohibited by application of the statute. As a result, dismissal of Quan-napowitt\u2019s third-party complaint was proper, and submission of the special questions relating to the parties\u2019 negligence was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">Nor was there any claim alleged in Quannapowitt\u2019s third-party complaint that C &amp; R impliedly agreed to indemnify any losses incurred as a result of its employees\u2019 actions. Compare <em>Decker </em>v. <em>Black &amp; Decker Mfg. Co., </em>389 Mass. 35, 37 (1983). No other theories of common law indemnification are advanced by Quannapowitt as a rationale for sustaining the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b316-15\">The pertinent paragraph of the agreement reads, in part, as follows:. \u201cThe Subcontractor further agrees that he will, during the performance of this work comply with all safety requirements and programs of the Contractor, place proper guards around the same for the prevention of accidents, <em>and shall indemnify the Owner, the Contractor, its or their officers, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number><em>agents and employees, and save them harmless from any and all liability, suits, actions, demands (just or unjust), any and all damages and any and all costs or fees on account of injuries to person or property, including accidental death, arising out of or in connection with the work, or by reason of the operations under this contract, whether such liability be the result of the alleged active or passive negligence of the Owner or Contractor, their agents, servants, employees </em>or by reason of any participation in the wrong or upon any breach of any statutory duty or obligation on the part of the Owner or Contractor, its or their officers, agents and employees or any other person\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b317-8\">General Laws c. 149, \u00a7 29C, as appearing in St. 1985, c. 228, \u00a7 3, provides, in pertinent part, as follows: \u201cAny provision for or in connection with a contract for construction . . . which requires a subcontractor to indemnify any party for injury to persons or damage to property <em>not caused by the subcontractor or its employees, agents or subcontractors, </em>shall be void\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
