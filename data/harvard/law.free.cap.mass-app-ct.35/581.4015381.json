(Transgas). On appeal, the plaintiff, Michael Carr, claims that the judge erred in concluding that the decision of an arbitrator precluded his handicap discrimination claim brought pursuant to G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4(16). As we are in agreement with the plaintiff, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-15\">Transgas, a Massachusetts liquid gas hauler, employed Carr as a truck driver from August 3, 1981, to April 6, 1990. Carr alleged that on January 25, 1990, he (for the third time) injured his shoulder while operating a truck without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>power steering.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He notified Transgas of the injury. On April 4, 1990, Carr was again assigned a truck without power steering, although, he alleges, trucks with power steering were available. He attempted to operate the vehicle but later returned it to the terminal, claiming that he was unable to operate a truck that lacked power steering because of his shoulder injury. Two days later, Carr was discharged for refusing to drive the truck assigned to him on April 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Through his union, Carr filed a grievance against Trans-gas, claiming unjust discharge because he was handicapped under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 75B.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In accordance with the collective bargaining agreement between the union and the company, the dispute went to arbitration. The arbitrator concluded that \u201cthere was just cause to discharge him in April 1990.\u201d The arbitrator also found that the evidence did not support Carr\u2019s claim that he suffered a work-related injury which would qualify as a handicap under the law. She ruled, in addition, that, even if such a handicap were established, it was not clear that the law regarding handicap discrimination could be applied here. Unsatisfied with the arbitrator\u2019s decision, Carr filed an action in Superior Court alleging handicap discrimination pursuant to G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4(16).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">Transgas moved to dismiss the complaint as precluded by the earlier arbitration. In allowing the motion the judge ruled that \u201cthe questions of whether Carr had sustained a work-related injury and whether Transgas fired him because of that injury (or \u2018handicap\u2019) were distinctly in issue and were directly determined by the arbitrator.\u201d This was error. See and compare <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Liab. Ins. Co., </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 34, 36-38 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>Although in other circumstances an arbitration decision may be preclusive, an employee\u2019s prior submission of a claim of racial discrimination to final arbitration under the nondiscrimination clause of a collective bargaining agreement does not foreclose the employee\u2019s statutory right under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e et seq. (1988), to a trial de novo in Federal court. <em>Alexander </em>v. <em>Gardner-Denver Co. (Alexander), </em>415 U.S. 36, 59-60 (1974). \u201c[I]n general, submission of a [racial discrimination] claim to one forum does not preclude a later submission to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 47-48. In <em>Alexander </em>the Court emphasized that an employee\u2019s contractual rights under a collective bargaiijing agreement are distinct from the employee\u2019s independent statutory rights under Title VII. \u201cThe distinctly separate nature of these contractual and statutory rights is not vitiated merely because both were violated as a result of the same factual occurrence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49-50. See the discussion in <em>Gilmer </em>v. <em>Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., </em>500 U.S. 20, 35 (1991), of the distinctions between the line of cases holding that compulsory arbitration of statutory claims under an agreement to arbitrate all claims may be appropriate and preclusive and the <em>Alexander </em>line of cases, which hold that prior submission of a contract-based claim to arbitration does not bar subsequent de novo review of a statutory claim by a court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <em>Alexander </em>Court also determined that, because such rights are personal, or individual, in nature, \u201can employee\u2019s rights under Title VII are not susceptible of prospective waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Applying <em>Alexander </em>to an employment discrimination case brought pursuant to G. L. c. 151B, the Supreme Judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>Court in <em>School Comm. of Brockton </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>377 Mass. 392, 399 (1979), stated: \u201cGeneral Laws c. 151B, \u00a7 4, concerns not collective processes, but rather each individual\u2019s right to equal employment opportunities. . . . Rights of this kind, which are of a personal, and not merely economic, nature are beyond a labor union\u2019s ability to bargain away.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See also <em>Rooney </em>v. <em>Yarmouth, </em>410 Mass. 485, 490-491 (1991), and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">In the present case, the labor arbitrator lacked the authority to decide Carr\u2019s statutory handicap discrimination claim. The issue before the arbitrator was whether, under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, Transgas had \u201cjust cause\u201d to terminate Carr. Nowhere in the agreement was there a provision proscribing handicap discrimination, and there was no other agreement to arbitrate the statutory claim of handicap discrimination. See <em>Rooney </em>v. <em>Yarmouth, </em>410 Mass. at 491 (\u201cemployees need not submit to arbitration disputes based on independent statutory rights that are not addressed and encompassed by the collective bargaining agreement\u201d). Compare <em>Gilmer </em>v. <em>Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., </em>500 U.S. 20 (1991) (a party can be compelled to arbitrate statutory age discrimination claims covered by an arbitration agreement). Since the arbitrator was confined to interpreting the collective bargaining agreement and the agreement in no way incorporated the statutory claim of handicap discrimination, the arbitrator could not properly have determined that Carr was not handicapped under the provisions of G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 75B.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Gilmer, supra </em>at 34-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>In fact, the arbitrator acknowledged her lack of authority to determine whether Carr suffered from a qualifying handicap under G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 75B. Noting that the collective bargaining agreement specifically included discrimination based on \u201crace, color, creed, sex, national origin or union membership,\u201d but did not mention \u201chandicap,\u201d the arbitrator wrote in her opinion, \u201c[B]y its specific omission, it appears that the parties intended to <em>exclude </em>the application of external law as it relates to handicap discrimination from the terms of the collective bargaining agreement. Since the arbitrator is limited by the stipulated issue to interpreting the contract, and the contract appears specifically to exclude the law as it relates to handicap discrimination, the Union\u2019s argument concerning G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 75B, would fail, even if the Grievant had established a work-related injury.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Because there was no agreement to arbitrate handicap discrimination claims in the collective bargaining agreement between Carr\u2019s union and Transgas, the arbitrator lacked the authority to decide whether Transgas discriminated against Carr on the basis of a handicap. Therefore, the arbitrator\u2019s finding that Carr \u201cwas not unable to perform his duties by reason of a handicap or impairment\u201d when he refused to drive equipment assigned to him does not preclude Carr\u2019s handicap discrimination action brought in Superior Court pursuant to G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4(16). We accordingly reverse the judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. See <em>School Comm. of Brockton </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>377 Mass. at 399, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Carr claimed that he had sustained two prior shoulder injuries in a similar manner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b612-8\">\u201cAny employee who has sustained a work-related injury and is capable of performing the essential functions of a particular job, or who would be capable of performing the essential functions of such job with reasonable accommodations, shall be deemed to be a qualified handicapped person under the provisions of [c. 151B].\u201d G.
