Did Toyota Motor Distributors, Inc. (Toyota), act in a commercially reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>fashion, as it was required to do by G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 4(3)(0,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> when it refused consent to the assignment of an automobile dealership by Hallissy Auto Mall, Inc., to Greater Lowell Auto Mall, Inc. (GLAM)? A judge of the Superior Court, who took the case on the defendant Toyota\u2019s motion for summary judgment, decided that consent to an assignment of the franchise had been withheld reasonably, and a judgment, from which GLAM appeals, was entered for the defendants. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">In summary, the undisputed facts developed in the summary judgment contest are as follows. Peter B. Hallissy was the principal (he owned and ran the business) in a Toyota dealership that he operated from 1976 to 1988 on Rogers Street in Lowell. Early in 1987 he conceived an exalted scheme for an auto mall in which seven dealerships<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> would operate under one roof. The locale he had selected was 333 Main Street, Tewksbury. Hallissy applied to Toyota for permission to relocate his Toyota dealership and to assign it to Hallissy Auto Mall, Inc., which had been organized to operate the multiple dealerships project. The right to approve a change in location of, as well as a transfer of interest in, a dealership was reserved by Toyota in its dealership agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">Toyota was less than lukewarm to Hallissy\u2019s proposition. As matter of policy it tended to disapprove the practice of \u201cdualing,\u201d a trade term of art for operating more than one dealership in a building. Its experience, Toyota explained, had been that freestanding dealerships concentrated better on the customer, provided better service, and achieved better over-all customer satisfaction. It was doubtful, Toyota wrote to Hallissy, that the mall could be consistent with \u201cone of the basic philosophies of Toyota, the \u2018Toyota Touch.\u2019 \u201d To make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>matters worse, so far as Toyota was concerned, the mall plan would cause congestion \u201cwhich will negatively impact Toyota customer satisfaction.\" Toyota sent Hallissy a letter of rejection to which he responded with a combination of pleading and pointed references to consultation with his lawyer. In the event, Toyota reversed itself and gave permission for the transfer, albeit \u201cwith reluctance due to the continuing concern for the level of customer satisfaction possible from a multi-line \u2018auto mall\u2019 operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The Tewksbury auto mall enterprise was a smashing failure. On Toyota\u2019s consumer satisfaction index, the dealership in the Tewksbury mall rated among the lowest in the country. Whatever inherent operational problems the mall posed were much exacerbated by the deterioration of Hallissy\u2019s health, management capacity, and financial strength \u2014 in that order. By September, 1989, the dealership was often untended on Saturdays, ran no advertising, could not buy new models, and its financial fate had fallen into the hands of General Motors Acceptance Corporation, a company related to competitors of Toyota. Hallissy began to look for a buyer to take him out and came up with William P. DeLuca, Jr., and his son William P. DeLuca, III. They organized GLAM to acquire and run the auto mall.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Two meetings took place between the DeLucas and Toyota. The DeLucas undertook to explain why they could succeed in making the mall work for Toyota and the other dealers. Toyota was not convinced and declined to give its consent. In the meantime, Toyota had terminated the Hal-lissy dealership agreement for multiple failures of performance by Hallissy of the dealer\u2019s obligations. The notice of termination was a fifteen-day notice, which, under G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 4(3)(e)(l), was useable only in the event the dealer abandoned or closed the dealership; for other violations of the dealership agreement, the statute requires a sixty-day notice. The judge ruled that on the undisputed facts Hallissy had neither closed nor abandoned the business. To be sure, the car agency had slipped to an extremely low ebb, but the judge thought, \u201cvain though the effort may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>been, Hallissy was struggling to keep enough of a pulse beating in the dying business that it might be transferred.\u201d Accordingly, he ruled that Hallissy had not abandoned his shop. Whether that ruling was correct is now academic because the Hallissy dealership was ultimately extinguished by Toyota\u2019s refusal to consent to transfer of the dealership to GLAM.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">Although it had not received consent to assign its Toyota dealership to GLAM, Hallissy Auto Mall, Inc., nevertheless in January, 1990, assigned all its interests in the mall to GLAM. Insofar as that assignment included dealerships, it was effective only to the extent the respective manufacturers ultimately gave their consent. Also included in the assignment were its rights to maintain causes of action against Toyota for wrongful cancellation of the dealership and refusal to consent to the assignment to GLAM.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">By reason of the purported assignment of the causes of action, GLAM was substituted as a plaintiff against Toyota in an action begun November 15, 1989, by Hallissy and his company. A prospective transferee of rights in an automobile dealership does not have standing to maintain an action under G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 4(3)(z), against a manufacturer for unreasonably withholding consent to transfer of a dealership by a dealer to that prospective assignee. <em>Beard Motors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Toyota Motor Distrib., Inc., </em>395 Mass. 428, 433 (1985). See <em>Bishay </em>v. <em>Foreign Motors, Inc., </em>416 Mass. 1, 10-11 (1993). We do not think that the principle established in the <em>Beard </em>case can be circumvented by the tail chasing expedient of assigning the existing dealer\u2019s rights to the aspiring dealer. Cf. <em>Bishay </em>v. <em>Foreign Motors, Inc., supra. </em>The point, however, was not discussed by the Superior Court judge, and we prefer, therefore, not to make it the fulcrum for disposition of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">We turn, at last, to what we have identified as the disposi-tive issue, whether Toyota acted reasonably in withholding consent to the assignment Hallissy sought to make to GLAM. In connection with a substantially similar statutory provision, a United States Bankruptcy Court judge identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>as a general test for reasonableness \u201cfactors closely related to the proposed assignee\u2019s likelihood of successful performance under the franchise agreement.\u201d <em>In re Van Ness Auto Plaza, Inc., </em>120 B.R. 545, 547 (Bankr. N.D. Cal. 1990). Specific relevant considerations would include: (1) the suitability of combining the franchise in question with other franchises at the same location; (2) the location of the proposed dealer; (3) the adequacy of the working capital of the proposed dealer; (4) prior experience with the proposed dealer; (5) prior sales performance of the proposed dealer; (6) whether the proposed dealer has a history of profitable operation; (7) the business acumen of the proposed dealer; and (8) whether the proposed dealer has provided the manufacturer with solid information about its qualifications. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">In <em>Brattleboro Auto Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Subaru of New England, Inc., </em>633 F.2d 649 (2d Cir. 1980), the court held it a suitable reason for terminating a dealership that the dealer in question (BAS) wished to relocate and take on as additional manufacturers Buick, Pontiac, and GMC light trucks (it had been selling Subaru, Saab, and International Harvester). The court said that Subaru \u201creasonably could have concluded that BAS\u2019s sales and service of Subaru cars would suffer as a result of BAS\u2019s simultaneous promotion of several lines of directly competing cars.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 642. A history of unprofitable operations, low capitalization, and insufficient selling space were cited as reasonable grounds for refusing consent to an assignment of a dealership in <em>In re Pioneer Ford Sales, Inc., </em>729 F.2d 27, 29-30 (1st Cir. 1984). Unease about \u201cdualing\u201d specifically has been regarded as a commercially reasonable basis for refusing consent to an assignment as contemplated by G. L. c. 93B. <em>Simonds Chevrolet, Inc. </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>564 F. Supp. 151, 153 (D. Mass. 1983). Most recently in <em>Bishay </em>v. <em>Foreign Motors, Inc., </em>416 Mass. at 8, 9-10 n.18, concerns about respect for the manufacturer\u2019s trademark and a history of noncompliance with commitments to the manufacturer were implicitly accepted as valid reason for refusing consent to assignment of an auto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>mobile dealership. See also <em>Foreign Motors, Inc. </em>v. <em>Audi of America, Inc., </em>755 F. Supp. 30, 35 (D. Mass. 1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">In the instant case, Toyota, having once agreed to try the Tewksbury auto mall with great reluctance, acted reasonably in declining to consent to having another go at it with a different dealer. Given the history of failure, it could resume adherence to its fundamental policy of avoiding dualing and preferring freestanding car agencies. Toyota could also factor into its decision the rickety financial structure that Hallissy had transferred to GLAM. On the basis of the record made for summary judgment purposes, the judge correctly concluded that GLAM could not make a showing that Toyota had acted unreasonably \u2014 and hence in violation of G. L. c. 93B \u2014 in refusing consent to assignment of the Hallissy agency to GLAM.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b278-7\">The pertinent provision is the last sentence of G.
