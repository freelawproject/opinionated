St. 1987, c. 673, amending St. 1985, c. 736. \u201cReal property interest\u201d is defined in \u00a7 1 of the Act broadly, but there are a number of exemptions. One of the exemptions is \u201cthe interest of a stockholder in a corporation, or a partner in a partnership unless any real property interest has been transferred to such corporation or partnership for the purpose of evading the fee imposed by [the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>ute] .\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The case before us involves a change in ownership of real property accomplished by use of a corporation whose sole asset during its entire existence was a piece of Dukes County real estate. In a dispute between the Land Bank, and Michael T. and Ann M. Long, who, as a result of a series of transactions involving the corporation, acquired ownership of the property, a Superior Court judge ruled in favor of the Land Bank, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">We summarize the agreed facts. The Brydens (Peter D. and Christine M.) owned a fifty percent interest in real estate in Edgartown, and T.J. Donahue owned the other fifty percent interest. The property was encumbered by two mortgages. In January of 1990, they formed a corporation (of which the Brydens, on the one hand, and Donahue, on the other, each owned fifty percent of the stock) to which they conveyed the real estate. The corporation had no other assets, and the Brydens and Donahue continued personally to make payments on the mortgages. On February 26, 1990, the Longs purchased the Brydens\u2019 fifty percent interest in the corporation. The Longs paid the Brydens $20,000 and assumed the Brydens\u2019 portion of the mortgages. The amount due on the mortgages was $170,000. On December 26, 1990, the corporation conveyed a one-half interest in the property to the Longs and the other half interest to Donahue. The corporation then went out of existence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Land Bank notified the Longs that a fee was due from them in connection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>with the February 26, 1990, transfer of stock. The Longs responded that they were entitled to the benefit of the exemption because the corporation was formed and the property conveyed to it not to evade the fee but for purposes unrelated to the fee. They stated that the corporate form was used to avoid the Brydens\u2019 creditors, for Federal income tax purposes, and to afford restructuring of Peter Bryden\u2019s holdings to avoid loss or sale due to adverse consequences of his business dealings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After a public hearing, the Land Bank determined that the statutory fee, along with interest and penalties, was due. The Longs paid $2,908.45, the return of which they seek in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">The judge considered the facts in light of the language of the statute<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the legislative purpose and scheme and ruled that the transaction in issue was not within the exemption. He stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">\u201cIf the Longs\u2019 interpretation of the Act is valid there exists a significant loophole in the Land Bank Act almost certainly unintended by the Legislature. Specifically, the imposition of a Land Bank fee could be avoided in every transaction by (1) creating a shell corporation; (2) transferring real estate into that corporation; (3) selling the stock of that corporation; and then (4) dissolving the corporation, thereby placing the real estate in the name of the ultimate purchaser.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">\u201cIt is clear that the statutory exclusion of stock transfers from the definition of \u2018real property interest\u2019 is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>meant to exclude only transfers of stock in corporations which transacted business in the ordinary sense and not where a shell corporation functions solely as a nominee. Were that not the legislative intent, the statutory objective could be frustrated simply by the creation of legal fictions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">We assume, as the Longs contend on appeal, that the original purpose of the creation of the corporation and the transfer of the property to it were not for the purpose of avoiding the Land Bank fee. We might even assume, without deciding, that the required payment is not a \u201cfee,\u201d as it is referred to in the statute, but a tax. Tax statutes are generally strictly construed. See <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>391 Mass. 630, 633 (1984). Section 14A of the Act, however, expressly provides that it \u201cshall be liberally construed to effect [its] purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">We agree with the trial judge that, under any reasonable and common sense construction of the statute, the exemption was inapplicable. On the instant facts, the use of the corporate form was an empty formality and, for purposes of the fee requirement, should be disregarded. Compare <em>Koch </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Rev., </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 707, 715 (1992), further appellate review granted, 414 Mass. 1103 (1993). The corporation had no assets other than the real estate; it existed only to hold title to the real estate; it had no existence at any point in time significantly before or after the transfers; and, as a result of the series of transfers in which the Longs engaged, within a relatively brief period of time the ownership of real estate passed from the Brydens to them in exchange for valuable consideration. We consider the \u201csubstantial nature of the transaction,\u201d see <em>Commissioner of Corps. &amp; Taxn. </em>v. <em>Dalton, </em>304 Mass. 147, 150 (1939), and conclude that it constituted a routine sale of real estate of the kind the statute was intended to reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The remaining exemptions referred to in \u00a7 1 include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">\u201c[T]he dominant estate in any easement or right of way; the right to enforce any restriction; any estate at will or at sufferance, and any estate for years having a term of less than thirty years; the rever-sionary right, condition, or right of entry for condition broken; [and] the interest of a mortgagee or other secured party in any mortgage or security agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">There are additional exemptions in \u00a7 12 of the Act. Section 120\") exempts \u201ctransfers made to a stockholder of a corporation in liquidation of the corporation, and transfers made to a partner of a partnership in dissolution of the partnership.\u201d For the reasons stated in this opinion, the plaintiffs are not entitled to the benefit of that exemption.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b577-9\">Donahue subsequently conveyed his fifty percent interest in the land to the Longs for $100,000. The amount of the fee ordered by the Land Bank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>with respect to that transfer, $2,000, was paid by the Longs, and the matter is not in issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b578-10\">On August 2, 1991, a creditor alleging that the transfer of property by Peter D. Bryden to the corporation was a fraudulent conveyance obtained a judgment under G. L. c. 109A.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b578-12\">The Land Bank has promulgated regulations covering issues similar to those raised in this case. However, they took effect after the Longs\u2019 purchase of stock in the corporation, the transaction on which the Land Bank based its notice to the Longs that a fee was due. We decide the case, therefore, without relying on the regulations which would have added support to the Land Bank\u2019s position.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAQ\">(concurring). Oblivious to the wake-up call of <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>414 Mass. 450 (1993), members of the bar still persist in bringing lawsuits that are so clearly devoid of merit that one is hard pressed not to suspect that monetary gain, i.e., a fee, is the only possible reason for doing so.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I repeat, once again, the same old song.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See, e.g., <em>Hodge </em>v. <em>Klug, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 746, 759 (1992) (Brown, J., concurring). Is anybody listening, or reading for that matter? \u201cThe absurd notion of a lawyer as a hired gun, who will do <em>anything </em>a client requests, has never had a place in our profession and must not be tolerated. See S.J.C. Rule 3:07, Canon 7, DR 7-102(A)(1) &amp; (7), 382 Mass. 785 (1981)\u201d (emphasis original). <em>Id. </em>at 760.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">This case is absolutely frivolous, and, as the majority states, even if we assume the plaintiffs\u2019 underlying premises to have some substance, which neither does, this hapless challenge to the defendant\u2019s fee was foredoomed. In the words of the majority, it is beyond \u201creasonable [or] common sense\u201d or thoughtful legal analysis by counsel for the plaintiffs that \u201cthe exemption [here] was . . . applicable.\u201d As it is apparent that neither an important principle nor a matter of conscience is involved here, I am puzzled why counsel did not advise the client that the legal fees generated in this matter would be far in excess of any amount that might have been recovered from the defendant commission. Of course, when you factor in the impossibility of success, then counsel\u2019s performance becomes even more disturbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">This is yet another painful example of how \u201ccourts are too frequently called upon to expend their limited resources to assist the needy by the machinations of the greedy.\u201d <em>Pic-cicuto </em>v. <em>Dwyer, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 137, 140 (1992). Double costs of appeal should be imposed and the attorney for the plaintiffs should be ordered to pay the defendant\u2019s legal fees. See <em>Avery </em>v. <em>Steele, supra </em>at 457. If lawyers do not see the light, they should be made to feel the heat.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b580-7\">See also <em>VMS Realty Inv., Ltd. </em>v. <em>Keezer, </em>34 Mass.
