L. c. 209C, and to obtain an award of custody<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and suitable support. In his answer to the complaint, the defendant admitted paternity and asked the court to establish a reasonable visitation schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-15\">At a hearing on the complaint conducted when the child was five weeks old, the only issues addressed after the father formally acknowledged paternity were those of support and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>visitation. Through counsel, the mother suggested child support of thirty dollars per week and the father, who was then a high school student, mildly resisted any order \u201cmuch beyond . . . twenty dollars.\u201d The visitation issue focused on whether the father, who had yet not visited with his child, would see her at the mother\u2019s home or be permitted to take her to his home. At the end of the hearing, the judge recited into the record that she was adjudicating the defendant to be the father, establishing support arrearages and ordering weekly support at the rate of thirty dollars a week. She also ordered visitation for five hours every Sunday outside of the mother\u2019s home. The record discloses no discussion of custody by the parties, their attorneys or the judge. However, a judgment of paternity which was entered on the day of the hearing included an order that the \u201cparties have joint custody with [the mother] having the physical care\u201d of the child. In this appeal, the mother correctly claims that the grant of joint custody was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">An award of custody incident to a paternity proceeding initiated pursuant to G. L. c. 209C is governed by \u00a7 10 of that chapter, which contains the following pertinent provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">\u201c(a) Upon or after an adjudication or voluntary acknowledgment of paternity, the court may award custody to the mother or the father or to them jointly or to another suitable person as hereafter further specified as may be appropriate in the best interests of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">\u201cIn awarding the parents joint custody, the court shall do so <em>only </em>if the parents have entered into an agreement pursuant to section eleven or the court finds that the parents have successfully exercised joint responsibility for the child prior to the commencement of proceedings pursuant to this chapter and have the ability to communicate and plan with each other concerning the child\u2019s best interests\u201d (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>The Legislature has enacted rules for construing its statutes in G. L. c. <em>4, </em>\u00a7 6, which, in paragraph Third, provides that unless \u201ctechnical\u201d in nature, \u201c[w]ords and phrases shall be construed according to the common and approved usage of the language . . . .\u201d This sensible standard, consonant with the common law, see <em>United States Jaycees </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Commn. Against Discrimination, </em>391 Mass. 594, 601 (1984), leads to the conclusion that the alternative circumstances recited in \u00a7 10, alone support the award of joint custody under G. L. c. 209C, since \u201conly\u201d is not a technical word and, as there used, means \u201csolely\u201d or \u201cexclusively.\u201d See <em>Sherwin </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>282 Mass. 306, 310 (1933); Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1089 (6th ed. 1990); Webster\u2019s Third New Intl. Dictionary 1577 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Neither party claims, nor does the record establish, the existence of the first stated statutory basis for awarding joint custody \u2014 a formal, notarized parental agreement as contemplated by \u00a7 ll.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The other basis is predicated on the existence of judicial findings. The record discloses neither express findings nor any evidence which supports an inference that the requisite findings are implicit in the judge\u2019s order. To the contrary, not only was custody not an issue, but as of the time of the hearing, the disagreement over where visitation by the father would take place precluded the building of any record of \u201csuccessfully exercised joint responsibility for the child prior to the commencement of [paternity] proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Accordingly, so much of the judgment as awards joint custody is modified to provide that custody is awarded to the mother, subject to the continuing jurisdiction of the Probate and Family Court pursuant to G. L. c. 209C, \u00a7 20. The judgment, as so modified, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b486-16\">General Laws c. 209C, \u00a7 10(6), inserted by St. 1986, c. 310, \u00a7 16, states: \u201cPrior to or in the absence of an adjudication or voluntary acknowledgment of paternity, the mother shall have custody of a child born out of wedlock.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b488-8\">The mother in her brief claims that an agreement giving custody to her was \u201cpresented\u201d to the court and disregarded by the judge.
