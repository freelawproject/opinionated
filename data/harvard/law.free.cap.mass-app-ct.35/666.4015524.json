We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-16\">Based on a tip from an \u201cunnamed\u201d informant that drugs were being distributed from 9 Seymour Street in the Ros-lindale section of Boston, and corrobative information pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>vided by police investigation of activity at that location,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Detective Dominguez obtained a search warrant for that residence and for the persons of the defendant and one Francisco Heredia. At approximately 5:00 to 5:30 p.m. on the day that the search warrant was to be executed, Detective Dominguez was contacted again by the informant. The informant explained that the defendant would soon make a delivery of cocaine to 9 Seymour Street. Upon receiving this new information Detective Dominguez returned to 9 Seymour Street to continue his surveillance.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">As the informant had predicted, within an hour\u2019s time, the defendant left the building at 9 Seymour Street and drove two miles directly to her personal residence at 2 Beechland Street in Roslindale. After a brief stay at her home, the defendant again entered her automobile and drove in the direction of the residence at 9 Seymour Street. Approximately one-half mile from the apartment, the defendant was stopped by a team of police officers who had been following her.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">The defendant was placed in the back of Detective Dominguez\u2019s cruiser and taken to 9 Seymour Street. As no female police officer was present, she was not searched at that time. After fruitless searches of the residence,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the defendant\u2019s au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>tomobile, and the defendant\u2019s person, the defendant was released.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Later that same day, Detective Dominguez found a handbag that belonged to the defendant in the back of his cruiser. On the floor of the cruiser he found a bag containing over fifty-five grams of cocaine. Based on the discovery of this evidence, Detective Dominguez arrested the defendant for trafficking in cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">The motion judge determined the stop and search of the defendant and her automobile to be illegal on two bases: first, the defendant\u2019s automobile was not within the curtilage of the premises to be searched under the warrant; second, the affidavit in support of the search warrant for the residence at 9 Seymour Street and the subsequent tip the police received did not establish that there was probable cause to believe that the defendant was transporting drugs in her automobile. The motion judge concluded that there was no direct evidence that the defendant was personally selling or distributing drugs, and he held that the informant\u2019s tip concerning an imminent delivery of cocaine was not sufficiently detailed to create probable cause to stop the defendant. He accordingly ordered that the evidence obtained as a result of the stop should be suppressed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">\u201cIn reviewing the judge\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, we accept the motion judge\u2019s subsidiary findings unless there is clear error. We give substantial deference to the judge\u2019s ultimate findings. . . . We do, however, review the judge\u2019s application of constitutional principles to the facts.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Colon-Cruz, </em>408 Mass. 533, 538-539 (1990) (citations omitted). There was. probable cause to stop the car,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the evidence seized as a result of the defendant\u2019s subsequent arrest was not tainted by constitutional error. \u201cProbable cause does not require a showing that the police had resolved all their doubts. All that was required was that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>\u2018 \u201cthe facts and circumstances within . . . [the officers\u2019] knowledge and of which they had reasonably trustworthy information [were] sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that\u201d an offense [had] been or [was] being committed\u2019 \u201d (citations omitted). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Olivares, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 596, 598-599 (1991). The instant circumstances are controlled in material respects by the reasoning and result reached in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass. 891, 895-901 (1990), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, ante </em>221, 224-226 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The linchpin of the defendant\u2019s argument is that the Commonwealth failed to establish the critical nexus between the premises for which the search warrant had been issued and the defendant\u2019s automobile. Conceding, as it must, that the warrant authorizing a search of the premises at 9 Seymour Street did not, by itself, justify the stop of the defendant\u2019s automobile en route to that location,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Commonwealth asserts that probable cause and exigent circumtances converged to allow the stop of the defendant\u2019s automobile. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass. at 901; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bakoian, </em>412 Mass. 295, 301-303 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra </em>at 225-226 &amp; n.7.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">The motion judge found that, in addition to gathering the verification information set out in the margin (see note 1, <em>supra), </em>the affiant, Detective Dominguez, was told by the informant (who had passed the \u201cveracity\u201d test, see note 4, <em>supra) </em>that Heredia and the defendant were involved in the sale of cocaine at 9 Seymour Street, and also that they conducted a distribution operation from that residence, which \u201cinvolved telephone orders for drugs and deliveries by automobile.\u201d Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>409 Mass. 16, 20-22 (1990). As already mentioned (see note 1, <em>supra), </em>Detective Dominguez, in providing further corroboration, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>among other things, verified the descriptions of the two persons and their respective automobiles (i.e., make, model and plate registration number), see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parapar, </em>404 Mass. 319, 323 (1989), and superintended a controlled buy of cocaine on the premises from Heredia, cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benlien, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 834, 838-839 (1989), and authorities cited. In addition, the informant accurately predicted the expected behavior of the defendant within a narrow time frame on - the night in question, which the law enforcement officials corroborated. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass. at 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">\u201c[A]n informant\u2019s detailed tip, plus independent police corroboration of those details, of the type that occurred in <em>Draper </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[358 U.S. 307 (1959)], can compensate for deficiencies in either or both [elements] of the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli </em>[canon], and thus satisfy the art. 14 probable cause requirement.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass. at 896, and cases cited. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciaramitaro, 26 </em>Mass. App. Ct. <em>110, 115 </em>(1988). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oliveira, ante </em>645 (1993). That is what happened here. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>403 Mass. 163, 166 (1988). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Borges, </em>395 Mass. 788, 789 (1985) (informant did not indicate to police any expected behavior on the defendant\u2019s part); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Spence, </em>403 Mass. 179, 182 &amp; n.3 (1988), and cases cited (informant accurately predicted defendant\u2019s activity but failed to describe the defendant\u2019s appearance).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">The information provided by the informant coupled with the careful police investigation conducted here provided probable cause to stop the defendant and to search her and her vehicle. A warrant was not required as exigent circumstances existed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass. at 903-906; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra </em>at 225-226. But see also <em>id. </em>at 226-227.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">\n<em>Order allowing motion to suppress reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-7\">The motion judge found that the police investigation included (1) surveillance and observation of heavy \u201ctraffic activity [that] was consistent with a drug distribution operation\u201d at the premises, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parapar, </em>404 Mass. 319, 323 (1989), (2) confirmation of the description of the defendant\u2019s physical characteristics and the make, model and plate registration number of her automobile, and the further discovery that it was registered at a different address in Roslindale, (3) verification of a connection between the defendant and the male occupant of that address and the presence of her automobile at that location, and (4) an orchestrated controlled buy (from someone other than the defendant) at the premises. Also, Detective Dominguez stated in his affidavit in support of the application for a search warrant that, upon inspection of the trash from the Seymour Street residence, he discovered \u201cassorted cut off plastic bags containing a white powder residue.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b697-8\">Parenthetically, we do not engage in a debate whether the officer\u2019s stop of the defendant was premature, but we do think it appropriate to make mention of Detective Dominguez\u2019s thorough investigation. See note 1 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b697-9\">At the residence, \u201c[t]he police found some [drug] paraphernalia but no drugs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Due to the track record of the informer the \u201cveracity prong\u201d (i.e., credibility of the unnamed informant or reliability of the information provided) of the familiar <em>\u201cAguilar-Spinelli\u201d </em>test is not in contention here. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass. 891, 896 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Neither the informant, nor the police officers who conducted the surveillance at 9 Seymour Street, observed the defendant deliver, buy or sell drugs, or otherwise participate in drug activity. There also is no clear indication in the record that the defendant was even present at the time the informant alleges he witnessed a drug transaction. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carrasquillo, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 783, 786-787 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
