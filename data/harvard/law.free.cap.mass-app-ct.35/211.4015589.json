Her aunt Marla Gambino and Gambino\u2019s boyfriend, the defendant, moved in with Smith\u2019s family in New Bedford in August or September, 1985, and stayed for about two months. One day Smith walked into a room where the defendant was lying, clothed, on a bed. He told her to close the door, unbuttoned and unzipped his jeans, and asked her \u201cto suck my dick.\u201d She complied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Three weeks later, when she was alone in the apartment with the defendant, he asked her to do the same. She said no, she did not want to, but finally she \u201cdid it\u201d because I was getting scared.\u201d He asked if she was going to tell anyone; she said she would not. He offered to do \u201cit\u201d to her; she refused. Smith acknowledged that she did not tell anyone at this time.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">About a month after the latter incident, Gambino and the defendant moved to Providence. During the three and one-half years that followed to February, 1989, Smith often visited them, sometimes staying for as long as a month. In turn they visited Smith\u2019s family in New Bedford. Smith testified that the defendant did not approach her in any sexual way between his departure from New Bedford in 1985 and Smith\u2019s visit to Providence in February, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>The prosecutor went on to ask, \u201cNow, did something happen in 1989?\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge allowed Smith to say that on a day in February of that year she was lying on a bed in the Providence apartment with the defendant, her aunt Gambino, and one of Gambino\u2019s children; Gambino and the other child left the room; the defendant then touched her on her back \u201cdown next to my buttocks\u201d and \u201cstarted to go into my shirt.\u201d He stopped when Gambino returned to the room. One week later, Smith said, alone with the defendant, she told him she did not want him to do \u201call those bad things you do to me\u201d; he agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">Later, in July, 1989, again on a visit to Providence, realizing, Smith said, that she would be left alone in the apartment with the defendant, and fearful of what the defendant might do, she spoke to her brother Dennis, then eight years old. Smith told Dennis about the earlier events in New Bed-ford.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Dennis wondered whether she might not have had a nightmare but told her to tell somebody. She spoke to a young woman, Rhoda, who was staying in the apartment; Rhoda gave her the same advice. Promptly she told Gambino that \u201cUncle Joey molested me,\u201d \u201cmade me put my mouth on his penis,\u201d and \u201ctouched me in my private part.\u201d Gambino immediately confronted the defendant. He said, \u201cI\u2019d rather murder somebody than molest anybody.\u201d Gambino telephoned Smith\u2019s mother, and Gambino and Smith told her what had happened. It was agreed that all concerned would meet in New Bedford. The defendant then drove Smith and Gambino there, and these three and Smith\u2019s mother sat around a table and discussed Smith\u2019s story at length. The defendant continued to deny the accusations.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The foregoing sums up Smith\u2019s direct testimony. On cross-examination, Smith testified that she \u201cliked\u201d the defendant; she answered yes to the question, \u201cHe was good to you when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>he stayed with you and when you visited him, wasn\u2019t- he?\u201d Smith also suggested that she was afraid of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The prosecution called Michael Sylvia, an investigator for the Department of Social Services, who interviewed Smith several weeks after the family discussion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Smith mentioned an incident of oral sex; she referred to but one such incident. She also told him about a 1989 touching. She did not complain of any threats by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Smith\u2019s brother Dennis testified sketchily about Smith\u2019s statement to him and about the family discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">Smith\u2019s mother, Dora, said the relationship between Smith and the defendant during the New Bedford period was \u201c[v]ery good,\u201d and between 1985 and 1989 \u201cthey appear[ed] to continue to get along.\u201d In the phone conversation Smith told her of a recent touching. Describing the family meeting, the mother retold much of Smith\u2019s account of the defendant\u2019s misconduct in 1985 and 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Finally, Sherri Nobre, a child abuse investigator for the Bristol County district attorney, reported Smith\u2019s statement to her about the two incidents of oral sex in 1985 and the touching in 1989. So ended the Commonwealth\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">Gambino, for the defense, talked of the good relationship between Smith and the defendant over the years. In July, 1989, Smith told her that the defendant had been touching her chest, and \u201cwhen we was in New Bedford, he made me suck his penis.\u201d According to Gambino, Smith said that she had not told anyone sooner \u201c[b]ecause he [the defendant] said if I ever said anything, that I\u2019d never see you [Gambino] again.\u201d Gambino said Smith mentioned this alleged remark by the defendant at the family meeting. It may be noted, however, that Smith\u2019s own testimony did not refer to such a statement by the defendant; indeed, she did not testify to any explicit threat by the defendant. (Compare note 4, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">The defendant took the stand and flatly denied that he ever had any sexual contact with Smith. The prosecutor did not cross-examine him.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>1. <em>Fresh complaint. </em>The basis \u2014 historical, theoretical, and practical \u2014 on which fresh complaint testimony is admitted has received much attention in our courts in recent years and need not be dwelt on here. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. 654, 656-660 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dion, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 406, 412-417 (1991). It follows from the purely corroborative function of such testimony that it should be rejected unless fresh \u2014 uttered \u201cseasonably\u201d by the alleged victim. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. at 657.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">Here the corpus delicti was two events of oral sex between late August and early November, 1985. Smith \u201ccomplained\u201d to the four witnesses \u2014 Dennis, her mother Dora, Sylvia, and Nobre \u2014 no sooner than about forty-five months later, in mid-to-late 1989. Now, where the victim has been a child, with a child\u2019s supposed tendencies toward repression and vacillation, our courts have accepted complaint testimony \u201c \u2018many months after the incidents leading to the charges.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gardner, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 515, 525 (1991)(footnote omitted), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lagacy, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 622, 626 n.6 (1987). The longest delay we have found in the child-victim cases between the sexual assault and a complaint, held admissible, has been about twenty-four months. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Souther, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 219, 221-222 (1991); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hyatt, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 488, 490-492 (1991). In these two cases, as noted in <em>Gardner, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. at 524, \u201cthe child\u2019s age, the length of time the child [was] away from an abusive setting,' whether the perpetrator used threats or coercion, and whether the perpetrator [was] a relative or close friend of the child\u201d were considerations that led to a conclusion (not without some doubt) that the complaint was fresh enough to have some fair corroborative function. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Quegan, ante </em>129; 135 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>The situation in the present case resembles more closely <em>Gardner </em>itself, where the thirty-eight month lapse between a father\u2019s alleged assault upon his four year old child and the child\u2019s complaint was held to put the complaint out of bounds. It is true that Smith was a child, only eight, when the incidents allegedly occurred, and that the assailant may be considered the equivalent of a near relative, living with the victim\u2019s family at the time. Smith\u2019s fear of the defendant, to which she rather equivocally testified, might account for some delay in her coming forward and speaking. Like the victim in <em>Gardner, </em>however, Smith did not testify \u201cas to any specific threats or actions of the defendant that compelled her to be silent about the incident [s] for such a long period of time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 526. And, as in <em>Gardner, </em>the defendant left Smith\u2019s home within a relatively short period of time after the alleged assaults, and, \u201cas a result, during the following [forty-five] months, [Smith] was not in his control.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In fact, the \u201cassertion of generalized fear on [Smith\u2019s] part was promptly negated\u201d by her repeated visits to the Providence home between 1985 and 1989. <em>Dion, </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. at 414.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">We need not attempt to say at what specific point in time \u2014 at a lapse of twenty-five months or twenty-nine months or some other specific interval \u2014 a complaint by the victim herein would have, to be pronounced stale. We are clear, however, that the running of forty-five months, a period beyond \u201cthe far end of decisional experience,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>should have disqualified the complaints as corroborative evidence. And see Appendix.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Especially is this called for, since we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>have here essentially a weak case, a contest of word against word. The error in admitting the complaints was material.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">2. <em>Bad acts. </em>The defendant was on trial for committing two sexual acts against Smith in 1985. Nevertheless the judge admitted testimony of a sexual touching that supposedly happened forty months later. If received to show the defendant\u2019s character or propensity to commit the crime charged, such bad acts testimony would be recognized as deeply prejudicial and plainly inadmissible. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, </em>409 Mass. 500, 505 (1991). However, the prosecution urges as an \u201cexception\u201d to the general canon the proposition, which has appeared in our cases, \u201cthat, when a defendant is charged with any form of illicit sexual intercourse, evidence of the commission of similar crimes by the same parties though committed in another place, if not too remote in time, is competent to prove an inclination to commit the [acts] charged in the indictment . . . and is relevant to show the probable existence of the same passion or emotion at the time in issue.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>387 Mass. 464, 470 (1982), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bemis, </em>242 Mass. 582, 585 (1922). If an exception for \u201cinclination\u201d is not to subvert the canon and foster intolerable prejudice against the accused, it must be applied with care; thus the cautionary phrase, \u201cif not too remote in time.\u201d We suggest that the single bad act here happened, if it happened at all, beyond the rim of the \u201cremote.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gillette, </em>where bad acts testimony was offered in a case of sexual assault on a child under fourteen, the court said, \u201c[n]o case brought to our attention has dealt with an act done, or a statement made, more than a few months before or after the alleged offense.\u201d 33 Mass. App. Ct. 427, 431-432 (1992) (seven years too remote). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bemis, </em>242 Mass. at 585 (four months not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>too remote); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Machado, </em>339 Mass. 713, 714-715 (1959) (five months); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Odell, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 100, 103-104 (1993) (three months). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brenner, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 930, 931 (1984) (uncharged act admitted that occurred \u201cwithin the time frame of the complaint\u201d). Contrast cases of repetitive bad acts over long periods: <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Calcagno, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 25, 27-28 (1991) (evidence admitted that defendant had molested victim at least three times a month for eight years); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brigham, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 935, 936-937 (1992) (\u201ca continuing course of sexual molestation by the defendant over several years, both before and after the events covered by the indictments\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">There was material error in admitting testimony about the alleged 1989 touching.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">3. <em>Further remarks. </em>We take note of two further points that the defendant, having objected root and branch to the admission of bad acts testimony, allowed to pass without reaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">In instructing on bad acts, the judge, in a rather confused passage,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> indicated that the jury might consider this testimony, \u201c[i]n other words, to explain . . . [w]hy the incidents of 1985 came to light in 1989.\u201d The alleged incidents came to light in the victim\u2019s complaints, but the complaints occurred not at the time of the bad act \u2014 the touching \u2014 but about five months thereafter. Moreover, testimony about bad acts, inherently prejudicial, is not admissible to explain why a delayed complaint was made at a particular time or to show the victim\u2019s state of mind when he or she made the complaint. See <em>Montanino, </em>409 Mass. at 505-507 (error to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>admit victim\u2019s testimony that he was prompted to make delayed complaint when he heard the defendant was abusing others; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Errington, </em>390 Mass. 875 [1984], distinguished).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Second, although the 1989 touching was not itself charged to the defendant as a crime, Smith, besides testifying to the touching, was allowed to say that she complained of it (as well as of the rape) to others, and the others were allowed to confirm that she complained of it. So we have what amounts to fresh complaint testimony about bad acts. The fresh complaint doctrine, as applied in the usual way to sexual offenses actually in suit, is an anomaly in the law of evidence, as was recognized from an early date; it is justified for special reasons.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In the present case the anomaly was questionably extended to a new domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial, if the Commonwealth should so elect.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">\n<em>Verdict set aside.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">Fresh complaint testimony allowed in presence of family ties or threats: <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>412 Mass. 664, 666-669, 670 n.4 (1992): seven months; fourteen year old victim; defendant was mother\u2019s husband; three incidents; threats that defendant would harm victim\u2019s family if she told. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Souther, </em>31 Mass.
