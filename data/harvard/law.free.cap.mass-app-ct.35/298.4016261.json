Wile Corporation to demolish a building in Cambridge and construct another in its place. The Wile Corporation subcontracted the demolition work to the Duane Corporation (Duane), and Duane in turn subcontracted it by oral contract to Hercules Building and Wrecking Company, Inc. (Hercules).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">Harold Monsini, the owner, president, treasurer, and worksite manager of Hercules, sometime in August 198.3 put Paul Murray to work on the demolition job at a wage of $250 a week, paid in cash. On September 7, 1983, Murray was standing on scaffolding at the site, removing piping with tools supplied by Hercules. As Murray cut a hanger from which the piping was suspended, the piping fell onto the scaffolding, upsetting it. Murray fell and suffered severe injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">We recount some litigative history to bring the present appeal to focus.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">In October, 1984, Murray commenced an action in Superior Court against Hercules, Monsini, and Duane (and another). Without detailing all the allegations of the complaint, it will be enough to say that Murray charged Hercules and Monsini, in effect, with negligent failure to secure and maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance, and Monsini and Duane with negligence in failing to use reasonable care to maintain a safe workplace. Joining as plaintiffs in the action, alleging loss of consortium, were Murray\u2019s wife and the children of the family. Substantial damages were demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">Hercules in fact had no workers\u2019 compensation insurance. It did have comprehensive general liability (CGL) insurance with Great Southwest Fire Insurance Company (Great Southwest). Duane had CGL insurance with National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (National Union), and workers\u2019 compensation insurance with Commercial Union Insurance Company (Commercial Union).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">With the Murray action pending, Great Southwest gave notice \u201cto whom it may concern\u201d on February 8, 1985, that \u201c[i]f it is later determined that Mr. Murray was in fact an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>employee of yours [Hercules] at the time of his injury, then, Great Southwest Fire Insurance Company will withdraw its defense [in the Murray action] and refuse to indemnify you for this loss.\u201d On April 3, 1985, Great Southwest gave notice that it was disclaiming coverage in an action by Commercial Union against Hercules and Monsini to recoup the workers\u2019 compensation benefits Commercial Union had provided to Murray: the workers\u2019 compensation obligation fell on Duane since Hercules, its subcontractor, had failed to provide this protection, and Commercial Union, as Duane\u2019s insurer, was demanding reimbursements, see G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 18.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">On May 24, 1985, Great Southwest brought a declaratory action in Superior Court against Hercules, Murray (and his family), and Commercial Union seeking a ruling, in essence, that its CGL policy did not cover Hercules for the claims constituting the Murray action. This declaratory action was consolidated for trial with the Murray action.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Here followed a long pause. Hearings before the Department of Industrial Accidents, with the interested parties represented, took place in October 1985, October 1986, May 1987, February 1988, and April 1988. These eventuated, in October 1988, in a report by an administrative judge of the department to the effect that Murray was an employee of Hercules at the time of the accident (a matter that had been disputed), that Hercules was then uninsured for workers\u2019 compensation benefits, and that Commercial Union, as Duane\u2019s insurer, was thus liable in the first instance to pay Murray appropriate benefits as described in the report (amounting to $13,581.27 for temporary total incapacity compensation benefits from November 7, 1983, to May 25, 1985, plus medical expenses and attorney\u2019s fees). The administrative judge reported that he disbelieved Monsini\u2019s testimony that he had given a check to an insurance agent before the accident to procure workers\u2019 compensation coverage for Hercules.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>On March 22, 1989, the Murray action (and associated litigation) was settled for $395,000, with a contribution of $197,500 by Great Southwest and a like contribution by National Union and the Wile Corporation. The agreement of settlement contemplated that final adjustment as between Great Southwest and National Union would await the result of the declaratory action (amended on May 10, 1989, to include Monsini and National Union as parties defendant) on the following contingent basis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\">If the Court declares that there is insurance coverage under [the Great Southwest policy] for either Harold Monsini or Hercules for the personal injury claim of Paul Murray, then Great Southwest will pay National Union the sum of $197,500.00 without interest, costs or attorneys fees.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Otherwise, the settlement agreement provided, National Union would pay a like sum to Great Southwest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">A stipulation of facts (in part recounting the facts set out above) was entered into in aid of the declaratory action, and in August, 1990, the parties cross-moved in that action for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">A judge of the Superior Court ruled in Great Southwest\u2019s favor that there was no coverage under the CGL portion of its policy for either Hercules or Monsini, so National Union must make payment to Great Southwest. National Union appeals, contesting seriously only the negative holding with respect to Monsini. We hold that Great Southwest\u2019s policy affords coverage to Monsini as described at our points 2b(ii) and 3 below. Accordingly, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>1. <em>CGL coverage under Great Southwest\u2019s insurance policy. </em>The CGL provisions of Great Southwest\u2019s insurance policy state: \u201cThe company will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay in damages because of <em>A. </em>bodily injury or <em>B. </em>property damage to which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence, and the company shall have the right and duty to defend any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such bodily injury or property damage, even if any of the allegations of the suit are groundless, false or fraudulent . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Under \u201cPersons Insured,\u201d the policy states: \u201cEach of the following is an insured under this insurance to the extent set forth below: ... if the named insured is designated in the declarations as other than an individual, partnership or joint venture, the organization so designated and any executive officer, director or stockholder thereof while acting within the scope of his duties as such . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">These provisions, taken together, on their face foretell coverage of the insureds \u2014 namely, Hercules, as designated corporation, and Monsini, as executive officer thereof \u2014 with regard to Murray\u2019s bodily injury in the occurrence of September 7, 1983 \u2014 unless relevant \u201cexclusions\u201d are to be found in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">2. <em>Exclusions from Great Southwest\u2019s CGL coverage. </em>We are to recall, to begin with, that when a party relies upon a \u201cseparate and distinct\u201d exclusion, that party bears the burden of demonstrating that the exclusion applies. See <em>Ratner </em>v. <em>Canadian Univ. Ins. Co., </em>359 Mass. 375, 381 (1971), quoting from <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Continental Ins. Co., </em>313 Mass. 557, 563 (1943). See also <em>Camp Dresser &amp; McKee, Inc. </em>v. <em>Home Ins. Co., </em>30 Mass. App. Ct. 318, 321 (1991). Moreover, exclusions are to be read literally, without poetic license \u2014 they are \u201cto be strictly construed.\u201d <em>Quincy Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Abernathy, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 907, 908 (1983), quot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>ing from <em>Vappi &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>348 Mass. 427, 431 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In its letter of February 8, 1985, reserving rights, Great Southwest cited two clauses of exclusion. According to its policy, \u201c[t]his insurance does not apply: . . . (i) to any obligation for which the insured or any carrier as his insurer may be held liable under any workmen\u2019s compensation, unemployment compensation or disability benefits law, or under any similar law; (j) to bodily injury to any employee of the insured arising out of and in the course of his employment by the insured or to any obligation of the insured to indemnify another because of damages arising out of such injury . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">a. <em>Application to Hercules. </em>We look first to the component of the Murray action that complained of Hercules\u2019s failure to procure workers\u2019 compensation insurance for its employees. Accepting, as did the Department of Industrial Accidents and the judge of the Superior Court, that Murray was Hercules\u2019s employee, Great Southwest asserts correctly that exclusion (i) barred coverage of Hercules to the extent of its obligation to see to the provision of the workers\u2019 compensation benefits owed to Murray.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">And, accepting again Murray\u2019s status as Hercules\u2019s employee, exclusion (j) clearly prevented coverage of Hercules regarding Murray\u2019s bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">The judge was in accord on both scores, exonerating Great Southwest as to Hercules, and, as noted, National Union presents no material argument to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">b. <em>Application to Monsini. </em>(i) <em>Negligent failure to secure workers\u2019 compensation insurance. </em>Remaining in controversy is the question of the coverage or exclusion from coverage of Harold Monsini, an insured under the CGL portion of Great Southwest\u2019s policy as an executive officer of Hercules, the named insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">Monsini, in his individual role as such an officer, was obliged to see to the procurement of workers\u2019 compensation insurance for the benefit of Hercules\u2019s employees. This follows from the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s decision in <em>LaClair </em>v. <em>Silberline Mfg. Co., </em>379 Mass. 21 (1979). LaClair was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>employee of Marian Plastics, Inc., a corporation engaged in manufacturing and coloring plastics. On the day of the accident, LaClair was mixing aluminum powder with colors of polystyrene plastic to obtain a silver-colored plastic. A static spark evidently ignited aluminum dust, and in the explosion LaClair suffered burns that resulted in his death. One Robert E. Lewis, the president and treasurer of the corporation as well as its general manager, was a defendant in the action brought by the administratrix, and one of the claims brought against him was for his failure through negligence to procure workers\u2019 compensation insurance for the corporation\u2019s employees. <em>Id. </em>at 23-24. The court held that Lewis must answer to this charge. See <em>id. </em>at 34. The reasoning goes thus.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Since 1943, workers\u2019 compensation protection, furnished by insurance (or self-insurance), has been required of most employers by statute. The obligation to secure this protection is cast not only on a corporate employer proper but also upon the corporation\u2019s president and treasurer. By G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 25C, he or she is made criminally punishable for the corporation\u2019s default.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at 26-27. Such a violation on the part of the corporate executive, while not conclusive of his or her civil liability, is \u201cevidence of a violator\u2019s negligence as to all consequences that the statute was intended to prevent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28. (The \u201cconsequences\u201d here con.sist of liability for the dollar equivalent of the benefits the employee would be entitled to receive under the statutory system. See <em>id. </em>at 30.) The court in <em>LaClair </em>also noted that Lewis had reason to know not only of the corporation\u2019s precarious financial situation, which heightened the importance to its employees of workers\u2019 compensation, but also of the probability of industrial accidents in the line of work. See <em>id. </em>at 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>The position of Monsini parallels that of Lewis in the <em>LaClair </em>case. As president and treasurer of Hercules, Mon-sini had the responsibility of ensuring that Hercules had workers\u2019 compensation coverage, and his failure to do so exposed him to the penalties outlined in G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 25C. Moreover, it may be noted that he could have anticipated accidents in the course of the demolition work, especially in Murray\u2019s case, as Murray had no experience in this work.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">However, it is not a question whether Monsini would have won or lost had Murray\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation-related claim against him been tried, but rather a question of the nature of the \u201cobligation\u201d that formed the basis of Murray\u2019s asserted claim. Although the point is not absolutely clear, we think, in agreement with the judge below, that Great Southwest makes a case that Monsini\u2019s \u201cobligation\u201d to secure workers\u2019 compensation insurance for Hercules\u2019s employees was so far derived from, and integral to, the workers\u2019 compensation statute that it fell within exclusion (i) of the policy\u2019s CGL provisions; the risk that Monsini would negligently fail in fulfilling that obligation was an excluded risk by the terms of exclusion (i). Cf. <em>Hanover Ins. Co </em>v. Ramsey, 405 Mass. 1101, 1101 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">(ii) <em>Duty to use reasonable care to maintain safe workplace. </em>When it comes to the risk that Monsini would fail in his duty to use reasonable care to create and maintain a safe workplace, Great Southwest is unable to show that the risk of resultant bodily injury is excluded by any of the provisions in the CGL portion of its policy.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-7\">That Monsini was under the duty described is also settled by the <em>LaClair </em>decision. In that case, the administratrix <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>made a second claim against Lewis, charging him in his individual role with negligent failure to use reasonable care to provide a safe workplace. Of this, the court said: \u201cIt is unquestionably true that Lewis, as the sole manager of the Marian Plastics plant, owed LaClair duties to use reasonable care to provide him with a safe place in which to work and to furnish and maintain reasonably safe and proper machinery and equipment with which to perform his assigned tasks.\u201d <em>LaClair, 319 </em>Mass. at 30 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (The court, however, went on to find that it was right for the trial court to have directed a verdict against Lewis on this claim because there was no evidence of causation: \u201cno proof that \u2018but for\u2019 this negligence the injury to LaClair would not have occurred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Monsini, the self-admitted \u201csupervisor\u201d of Hercules\u2019s on-site operations, was under the same duty as Lewis, and we have to assume for purposes of the present case that breach of that duty could result in bodily injury to Murray. Therefore the CGL provisions of Great Southwest\u2019s policy cover the risk unless the insurer can point to an applicable exclusion. It cannot.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">Exclusion (i) does not apply because Monsini\u2019s duty to use reasonable care to furnish a safe workplace, as described in <em>LaClair, </em>is a common law (nonstatutory) duty and is not (to quote again the words of [i]) an \u201cobligation for which the insured . . . may be held liable under any workmen\u2019s compensation . . . law.\u201d In contrast is Monsini\u2019s responsibility to use reasonable efforts to obtain workers\u2019 compensation insurance: a responsibility that has a source in the statute, as we have indicated. Great Southwest\u2019s attempt to tie the <em>LaClair </em>safe-workplace duty to the workers\u2019 compensation statute is unavailing.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Exclusion G) is inapplicable because it speaks of \u201cany employee of the insured\u201d: Murray was an employee not of Mon-sini but of Hercules; this exclusion deprives Hercules of coverage, as we have seen, but not Monsini.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The effect of the foregoing is that Monsini as executive officer-insured has bodily injury coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Great Southwest now mentions a provision of the policy (not cited in its letters of February 8 and April 3, 1985) in hopes that it may be treated as an exclusion against Monsini. An endorsement entitled \u201cAdditional Insured (Employees)\u201d states: \u201cIt is hereby understood and agreed that the \u2018Persons Insured\u2019 provision is amended to include any employee of the named insured while acting within the scope of his duties as such, but the insurance afforded to such employee does not apply: I. To bodily injury to (a) another employee of the named insured arising out of or in the course of his employment . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">It is hardly plausible that a provision for coverage to employees as \u201cadditional insured,\u201d subject to a coemployee exception, can be fairly read to cut down the coverage otherwise provided for executive officers. If such was a purpose of Great Southwest, no more circuitous or improbable means of achieving it can be imagined. The endorsement is not relevant to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">Nor, we may add, does the case fit the words of the endorsement. There is no indication of record<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that Monsini had any arrangement with Hercules, express or implied, for the payment of compensation to him for any services he might perform as an officer of the corporation, nor is there any suggestion that he was on the payroll as an employee. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Thus he was not an \u201cemployee,\u201d if we take a workers\u2019 compensation definition of the term as a cogent reference.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> It is possible for an executive officer of a corporation to have a place also in the line of regular working employees and to receive distinct compensation for that work. Cf. <em>Emery\u2019s Case, </em>271 Mass. 46, 49 (1930). Monsini was distant from such a model. He appears as the absolute boss of the operation by his ownership and control, not as an employee. He hired employees (including Murray) and presumably could fire them. He set the terms of employment. He laid out and supervised the work of the employees at the site, gave them the necessary tools and safety equipment, and saw to the payroll. That he might on occasion pitch in and help out physically on some piece of work does not alter the picture. For examples of situations resembling the present where employee status was held not to exist, see <em>Ben-Jay Food Dis-tribs. </em>v. <em>Warshaw, </em>70 So. 2d 564, 564-565 (Fla. 1954); <em>Erickson </em>v. <em>Erickson Furniture Co., </em>179 Minn. 304, 306-307 (1930); <em>Holm </em>v. <em>H &amp; S Asphalt Co., </em>283 Minn. 330, 330-331 (1969); <em>Duvick </em>v. <em>Industrial Commn., 22 </em>Wis. 2d 155, 162-163 (1963).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">3. <em>Regarding the consortium claims. </em>The judge held that Great Southwest\u2019s policy afforded coverage of the consortium claims made by members of Murray\u2019s family. \u201cBodily injury\u201d was taken, with the aid of language in the \u201cLimits of Liability\u201d part of the policy, to comprise the associational injury, and there was no relevant exclusion; it was also observed that the workers\u2019 compensation statute, at the date of Murray\u2019s accident or the commencement of Murray\u2019s action, did not bar suit for loss of consortium on the part of an injured employee\u2019s family, even if the employer had workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>compensation insurance. That was the holding in <em>Ferriter </em>v. <em>Daniel O\u2019Connell\u2019s Sons, Inc., </em>381 Mass. 507 (1980), later superseded by statute, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 24, as appearing in St. 1985, c. 572, \u00a7 35. The parties do not debate any of this; it does not figure in the formula of the settlement agreement by which liability is determined as between the insurers; and the settlement payment to Murray engrosses and disposes of the consortium claims with the other claims in Murray\u2019s complaint.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded for entry of judgment in favor of National Union in conformance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b330-7\">Duane had sued Hercules and Monsini to recoup expenditures by or on behalf of Duane in favor of Murray.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b331-9\">A special provision regarding the loss of consortium claims in the Murray action will be noted at our point 3 below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b331-10\">The theory of the arrangement evidently was, under the policies or more general considerations, that any liability of Great Southwest to Hercules or Monsini was primary, National Union\u2019s secondary. The record does not describe the parties\u2019 reasoning on the matter. Whatever the theory, we are concerned with carrying out the provisions of the settlement agreement and thus of Great Southwest\u2019s policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b332-8\">The policy also states: \u201cThe insurance afforded applies separately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought, except with respect to the limits of company liability . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b334-6\">General Laws c. 152, \u00a7 25C(5), as appearing in St. 1987, c. 691, \u00a7 10, reads as follows: \u201cIn addition to being subject to the civil penalties herein provided, an employer who fails to provide for insurance or self-insurance as required by this chapter shall be punished by a fine of not more than one thousand five hundred dollars or by imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. ... If such employer is a corporation, the president or treasurer or both shall be liable for said punishment. . .</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b335-8\">The judge of the Superior Court did not treat separately this claim against Monsini, as manager, to see to the provision of safe conditions of work. Possibly she thought that the exclusion she had found regarding Monsini\u2019s obligation to secure workers\u2019 compensation insurance somehow extended automatically to his safe-workplace duty. This would be mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">We may note that the damages Murray might have recovered on a trial of the safe-workplace claim could have far exceeded a recovery on his workers\u2019 compensation-related claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The court cites <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Frank\u2019s Inc., </em>314 Mass. 42, 45 (1943), and cases therein cited, and refers also to <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sancolmar Indus., Inc., </em>347 F.
