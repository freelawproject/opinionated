L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, inserted by St. 1989, c. 580, \u00a7 2, which added the following provision \u201c[f]or the purposes of this chapter, the amount of actual damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>to be multiplied by the court shall be the amount of the judgment on all claims arising out of the same and underlying transaction or occurrence regardless of the existence or nonexistence of insurance coverage available in payment of the claim,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> did not apply to suits pending at the time of its enactment and (2) that the actual damages awarded by a master for the loss of use of money wrongfully withheld in violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, must be reduced by the amount of prejudgment interest recovered by the plaintiff on his contract claim based on the same wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">We summarize the procedural background. The plaintiff filed suit in the Superior Court against the defendant for breach of contract and for violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, based upon the alleged wrongful failure of the defendant to return his deposit of $50,000, which had been held in escrow under a purchase and sale agreement. The judge bifurcated the claims. The jury found for the plaintiff on the contract claim and awarded the plaintiff $50,000. The court entered a separate judgment in the amount of $50,000 together with prejudgment interest of $27,017 against the defendant on the contract claim. On February 9, 1990, the plaintiff was paid the $50,000 plus the then-accrued interest in the escrow account of $22,781.85 on that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The same judge who bifurcated the claims for trial assigned the c. 93A claim to a master for trial. Before the case was heard by a master, the defendant filed a motion asking the court to rule that the above described amendment to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, did not apply to this claim, which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>pending at the time of its enactment. The judge ruled that the amendment imposed an additional penalty on litigants and should be given prospective effect only. The c. 93A claim was then tried before the master who determined that the plaintiff was entitled to recover the loss of use of his money for the period from September, 1984, the approximate date of demand, until February 9, 1990, the date of its return, in the sum of $31,055.69. The master also found that this sum should be tripled for the wilful and knowing violation of c. 93A and thus awarded damages in the sum of $93,167.07. Upon the plaintiff\u2019s motion for confirmation of the master\u2019s report and the defendant\u2019s objections to the report, a different judge confirmed the report in all respects except the award of damages. He reduced the master\u2019s single damages award of $31,055.69 by the amount of accrued interest in the escrow account in the sum of $22,781.85 which had been paid to the plaintiff on his contract claim. This resulted in a single c. 93A damages award of $8,273.84 and a punitive damages award of $16,547.68. The judge also awarded the plaintiff attorney fees and costs of $41,282. The plaintiff filed this appeal claiming that the amendment to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, should apply to pending claims and that his single damages should not have been reduced by interest accrued on the escrow account.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">1. <em>The 1989 amendment to G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11. </em>The plaintiff argues that the amendment did not change the substance of a claim for violation of G. L. c. 93A but merely clarified the remedy available to a litigant under that chapter and, thus, should be construed to be remedial. Absent a legislative directive, remedial statutes \u2014 those regulating practice, procedure, and evidence \u2014\u2022 are commonly treated as operating retroactively to apply to pending claims. <em>Hanscom </em>v. <em>Malden &amp; Melrose Gas Light Co., </em>220 Mass. 1, 3 (1914). <em>City Council of Waltham </em>v. <em>Vinciullo, </em>364 Mass. 624, 626 (1974). It is, however, difficult to determine whether a statute is remedial in nature or affects substantive rights. <em>Fon-taine </em>v. <em>Ebtec Corp., </em>415 Mass. 309, 319 (1993). <em>Goes </em>v. <em>Feldman, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 84, 87-89 (1979). In the past, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>remedial legislation given retrospective effect in this Commonwealth has encompassed essentially procedural legislation which preserved a remedy that might otherwise be lost or which created a new enforcement mechanism for remedying the impairment of an existing legal right. <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>Ebtec Corp., supra </em>at 319 and cases cited therein. In <em>Fon-taine, supra </em>at 319, the Supreme Judicial Court \u201crecognized that legislation limiting or increasing the measure of liability, while arguably remedial in the broad sense of that word, generally is considered to impair the substantive rights of a party who will be adversely affected by the legislation.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Cudlassi </em>v. <em>MacFarland, </em>304 Mass. 612, 613 (1939) (amendment eliminating double damages for dog bites not retroactive because plaintiff had a \u201cvested right\u201d in the double recovery at the time he was bitten); <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Boston Univ. Hosp., </em>372 Mass. 654, 657-658 (1977)(statute requiring litigants who do not succeed at the tribunal level in medical malpractice actions to post a bond applied prospectively because, even though statute was largely procedural, forcing litigants to shoulder costs involves an element of substance); <em>USM Corp. </em>v. <em>Marson Fastener Corp., </em>392 Mass. 334, 353 (1984)(declining to give retroactive application to legislation imposing up to double damages for misappropriation of trade secrets); <em>Ricky Smith Pontiac, Inc. </em>v. <em>Subaru of New England, Inc., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 396, 414 (1982)(amendment to statute regulating auto franchises that redefined the \u201crelevant market area\u201d of a franchisee and deleted a provision permitting multiple damages deemed substantive). There is no question that the amendment to \u00a7 11 affects the measure of liability. In this case, the amendment would subject the defendant to significantly increased damages. Instead of the plaintiff\u2019s loss being based upon the foreseeable consequences of the defendant\u2019s unfair act or practice (the loss of use of money during the period it was wrongfully withheld), his loss would be measured by his contract damages which, if tripled, would far exceed those resulting from lost interest. Therefore, we conclude that, without direction from the Legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>ture as to its intent, the amendment should not be applied retroactively. <em>Fontaine, supra </em>at 320-321. See <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Boston Univ. Hosp., </em>372 Mass. at 658 (any uncertainty must be resolved against retroactive application of the statute).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">2. <em>Interest. </em>The plaintiff protests the second judge\u2019s reduction of the master\u2019s award of single damages by the interest earned on the escrow account. A master\u2019s findings are binding upon the judge and upon this court unless the findings are clearly erroneous, mutually inconsistent, contradictory or vitiated in view of the controlling law. <em>Selectmen of Hatfield </em>v. <em>Garvey, 362 </em>Mass. 821, 825 (1973). <em>John F. Miller Co. </em>v. <em>George Fichera Constr. Corp., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 494, 495 (1979). We conclude that the judge acted properly in reducing the master\u2019s award of single damages as matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In cases where damages under c. 93A amount to lost interest on money wrongfully withheld, a plaintiff\u2019s actual or single damages usually consist of the amount of interest which could have been earned. <em>Guenard </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>387 Mass. 802, 810 (1982). <em>Bertassi </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>402 Mass. 366, 372-374 (1988). However, the same interest cannot be recouped more than once on alternate theories of recovery. <em>Calimlim </em>v. <em>Foreign Car Center, Inc., </em>392 Mass. 228, 235 (1984). <em>Bertassi, supra </em>at 373. Here, while the suit was pending, the $50,000 deposit was actually accruing interest in an interest bearing trust account created for the ultimate recipient of those funds. The judge reasoned that, given the account\u2019s existence and the interest being earned thereon, the plaintiff\u2019s actual damages should be measured by calculating the difference between the amount of interest actually earned and the amount, as determined by the master, that could have been earned had the plaintiff had a choice of where to invest the sums on deposit as determined by the master. Since the plaintiff has already received the interest earned in the escrow account as part of his damages under the contract claim, he cannot now recover that same money again as part of his award under c. 93A. <em>Bertassi, supra </em>at 372-373.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b572-7\">According to its proponents, the amendment was designed to overrule those cases, <em>Bertassi </em>v. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>402 Mass. 366 (1988), and <em>Trempe </em>v. <em>Allstate Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 448 (1985), which had excluded the amount available under the policy from the amount multiplied for a wilful and knowing violation of G. L. c. 93A based on a violation of the Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act, G. L. c. 176D, \u00a7 3(9), and to clarify that the actual damages to be doubled and tripled were not just lost interest on the amount the insurer should have paid, but also included the amount of the underlying judgment that a plaintiff was forced to litigate to recover.
