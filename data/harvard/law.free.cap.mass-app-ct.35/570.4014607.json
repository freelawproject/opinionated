The machine was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>not built, and Standard eventually sued Bolton and two of its officers, John W. Fitzgerald and Glen I. Urquhart, on alleged grounds of breach of contract, misrepresentation, etc. After lengthy pretrial proceedings, the action came to trial, jury-waived, in the Newburyport sitting of the Superior Court for Essex County, and resulted in a judgment for the plaintiff against all three defendants. With out-of-pocket losses and lost profits allowed and doubled pursuant to G. L. c. 93A, and interest to the time of judgment and attorney\u2019s fees added, the judgment was for more than three million dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Final evidence in the action was submitted on December 13, 1991. Under date of January 14, 1992, the clerk of the Essex County Superior Court at Salem forwarded to the parties copies of the judgment rendered and dated at Newbury-port on December 31, 1991; the date January 14, 1992, was inscribed by the clerk at the side of the copy of the judgment (together with the initials of the attorneys in the action). The defendants filed their notices of appeal from the judgment on February 4, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">On March 4, 1992, the plaintiff moved to dismiss the defendants\u2019 appeal for untimeliness, asserting that more than thirty days had passed between the date of the judgment and the defendants\u2019 filing of their notices of appeal. The defendants opposed the motion, denying untimeliness, and, for safety\u2019s sake, provisionally assuming untimeliness, they moved on their own part for an extension of the time to notice their appeals (so as to validate their filing on February 4), claiming excusable neglect. The motions were heard by a judge of the Superior Court (not the trial judge). On May 11, 1992, the judge, without opinion, allowed the plaintiffs motion to dismiss and denied the defendants\u2019 motion to extend time. The decision, in both its parts, is here for review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">1. We hold that the notices of appeal were timely filed. Time for filing the notices did not run from the date when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>the judgment was rendered (December 31, 1991) but from the date of the entry of that judgment on the docket in Salem. For Mass.R.A.P. 4(a), as amended, 395 Mass. 1110-1111 (1985), provides that a notice of appeal \u201cshall be filed with the clerk of the lower court within thirty days of the date of the entry of the judgment appealed from,\u201d and Mass.R.Civ.P. 79(a), 365 Mass. 840 (1974), directs the clerk to make entry of judgment and \u201c[t]he entry of an order or judgment shall show the date the entry was made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The docket in the present case maintained in Salem has a line describing the present judgment in detail, preceded by \u201c1991 Dec. 31.\u201d But it is nearly certain that this was not the date of entry; it was simply the date of the judgment. We observe that the judgment here was rendered on New Year\u2019s Eve, with all that that implies about the likelihood of immediate entry by the clerk, even if the judgment came into the clerk\u2019s office that day. More likely is it that the inscribed date January 14 on the copies of the judgment represents not only the date the copies were sent to the parties but also the actual date of entry of the judgment on the docket (or a date shortly after the actual date of entry). This, indeed, follows from Mass.R.Civ. P. 77(d), 365 Mass. 838 (1974), which directs that \u201cthe clerk shall immediately upon the entry of an order or judgment serve a notice of the entry by mail . . . upon each party ....\u2019\u2019 The clerk\u2019s office went wrong in failing to note on the docket the date of entry, as required by rule 79(a), quoted above. (The clerk\u2019s office was also at fault in failing to \u201cmake a note in the docket of the mailing\u201d of the notice to the parties of the entry of judgment, as also required by rule 77[d].) Taking January 14 (or a prior date not earlier than January 5) to be the date of entry, the defendants\u2019 notices of appeal were timely. It is true that the defendants cannot fix with certainty the exact date of the entry of judgment, but enough appears in all the circumstances to justify a conclusion in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">2. If, contrary to the foregoing analysis, December 31, 1991, is taken as the date of entry of the judgment, then the defendants make a good case for an extension of time under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Mass.R.A.P. 4(c), as amended, 378 Mass. 929 (1979): \u201cUpon a showing of excusable neglect, the lower court may extend the time for filing the notice of appeal by any party for a period not to exceed thirty days from the time otherwise prescribed by this rule.\u201d The defendants could reasonably construe the copies of the judgment received by them, bearing the clerk\u2019s inscription of the date January 14, as the mailed notice of the entry of judgment, a mailing which, by rule 77(d), as we have seen, is to take place \u201cimmediately upon the entry of an order or judgment.\u201d The defendants would have no particular occasion to look further and could file their notices of appeal in thirty days, as they did on February 4. If they became concerned that January 14 was merely an arbitrary date, and proceeded to examine the docket, they would read December 31; this they would recognize as almost surely not the date of actual entry. This is turn would tend to confirm or at least not to displace the view that January 14 or an earlier nearby date was the date of actual entry. Of course the defendants might then, out of abundant caution, try to avoid possible trouble by making haste to. notice their appeal. But on the whole scenario described, one can say that the problem, such as it was, had its origin in two main faults at the clerk\u2019s office: its mailed notice to the parties did not state in terms the information it intended to convey but left it to implication from the inscribed date, and it failed to note on the docket the true date of the entry of judgment. Any fault of the defendants was enmeshed in faults of the clerk\u2019s office.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On the predicate that the notices of appeal were late, they were late by no more than several days, thus the plaintiff can claim no material prejudice. We conclude that such \u201cneglect\u201d as is attributable to the defendants should be held \u201cexcusable.\u201d Insofar as the judge below may have exercised discretion in denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>the extension of time, we are obliged to say that discretion was abused.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">We believe that procedural rules (including administrative directions) should be faithfully followed and derelictions condignly discouraged or sanctioned. But though procedural law has some claims of its own, its main function is to facilitate adjudication on the merits \u2014 not to abort such inquiry and decision. The courts of the Commonwealth have long been committed to this understanding of the subject. As applied to appeals, our court has spoken of \u201cthe evolving rule that a procedural tangle having its origin in a failure by the court\u201d \u2014 here we may include the court clerk \u2014 \u201cto observe the mandates of rules will generally be resolved in favor of preserving rights of appeal where this result is technically possible and does not work unfair prejudice to other parties.\u201d The court referred to a tangle close to the present: \u201cthe promiscuous use of the title, \u2018Judgment,\u2019 one effect of which is to leave the parties in confusion as to when an appeal is called for to save their rights to appellate review.\u201d <em>Krupp </em>v. <em>Gulf Oil Corp., 29 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 116, 121 &amp; n.6 (1990). The court cites (at 121) several cases illustrative of the \u201cevolving rule,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to which we would add <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Manns, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 485, 490-492 (1992) (appellate rights preserved although appeal lodged in wrong court).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>The order of dismissal of the defendants\u2019 appeal is vacated, and the appeal is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\">We should note that the defendants also applied for relief to a single justice of our court, but that dissipated itself because of supposed difficulties with single justice jurisdiction which need not detain us, leaving for us the two issues mentioned.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b603-5\">We recognize the possibility that such faults may be contributed to by limited resources or shortage of personnel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b604-6\">It should be added that a reading of what the parties have to say in short compass in their briefs about the substance of the defendants\u2019 appeal leaves us with the view that the appeal is \u201cmeritorious\u201d in the narrow sense that it is \u201cworthy of presentation to a court, not one which is sure of success.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Manns, </em>33 Mass.
