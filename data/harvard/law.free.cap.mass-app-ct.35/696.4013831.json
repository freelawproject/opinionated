A Superior Court judge construed our statutes to require an affirmative answer to this question and granted summary judgment to the defendant municipality. We disagree with that conclusion and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>Seven year old Thomas Forbush was playing on a broken swing at the Keaney Playground, a facility owned and operated by the city of Lynn, on July 19, 1989. The playground was open to the public for recreational use without charge. While sliding down the broken swing chain, Thomas was impaled on a large hook at the end of the chain, which became embedded in his groin. His ten year old sister, Jennifer, responded to his screams as he dangled on the hook and helped him off the chain to medical assistance. In November, 1990, Thomas and Jennifer, by their mother and next friend, commenced suit against the city, after proper presentment. They alleged that the city\u2019s negligence in various respects relating to the operation of the playground had caused Thomas\u2019s physical injuries and both plaintiffs\u2019 emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The city answered and, on March, 2, 1991, moved for summary judgment. The bases of the motion were the so-called recreational use statute, G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the Supreme Judicial Court\u2019s decision in <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Springfield, </em>406 Mass. 632 (1990). <em>Anderson </em>had held that \u00a7 17C applied to municipalities and other governmental entities to the same extent as to private landowners. <em>Id. </em>at 634. While acknowledging its responsibility for maintaining and operating the playground, the city nonetheless contended that it was entitled to summary judgment under \u00a7 17C because the plaintiffs had not alleged any wilful, wanton or reckless conduct (the \u00a7 17C liability standard) on the city\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Hurriedly filing a motion to amend their complaint to add such an allegation, the plaintiffs also opposed the city\u2019s mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>tion with extracts from depositions of two city employees involved in operation of the playground. The depositions indicated that sometime in June, 1989, a playground \u201cinstructor\u201d had, as part of his duties, inspected and assessed the condition of the playground. At that time the instructor had filed a report of his findings with his superiors in the appropriate city department charged with repairing or replacing damaged playground equipment. His report had specifically included, among other unsafe conditions, the defective swing on which Thomas subsequently was injured. No effort was thereafter undertaken by any city employee to repair or replace the swing or post any warning.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">After hearing, the judge allowed the city\u2019s summary judgment motion, superscribing thereon the handwritten notation: \u201c[I]t appearing that [G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17,] applies and there can be no recovery for wilful, wanton and reckless conduct under [c.] 258.\u201d Implicit in the judge\u2019s determination appear to be (a) a ruling that the plaintiffs had sufficiently alleged, or could properly allege on the evidence presented, that the city acted wilfully, wantonly or recklessly with respect to the faulty swing<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (b) a legal conclusion that the city was nonetheless immune because its actions as alleged were the equivalent of an \u201cintentional tort,\u201d for which there is no liability under the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act, G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10(c).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiffs appeal from the judge\u2019s implicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>conclusion that a municipality\u2019s \u201cwilful, wanton or reckless\u201d conduct is excluded as a basis for liability under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">We agree with the plaintiffs\u2019 contention that \u201creckless\u201d conduct<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> should not be equated with the intentional torts which \u00a7 10(c) exempts from the coverage of the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act. It is true that <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass. 383 (1944), relied upon by the city, contains the frequently quoted observations that \u201c[t]he essence of wanton or reckless conduct is intentional conduct\u201d and \u201c[w]anton or reckless conduct is the legal equivalent of intentional conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399, 401. See, e.g., <em>Tilton </em>v. <em>Franklin, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 110, 112 (1987). No Massachusetts appellate decision, however, has expressly declared that reckless tortious conduct causing harm to another constitutes, per se, an intentional tort falling within the \u00a7 10(c) exclusion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">Such an equation would be inappropriate in this case for several reasons. First, we have been enjoined to read the intentional tort exception of the Massachusetts Tort Claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Act narrowly against public entities asserting it. See <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Blandford, </em>402 Mass. 831, 837-838 (1988); Oriz v. <em>Hampden, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 138, 138-140 (1983). This principle of restricting the scope of exclusions from the Act flows from the Legislature\u2019s original instruction that the provisions of the Act be \u201cconstrued liberally.\u201d St. 1978, c. 512, \u00a7 18. Liberal construction of the Act was mandated in order to achieve its overriding dual purposes: eradicating the logically indefensible doctrine of sovereign immunity and replacing it with a statutory mechanism that facilitated recovery by plaintiffs with valid causes of action against government tortfeasors. See <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>392 Mass. 745, 768-769 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Revealed through the lens of liberal construction would be Massachusetts law\u2019s recognition of the difference between the intention to commit an act which involves a high degree of likelihood that substantial harm may result to another (reckless misconduct) and the intention to cause that harm (intentional misconduct). The Restatement of Torts has usefully delineated that distinction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-6\"><em>\u201cIntentional misconduct and recklessness contrasted. </em>Reckless misconduct differs from intentional wrongdoing in a very important particular. While an act to be reckless must be intended by the actor, the actor does not intend to cause the harm which results from it. It is enough that he realizes or, from facts which he knows, should realize that there is a strong probability that harm may result, even though he hopes or even expects that his conduct will prove harmless. However, a strong probability is a different thing from the substantial certainty without which he cannot be said to intend the harm in which his act results.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 500 comment f (1964). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welansky, </em>316 Mass. at 399; <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Goriansky, </em>321 Mass. 200, 204 (1947). See also Restate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>ment (Second) of Torts \u00a7 8A comment b; Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts \u00a7 8, at 36, &amp; \u00a7 34, at 212 (5th ed. 1984).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Most pertinently, the distinction between an \u201cintentional tort\u201d and \u201cwilful\u201d wrongdoing is reflected in the Massachusetts Tort Claims Act itself. See G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 9. It is a discrimination that is consistent with legislative practice. In creating and modifying liabilities and immunities, the Legislature has been differentially precise in specifying when it wanted standards of liability to be based on \u201cintentional\u201d conduct, see G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 85S(c), 85V, &amp; 85W, rather than on \u201cwilful, wanton or reckless\u201d conduct, as in \u00a7\u00a7 85K, 85R, &amp; 85T; or on \u201cgross negligence\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 85V &amp; 85W); or on \u201cordinary negligence\u201d (\u00a7 85L).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Under our principles of statutory interpretation, we must, therefore, be differentially precise in according discrete, and not identical, meanings to the several standards in construing our statutes as a consistent, harmonious body of law. See <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessor of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 513-514 (1976); <em>Catlin </em>v. <em>Board of Registration of Architects, </em>414 Mass. 1, 4-5 (1992); <em>Healey </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>414 Mass. 18, 24-25 (1993); <em>Marco </em>v. <em>Green, </em>415 Mass. 732, 735-736 (1993). Such precise differentiation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>is particularly appropriate in order to implement the beneficial and remedial purposes intended by the Legislature in enacting c. 258. See <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Solomon, </em>385 Mass. 91, 100 (1982); <em>Dover </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Water Resources Authy., </em>414 Mass. 274, 278-280 (1993).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">The previously unexamined consequences of the judge\u2019s ruling dramatically highlight the unacceptability of treating reckless municipal conduct as falling within the intentional tort exclusion. It is paradoxical enough that the applicability of \u00a7 17C to public landowners creates an anomalous distinction between child users of public land \u2014 a municipality enjoys a substantially lesser degree of responsibility (refraining from reckless conduct) for the protection of children lawfully playing on public recreational land which they have been affirmatively encouraged to use than it does for the protection of trespassing children who illegally invade \u201cnonrecreational\u201d property owned by the municipality, the essential characteristics of which land may be substantially similar if not identical.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>, <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The judge\u2019s overlay of the intentional tort exclusion of \u00a7 10(c) onto his application of \u00a7 17C to these circumstances, however, aggravates that unfortunate dichotomy. It renders public landowners who gratuitously allow, or even invite, the use of public lands wholly immune from the liability to such users \u2014 however youthful, inexperienced and trusting \u2014 to which all other landowners are exposed. Such a drastic, sweeping and (we would warrant) unantici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>pated consequence to the public of exercising their privilege of using public property for its intended public purposes cannot have been contemplated by either the Legislature or <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Springfield, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em>\u2019 </em><footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">To paraphrase Justice Quirico (when rejecting the claim of immunity by a landowner who refused to assist a helplessly trapped trespasser): \u201cIt should not be, it cannot be, and surely it is not now the law of this Commonwealth that the [public land] owner ... is rewarded with immunity from liability [in these circumstances] .... [I] t is unthinkable to have [such] a rule ... [in light of the] recognition by the law of the ever changing concepts of each individual\u2019s rights and duties in relation to all other members of our society, and . . . current standards of concern for the personal safety and well being of each individual.\u201d <em>Pridgen </em>v. <em>Boston Hous. Authy., </em>364 Mass. 696, 711 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The novel rule of absolute immunity inadvertently created by the judge\u2019s juxtaposition of G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C, and G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10(c), falls within that rubric. Fortunately, it is not compelled by the statutory language; it is inconsistent with the appropriate construction of those statutes and would be contrary to public policy in significantly undermining the salutary legislative purposes behind each statute. See <em>Sheehan </em>v. <em>Goriansky, </em>321 Mass. at 204; St. 1972, c. 575; House No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>5004 (December 1971) (Special Report of the Department of Natural Resources Relative to Public Recreation on Private, County and Municipal Lands as Relates to the Problem of Landowners\u2019 Liability); Senate No. 1136 (Jan. 24, 1967) (Legislative Research Council Report Relative to Public Recreation on Private Lands and Landowners\u2019 Liability).</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">For these several reasons, we conclude that the plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the city falling within the recreational use statute, G. L. c. 21, \u00a7 17C, are not barred by the intentional tort exception contained in G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 10(c). The judgment is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b727-7\">General Laws c. 21, \u00a7 17C, as inserted by St. 1972, c. 575, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-8\">\u201cAn owner of land who permits the public to use such land for recreational purposes without imposing a charge or fee therefor, or who leases his land for said purposes to the commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof <em>shall not be liable to any member of the public </em>who uses said land for the aforesaid purposes for injuries to person or property sustained by him while on said land <em>in the absence of wilful, wanton or reckless conduct by such owner, </em>nor shall such permission be deemed to confer upon any person so using said land the status of an invitee or licensee to whom any duty would be owed by said owner. . . .\u201d (Emphases added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b728-6\">By the judge\u2019s implicit recognition of the propriety of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to amend their complaint to include allegations of the city\u2019s wilful, wanton or reckless conduct, he appears to have rejected the city\u2019s objection below that the amendment was improper because the plaintiffs\u2019 presentment letter did not state a claim against the city based on such conduct. Although the city\u2019s appellate brief contains one sentence stating the fact of the allegedly defective presentment, the city presented no legal argument regarding the subject either to the judge or on appeal, and we need not address the issue.
