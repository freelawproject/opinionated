Quegan was convicted on two indictments charging forcible rape of his daughter, Deborah,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in 1982 and in 1983, when she was four and five years old, respectively.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His principal contention on appeal is that he was prejudicially denied his right to present a defense by the judge\u2019s refusal to permit him to cross-examine Deborah\u2019s maternal grandmother, Virginia Van Horne,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> about two prior accusations by Mrs. Van Horne of sexual abuse of Deborah by two other family members. We find no merit in this or Quegan\u2019s other appellate arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">Following a violent confrontation over Quegan\u2019s visitation rights in May, 1984, during which Quegan physically assaulted Deborah and others,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Deborah began, initially at the behest of the Probate Court, seeing family therapists on a regular basis. Starting in January, 1985, she gradually revealed to caseworkers and therapists facts indicating that her father had sexually abused her. By April, 1985, Deborah had disclosed that, in the course of visitations at her father\u2019s home, she used to take showers with Quegan, during which \u201che told me to touch his pee pee and then he peed on me\u201d; that similar incidents occurred in Quegan\u2019s bed; that \u201cthis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>happened with my daddy every time I saw him\u201d; that on one occasion Quegan \u201ctold me to put his pee pee in my mouth. It was runny. Then he licked my pee pee\u201d; that Quegan told her \u201che had a gun . . . [and] was going to shoot her head off if she told anybody\u201d; that she was terrified Quegan would break into her house to find her; and that she hated him.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Indicted as a result of these disclosures, Quegan filed a motion in limine seeking to allow his counsel \u201cto inquire into [false] allegations [by Mrs. Van Horne] of sexual abuse of the alleged victim by one Kirk Littlefield and Michael Logan.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the hearing on the motion, Quegan\u2019s counsel explained that the purpose of the intended evidence was to establish bias and motive on the part of Mrs. Van Horne, on the theory that she was a vindictive liar who had manipulated Deborah into making false charges against Quegan as part of Mrs. Van Horne\u2019s efforts to wrest Deborah away from her parents, whom Mrs. Van Horne considered unfit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The motion judge (who was also the trial judge) denied Quegan\u2019s motion on the ground of lack of relevance. He repeated his ruling when Quegan\u2019s counsel sought reconsideration during cross-examination of Mrs. Van Horne and again when Quegan sought a postsentence stay pending appeal.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>The judge\u2019s exclusion of the evidence of the prior accusations was not erroneous. The determination whether evidence is legally relevant is within the discretion of the trial judge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chasson, </em>383 Mass. 183, 187 (1981). Determining whether relevant evidence demonstrates bias also falls within that discretion. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavelle, </em>414 Mass. 146, 153 (1993). Although a criminal defendant has a right to reasonable cross-examination of a material witness for the purpose of showing bias, the \u201ctrial judge . . . retains the discretion to appraise ,the materiality of the testimony sought to be introduced.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Huertas, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 939, 941 (1993), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. 935, 936-937 (1983). Quegan has failed to demonstrate abuse of discretion by the judge in any respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">In the first place, Mrs. Van Horne was not a key witness against Quegan. She testified as a fresh complaint witness; her testimony was limited to corroborating Deborah\u2019s disclosures. Consequently, her credibility was not the critical issue at trial. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>382 Mass. 222, 230 (1981), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stockhammer, </em>409 Mass. 867, 876 (1991) (the complainant witness\u2019s credibility was of critical importance, since she was the sole witness on the central issue of consent to sexual intercourse); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Piedra, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 155, 156, 158 (1985) (witness whose bias defendant sought to show was \u201cthe key prosecution witness,\u201d whose \u201ccredibility . . . was \u2018essential to the proof of the defendant\u2019s guilt\u2019 \u201d); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pyne, ante </em>36, 39-40 (1993) (defendant prevented from questioning alleged victim about prior false accusation in similar circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">Notwithstanding the defense theory that the evidence was relevant to show Mrs. Van Horne\u2019s \u201cproclivity for trafficking in accusations of child molestation . : . as a strategic device in her efforts to secure custody of\u2019 her grandchildren, Quegan presented no evidence that the excluded accusations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>had ever actually been so used. Indeed, he did not even offer any evidence supporting his implicit contention that Mrs. Van Horne had in fact used Deborah\u2019s charges of his sexual molestation in resisting his 1984 attempt to secure her custody for himself. Nor was there any evidence adduced at trial indicating that Mrs. Van Horne had put Deborah up to making false accusations against Quegan. Any logical predicate or nexus for the relevance of the excluded evidence was thus conspicuously absent, beyond tenuous, speculative assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Most significantly, Quegan has lost sight of the principle that \u201c[w]ithout evidence of [their] falsity, the [prior] statements [about sexual abuse attributed to Mrs. Van Horne] became irrelevant to any issue in the case, including the credibility of the\u201d witness. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherry, </em>386 Mass. 682, 692 (1982). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>412 Mass. 664, 675-676 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lefko-witz, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 513, 515-516 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 487, 490-492 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rathburn, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 699, 710 (1988). Quegan has cited no Massachusetts authority to the contrary.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The record is devoid of any evidence warranting a legitimate inference, let alone a finding, of the falsity of Mrs. Van Horne\u2019s alleged previous accusations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Quegan has also overlooked the fact that, \u201c[i]f a defendant believes that the judge improperly restrained his cross-examination of a witness [with respect to bias], the defendant must demonstrate that the judge abused his discretion <em>and that he was prejudiced by such restraint.\u201d Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnes, </em>399 Mass. 385, 393 (1987) (emphasis added). Here, the judge\u2019s ruling did not preclude exploration of the subject of Mrs. Van Horne\u2019s bias against Quegan and any motives she may have had to make adverse statements about him \u2014 even though such issues were not, contrary to Quegan\u2019s perfervid rhetoric, crucial to his cause.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Quegan\u2019s counsel successfully established such bias and motive in his cross-examination of Mrs. Van Horne and in his direct examination of Quegan. His efforts included eliciting her personal dislike of Quegan; her long-held suspicions of his deviant behavior; her repeated references to his \u201clying\u201d; her persistent efforts to obtain and retain custody of Deborah and her other grandchildren, in vehement opposition to their parents; and her allegedly corrupt motives in seeking to rid herself of Quegan, involving her acquisition of title to Quegan\u2019s former home and her supposed desire to control the proceeds of a tort action settlement placed in trust for Deborah. Moreover, the jury, urged by the judge and counsel to apply their common sense and experience to the evidence, had to have been acutely aware of Mrs. Van Horne\u2019s animosity toward the man who had, as she perceived it, ruined her daughter, repeatedly molested her granddaughter, and violently battered most of her family.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>In light of the extensive eduction of evidence limning Mrs. Van Horne\u2019s attitudes in ways that plainly raised the issues of her bias and hostile motivation toward Quegan and unmistakably impugned her credibility, any error in refusing to admit the prior accusations, even if it amounted to an abuse of discretion, was not prejudicial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>377 Mass. 1, 8 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elder, </em>389 Mass. 743, 749-751 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lavelle, </em>414 Mass. at 154; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>16 Mass. App. Ct. at 937; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McNickles, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 114, 117-119 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Heath, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 437, 444-445 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Quegan\u2019s other appellate issues require little discussion. Mrs. Van Horne\u2019s description of Deborah\u2019s disclosures was not inadmissible hearsay, but rather was properly admissible fresh complaint testimony which did not exceed the limits of corroboration.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It accurately recited what Deborah had said and done. It did not fill in any substantive gaps in the prosecution\u2019s case. It did not reveal other acts of sexual misconduct by Quegan. It did not involve needless repetition of inflammatory details. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. 654, 656-660 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Scanlon, </em>412 Mass. at 669-670; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caracino, </em>33 Mass. App. Ct. 787, 791-792 (1993). The judge carefully instructed the jury, both at the time of its admission and again during his charge, as to the limited corroborative purposes of such evidence, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Licata, </em>412 Mass. at 660, which admonitions the jury are presumed to have understood and followed. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>406 Mass. 581, 588 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Finally, Quegan\u2019s contention that the prosecutor prejudi-cially smeared his character, by unfair cross-examination re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>garding Quegan\u2019s role as a parent designed to portray him as despicably neglectful, irresponsible and greedy, is groundless. The judge sustained every objection Quegan\u2019s counsel made to such questions. At no time did his counsel move to strike allegedly offensive or inadmissible remarks or seek curative instructions regarding them. The prosecutor properly sought to explore such subjects \u2014 by questioning directly responsive to Quegan\u2019s testimonial self-description as a loving, doting father whose parental rights were callously undermined by Mrs. Van Horne and her husband \u2014 to show Quegan\u2019s actual attitude and state of mind during the relevant time period. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trapp, </em>396 Mass. 202, 206 (1985). Such evidence was also pertinent to show \u201cthe \u2018entire relationship\u2019 between the victim and the defendant.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, </em>397 Mass. 65, 79 (1986), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Young, </em>382 Mass. 448, 463 (1981). In any event, any prosecutorial transgressions were not egregious, and any resulting error was harmless. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cokonougher, </em>32 Mass. App. Ct. 54, 58-61 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>34 Mass. App. Ct. 131, 132-133 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b160-9\">A pseudonym.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b160-10\">The defendant and Deborah\u2019s mother, Victoria, had divorced in 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b160-11\">Mrs. Van Horne, as of 1982, was guardian and had legal custody of Deborah.

After being told that Deborah could not go out because she had a fever, Quegan became belligerent, then violent, throwing his ex-wife across a table, choking her and repeatedly striking her in the face; grabbing, then dropping, Deborah on her head while she cried and screamed, injuring her eye; pushing and shoving another daughter; and kicking Mrs. Van Horne in the head, breaking her glasses. Quegan pleaded guilty to criminal assault and battery charges that arose from this incident, after which he ceased to have visitation rights.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b161-6\">Michael Logan is a fictitious name because this accused person was at the time, and remains, a minor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b161-7\">A psychiatrist examining Deborah in July, 1984, took a family history from Mrs. Van Horne and recorded in his notes that Mrs. Van Horne reported that Kirk Littlefield, a twenty-five year old son of Deborah\u2019s mother\u2019s live-in boyfriend, had once molested Deborah and was convicted of molesting an eleven year old girl. Littlefield was in fact prosecuted for, and pleaded guilty to, molesting Deborah\u2019s half-sister. At Quegan\u2019s probable cause hearing in August, 1986, Deborah testified that Littlefield had put his hand on her \u201cbum\u201d and said that she had once told her grandmother that he had touched her \u201cpee pee.\u201d The second allegation was that Mrs. Van Horne, in April, 1984, told a Department of Social Servic\u00e9s caseworker that Michael Logan, the nine year old son of Quegan\u2019s then-fiancee, had put his hand in Deborah\u2019s \u201cbum.\u201d Deborah, when questioned about this, confirmed to the caseworker that the boy had put his hand on her \u201cbum\u201d over her clothes. The caseworker told Deborah to tell the boy not to do it again and to inform adults if he did.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b161-8\">The judge also cited, as a \u201csecondary] .. . alternative, additional, independent ground\u201d for his denial, the \u201crape shield statute,\u201d G. L. c. 233, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>\u00a7 21B. The Commonwealth on appeal does not rely on that statute as a ground for upholding the judge\u2019s exclusion of the proffered evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b163-6\"><em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Joyce, </em>382 Mass. 222, 230 (1981), Quegan\u2019s principal case on this issue, is distinguishable and does not support, but rather undercuts, his position. There the defendant, accused by the complainant of rape, asserted that the intercourse had been consensual and sought to introduce the complainant\u2019s arrest record for prostitution in order to establish her motivation to accuse the defendant falsely of rape to avoid further prosecution. In <em>Joyce, </em>unlike the instant case, the credibility of the witness sought to be impeached (the complainant) was critical, she being the sole witness on the issue of lack of consent, and the impeaching evidence was uncontestably accurate. Moreover, the rationale of the decision was reflected in the court\u2019s observation that \u201cThe right to cross-examine a complainant in a rape case to show a <em>false </em>accusation may be the last refuge of an innocent defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229. (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Assuming that Mrs. Van Horne had made such accusations (at least one of which she denied), they were essentially corroborated by Little-field\u2019s conviction, Deborah\u2019s statements to her therapists, and Deborah\u2019s probable cause testimony. See <em>supra, </em>note 6.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Quegan\u2019s effort to establish prejudice consists almost entirely of conclusory, impassioned declarations, such as \u201cthe exclusion of the evidence of Mrs. Van Horne\u2019s history of trafficking in accusations of child molestation . . . almost certainly doomed the defendant\u201d; \u201cthe rulings \u2018cut the heart out of the defense,\u2019 \u201d; \u201c[the] case . . . turned entirely on [Mrs. Van Horne\u2019s] credibility, [and] the judge\u2019s rulings unfairly deprived the defendant of his only effective means for demonstrating a basis to doubt the truthfulness of the charges\u201d; and \u201cthe entire defense turned\u201d on proof of Mrs. Van Horne\u2019s bias and credibility.
