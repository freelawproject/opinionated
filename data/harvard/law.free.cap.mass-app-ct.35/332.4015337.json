The fire engine was manufactured by FMC Corporation (FMC) and sold by Woodward Spring Shop, Inc. (Woodward). Chandler brought an action in the Superior Court against FMC and Woodward alleging negligence and breach of warranties in the design and sale of an allegedly defective side climbing system on the fire engine. Chandler claimed that a step on the side of the fire engine was too small to afford proper balance for a person climbing up the side of the fire engine. Chandler\u2019s wife and their minor children brought separate claims for loss of consortium. Prior to trial, the plaintiffs dismissed their claims against Woodward and their negligence count against FMC.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>The matter was tried before a Superior Court judge and a jury. For reasons not apparent on the record, the judge decided, at the start of the trial, to set time limits on all the witnesses\u2019 testimony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result, the following discussions occurred at the bench during the direct examination of the plaintiff Chandler:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">Judge: \u201cYou have two minutes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel: \u201cThat\u2019s a total of forty-five minutes, your honor, for the plaintiff?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"alf-dedup-0\">Judge: \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Atq\">Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel: \u201cWould you note my objection, your honor?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"age-dedup-0\">Judge: \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-12\">During cross-examination of Chandler, FMC\u2019s counsel was informed by the judge that \u201c[y]ou have another eight minutes, you know.\u201d Later, FMC\u2019s counsel was summoned to the bench where the following occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-13\">Judge: \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-14\">FMC\u2019S Counsel: \u201cCould I just state for the record, your honor, that there [are] a number of other avenues of inquiry into which I would go if I had the time, and I\u2019d like to object to your cutting me off at this point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHN\">Judge: \u201cI told you how much time you had, and you\u2019ve gone over it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel: \u201cMay I have an opportunity for redirect, your honor?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aa_z\">\u201cSure.\u201d Judge:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad2\">\u201cHow much time?\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7Z\">\u201cTen minutes.\u201d Judge:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">After the evidence on the liability aspect of the claim had concluded, the judge announced to the jury, \u201cFor reasons of the court\u2019s schedule, I am what they call bifurcating the case, that is, I\u2019m going to put liability to you separately from damages.\u201d In his remarks, the judge also informed the jury that \u201c[i]f you find liability for the plaintiff, then the second stage of the case will open up, and we will have additional evidence on the matter of all the damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">Before the liability issue was submitted to the jury, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a \u201cdirected verdict\u201d on the <em>Cor-reia </em>defense issue. In <em>Correia </em>v. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co., </em>388 Mass. 342, 355 (1983), the Supreme Judicial Court ruled that, where a plaintiff asserts a personal injury claim based on a breach of implied warranty of merchantability, a defendant may raise as an affirmative defense that the plaintiff is barred from recovery because he violated a duty \u201cto act reasonably with respect to a product which he knows to be defective and dangerous\u201d and that the plaintiffs conduct was the cause of the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-13\">According to the plaintiffs, FMC was not entitled to a jury instruction on the <em>Correia </em>defense because (1) there was no evidence offered by FMC that would support a <em>Correia </em>instruction, (2) FMC failed to plead the affirmative defense in its answer, and (3) FMC failed to supplement its answers to interrogatories relative to the defense. The judge denied the motion, stating that Mass.R.Civ.P. 15(b), 365 Mass. 761 (1974), \u201cwill allow [the amendment] on this evidence.\u201d The judge then instructed the jury, among other things, that Chandler could not recover if FMC met its burden of proving that \u201cChandler actually knew that the product he was using was defective and dangerous\u201d and that he \u201cacted unreasonably in using the product.\u201d In accordance with his in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>struction, the judge submitted special questions on the <em>Cor-reia </em>defense for the jury to answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The special questions submitted to the jury were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">\u201c1. Did FMC . . . breach any warranties which caused an injury to Carleton Chandler?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AE8\">_Yes_No</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMs\">2. (a) Did Carleton Chandler know the product to be defective and dangerous?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFq\">Yes No</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ammx\">(b) If the answer to 2(a) is \u2018yes\u2019, did he then proceed voluntarily and unreasonably to use the product?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"abe-dedup-0\">Yes No</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHg\">(c) If the answer to 2(b) is also \u2018yes\u2019, did Carleton Chandler\u2019s actions cause his injury?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af_\">Yes No\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-16\">The jury answered all the questions in the affirmative, thereby finding that FMC had been in breach of warranties but that Chandler knew the product to be defective and dangerous and had proceeded voluntarily and unreasonably to use it. Finally, the jury found that Chandler\u2019s actions caused his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-17\">Although the jury\u2019s answers to the special questions were in favor of FMC on the liability issue, the judge decided, over FMC\u2019s objection, to allow the trial to continue on the issue of damages. At a bench conference, the judge informed the lawyers for the parties that the trial should proceed because he had \u201csome . . . problems\u201d with the adequacy of the evidence concerning the <em>Correia </em>issue and he wanted the reviewing court to have \u201ceverything\u201d before it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-18\">The trial proceeded on the damages issue in accordance with the judge\u2019s decision. After the parties concluded their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>presentation of the evidence on the matter, the judge instructed the jury on the law of damages. He specifically instructed the jury not to take into account any evidence of liability when considering the damages issue. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Chandler in the amount of $12,262.58. The jury found in favor of FMC in regard to Chandler\u2019s wife and children\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">After the verdicts on damages were returned, the parties filed various motions. The plaintiffs filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the liability issue and a motion for new trial on the damages issue only. Mass.R.Civ.P. 59(a), 365 Mass. 827 (1974). In regard to the latter motion, the plaintiffs also filed a motion for an additur. FMC filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, for a new trial in regard to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>jury\u2019s finding that FMC had committed a breach of its warranty. FMC claimed, among other things, that there was no evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">After considering the various motions, the judge reversed his previous ruling that the <em>Correia </em>defense issue was a matter to be decided by the jury and instead ruled that the issue should not have been submitted to the jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The judge then allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and ordered judgment to enter in favor of Chandler for $12,262.58 on his breach of warranty claim. He denied the remaining motions of both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">On appeal, the plaintiffs claim, among other things, that they are entitled to a new trial on the issue of damages because the judge improperly imposed time limits on the testimony of the witnesses. FMC filed a cross appeal claiming that the judge committed error in granting the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the liability issue. It claims, among other things, that sufficient evidence had been presented on the <em>Correia </em>defense to have it submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">The question of the propriety of a trial judge imposing time limits on witnesses\u2019 testimony appears to be a matter of first impression in the Commonwealth. We therefore write on a clean slate.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>\u201cThe judge\u2019s function at any trial is to be \u2018the directing and controlling mind at the trial ....\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sapoznik, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 236, 241 n.4 (1990), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>381 Mass. 90, 118 (1980), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>346 Mass. 373, 379 (1963), cert. denied, 376 U.S. 933 (1964). An important part of the judge\u2019s function is to ensure that the trial always moves forward, without needless consumption of time and, \u201cwithout repetitions and without diversions into collateral or disconnected matters.\u201d <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Ashkins, 266 </em>Mass. 374, 380 (1929). In that regard, a judge has wide discretion to impose reasonable limits on the length of the direct and cross-examination of witnesses. <em>Id. </em>at 379-380. However, the limits must be reasonable; they must not prevent a party from presenting its entire case to the fact finder. <em>Id. </em>at 380, citing <em>Union Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Magenis, 266 </em>Mass. 363, 365 (1929).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Here, the judge imposed arbitrary time limits on the witnesses\u2019 testimony. As a result, the record clearly shows that the judge prevented the parties from presenting their entire case to the jury, both on the liability issue and damages. The judge, therefore, abused his discretion, and that error infected the entire trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\u201cThe ascertainment of facts having probative force on the issues, nothing more and nothing less, is the whole object of a trial in court.\u201d <em>Goldman </em>v. <em>Ashkins, supra </em>at 379. That objective is thwarted by the arbitrary imposition of time limits on witnesses\u2019 testimony. For well over a century, trial judges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>in the Commonwealth have been able to control the flow of testimony at trials without the imposition of time limits. We do not see any reason for the adoption of such means now.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The judgments are reversed. The matter is remanded to the Superior Court for a new trial on all the issues contained in the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b363-17\">Although nothing in the record gives the judge\u2019s reasons for the imposition of time limits on the witnesses\u2019 testimony, according to the plaintiffs\u2019 brief, the judge placed time limits because, when the case was called for trial, there were only three days remaining in the session. Despite the parties\u2019 estimate of a two-week trial, it was completed in three days.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b365-19\">At the bench conference, FMC\u2019s counsel argued that, if there was insufficient evidence on the <em>Correia </em>issue, it was caused by the time limits the judge had imposed on the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-20\">The discussion on the matter was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Judge: \u201cAs I indicated, I had some [Mass.R.Civ.P.] 50(b) problems with the adequacy of the evidence on [special questions] 2A, B and C. I\u2019ll put the issue of damages to the jury. Then when that issue comes in, [they] will have everything on appeal to be resolved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AI6\">FMC\u2019S Counsel: \u201cExcuse me, your Honor. This is a case where you limited my cross-examination of the plaintiff to thirty minutes. Obviously, I \u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9s\">Judge: \u201cNo. I limited it to forty minutes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AbjI\">FMC\u2019s Counsel: \u201cI believe that\u2019s incorrect, your Honor. I had to make some difficult decisions as to what lines of examination to pursue on that because I knew I couldn\u2019t get everything I needed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIE\">Judge: \u201cQuid ad punctum?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUv\">FMC\u2019S Counsel: \u201cExcuse me?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiJE\">Judge: \u201cQuid ad punctum? What\u2019s the point of what you\u2019re saying?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVG\">FMC\u2019s Counsel: \u201cThe point is that had I been given ample time to cross-examine [Chandler], there would have been more evidence on [special] question 2, and, therefore, whatever issues there are at this point as to the \u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ays-dedup-0\">Judge: \u201cThe reviewing court can judge for itself whether you wisely spent the time allocated to you in the cross-examination.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b367-8\">Although the discussion between the parties\u2019 attorneys and the judge take up eighteen pages of transcript, it is not entirely clear on what grounds the judge based his decision to grant the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. We have previously alluded to the judge\u2019s comments concerning the \u201cproblems\u201d he had with the adequacy of the evidence introduced by FMC on the <em>Correia </em>defense issue (see note 3, <em>supra). </em>Before granting the plaintiffs\u2019 motion, the judge also discussed with both counsel his concerns with FMC\u2019s failure to plead the <em>Correia </em>defense in its answer and also its failure to supplement its answers to interrogatories in regard to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">From our reading of the record, it appears that FMC did not introduce sufficient evidence on the <em>Correia </em>defense issue. That failure may be attributable to the time limits imposed by the judge (see note 3, <em>supra). </em>In any event, at the new trial, FMC may introduce relevant evidence on the <em>Correia </em>defense issue. The sufficiency of that evidence is to be considered by the trial judge presiding at the new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Undoubtedly because the plaintiffs prevailed on the liability issue as a result of the judge\u2019s allowance of their motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, on appeal, they have requested a new trial on damages only because of the imposition of time limits. FMC has not requested a new trial on liability, which is somewhat surprising considering its vigorous objections to the imposition of time limits at the trial. Our examination of the record clearly shows, however, that the parties did not receive a fair trial because of the imposition of time limits, and we have granted a new trial on both the liability and damages issue. Cf. <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Lowell Sun Publishing Co., </em>404 Mass. 9, 11 (1989). This result is consistent with our conclusion that the relief sought by each party would not be fair to the other party.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
