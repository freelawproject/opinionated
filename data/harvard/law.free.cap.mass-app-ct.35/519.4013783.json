The plan depicted Rockville Avenue as an east-west street, running from Philip Road on the west to Swan Lane on the east and intersected by William Avenue (shown on later plans as Davis Road). Four adjacent lots shown on that plan (67, 68, 69, and 70), located at the southeast cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>ner of the intersection and fronting on Rockville Avenue, were conveyed to the plaintiff by deed in 1978. In 1978, the plaintiff submitted a plan to the planning board showing lots 67 and most of 68 combined as a new lot 1 and the remainder of lot 68 and all of lots 69 and 70 combined as a new lot 2. Lots 1 and 2 were shown as having frontage on Rockville Avenue of, respectively, 122.2 feet and 125 feet. The plan was endorsed as not requiring approval under the Subdivision Control Law. See G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 8IP. In 1991 the plaintiff, having apparently conveyed the corner lot, lot 1, with a house to one Heitman, was granted registration of lot 2 by decree of the Land Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">In 1980 the plaintiff applied for a building permit for lot 2. This was denied by the building commissioner on the ground that the portion of Rockville Avenue on which the lot fronted was not considered to be a street. The board of appeals affirmed the denial, rejecting the argument by plaintiff\u2019s counsel that the planning board\u2019s endorsement of \u201capproval not required,\u201d with no indication on the plan that lot 2 lacked the requisite frontage (125 feet) on a street to be a buildable lot under the zoning by-law, should bind the town for zoning purposes, at least as to the lot\u2019s having frontage on a street. In the Superior Court, the plaintiff sought and obtained a partial summary judgment declaring that \u201cRockville Avenue is a way approved pursuant to [the] Subdivision Control Law by operation of [G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 8IFF].\u201d This was not a final judgment, not carrying the finding prescribed by Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(b), 365 Mass. 821 (1974), and the judge who undertook to complete the case in effect reversed the partial summary judgment and affirmed the decision of the board. The plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">It is uncontested that Rockville Avenue is a paved road with houses in the section that runs from Swan Lane west to the plaintiff\u2019s lot line, including the first ten feet in front of his lot. The paving stops at that point, and Rockville Avenue becomes a path, some fifteen feet in width, wooded on both sides, with boulders and ledge outcroppings, descending at an increasingly steep slope (starting at eight and one-half per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>cent, reaching thirteen and one-half percent at the plaintiffs west lot line, and reaching nineteen and one-half percent thereafter) to the Davis Road intersection. The relatively short portion of Rockville Avenue from Davis Road west to Philip Road is paved and sidewalked. Plainly the short unpaved section of Rockville Avenue that borders the plaintiffs lot and lot 1 is not suitable <em>in fact </em>for vehicular travel, except perhaps by four-wheel drive, all-terrain vehicles during non winter months.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The Lexington zoning by-law requires frontage on a \u201cstreet.\u201d The by-law definition of \u201cstreet\u201d tracks the wording of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81L, defining \u201csubdivision\u201d to exclude divisions which show every resulting lot to have the requisite frontage for buildability on <em>(a) </em>a public way, (6) a way shown on a previously approved subdivision plan, or (c) a way that predates subdivision control that has, in the planning board\u2019s opinion, width, grades, and construction suitable and adequate for vehicular traffic and the installation of utilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The plaintiffs argument centers on <em>(b): </em>his contention is that his 125 plus<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> feet of frontage on Rockville Avenue is frontage on a \u201cstreet,\u201d as required by the Lexington zoning by-law, because Rockville Avenue has the status of a way shown on an approved subdivision plan. To be sure (as he recognizes), the planning board has never in fact approved a plan incorporating the portion of Rockville Avenue east of Davis Road (G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 81U), but it has, on two occasions, endorsed such plans as not requiring approval under the Subdivision Control Law (G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 8IP).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> His argument is that, under \u00a7 8IFF, when he obtained registration of his lot, shown as bounded by Rockville Avenue, his plan became \u201cfor the purposes of the subdivision control law [one] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>deemed to be, and . . . invested with all the rights and privileges of, a plan approved pursuant to said law.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ake\">The operation of that sentence is not altogether clear, because the court is required under \u00a7 81FF to verify only that a plan of subdivision either has been approved by the planning board \u201cor would otherwise be entitled ... to be recorded in the registry of deeds.\u201d A plan endorsed \u201capproval not required\u201d under \u00a7 81P is entitled to recordation under the first paragraph of \u00a7 81X. If, as the plaintiff argues, registration elevates a \u00a7 81P endorsement to the level of a \u00a7 81U approval, it is clear from the express language of \u00a7 81FF that it does so only \u201cfor the purposes of the subdivision control law.\u201d At most, then, a registration under \u00a7 81FF, like a \u00a7 81P endorsement, gives the lots shown on the plan no standing as lawful lots under a zoning code. See <em>Smalley </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Harwich, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 599, 603 (1980), and cases cited; <em>Arrigo </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Franklin, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 802, 807 (1981); <em>Corrigan </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Brewster, ante </em>514 (1993). Even for purposes of the Subdivision Control Law, a planning board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>acts \u201cproperly [in] denying] an 81P endorsement because of inadequate access, despite technical compliance with frontage requirements, where access is nonexistent for the purposes set out in \u00a7 81M.\u201d <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Nantucket, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 144, 153 (1983) (plan showing frontage on two paper ways, one an unconstructed \u201cpublic way,\u201d the other shown on a Land Court plan but not constructed on the ground).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Not only for the good of the homeowner, but also for the safety of the public, a town can insist that homes not be built on lots lacking adequate access for fire trucks and emergency vehicles. Even if the plaintiffs argument is accepted and Rockville Avenue is in legal contemplation \u201ca way shown on a plan previously approved and endorsed in accordance with the subdivision control law,\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but see <em>Corrigan </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Brewster, supra </em>at 517, the section on which the plaintiffs lot fronts does not exist <em>in fact. A </em>fire truck cannot drive on a plan. A zoning by-law which requires frontage on a way shown on an approved plan must be understood, if the purpose of the by-law is not to be undermined, to require an <em>actual </em>way, constructed on the ground, not just a depiction of a way on a plan. The planning board\u2019s approval may have legal significance under the zoning by-law\u2019s definition of \u201cstreet\u201d if the way depicted on an approved plan has been constructed as approved (Rockville Avenue is shown on the assertedly approved plan as a way forty feet in width) but not where it has never been constructed at all. Compare <em>Richard </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Acushnet, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 216, 218-220 (1980); <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Nantucket, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. at 150-153, 154-155.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\"><em>Nasca </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Medway, </em>27 Mass. App. Ct. 47 (1989), should not be read as requiring zoning officials to give status to paper roads that appear on plans that have been endorsed under the Subdivision Control Law. In <em>Nasca </em>the court was confronted with a zoning by-law amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>passed by town meeting with the specific objective of qualifying Kadin Lane as a street for purposes of the frontage requirement of the zoning by-law. The amendment was inartis-tically drawn; to give it effect, the court read \u201ca way . . . shown on a plan approved by the [planning [bjoard\u201d to include \u201ca way approved by the planning board.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 49-54. Kadin Lane was so approved, as evidenced primarily by the planning board\u2019s having recommended the zoning amendment to the town meeting.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The building commissioner and the board of appeals were correct in withholding a building permit for the plaintiff\u2019s lot so long as the section of Rockville Avenue on which it fronts remains \u00fanconstructed.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b551-7\">A later plan shows the plaintiff\u2019s actual frontage as 129.25 feet.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b551-8\">In 1956 a couple named Yntas or Yntase registered lots on Rockville Avenue opposite the plaintiffs lot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The text of the second paragraph of \u00a7 81FF, as inserted by St. 1953, c. 674, \u00a7 7, reads in material part: \u201c[A]ny plan of a subdivision which has been registered or confirmed by said court before February first, nineteen hundred and fifty-two, whether the subdivision control law was in effect in the city or town in which the subdivision was located or not, and whether the plan of the subdivision was approved by the planning board or not, shall have the same validity in all respects as if said plan had been so approved, but the land court shall not register or confirm a plan of a subdivision . . . which has been filed on or after February first, nineteen hundred and fifty-two, unless it has first verified the fact that the plan filed with it has been approved by the planning board, or would otherwise be entitled if it had related to unregistered land, to be recorded in the registry of deeds.
