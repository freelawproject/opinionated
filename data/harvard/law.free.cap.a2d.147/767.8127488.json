The only error claimed is admission in evidence of appellant\u2019s confession. The claim is that the confession was illegally admitted because obtained while appellant was being held under an unlawful arrest. The claim of unlawful arrest is based on the fact that the arrest was without a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-21\">The evidence of the complaining witness justified a finding that on February 24, 1958, appellant entered the library of American University and took a wallet from complaining witness\u2019s purse while she was temporarily absent from her desk. Appellant was not apprehended until July 3, 1958, and his arrest occurred under the following circumstances. On that day a police officer who had been investigating reports of a number of thefts at the University and who had a \u201clook-out\u201d for a person answering appellant\u2019s description, received a radio call to investigate a housebreaking in the library of the University. As he and his fellow officer drove up to the University they were told by a young lady\u2014 not the complaining witness in this case\u2014 that the man sought had just left the library and had entered a building across the way. At that moment appellant, who fitted the \u201clook-out\u201d description, came out of the other building and the young lady said: \u201cThat\u2019s him.\u201d Appellant looked at them and \u201ctook off\u201d in the opposite direction, paying no heed to the officer\u2019s demand that he stop. After a three-block chase he was apprehended and taken to No. 8 precinct. There he freely admitted a number of thefts including that of February 24, 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>Appellant\u2019s argument is that he was charged with and convicted of petit larceny, a misdemeanor (Code 1951, Supp. VI, 22-2202), and that the officer had no right to arrest without a warrant for a misdemeanor not committed in his presence. This argument ignores the fact that the officer\u2019s information relating to the offense of February 24 gave him probable cause to believe that appellant had entered the building with intent to steal. The entering of a building with intent to commit any offense is a felony. Code 1951, 22-1801. Appellant\u2019s appearance fitted the \u201clook-out\u201d description, and we think it is clear ne was arrested because suspected on reasonable grounds of having committed a felony. Under the circumstances no warrant was needed and the arrest was lawful. The fact that the District Attorney saw fit to reduce the charge from housebreaking to petit larceny does not change the circumstances of the arrest. The same factual situation may result in convictions of both housebreaking and larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
