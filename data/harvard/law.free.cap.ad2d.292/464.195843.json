S. Miller, J.P., Schmidt, Crane and Cozier, JJ., concur.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\"><p id=\"AePO\">Appeal by the defendant from a judgment of the County Court, Orange County (DeRosa, J.), rendered December 8, 1999, convicting him of criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, and reckless endangerment in the first degree, upon a jury verdict, and imposing sentence.</p><p id=\"b499-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p><p id=\"b499-3\">The defendant failed to preserve for appellate review the issue of whether the trial court erred in permitting a witness to testify without meeting the requirements of CPL 60.25 <em>(see, People v Martin, </em>50 NY2d 1029, 1031; <em>People v Udzinski, </em>146 AD2d 245). In any event, the defendant\u2019s attempt to apply CPL 60.25 to the circumstances here is misplaced, as no witness identification of the defendant was involved <em>(see, </em>CPL 60.25; <em>People v Bayron, </em>66 NY2d 77).</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
