Supreme Court, by order dated June 8, 2001, has now denied such motion. Our review of the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing provides no basis to conclude that denial of the suppression motions was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Defendant failed to preserve his claim that the court inadequately and inaccurately responded to the second jury note <em>(People v Blackwell, </em>249 AD2d 81, <em>lv denied </em>92 NY2d 848). Nor, in view of the absence of prejudice resulting from the court\u2019s response, do we find any basis to reverse in the interest of justice <em>(People v Lourido, </em>70 NY2d 428, 435). Defendant\u2019s contention that the court erred by not allowing the jury to resume deliberations after the second note is belied by the record, which reflects that the foreperson and, upon polling, each member of the jury, indicated that further deliberations were unnecessary. Defendant\u2019s remaining contentions are also meritless. Concur \u2014 Nardelli, J.P., Williams, Tom, Sullivan and Friedman, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
