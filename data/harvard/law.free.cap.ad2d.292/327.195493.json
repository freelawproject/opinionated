Therefore, the motion was actually one to reargue, the denial of which is not appealable <em>(see, Duffy v Wetzler, </em>260 AD2d 596, 597; <em>SantaMaria v Schwartz, </em>238 AD2d 569).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The branch of the plaintiffs motion which was to vacate the order dated October 6, 1999, granting the motion of the defendant Ted Doukas for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against him, should have been granted. Pursuant to CPLR 5015 (a), the plaintiff established both a reasonable excuse for its default in opposing the motion <em>(see, Cole v Delcamp, </em>288 AD2d 850; <em>see also, Krebs v Cabrera, </em>250 AD2d 736), and a meritorious cause of action against Ted Doukas. In the order dated October 6, 1999, the Supreme Court ruled, on the merits, that Ted Doukas, who guaranteed the obligations in the leases in question, was no longer liable. The basis for that finding was that \u201con or about August 14, 1998, an assumption of the leases was executed and George Doukas and Diane Kokoris were substituted for defendant Ted Doukas, as personal guarantors.\u201d The plaintiff asserted that it never consented to the assignment of the personal guarantee. The obligor under a contract cannot assign obligations under the contract without the consent of the obligee <em>(see, Toroy Realty Corp. v Ronka Realty Corp., </em>113 AD2d 882, 883; <em>Goldome v Bonuch, </em>112 AD2d 1025; <em>Iorio v Superior Sound, </em>49 AD2d 1008; <em>Halbe v Adams, </em>172 App Div 186). In view of the foregoing, the plaintiff is entitled to vacatur of the order dated October 6, 1999, and an opportunity to oppose the motion of the defendant Ted Doukas for summary judgment.
