Thereafter, charging that appellant was not a fit and proper person to have the custody of the child, respondent procured an order to show cause why said decree should not be modified to the extent that he be granted her custody. The matter was set for hearing on June 19, 1939, when both sides appeared, ready for the trial of the issues involved. At that time respondent was in arrears in the payment of a monthly award of $30 for the support of the minor. The amount had been due nine days.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-11\">During the cross-examination of respondent it developed that, as stated above, he was in default in one payment of the allowance. Thereupon, appellant moved the court to dismiss or continue the hearing until \u201che\u201d (respondent) \u201chas purged himself of contempt.\u201d Later, during the hearing, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-12\">\u201cYou may call any other witnesses. Then we will continue the matter for one week and give him an opportunity to purge himself of contempt of court before I pass upon the motion. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-13\">The hearing continued. Toward the end thereof, the following proceedings took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-14\">\u2018 \u2018 THE COURT: The motion submitted to increase the allowance for the support of the child will be denied. The interlocutory decree will be modified at this time giving the custody of the child to the father until the further order of the court; if circumstances change down there, and the home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>provided by the father is not satisfactory, you may make a motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-5\">\u201cMR. SNYDER: If the court please, I want it definitely understood I by no means waive my right under the original motion, with this testimony at this time; I also at this time, if the court please\u2014withdraw that\u2014I don\u2019t want the court to understand my proceeding at the court\u2019s request I waived my right on my motion to dismiss the particular motion on the grounds that this man was in contempt; I made it in time and I want it to be understood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-6\">\u201cTHE COURT: I will reopen the case\u2014put him on the stand to testify.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">Respondent then testified that he had handed to counsel for appellant a cheek for the payment which was overdue.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">Appellant contends that she was deprived of a right guaranteed by article I, section 13 of the Constitution of California, which provides that: \u201cNo person shall ... be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.\u201d Counsel for appellant states that the court said the matter would be continued for one week to give respondent an opportunity to purge himself of contempt, and that relying upon said statement, he made no effort to have all the witnesses present in the afternoon of the day of hearing. The point is without merit. Prior to making the announcement last mentioned, the court said: <em>\u201cYou may call any other </em>witnesses.\u201d The intent of the court, clearly indicated, was to hear <em>all </em>the witnesses on that day, and then withhold the ruling for a week, within which time respondent might have an opportunity to pay the installment of allowance which was overdue. It was the duty of appellant then and there to produce all witnesses upon whose testimony she would rely. Furthermore, appellant made no showing as to the names of the witnesses whose testimony she asserts she was unlawfully deprived of, and the substance of the evidence which she would produce. No showing of prejudice is therefore made, assuming that tile contention of appellant had any merit. The record contains some one hundred twenty-five pages of testimony. Six witnesses were called by appellant. It would seem as though she had her day in court on an issue of this character, and that she was not deprived of any constitutional right during said hear-</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Appellant also contends that the trial court was bound to award her the custody of said minor, under the provisions of section 1408 of the Probate Code, which read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">\u201cAs between parents claiming the guardianship adversely to each other, neither is entitled to priority; but other things being equal, if the child is of tender years, it should be given to the mother. . . . \u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">That section has reference to the appointment of a guardian, and is not applicable here. Section 138, subd. 2, of the Civil Code, is very similar, however, and it reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-8\">\u201cAs between parents adversely claiming the custody, neither parent is entitled to it as of right; but other things being equal, if the child is of tender years, it should be given to the mother; if it is of an age to require education and preparation for labor and business, then to the father.\u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-9\">This section does not give the mother the <em>absolute right </em>to the custody of a child of tender years. The qualifying clause, \u201cbut other things being equal,\u2019\u2019 still leaves a large measure of discretion with the trial court. If the court finds that other things are <em>not </em>equal, as it evidently did here, and there is any substantial evidence to support such a finding, our inquiry is at an end.  The evidence is abundantly sufficient to warrant the court in exercising its discretion as it did. It showed the appellant to be employed as a waitress and bartender in an establishment known as Russell\u2019s Cafe in the town of lone, Californa, and that while engaged <em>in </em>such employment, she drank considerably, played cards with the male patrons, and on occasion was observed to be under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The minor child of the parties hereto was in these surroundings many times and as late as eleven and twelve o \u2019clock at night. The child had been abandoned to the care and control of appellant\u2019s mother, who, with her husband, operated a roadhouse, the only accommodations of which were a kitchen, bedrooms, and a bar. In this atmosphere, the child\u2019s surroundings, of necessity, confined her to the bar a great part of the time, where intoxicating liquor was sold. Appellant\u2019s mother did on occasions act as bartender and drink with the patrons in the presence of the minor child of the parties hereto. Respondent herein, the father of the minor child, was shown to be regularly employed and in a position to properly care for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>the child. His plans were to live with his sister in lone, which is situated close to his place of employment. His sister\u2019s home provided reasonable accommodations for respondent and his minor child.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">Thompson, Acting P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
