J.</author>\n<p id=\"AS8k\">The two petitioners sought a writ of mandate to effect their retirement under the Police Pension Act. The demurrer was sustained without leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">The petitioners are both constables who have served as such in separate townships of San Mateo County for more than thirty years. The respondents are the three public officials of the county designated by the act of March 4, 1889 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>(DBering\u2019s Gen. Laws, Act 6012) to serve as the board of police pension fund commissioners of the county, except that the sheriff is sued as one of said commissioners instead of the \u201cchief of police\u201d who is named as such in the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">It is the contention of appellants that they are entitled to retire under the provisions of the foregoing act because of their service as \u201cpeace officers\u201d for the required number of years. It is the contention of respondents that the act does not apply to \u201cpeace officers\u201d of a county, or township, but is made applicable only to those public agencies \u201cwhere a regular police department is maintained\u201d; that a constable is an officer of a township, chosen by the electors of the township, which is a distinct political entity, citing <em>Kenyon </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>97 Cal. App. 552, 555 [276 Pac. 110]. Reference is made to the statute of May 5, 1931 (Deering\u2019s Gen. Laws, Act 5848), which in plain terms creates a pension fund and provides for the retirement of sheriffs, constables, and other \u201cpeace officers,\u201d but which is not applicable to San Mateo County because it provides that its terms shall be approved and accepted by the board of supervisors before it shall become effective or applicable in any specific county.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The question presented is simply one of statutory construction\u2014whether the legislature intended Act 6012 to apply to the elective peace officers of a county or township, or whether its provisions were limited to those public agencies which maintained a \u201cregularly constituted police department.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Section 9 of Act 5848 defines \u201ccounty peace officers\u201d as including \u201call sheriffs, under-sheriffs . . . constables, deputy constables. ...\u201d Section 10 makes all such \u201cpeace officers\u201d eligible for participation in the act after a fixed term of employment. It is entitled an act relating to \u201ccounty peace officers as defined in the act\u201d and is commonly known as the \u201cCounty Peace Officers\u2019 Retirement Law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">Act 6012 is entitled \u201can act to create a police relief . . . pension fund. ...\u201d It was enacted in 1889 and was designed for and made use of by the city and county of San Francisco. <em>(Pennie </em>v. <em>Reis, </em>80 Cal. 266 [22 Pac. 176].) It was made available to anyone who had served for more than twenty years as a member \u201cof the regularly constituted police department of any such county, city and county, city, or town. ...\u201d The \u201cpension fund\u201d out of which the bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>fits are to be paid is made up of certain license fees, fines for certain misdemeanors, fines imposed upon the members of the \u201cpolice force\u201d for violations of the rules of the police department and from a special appropriation \u201cequal to two percent of the salaries paid to the policemen . . . payable from the funds of such municipal corporation.\u201d (Sec. 12.) Prior to the amendment of 1917 this section required the treasurer to \u201cretain from the pay of each member of the police department the sum of two dollars per month\u201d to be added to the \u201cpension fund.\u201d It is a matter of common knowledge that this act when passed was designed to reach the police department of the city and county of San Francisco, as stated in the early case of <em>Pennie </em>v. <em>Reis </em>(supra); it was made to apply to all \u201ccounties, cities and counties, cities, and towns of the state\u201d to avoid the constitutional inhibition against special legislation. It expressly refers to a \u201cregularly constituted police department\u201d as such organization is distinguished from the miscellaneous group of \u201cpeace officers\u201d such as sheriffs, constables, and their deputies. It left the administration of the act to the \u201cboard -of police commissioners\u201d or to a special commission of three of which the \u201cchief of police\u201d was one. None of these officers is known to the political organization of the ordinary county.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-3\">We are in accord with the view of the trial judge that \u201cIt is a familiar principle of statutory construction that where two acts bear upon the same, or upon kindred subjects, to ascertain the meaning of either they must be construed together. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">\u201cIt is my opinion that 5848 constitutes a legislative declaration that 6012 is inadequate to cover the instant situation which it was contemplated might arise, and it was adopted with a view of giving relief under the circumstances here involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Spence, J., and Sturtevant, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
