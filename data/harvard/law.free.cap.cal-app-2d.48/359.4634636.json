Defendant then left the store.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-14\">Defendant relies for reversal of the judgment on this single proposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-15\">\n<em>There is no substantial evidence to sustain the finding of the jury that defendant participated in the robbery of which he was convicted.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-16\">This proposition is untenable. An examination of the record discloses substantial evidence taken together with in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>ferences which the jury may have reasonably drawn therefrom to sustain each and every material finding of fact upon which the judgment-was necessarily predicated, including the identity of defendant as the perpetrator of the crime of which he was convicted. For example, the proprietor of the store which was robbed and a friend of his, Mr. Houlihan, both positively identified defendant as the robber. Further discussion of the evidence would serve no useful purpose (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Pianezzi, </em>42 Cal. App. (2d) 270, 277 [108 Pac. (2d) 685]).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">For the foregoing reasons the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Moore, P. J., and Wood (W. J.), J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
