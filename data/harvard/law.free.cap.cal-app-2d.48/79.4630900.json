The purchase price was to be $1,000; $100 down, and monthly payments of $20 a month on the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-11\">In order to bind the bargain the plaintiff gave to the defendant his check for $20, and the defendant gave to the plaintiff his receipt therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-12\">There is a conflict in the testimony as to the wording of the receipt, because, some days later, when the parties met at a bank, the defendant told the plaintiff that he did not want to go through with the deal, and the defendant\u2019s mother got possession of the receipt and refused to give it back to the plaintiff. The trial court properly admitted the plaintiff\u2019s oral testimony as to the wording of the receipt.  At the trial defendant contended that the receipt is in language to be found in a writing which the defendant\u2019s mother testified was the one she took from the possession of the plaintiff. She said that she delivered it to her attorney, who later on sent it to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. The language of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>claimed receipt is materially different from that testified to by the plaintiff as being on the one which was first given to him. The trial court adopted the wording of the receipt as testified to by the plaintiff, and found that the writing was sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds. We think there is substantial evidence in the record to support this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The trial court adjudged specific performance, in that the plaintiff was to pay to the defendant $100, and that then the plaintiff was to have possession of the premises, and that, thereafter, the plaintiff was to pay to the defendant $20 per month until the purchase price of $1,000 was paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Appellant argues that the contract as found by the trial court cannot be thus specifically enforced because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-8\">(a) It is uncertain, and because</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-9\">(b) It is not just and reasonable as to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">It is contended that it is uncertain because deferred payments are governed by the following clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-11\">\u201cBalance to be paid at $20.00 per month.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-12\">Appellant relies upon the case of <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Markarian, </em>175 Cal. 37 [165 Pac. 3], in support of his contention that this provision in the contract is uncertain. In that case the provision for future payments which was under attack read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-13\">\u201cIn quarterly yearly payments with interest at 6% annually. \u2019\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-14\">The opinion of our Supreme Court indicates that such a clause could not be held to mean annual payments, each covering a quarter of the balance due under the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-15\">In the present case, however,- we have no difficulty in determining that the expression \u201cbalance to be paid at $20.00 per month\u201d means that the purchaser is to pay $20 a month each month until the balance due on the principal is fully paid, and that therefore, there is no uncertainty in the contract as found by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-16\">Appellant finally contends that the contract is not \u201cjust and reasonable,\u201d as to him, because by its terms he has been forced to give possession of his property to the plaintiff upon payment of l/10th of the purchase price, and he has \u201cno writing signed by anyone evidencing an obligation to pay the balance, nor any security for said balance beyond the inadequate security of a vendor\u2019s lien.\u201d (Quotation from <em>Klein </em>v. <em>Markarian, supra, </em>at p. 41.)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>There is nothing in this last point of appellant because there is substantial evidence to sustain the finding of the trial court that the contract is just and reasonable. There is no question of a vendor\u2019s lien involved here because by the terms of the judgment title is withheld until the full purchase price is paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">York, P. J., and Doran, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
