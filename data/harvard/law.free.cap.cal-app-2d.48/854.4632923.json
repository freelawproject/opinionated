The defendant Naylor was sentenced to six months\u2019 imprisonment in the county jail and no notice of appeal was given in his behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">The defendant Sudduth was sentenced to the penitentiary on July 15, 1941, and immediately after the pronouncement of judgment he gave oral notice of appeal. No application stating the grounds of the appeal or designating what portion of the phonographic reporter\u2019s notes it was desired to have transcribed was filed on behalf of the defendant Sudduth within five days after his notice of appeal, or at any other time. No reporter\u2019s transcript has been prepared or filed in this court and no brief on behalf of the appellant has been presented or filed herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">The matter was regularly placed upon the calendar for November 13, 1941, and no appearance was then made on behalf of the appellant.
