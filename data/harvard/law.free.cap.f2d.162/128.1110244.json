The new agency was directed to use the functions and powers transferred to it by this Order \u201cto further a swift and orderly transition from wartime production to a maximum peace-lime production * * * and to that end shall * * * (a) expand the production of materials which are in short supply, (b) limit the manufacture of products for which materials or facilities are insufficient, (c) control the accumulation of inventories so as to avoid speculative hoarding and unbalanced distribution which would curtail total production, (d) grant priority assistance to break bottlenecks which would impede the reconversion process, (e) facilitate the fulfillment of relief and other essential export programs, and (f) allocate scarce materials and facilities necessary for the production of low-priced items essential to the continued success of the stabilization program of the Federal Government.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-19\">Thereafter the Civilian Production Administration acting under the authority of the Second War Powers Act <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in \u201cthe fulfillment of requirements for the defense of the United Stales\u201d issued Veterans\u2019 Hous<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>ing Program OrderNo. One (hereinafter referred to as VHP-1) on March 26, 1946. This Order (VHP-1) forbade all construction (with certain minor exceptions not applicable here) begun after March 26, 1946 unless authorized by the local agency of the Civilian Production Administration.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">On or about May 1, 1946, appellants, Chester Fippin and the St. Claire Corporation, began, and thereafter continued without such authorization from the Civilian Production Administration, the construction of the \u201cTahoe Sky Harbor Casino\u201d in the state of Nevada. Since under the Second War Powers Act the wilfull violation of any Order issued thereunder is a misdemeanor,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> appellants were charged with violation of the Order by an information consisting of two counts. The information set forth VHP-1 in general terms, and in the first count charged that the defendants (appellants here) \u201con or about May 1, 1946, without the authorization of the Civilian Production Administration, wilfully did begin the construction of commercial buildings * * * subsequently known as \u2018Tahoe Sky Harbor Casino\u2019, and that the cost of said commercial buildings was approximately Forty Thousand Four Hundred Five Dollars and Eighteen Cents ($40,405.18), the same being new construction of the type prohibited by the aforesaid Order VHP-1, and- was * * * in excess of the One Thousand Dollar ($1,000.00) exemption provided by * * * said order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">The second count realleged all of the allegations of the first count save that it charged only that the defendants \u201cwilfully did carry on and participate in the construction of commercial buildings.\" At the trial, the first count was dismissed upon the motion of the Government, and appellants entered a plea of nolo contendere as to the second. The district judge then entered judgment fining appellant Chester Fippin $1,500.00, and appellant St. Claire Corporation, $6,000.00. Appellants appeal from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>The sole question raised by this appeal is whether the information states sufficient facts to charge a crime against the United States. In essence, the argument presents two material issues, one, that the facts charged are not a violation of the Order (VHP-1), and the other, that the Order itself is invalid, null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">In respect to the former, appellants contend that the information failed to <em>negative </em>the following possibilities: (a) that the construction was begun before March 26, 1946 and was therefore not in violation of the terms of the Order, (b) that the \u201cestimated cost at the beginning of the construction\u201d was less than $1,000 and (c) that the construction was a commercial airport. These contentions are without merit. It is not necessary that an information or indictment negative every possibility or combination of facts that could technically be a defense. McKelvey v. United States, 260 U.S. 353, 357, 43 S.Ct. 132, 67 L.Ed. 301; Rose v. United States, 9 Cir., 149 F.2d 755. It is sufficient if the facts as stated in the information are definite enough so that the defendant may know of what he is charged and so as to protect him from a subsequent prosecution for the same offense. Maloof v. United States, 9 Cir., 159 F.2d 62, cert. denied 67 S.Ct. 1306, and the cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\"> Moreover, the plea of nolo contendere gave the district court no opportunity to pass upon these matters. The rule is well settled that where, as here, no Bill of Particulars was requested, and no attack upon the sufficiency of the information was made in the lower court, and where, as here, no prejudice is shown, the information will be deemed sufficient (upon appeal) to have adequately apprised the defendant of what he was charged. After verdict every intendment must be indulged in support of the information. Koa Gora v. Territory of Hawaii, 9 Cir., 152 F.2d 933, cert. denied 328 U.S. 862, 66 S.Ct. 1362, 90 L.Ed. 1632, and cases there cited. These well established rules of law dispose of the first argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">As to the second issue, it is not contended that cither the First or Second War Powers Act is unconstitutional, but appellants assert that the Order (VHP-1) is invalid and void, because it is beyond the powers of the Civilian Production Administration. In support of this proposition they advance three arguments:</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">First: They contend that the Order (VHP-1) issued by the Administrator is an attempt to exercise the war powers of the Federal Government and since hostilities have ceased any use of the war powers to control a peace time emergency is unconstitutional and void. To bolster this argument they cite the opinion of Justice Holmes in Chastleton Corp. v. Sinclair, 264 U.S. 543, 547, 44 S.Ct. 405, 406, 68 L.Ed. 841 where he said: <em>\u201cA </em>law depending upon the existence of an emergency or other certain state of facts to uphold it may cease to operate if the emergency ceases * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">Assuming without deciding that the powers asserted in VHP-1 are \u201cwar powers\u201d, the argument of appellants fails in that, although the hostilities have terminated the emergency upon which the First and Second War Powers Acts depend still exists. Fleming v. Mohawk Wrecking &amp; Lumber Co., 67 S.Ct. 1129. It follows, therefore, consistent with the views of Justice Holmes, that the \u201cwar powers\u201d could be and properly were exercised in and through the Order (VHP-1) by the Civilian Production Administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">Second: Appellants contend that the Order (VHP-1) was contrary to the will of Congress as expressed in the War Mobilization and Reconversion Act of 1944, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 1658(b) wherein Congress specifically directed all executive agencies to \u201cpermit the expansion, resumption, or initiation of production for nonwar use whenever such production does not require materials, components, facilities, or labor needed for war purposes * * *.\u201d This argument is really but an extension of the first and lacks validity in that it fails to recognize that it is the function of the executive agency to determine <em>when and if </em>the \u201cexpansion, resumption, or initiation of production for nonwar use\u201d will interfere with war purposes. The Order (VHP-1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>here involved simply makes that determination, and the language referred to by appellants in the War Mobilization and Reconversion Act in no way invalidates the Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Third: Appellants contend that Executive Order 9638, supra, which created the Civilian Production Administration did not give it the power to issue Order (VHP-1) since Executive Order 9638 provided that the powers given should be exercised to further \u201ca maximum peacetime production in industry <em>free from wartime Government controls\u201d. </em>We cannot agree. Although the language relied upon is correctly quoted, the emphasis is wrong. The Civilian Production Admiiiistration was directed by Executive Order 9638 to \u201climit the manufacture of products for which materials or facilities are insufficient,\u201d and to \u201callocate scarce materials and facilities necessary for the production of low-priced items essential to the continued success of the stabilization program of the Federal Government\u201d. It was the function of the Civilian Production Administration to restrict, where necessary, various forms of production, to secure the maximum <em>overall </em>peacetime production and to secure the maximum production of scarce low-cost items, such as housing, necessary to a rapid and smooth transition from war to peace. On March 26, 1946, when VHP-1 was issued, veterans\u2019 housing was a \u201clow-priced item, essential to the continued success of the stabilization program of the Federal Government\u201d. Under Executive Order 9638, the Civilian Production Administration was empowered to issue Order (VHP-1) and the Order was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Appellants direct our attention to the Veterans\u2019 Emergency Housing Act of 1946, 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 1821 et seq., asserting that this Act covers the identical situation and actions here involved and that those situations are not criminal offenses under that Act. This- contention is without merit. This statute was not passed until May 22, 1946, and could have no bearing upon the actions of appellants on or about May 1, 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-12\"> 50 U.S.C.A.Appendix, \u00a7 60-1. \u201c * * * Tire President is hereby authorized to make such <em>redistribu\u00ed ion of functions </em>among executive \u00a1\"vacies as he '-nay deem necessary, including any functions, duties, and powers <em>hitherto by lato eonferrad upon any executive depart mbit, commission, bureau, agency, governmental corporation, office, or officer, </em>in such manner as in Ills judgment shall seem best fitted to carry out the purposes of this title and to this cud is authorized t:o make such regulations and to issue such orders as lie may deem necessary <em>it </em>*_\u00bb [Emphasis supplied.]</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b183-13\"> Paragraph 3 of Kxecutivo Order 9038, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b183-14\"> 50 U.
