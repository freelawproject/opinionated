(Joseph Y. Houghton, of Washington, D. C., of counsel), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b477-5\">Before BLAND, Acting Presiding Judge, and HATFIELD, JACKSON, and O\u2019CON-NELL, Associate Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b477-6\">HATFIELD, Associate Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">This is an appeal in a trade-mark Opposition proceeding from the decision of the Commissioner of Patents reversing the decision of the Examiner of Interferences dismissing appellee\u2019s notice of opposition and holding that appellant was entitled to register the trade-mark \u201cBAKE-RITE\u201d for use on paper baking pans.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">In its application for registration, appellant stated that it had used its trade-mark on its goods since about November 3, 1942.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">Appellee is the owner of trade-mark registration No. 346,336, issued May 25, 1937, for the trade-mark \u201cBAKoWARE\u201d for use on \u201cContainers Made From Molded Pulp for Baking or Serving Hot Foods or Liquids.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">Appellee alleged in its notice of opposition that it had used its mark long prior to the claimed use by appellant of its trademark; that the goods of the parties posses-' sed the same descriptive properties; and that the respective marks of the parties were confusingly similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">In his decision, the Examiner of Interferences stated that it was apparent from the record that appellee was the first to use its trade-mark on its goods; that the goods of the parties possessed the same descriptive properties; and that the only issue in the case was whether the marks of the parties were confusingly similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">The Examiner of Interferences further held that the prefix \u201cBAK\u201d or \u201cBAKE,\u201d \u201ccommon to the marks of the paities,\u201d is merely descriptive of the character or quality of the goods of the respective parties. He held, however, that the difference between the remaining portions of the marks of the parties \u2014 \u201cRITE\u201d in appellant\u2019s mark and \u201coWARE\u201d in rppellee\u2019s mark \u2014 were so dissimilar that confusion in trade was not likely to occur by the concurrent use of the respective marks of the parties on their goods. The examiner, accordingly, dismissed the notice of opposition and held that appellant was entitled to register its mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-14\">On appeal, the Commissioner of Patents reversed the decision of the Examiner of Interferences, holding that the prefix \u201cBAKE\u201d in appellant\u2019s mark and the -prefix \u201cBAK\u201d in appellee\u2019s mark were merely descriptive of the character or quality of the goods of the respective parties; that the marks of the parties were confusingly similar, whether \u201ceither or both\u201d should be considered descriptive \u201cin whole or in part.\u201d The commissioner stated, however, that the validity of appellee\u2019s registered mark was not open to question in an opposition proceeding. The commissioner also held, ex parte, that the word \u201cBAKE\u201d in appellant\u2019s mark was merely descriptive and that as the suffix \u201cRITE\u201d is a phonetic equivalent of the word \u201cright,\u201d appellant\u2019s mark was merely descriptive of the character or quality of its goods; and that, therefore, the mark was not entitled to be registered and, accordingly, reversed the decision of the Examiner of Interferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-15\">It is contended here by counsel for appellant that the marks are not confusingly similar, although used on substantially identical goods, and that appellant\u2019s mark is not merely descriptive of its goods because it does not describe the \u201ccomposition or structure\u201d of appellant\u2019s paper baking pan but, on the contrary, \u201crefers to a possible result which may be obtained by its use. It does not describe the goods. It is fancifully suggestive; not descriptive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-16\">Appellant\u2019s trade-mark does not merely refer to a \u201cpossible result which may be obtained by its use.\u201d On the contrary, it was intended to convey to the purchasing public that substances used in appellant\u2019s paper baking pans would be properly and satisfactorily baked. There is no suggestion in the trade-mark that it might possibly produce good results.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-17\">Section 5 of the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, U.S.C., title 15, sec. 85(b), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 85(b), provides that trademarks may not he registered which are \u201cmerely * * * descriptive of the goods with which they are used, or of the character or quality of such goods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Although several cases are discussed in the brief of counsel for appellant in an attempt to support their argument that appellant\u2019s trade-mark is not descriptive, we deem it unnecessary to refer to them here, as they are not helpful in the determination of the issue of descriptiveness here presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">We are of opinion that appellant\u2019s mark \u201cBAKE-RITE\u201d is not merely fanciful or suggestive of appellant\u2019s goods but is merely descriptive of the character or quality of its goods in that it describes the result to be obtained by the use of its paper baking pans.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">The suffix \u201cRITE\u201d, as stated by the Commissioner of Patents, means merely that by the use of appellant\u2019s paper baking pans the article to be baked will be properly and satisfactorily baked, a term which any other manufacturer' of similar paper baking pans would have a right to so describe its goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Owing to our conclusion that appellant\u2019s trade-mark is merely descriptive of the character or quality of the goods on which it is used, and as it is not registrable under the Trade-Mark Act of February 20, 1905, and as the purpose of the opposition proceeding was to prevent the registration of appellant\u2019s mark, it is unnecessary that we consider the question of the confusing similarity of the marks of the respective parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">For the reasons stated, the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">By reason of illness, GARRETT, Presiding Judge, was not present at the argument of this case and did not participate in the decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
