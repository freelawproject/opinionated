On June 30, 1942, an involuntary petition in bankruptcy was filed against the debtor, the proceeding thus commenced was referred to a referee, and Ashton was appointed receiver of the debtor\u2019s property. Proofs of two claims against the debtor were filed by appellee on August 25, 1942, and December 30, 1942, respectively. An arrangement was proposed by the debtor under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 701-799, on March 12, 1943. An amendment to the proposed arrangement was filed 011 July 6, 1943. Objections to the claims were filed by the debtor on August 3, 1943, and were heard by and submitted to the referee on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>August 24, 1943. A second amendment to the proposed arrangement was filed on August 27, 1943. An order confirming the arrangement, as amended, was entered on October 28, 1943<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> No review of that order was sought. A petition for a rehearing of the debtor\u2019s objections to the claims was filed on June 22, 1944. The debtor\u2019s objections were reheard by and resubmitted to the referee on December 4, 1944. An order overruling the debtor\u2019s objections \u25a0 and allowing the claims was entered on December 18, 1944. A judgment affirming that order was entered on May 15, 1945, and was appealed from by the debtor on June 14, 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">One of the claims was for $3,281.42. The other was for $1,125.22. Both were for contributions claimed to be due and owing by the debtor under the California Unemployment Insurance Act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Deering\u2019s General Laws, Act 8780d, for the period from January 1, 1936,' to June 30, 1942. Such contributions constitute taxes,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and those here claimed were so designated in the proofs.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">The debtor\u2019s objections were numbered 1, 2 and 3. Objection 1 was that \u201cSaid claims do not state facts sufficient to constitute provable and allowable claims against the estate and effects of said bankrupt.\u201d Objection 2 was'that \u201cSaid claims are not proved in the manner required by law.\u201d The claims were not against the estate and effects of a bankrupt, but were against the debtor. The debtor was not a bankrupt. Facts sufficient to constitute provable and allowable claims against the debtor were stated in the proofs. The proofs were in substantial conformity with the requirements of \u00a7 57, sub. a, of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 93, sub. a, and Orders 21(1) and 38 of the General Orders in Bankruptcy, 11 U.S.C.A. following section 53. The debtor did not, in any of its objections, point out any defect in the proofs.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Objection 3 was that \u201cSaid claims and the whole thereof are not proper claims against the [debtor] in that same purport to include as employees of the [debtor] persons who were not such employees, and who were at all times employees of E. J. Murphy, an independent broker by virtue of a contract with the [debtor] dated August 1, 1927, a copy of which is attached hereto and marked exhibit \u2018A;\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that \u201csaid persons were at all times the employees of the said E. j. Murphy and were at none of the times therein mentioned the employees of the [debtor]that \u201cat no time did either the [debtor] or the said E. J. Murphy individually have sufficient employees to bring either of the said persons under the jurisdiction of [appellee]that \u201cat all times since the creation of [appel-lee], both the [debtor] and the said E. J. Murphy have made all the necessary and proper reports required to be made to [ap-pellee] by the laws of the State of California;\u201d that \u201cthe said E. J. Murphy was at all times a broker operating under contract with the -[debtor] and, as such, retained the profits from the said brokerage business and met his obligations to the [debtor] for monies advanced by the-[debtor] to the said E. J. Murphy in the financing .of the latter\u2019s business;\u201d that \u201cThe claims also purport to include a tax on monies paid to Emory F. Crepeau and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>John S. Dalzell, which said monies were paid to the said persons as independent contractors;\u201d and that \u201call monies paid to the said persons by the [debtor] or the said E. J. Murphy as salaries have been properly reported to [appellee] in such instances as the [debtor] and E. J. Murphy were subject to the jurisdiction thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AR9\">The referee found that none of the allegations contained in objection 3 was true; that \u201call of the sums of money set forth as contributions due [appellee] in the claims on file herein are based upon wages paid by the debtor * * * to its employees ;\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that \u201csaid wages were in fact paid by the debtor to its employees in the amounts and for the periods set forth in said claims;\u201d that \u201cnone of the sums of money set forth as contributions due [appellee] in the claims on file herein are based upon wages paid by Edmond J. Murphy or by any other person or business organization, save and except the debtor in this proceeding;\u201d that \u201csaid persons upon whose wages the aforesaid contributions are based were the employees of said debtor, with reference 1o wages paid in the sums and for the periods set forth in the claims of [appellee] and were not the employees of Edmond J. Murphy or any other person or business organization, save and except the debtor in this proceeding;\u201d that, \u201cwith respect to so much of the sums set forth in said claims as became due because of wages paid by said debtor during 1936 and 1937, no reports have been filed by the debtor with [appellee] as required by the provisions of the California Unemployment Insurance Act;\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that \u201cEdmond J. Murphy operated a department of the debtor\u2019s business and was not engaged in a separate venture or an independent calling;\u201d that \u201cduring the years 1936 and 1937, the debtor employed eight or more persons for a day or portion thereof in each of twenty different weeks in each of the respective calendar years;\u201d and that \u201cduring the years 1938, 1939, 1940, 1941 and 1942, the debtor employed four or more persons for a day or portion thereof in each of twenty different weeks in each of the respective calendar years.\u201d <footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">These findings were approved by the District Judge, are supported by substantial evidence, are not clearly erroneous and should not be set aside.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">The referee found that a duly authorized representative of a collector of internal revenue audited the debtor\u2019s and Murphy\u2019s books and records for the period of time covered by the claims and, as a result of said audits, concluded (1) that \u201cthe businesses of [the debtor] and of said Murphy during said period were separate and distinct;\u201d (2) that, \u201cfor the purpose of assessment of Federal Unemployment Insurance taxes, the persons he determined to be employees of the said Murphy could not be considered as employees of the debtor;\u201d and (3) that \u201camounts paid to officers of the debtor were not wages subject to taxation under the provisions of the Federal Internal Revenue Code providing for an employment insurance tax upon employers.\u201d The referee found that these conclusions were adopted by the collector.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-13\">The debtor calls the collector\u2019s adoption of these conclusions a ruling and contends that, in view of this ruling, it would be unlawful to require payment of the contributions claimed by appellee. There is no merit in this contention. The collector\u2019s ruling related only to Federal taxes. We are not here concerned with Federal taxes. We are here concerned with contributions claimed under the California Unemployment Insurance Act. Whether the debtor paid any Federal taxes is, for present purposes, immaterial. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b455-14\">It is true that, to the extent provided in \u00a7 1601 of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Code, \u00a7 1601, contributions paid by an employer under the California Unemployment Insurance Act may be credited against the tax, i.f any, paid by such employer under \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>1600 of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 1600; but it does not follow, nor is it true, that the payment of such a tax is a condition precedent to the collection of such contributions. Section 2 of the California Unemployment Insurance Act does not, nor do the cases cited by the debtor,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> support its contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">Other contentions urged by the debtor are so obviously lacking in merit as not to require discussion. We conclude that objections 1, 2 and 3 were properly overruled. No other objection was filed by the debtor prior to the taking of its appeal from the judgment affirming the order overruling these objections and allowing the claims. Hence no other objection may be considered on this appeal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Second. On November 24, 1944, objections to the claims were filed by the receiver, and a so-called notice of adoption of the receiver\u2019s objections was filed by the debtor. An order striking the so-called notice of adoption was entered on December 4, 1944. No review of that order was sought. An order dismissing the receiver\u2019s objections was entered on December. 18, 1944. A judgment affirming that order was entered on May 15, 1945, and was appealed from by the receiver, on June 14, 1945.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">The receiver\u2019s objections were, in effect, mere repetitions of the debtor's objection 3 \u2014 an objection which, as we have shown, was not well founded. Furthermore, the receiver\u2019s objections were filed long after the expiration of the 60-day period mentioned in the order confirming the arrangement<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and hence were too late, even if, in other respects, they were valid objections. We conclude that they were properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">Third. On July 24, 1945, the debtor and the receiver filed additional and supplemental objections to the claims. A motion to strike the additional and supplemental objections was filed by appellee on August 13, 1945, and was heard by and submitted to the referee on August 22, 1945. An order striking the additional and supplemental objections was entered on August 23, 1945. A judgment affirming that order was entered on February 27, 1946, and was appealed from by the debtor and the receiver on March 15, 1946.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">The additional and supplemental objections were filed long after the expiration of the 60-day period mentioned in the order confirming the arrangement. Hence they were too late and would have been too late, even if no appeal had been taken. Actually, however, the two appeals first above mentioned were taken and perfected prior to the filing of the additional and supplemental objections. Thus, so far as the claims weye concerned, jurisdiction of the proceeding had passed from the District Court to this court. Hence the District Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the' additional and supplemental objections.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We conclude that they were properly stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-13\">Judgments affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-14\"> Appellee has had three names \u2014 Unemployment Reserves Commission, California Employment Commission and Gal-ifornia Employment Stabilization Commission.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b454-6\"> The order of October 28, 1943, provided, inter alia, that \u201cThe court shall retain jurisdiction of these proceedings and the assets of the debtor until all expenses of administration, attorneys\u2019 fees and payments to creditors have been made;\u201d that \u201cThe priority claimants, being taxing authorities who have filed claims, shall be paid in full in the amounts at which their said claims shall be allowed;\u201d and that \u201cthe hearing and determination of objections by the debtor, or by other creditors, except as elsewhere in these proceedings otherwise waived, that may be filed on grounds not waived by the debtor, to the claims of creditors herein, shall be so filed and set for hearing within sixty days from the date of this order.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b454-10\"> Formerly the Unemployment Reserves.
