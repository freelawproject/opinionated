So much has been written, \u2014 we, ourselves, have written so many times,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in cases where efforts were made, as here, to import oral agreements into a completely integrated written contract, that it would serve no useful purpose for us to write at length either as to the principle or as to its application to the facts as the complaint sets them out. It is sufficient to say that, in addition to the rule which makes the writing the sole repository of the parties\u2019 agreement and prevents resort to oral evidence, the precise and unambiguous stipulations of the written contract stand as a complete barrier to plaintiff\u2019s suit. These are (1) \u201cThere shall be no liability * * * either for delay, loss of profits, expenses, or any consequential damages\u201d; (2) \u201cThis proposal states the entire contract\u201d; (3) \u201cIt is agreed that there are no verbal understandings whatever, no guarantees or warranties, express or implied, respecting said articles not stated herein, and that the liability of the company for loss or damage for any failure of said articles is limited to the replacement of parts manufactured by it found to be defective as to material or workmanship within the time and in the manner as provided herein\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-14\">As to the second so-called contract, it is quite plain that the complaint set out no contract at all. It merely details the circumstances and conditions under which the sellers endeavored to satisfy the purchaser by replacing portions of the equipment with which it was dissatisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-15\">The judgment was right. It is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b232-11\"> The damages claimed were $519,430.43 on the first cause of action and $49,553.22 on the second.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b232-12\"> The written contract, a document of nine printed pages, was attached to the complaint. It contained among other clauses one providing: Seller \u201chereby proposes to furnish One L-8-DR engine \u25a0 with following equipment: the' following specified and described articles of machinery and equipment for the price and upon terms; conditions and agreements hereinafter stated\u201d. There followed a lengthy detail of the things to be furnished and a provision that the machinery shall be transported and installed on the foundation and connected at the purchaser\u2019s expense, the purchaser to furnish all labor, supplies and facilities, the seller agreeing, however, upon request of the purchaser to furnish an experienced mechanic to direct, for the purchaser, the installation, erection and starting of the machinery, for which the purchaser will pay the regular hourly rates, $2,10 per hour with one and one-half time for Sunday and holidays.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-15\">There was a Material and Workmanship guarantee as follows: \u201cThe Company guarantees such of said articles of machinery and equipment as are manufactured by it to be and remain free from defects in material and workmanship for the period of one year from date of shipment thereof, and agrees to replace, free of charge * * * any part or parts thereof which fail through defect in material or workmanship within said year\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-20\">Then follows this clause: \u201cThere shall be no liability on the part of the Company to the Purchaser because of defects claimed, either for delay, loss of profits, expense or any consequential damages; the Company\u2019s liability as to defective parts being limited solely to the replacement or repair of defective parts to the extent herein provided. Auxiliary equipment or attachments to engines included in this contract, which are not manufactured by the Company, shall be subject only to the guarantees provided by the manufacturer of such equipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b232-21\">Finally the contract doses thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-22\">\u201cThis proposal states the entire contract under which the Company proposes to furnish the articles of machinery and equipment specified and described herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-23\">\u201cIt is agreed that there are no verbal understandings whatever, and no guarantees of warranties, express or implied, respecting said artides not stated herein, and that the liability of the Company for loss or damage from any failure of said artides is limited to the replacement of parts manufactured by it found to be defective as to material or workmanship within the time and in the manner as provided herein.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b233-10\"> Kessler &amp; Co. v.
