Branson, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b72-7\">Mrs. Grace B. Stiles, Assistant United States Attorney, of Washington D. C., with whom Messrs. George Morris Fay, United States Attorney, Daniel B. Maher, Assistant United States Attorney, and Sidney S. Sachs, Assistant United States Attorney, all of Washington, D. C., were on the brief, for appellee. Mr. Edward M. Curran, United States Attorney, of Washington, D. C., at the time the record was filed, also entered an appearance for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b72-8\">Before STEPHENS, EDGERTON, and WILBUR K MILLER, Associate Justices.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b72-9\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">This appeal is from a summary judgment in favor of the Postmaster General in a suit brought by appellant to enjoin enforcement of a fraud order. The evidence before the Postmaster General supports his finding of fraud. Since there was no other question before the court the summary judgment was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">Appellant sent through the mails representations like these: \u201cScripture Spreading The Light of Jesus Christ Scripture Peace Money Good Success Enjoy Money Quick Success Better Joy., He Conquer all Heal all' Sickness Without enemies Mysterious Power. Medicine Love Everlasting\u201d; \u201cThousands of men and women, ill or unhappy last month at this time, have solved their problems, and are now enjoying peace, power and plenty. So why continue suffer need?\u201d; \u201cscientific product\u201d; \u201cGive freely and you shall receive a bountiful blessing freely, Service.\u201d Readers were asked to send $2, $4, or more, and many did. In return they received only a paper or cardboard \u201cemblem,\u201d an oil chosen for its scent, and typewritten references to the Bible.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">Appellant admitted in the Post Office proceeding that his \u201c \u2018method\u2019 is only the sale of merchandise and writings on scripture.\u201d He explained that by \u201cscientific product\u201d he meant the Bible. He said it was not his \u201cbusiness to know or care anything about who may or may not understand * * * especially if and when they sign their name to my contract as aforesaid and send me their or my money.\u201d This admission of willingness to mislead would have supported the finding of fraud even if appellant\u2019s purpose to mislead had been otherwise less apparent than it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-14\">Appellant contends that his advertising is religious literature. It is not. Even if it were, the constitutional privilege which he claims would not follow. A religious ingredient is no better defense to a charge of fraud than to a charge of murder. And \u201cthe fact that a false statement may \u2018be obviously false to those who are trained and experienced does not change its character, nor take away its power to deceive others less experienced.\u201d Federal Trade Commision v. Standard Education Society, 302 U.S. 112, 116, 58 S.Ct. 113, 115, 82 L.Ed. 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-15\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
