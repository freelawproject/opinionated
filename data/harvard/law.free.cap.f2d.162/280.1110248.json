Federal jurisdiction therefore rests upon 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 <em>97 </em>as to both grounds alleged in support of the cause of action asserted, i. e., interference with the plaintiff\u2019s exclusive right to use its registered trade-mark. See Armstrong Co. v. Nu-Enamel Corp., 305 U.S. 315, 324, 325, 59 S.Ct 191, 83 L.Ed. 195. Furthermore, as will appear from our statement of the facts, federal jurisdiction over the ground of unfair competition may also be rested upon diversity of citizenship and amount in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-16\">The plaintiff-appellant, The Coca-Cola Company, a Delaware corporation, is the owner of the trade-mark \u201cCoca-Cola,\u201d registered in the United States Patent Office in the years 1893, 1905, 1925, twice in 1928 and again in 1945. It also registered its mark in Massachusetts in 1919. For a great many years it has manufactured and sold in interstate commerce the soft drink syrup from which its familiar dark reddish-brown beverage is made. The tens of millions of dollars it has spent over the years in advertising its product under the name \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d have created an enormous public demand for the beverage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Obviously, as the court below found, the value of its mark is far in excess of $3,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-17\">The plaintiff sells the syrup which it manufactures in two ways. It sells approximately 20% of its product to independent wholesalers or jobbers who sell it to soda fountain operators who in turn mix the syrup with carbonated water and dispense the beverage by the glass. Its business in this \u201cfountain syrup\u201d as it is called is without significance in the case at bar. It sells the major part of its syrup to six so-called \u201cparent bottlers\u201d,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> each of which has exclusive resale rights in a particular territory, and these in turn resell to local bottlers having exclusive franchises in their respective sub-territories.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These local bottlers mix the syrup with carbonated water, package the combination in distinctive 6 oz., somewhat hourglass shaped, bottles into the glass of which the trade-mark \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d in script is blown, and sell the bottled product to retail out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>lets such as stores, bars, taverns, restaurants, etc. For over 20 years the plaintiff has made extensive use of the phrase \u201cDelicious and Refreshing\u201d in its advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">The defendant-appellee, Snow Crest Beverages, Inc., is a Massachusetts corporation which was organized in 1930 for the purpose of incorporating a business carried on since 1923 by one Berkowitz under the name Snow Crest Beverage Company. Originally Berkowitz manufactured only pure fruit flavored carbonated beverages which he sold in 7% oz. and quart size bottles under the trade name \u201cSnow Crest\u201d. In 1929 he began to manufacture artificial flavored carbonated beverages which he sold in 7% oz., 12 oz. and quart bottles under the trade name \u201cPolar Cub\u201d. Berkowitz, and subsequently the defendant corporation, advertised its names, \u201cSnow Crest\u201d and \u201cPolar Cub\u201d, through the usual media with the\" result that there has been built up a special association of these names with the defendant\u2019s products.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">In 1935 the defendant added a cola type beverage to its line which is apparently indistinguishable from the plaintiff\u2019s Coca-Cola either by taste or color. It originally called this drink \u201cSno Kola\u201d, which it soon changed to \u201cSno Cola\u201d, and in 1937, without giving up this latter name, it began to put this beverage out also as \u201cPolar Kola\u201d, changed a little later to \u201cPolar Cola\u201d. It marketed this beverage in 7 oz., 7% oz., 12 oz. and quart bottles, and on all of these bottles it used a crown, or cap, displaying the name \u201cPolar Kola\u201d, later \u201cPolar Cola\u201d, in white block letters on a narrow red band under a representation of a polar bear cub, which was the symbol it had long used in connection with its Polar Cub line of artificial fruit flavored beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">On its bottles it also affixed a paper label, predominately blue, white and orange in color, bearing a representation of a polar bear cub in an Arctic scene under the words \u201cPolar Cola\u201d in block letters. Upon these labels the beverage was described as consisting of flavor from the cola nut blended with natural flavors, cane sugar, carbonated water and caramel, and on them appeared the words \u201cDelicious Refreshing\u201d. The label on the 7 oz. bottle carried the notation \u201cindividual size\u201d, that on its 12 oz. bottle \u201cdouble size\u201d, and that on its largest size bottle \u201cfamily size\u201d. The court below found that in view of the wide market for Coca-Cola the legend \u201cdouble size\u201d on the label of the defendant\u2019s 12 oz. bottle would be interpreted by the ordinary buyer of soft drinks to mean \u201cdouble the size of a Coca-Cola bottle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">In 1940 the defendant began to bottle its-Polar Cola in distinctive 28 oz. bottles of the same type that it had previously used in marketing some of its other products, and early in 1943 it discontinued all sales of Polar Cola except in bottles of this size and special type. Since 1944 it has soldi these 28 oz. bottles virtually only to the bar and tavern trade in Massachusetts. It intends, however, as soon as sugar and other supplies become available, to resume-its sales in smaller bottles to retail stores and to expand its business into interstate commerce.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">Until 1944 the defendant\u2019s 28 oz. bottles were closed with the Polar Cola cap already described and carried a paper label displaying (1) the name Polar Cola in large white lettering approaching script in appearance on a red background,. (2)-the defendant\u2019s name as bottler in small letters, (3) a description of the contents,, also in small letters, and (4) a prominent representation of an owl winking one eye next to the slogan \u201cGet Wise \u2014 Giant Size\u201d. Since December 1944 it has used caps and labels on its bottles which by no stretch of the imagination could be said to have-any resemblance to anything appearing in the plaintiff\u2019s advertisements, and it has-called its beverage \u201cPolar Cub\u201d on the label and \u201cCubo-la\u201d on the cap. It has retained the name \u201cPolar Cola\u201d on its trucks,, however, and it says that the change in-labeling of December 1944 was only to-test consumer reaction. Furthermore, it is found as a fact that the defendant intends to revive the name \u201cPolar Cola\u201d for its product. This case, therefore, has not become moot since the defendant not only asserts but also intends to exercise what, it claims to be its right to market its product in the way complained of whenever it may see fit to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>As already appears, the wrong complained of \u2014 interference with the plaintiff\u2019s exclusive right to use its mark \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d \u2014is grounded upon allegations both of trade-mark infringement and unfair competition. Specifically the plaintiff contends that the defendant\u2019s name \u201cPolar Cola\u201d infringes its registered trade-mark \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d; that the defendant\u2019s use of the name \u201cPolar Cola\u201d constitutes unfair competition with the plaintiff; that the defendant\u2019s product, with its connivance and assistance, has been and is being widely passed off by retail dealers to consumers on orders for the plaintiff\u2019s product; that the defendant without satisfactory reason or excuse has imitated the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cgetup\u201d and the general appearance of its product; and that, by printing \u201cDelicious Refreshing\u201d on its labels the defendant has made use of the predominant parts of one of the plaintiff\u2019s well known trade slogans. We shall consider these contentions in the \u2022order enumerated after disposing of three matters of general application.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">In the first place there is no question in this case with respect to the applicable law. Opposing counsel agree and the court below held, in conformity with its ruling in National Fruit Product Co. v. Dwinell-Wright Co., D.C., 47 F.Supp. 499, \u201cthat on the particular types of issues here involved there is no difference in the federal statutory rule, the federal common-law rule, the Massachusetts statutory rule and the Massachusetts common-law rule.\u201d Furthermore, it seems to be conceded, as it must be, that the legal test of trademark infringement is the same as the legal test of unfair competition and basically that test is the likelihood of consumer confusion as to the source of the goods. Dwinell-Wright Co. v. National Fruit Product Co., 1 Cir., 140 F.2d 618, 622, 623; Mishawaka Rubber &amp; Woolen Mfg. Co. v. Panther-Panco Rubber Co., 1 Cir., 153 F. 2d 662, 665, certiorari denied 329 U.S.-, 67 S.Ct. 64. That is to say, the test to determine whether the defendant has violated the plaintiff\u2019s right to the exclusive use of its mark is to inquire whether the defendant has carried on its business in such a way as to make it likely that ordinary purchasers of its goods would confuse them with those of the plaintiff. And we have held in this circuit that this ultimate question of the likelihood of consumer confusion as to source is one of fact. Thomas Kerfoot &amp; Co., Ltd., v. Louis K. Liggett Co., 1 Cir., 67 F.2d 214, 215; Dwinell-Wright Co. v. National Fruit Product Co., supra, 140 F.2d 618, 623, and cases cited. In accord see also Warner &amp; Co. v. Lilly &amp; Co., 265 U.S. 526, 529, 44 S.Ct. 615, 68 L.Ed. 1161; Skinner Mfg. Co. v. Kellogg Sales Co., 8 Cir., 143 F.2d 895, 899; Magazine Publishers, Inc., v. Ziff-Davis Pub. Co., 2 Cir., 147 F.2d 182, 185. Cf., however, LaTouraine Coffee Co. v. Lorraine Coffee Co., 2 Cir., 157 F.2d 115, 117, certiorari denied 329 U.S. 771, 67 S.Ct. 189, in which it is said that this ultimate question is reviewable on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">In the second place the defendant has the undoubted right to manufacture and market a drink indistinguishable from the plaintiff\u2019s by either taste or color. In 1920 the Supreme Court in The Coca-Cola Co. v. The Koke Co. of America, 254 U.S. 143, 147, 41 S.Ct. 113, 114, 65 L.Ed. 189, said the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cproduct including the coloring matter is free to all who can make it\u201d, provided of course, \u201cno extrinsic deceiving element is present.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-10\">In the third place the plaintiff has no monopoly on the use of the word \u201cCola\u201d in the name of its beverage. It has been held that the word is generic and therefore may be used in the name of a cola drink by any one who chooses to make such a beverage. Dixi-Cola Laboratories, Inc., v. Coca-Cola Co., 4 Cir., 117 F.2d 352, certiorari denied 314 U.S. 629, 62 S.Ct. 60, 86 L.Ed. 505, and cases cited. In fact counsel for the plaintiff in the case at bar does not contend otherwise. Therefore, the plaintiff\u2019s claim of trade-mark infringement rests upon the defendant\u2019s use of the word \u201cPolar\u201d in conjunction with the word \u201cCola\u201d as the name for its drink.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">In support of this contention of infringement the plaintiff points to the similarities of \u201cPolar\u201d and \u201cCoca\u201d in number and arrangement of vowels. But on the issue of trade-mark infringement words are not to be compared syllable by syllable, vowel by vowel and consonant by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>consonant. Instead they are to be compared as ordinary purchasers of soft drinks would compare them, that is, on the basis of similarities in their general appearance both in construction and in over-all impression on the eye. Thus the type, as script or block for instance, in which alleged infringing words are printed, the color thereof, and the color and composition of the background upon which they appear, as well as the spelling of the words themselves, are important considerations on the issue of trade-mark infringement. Furthermore, words are to be considered \u201cin connection with other similar words in use in the same general field\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>. Thomas Kerfoot &amp; Co., Ltd., v. Louis K. Liggett Co., 1 Cir., 67 F.2d 214, 215, and cases cited. Without elaborating on the facts already stated it will suffice to say that our own visual inspection of the exhibits in this case leads us to the conclusion that the court below not only was not clearly in error but instead was amply justified in its conclusion that the defendant\u2019s labels differ so much from the plaintiff\u2019s advertising (it does not label its bottles) that so far as appearance is concerned the defendant\u2019s use of \u201cPolar Cola\u201d does not infringe the plaintiff\u2019s trade-mark \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">But the plaintiffs contention is not so much that its and the defendant\u2019s names in their respective settings look alike as that when spoken they sound alike. It says that the words \u201cPolar Cola\u201d and \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d, when spoken in bars or taverns, which are frequently noisy places and where it and the defendant principally if not exclusively meet in competition, sound so similar as to cause consumer confusion. And in addition it says, and stresses, that the similarity in sound between the names is so marked as not only to permit but also actively to encourage the passing off of the defendant\u2019s product on orders for the plaintiff\u2019s. Thus the similarity in sound becween the names is urged in support of-both the ground of trade-mark infringement and the ground of unfair competition. Since the same facts are said to support both grounds (see Armstrong Co. v. Nu-Enamel Corp., 305 U.S. 315, 325, 59 S.Ct. 191, 83 L.Ed. 195) and since the test of both grounds is the same, we can dispose of two phases of the case on one consideration of the question of the verbal similarity of the names.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">It appears that cola drinks, so called, are not frequently sold as such in bars and taverns. It appears that the principal use' of cola beverages in such establishments is either as a chaser or as a mixer with spirits, usually rum or whiskey, and that when so used, as well as when dispensed alone, the drink is usually poured by the bartender at the bar from the bottle in which it came from the manufacturer into the glass served to the customer. Thus customers in bars and taverns seldom know by visual inspection what kind of cola beverage is served to them. And the evidence is that in the vast majority of cases they do not care. There is testimony that most customers order spirits and a cola drink by asking for a \u201cCuba Libre\u201d (rum- and a cola beveragq mixed) or rum and cola or \u201ccoke\u201d,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> or whiskey and cola or \u201ccoke\u201d, or rum or whiskey with a cola or \u201ccoke\u201d chaser, that few customers specify the brand of whatever spirit they may wish served with the cola drink, and that still' fewer ever specify any particular brand of cola beverage. The record is devoid of statistics \u2014 probably such statistics do not exist \u2014 but on the record as it stands we feel on safe ground in assuming that only a very small percentage of the persons who order a cola drink and a spirit in bars and taverns ever place specific orders for Coca-Cola. Therefore, we conclude, since the plaintiff has no right to the names \u201cCuba Libre\u201d or \u201ccola\u201d, and in this case asserts no right to the name \u201ccoke\u201d, that relatively very few opportunities ever arise for passing off the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>ant\u2019s drink in bars and taverns on specific orders for the drink manufactured by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">The evidence upon which the plaintiff relies, and the only evidence in the case, to show specific instances of passing off by bartenders of the defendant\u2019s beverage on categorical orders for the plaintiff\u2019s Coca-Cola was given by investigators hired by the plaintiff. These men made repeated visits to bars and taverns in and around Boston in which the defendant\u2019s beverage was sold, and there asked specifically for \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d, usually in conjunction with an order for rum or whiskey. They took note of what was served to them and found that sometimes they received what they ordered, sometimes were given the defendant\u2019s beverage, and on an appreciable number of occasions were given some other cola type drink. The court, below found that of 82 separate establishments visited, <em>47 </em>on one or more occasions served defendant\u2019s product on specific orders for \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d, and in the remaining 35 establishments the bartenders responded to 201 specific orders for \u201cCoca-Cola\u201d by serving Royal Crown Cola 31 times, Castle Rock Beverages 28 times, Pepsi-Cola 25 times, Coca-Cola 24 times and miscellaneous brands 93 times.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\"> There is no evidence that the defendant ever suggested in sales talks or advertising that bartenders substitute its drink on specific orders for the plaintiff\u2019s, and the court below found as a fact that it had never done so. Nevertheless, there is testimony that in some instances when the plaintiff\u2019s investigators called the bar-waiter\u2019s attention to the substitution and the waiter admitted that a substitution had been made, they said to the waiter, \u201cThey (meaning the names Polar Cola and Coca-Cola) both sound alike, don\u2019t they?\u201d and the waiter replied, \u201cYes, they do.\u201d The plaintiff relies heavily upon this testimony to show that the defendant by its choice of the name \u201cPolar Cola\u201d induced bartenders to pass off its product on orders for Coca-Cola. But obviously the question asked of the waiters has all the familiar vices of the leading question, and in addition it leads directly, almost inescapably, to a self-serving answer. We think it clear that this testimony falls short of proving clear error in the district court\u2019s finding that the only inducement the defendant held out to bartenders to substitute its drink for the plaintiff\u2019s was the inducement of a lower price (the defendant\u2019s drink is about one-half as expensive as the plaintiff\u2019s) and that inducement it was of course free to offer. All the defendant did, therefore, to make substitution by bartenders possible was to manufacture a drink almost if not quite identical with the plaintiff\u2019s, which it had an established legal right to do, and all it did to make such substitution likely was to sell its drink at about half the price of the plaintiff\u2019s, which it certainly was within its rights in doing. It seems to us to go without saying that such conduct on the defendant\u2019s part falls far short of constituting the legal wrong described in Warner &amp; Co. v. Lilly &amp; Co., 265 U.S. 526, 530, 531, 44 S. Ct. 615, 68 L.Ed. 1161, of designedly enabling and inducing its retail dealers to defraud their customers by palming its product off on them as the plaintiff\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Only minor matters remain for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">The plaintiff contends that the evidence conclusively establishes that the defendant itself, at its bottling plant in Salem, passed off its product for Coca-Cola. This contention, like the preceding one, rests exclusively upon the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s investigators. It appears that these young men, posing as employees of a local retail dealer who in past years had purchased the defendant\u2019s products, went to the defendant\u2019s plant on several occasions in the summer of 1944. First they telephoned to the defendant\u2019s plant that their ostensible employer would like some of the defendant\u2019s products, then they drove to its bottling plant by automobile. On their first visit, after some friendly banter with the defendant\u2019s female employees, they ordered five cases of soft drinks and then went into the back room to select what they wanted. They chose one case of Polar Cola and four cases of other unrelated soft drinks, paid for their purchase, pt\u00bb\u00a3 the cases in their car and drove away. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>On their next visit they asked for a case of \u201ccoke\u201d but were told that none was available. \u2022 On their third visit they again asked for \u201ccoke\u201d, as well as other soft drinks, were given a case of Polar Cola with their order, and again paid for their purchase and drove away with it. On their fourth visit, mindful of their instructions to order \u201ccoke\u201d on two occasions before they ordered Coca-Cola, they ordered the latter by name. They were given a case of Polar Cola which they paid for and took away without objection. They testified that they observed signs on the defendant\u2019s establishment indicating that it was the bottling plant of \u201cSnow Crest Beverages\u201d and saw no reference there by sign or otherwise to Coca-Cola.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">On this evidence the court below found that any reasonable person in the position of the defendant\u2019s employees would have supposed that when the plaintiff\u2019s agents asked for Coca-Cola they were asking for the product which without assistance they had themselves selected from the back room on their first visit; which on two occasions they had asked for as \u201ccoke\u201d and on one of those occasions \u2018had accepted without complaint on that order; and which was the sort of product any normal customer would expect to get from a plant which was obviously not a Coca-Cola bottling plant. Therefore, the court below found as an ultimate fact that the defendant\u2019s employees believed, and were justified in believing, that when the plaintiff\u2019s investigators asked for Coca-Cola, for reasons peculiar to themselves, they meant not Coca-Cola but Polar Cola. The sufficiency of the evidence recited above to support these findings of. fact does not seem to us to call for demonstration.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The plaintiff contends, apparently seriously, that the district court committed error of law in that it measured the likelihood of the defendant\u2019s mark to deceive by the erroneous test of the reaction thereto of the \u201ccareful buyer\u201d of cola drinks rather than by the correct test of the .reaction of the \u201cordinarily careful buyer\u201d of such beverages. We think that in making this contention the plaintiff gives wholly unwarranted significance to a typographical error. To be sure it would appear from the transcript of record that the district court quoted this court\u2019s opinion in Thomas Kerfoot &amp; Co., Ltd., v. Louis K. Liggett Co., 1 Cir., 67 F.2d 214, 215, as reading \u201cthe question * * * whether * * * two names are so similar * * * that one is likely to be mistaken for the other .by a careful buyer, is to be determined\u201d, etc., when in fact the quotation should read \u201cby an ordinarily careful buyer\u201d. But in other places in its opinion the court below clearly indicates that it recognized and applied the correct test, and furthermore in the district court\u2019s opinion as published in 64 F.Supp. 980, at page 990, the Kerfoot case is correctly quoted. It seems to .us, therefore, that this contention rests upon an obvious typographical error in the district court\u2019s opinion as printed in the transcript. In consequence we think it entirely lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">It does not seem to us that the plaintiff can make any valid objection to the use of the phrase \u201cdouble size\u201d on the defendant\u2019s 12 oz. bottles even if the phrase does connote that those bottles are twice the size of the plaintiff\u2019s. We see no reason why the defendant cannot legitimately call the attention of consumers to the fact that it offers twice as much beverage for the same price as the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">Nor do we think the plaintiff can legitimately complain of the defendant\u2019s use of \u201cDelicious Refreshing\u201d on some of its labels. These are common adjectives, they are peculiarly appropriate words to use in advertising a beverage, and we cannot concede that the plaintiff can acquire an exclusive right to use them for that purpose. We cannot see how the plaintiff has any right to complain of the defendant\u2019s use of the words in the way it did, i.e., on labels otherwise having no resemblance to anything appearing in the plaintiff\u2019s advertising.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">The plaintiff\u2019s contention that at a conference with defendant\u2019s president before suit was brought, it gave the defendant such definite notice that its dealers were making a practice of passing off Polar Cola to their consumers on orders for Coca-Cola that the defendant was thereby obligated to investigate the matter and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>take steps to prevent its dealers from continuing the practice (see New England Awl Co. v.
