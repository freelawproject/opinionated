See Mason v. Webb, 9 Cir., 142 F.2d 584, certiorari denied, 323 U.S. 747, 65 S.Ct. 58, 89 L.Ed. 598; Mason v. Smith, 9 Cir., 148 F.2d 894, leave to file petition for certiorari denied, 325 U.S. 839, 65 S.Ct. 1407, 89 L. Ed. 1965. One phase of his long legal battle for freedom also has been considered by the Supreme Court of the State of Washington. See State v. Mason, 25 Wash.2d 767, 172 P.2d 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">For the purposes of this decision, it will be necessary to give only a brief statement of the case, supplementing those contained in the opinions cited above.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">The petition herein recites that the appellant filed a petition for the common law writ of error coram nobis in the King County trial court, \u201calleging extrinsic errors of fact\u201d. On November 12, 1941, the sentencing judge denied the petition. The court\u2019s order of denial was received by the petitioner at the state penitentiary on November 25, 1941, 13 days after the entry thereof. The appellant asserts that \u201cit was therefore impossible for him to have served and [to] file a notice of appeal within five days as required by the rules governing appeals to the Supreme Court of Washington\u201d. Thereafter, the appellant filed in the superior court of King County a. second petition for a writ of error coram nobis. On August 22, 10 !o, 011c of the judges of that court entered an order denying the petition on the ground that \u201cthe questions raised therein were passed upon by an order entered on the 12th day of November, 1941, * * * and that the matter is res adjudicata * * *.\u201d The Supreme Court of the State affirmed the order. See State v. Mason, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">On October 21, 1946, the appellant filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the court below, which denied the petition on January 7, 1947. From the order of denial the present appeal was taken, in forma pauperis.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">It will be observed that the appellant herein did not take an appeal from the adverse decision of the superior court of King County on his first petition for a writ of error coram nobis.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">The fact that it was \u201cimpossible for him to have served and [to] file a notice of appeal within five days as required by the rules governing appeals to the Supreme Court of Washington\u201d, does not excuse his non-action in the matter. He should have made the effort, and he must still make the effort, before he can successfully contend that he has exhausted all state remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-12\">As we have pointed out in our opinion in Barton v. Smith, 9 Cir., 162 F.2d 330, the Supreme Court of Washington, in at least one recent non-capital case, has changed its rule as to the time within which appeal documents must be filed. As a result, a tardy appellant has been allowed to present his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">To paraphrase the language of the Supreme Court of the United States in Woods v. Nierstheimer, 328 U.S. 211, 216, 66 S. Ct. 996, 999, 90 L.Ed. 1177, \u201cwe do not know whether the state\u201d Supreme Court \u201cwill construe\u201d its own rules \u201cso as to deprive petitioner of his right to challenge a judgment asserted to have been rendered in violation of Constitutional guarantees where his action is brought\u201d after the prescribed time-limit. See also Canada v. Jones, 8 Cir., 160 F.2d 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">The full implications of Woods v. Nierstheimer and State v. Mason, supra, are discussed in Barton v. Smith, supra, and in Hampson v. Smith, 9 Cir., 162 F.2d 330. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>It would serve no useful purpose to repeat that discussion at this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Accordingly, the order of the court below, dismissing the appellant\u2019s application for a writ of habeas corpus, is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
