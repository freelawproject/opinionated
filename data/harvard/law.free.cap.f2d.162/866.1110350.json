Int.Rev. Code, \u00a7 44. The question presented is whether or not in computing the income and excess profits tax of the corporation for the year 1943 the corporation may, for excess profits credit, include as \u201cequity-invested capital\u201d uncollected profits which had been accumulated on its books on January 1, 1941, from such installment sales on the theory that such profits, although uncollected, represent \u201caccumulated earnings and profits as of the beginning of the taxable year\u201d under Sec. 718(a) (4) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 718(a) (4), which provides that equity-invested capital shall include \u201cthe accumulated earnings and profits as of the beginning of such taxable year; * * * <em>\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b921-13\"><em>In </em>making the sales of the real estate on the installment plan, a deed was executed and delivered to the purchaser, with a vendor\u2019s lien retained to secure payment of the promissory notes, for the balance, which notes the purchaser had executed to the corporation. Being on the accrual basis of accounting, the corporation carried on its books as receivables all of these installment obligations, but for income tax purposes it showed as unreported income under the classification of \u201cUnrealized Profit Installment Sales\u201d such part of the proceeds from the installment sales that remained uncollected, and in its excess profits tax return for the year 1943 it claimed the unreported income, or that part not yet collected from the installment sales, as a part of its surplus and undivided profits in computing its equity-invested capital.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-15\">In redetermining the Taxpayer\u2019s excess profits tax for the calendar year 1943 the Commissioner reduced its equity-invested capital for the calendar years of 1941, 1942, and 1943, by the full amount of the sums so carried as unreported income or profits irom those installment sales for the said thr.ee years.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-16\">The term \u201caccumulated profits\u201d is not defined in the excess profits tax provisions of the statutes, but Sec. 728 provides that \u201cthe terms used in this subchapter shall have the same meaning as when used in chapter 1.\u201d The Commissioner contends:</p>\n<p id=\"b921-17\">(1) That whether uncollected profits on installment sales at the beginning of the taxable year are includible in the equity-invested capital depends on whether such profits are \u201crecognized in computing net income\u201d as provided in Sec. 115(1) of Chapter 1 as added by Sec. 501 (a)-of the Second Revenue Act of 1940, 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev. Code, \u00a7 115(1), and that since the Taxpayer did not report in its income tax return the uncollected profits under the installment sales in computing its net income, such profits, therefore, were not \u201crecognized in computing net income\u201d and, therefore, are not includible in the term \u201cequity-invested capital\u201d for excess profits tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-18\">(2) That Congress, in enacting Sec. 115 (1), intended to approve an administrative definition of \u201cearnings and profits\u201d in determining the source of dividend distribution under 115(a) and that such long-standing definition should be applied in computing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>\u201cearnings and profits\u201d in determining equity-invested capital under 'Sec. 718 (a) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">(3) That Sec. 115(1) makes \u201crecognition\u201d in computing net income the test, and that income that is returned under the installment sales statute (44(a) and (b)) is so \u201crecognized\u201d, but that the uncollected profits on these installment sales which are merely shown in the income tax return as \u201cUnrealized Profit Installment Sales\u201d are not included in the income tax return and hence they are not \u201crecognized\u201d so as to be includible in earnings and profits.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">(4) That Sec. 19.115-3 of Regulations 103 expressly provided that uncollected profits shall not be included in \u201cearnings and profits\u201d, and that the Taxpayer\u2019s attack on the definition of earnings and profits that makes \u201crecognition\u201d instead of \u201crealization\u201d the test will not result in the regulation being stricken down unless it is clearly erroneous and unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">The Taxpayer insists that income tax consequences accrue upon the realization of income rather than upon its recognition, and that under the installment plan of income tax reporting, which the statute gives it the right to adopt, there was no actual realization of the income on the unpaid balances on the installment sales such as made it appropriate to return the same, but that said unpaid balances on such installment contracts were \u201caccumulated earnings and profits as of the beginning of such taxable year\u201d within the language and purpose of Sec. 718(a) (4).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-8\">If the Taxpayer had returned and paid the profits that accrued on each sale in the year in which such sale was made, the Commissioner would not contend that the accumulated earnings and profits represented in the unpaid installments would not then have been includible in equity-invested capital for excess profits tax purposes. He would, however, deny to the seller of property on the installment plan, who makes his income tax return according to the optional method that Congress has allowed in 44(b), the right to recognize in his income tax return the unrealized earnings and profits thus accumulated and accrued on its books and to take credit therefor as equity-invested capital in his excess profits tax return.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-9\">The Tax Court held with the Commissioner, citing in support of its holdings its own opinion in Kimbrell\u2019s Home Furnishings, Inc., v. Commissioner, 7 T.C. 339, which case was subsequently reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in an opinion reported at 159 F.2d 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-10\">Definitely there were accumulated as a legitimate part of the corporation\u2019s surplus earnings \u25a0 and profits as of the beginning of the taxable year which would have been taxable (or recognized) as gains had it not been for the option given the Taxpayer under Sec. 44(b) to defer income tax payments on profits from installment sales until the time of their realization.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">It is believed that if Congress had intended to restrict the earnings and profits includible in- equity-invested capital to those earnings and profits on which the corporation had in the taxable year paid income taxes, and also had intended to burden the option it had given in 44(b) by excluding profits from installment sales from being characterized as \u201caccumulated earnings and profits\u201d under Sec. 718(a) (4), it would have said so in plain words so that the Commissioner would not be called upon to resort to an argument so tenuous that it is necessary to pull in Sec. 115(7), 501(a), and 111(d) to prove that Sec. 718(a) (4) does not mean what it says.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-12\">The question has already been decided by this Court in Commissioner v. Shenandoah Company, 5 Cir., 138 F.2d 792, contrary to the contentions of the Commissioner, and we think the holdings announced in that case, which were approved by the Fourth Circuit in the Kimbrell case, supra, were correct and are controlling in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-13\">In our view the decision of the Tax Court is not in accordance with law, and the same is hereby reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b922-14\">HOLMES, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"atq-dedup-1\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-15\">I would affirm the decision of the Tax Court, since it seems to me that the decision of this court in Commissioner v. Shenandoah Company, 5 Cir., 138 F.2d 792, has in principle been overruled by Commissioner v. Wheeler, 324 U.S. 542, 65 S.Ct. 1182, 89 L.Ed. 2004.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
