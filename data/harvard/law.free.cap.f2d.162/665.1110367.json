It is urged by the defendants that the \u201cregular rate\u201d is controlled by provisions of collective bargaining agreements between the defendants and the union, International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, to which plaintiffs belonged in the years in question. The annual collective agreements made with this union since 1921 have provided for a \u201cbasic working day\u201d of eight hours and a \u201cbasic working week\u201d of forty-four hours. Beginning in 1918, these agreements fixed two sets of hourly rates: (1) Specified hourly rates were set for \u201cwork performed from 8 A.M. to 12 Noon and from 1 P.M. to 5 P.M., Monday to Friday inclusive, and from 8 A.M. to 12 Noon Saturday.\" (2) With a few exceptions, one and one-half times these rates were fixed for what the agreements called \u201call other time.\u201d In the Fall of 1938, after the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the agreement changed the labels for these respective periods: The first was now called \u201cstraight time\u201d; the second was now called \u201covertime,\u201d the rates for that period being newly described as \u201covertime rates.\u201d 'I his nomenclature was thereafter used in the agreements and is contained in the agreements for the years involved in these suits. No other significant changes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>were made in the agreements after the Act went into effect. <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">During the years 1943-1945, here involved, in most instances the defendants applied the terms of these agreements in paying the plaintiffs. As a result, if one of the plaintiffs in a given week worked, say, fifty hours during the so-called \u201covertime\u201d period, he received for the excess ten hours precisely the same rate per hour as he was paid for the forty hours; that is, he received merely the contract rate\u2014called the \u201covertime rate\u201d in the contract\u2014for all the fifty hours. If, in a given workweek, he worked thirty hours during the so-called \u201cstraight time\u201d period and twenty hours in the so-called \u201covertime\u201d period, again he received merely the contract rates; that is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>for the excess ten hours, lie received merely the contractually-labelled \u201covertime rate.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\"> The trial judge held this method of payment correct, on the ground that the rates fixed in the agreements for the \u201cstraight time\u201d period constituted the \u201cregular rate\u201d referred to in \u00a7 7(a) of the Act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In so deciding, he relied on Walling v. A. H. Belo Corp., 316 U.S. 624, 62 S.Ct. 1223, <em>86 </em>L.Ed. 1716. We think he erred. As recently as May of this year, the Supreme Court, in a unanimous opinion by Chief Justice Vinson\u2014confirming what had been said previously by this court and by several other inferior courts<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\u2014decided that the Belo case doctrine must be limited to agreements which contain a \u201cprovision for a guaranteed weekly wage with a stipulation of an hourly rate,\u201d and that other types of agreement, whether or not the result of collective bargaining, cannot, by their terms, determine what is the \u201cregular rate\u201d named in the Act. That \u201cregular rate,\u201d said the Court, is an \u201cactual fact.\u201d See 149 Madison Avenue Company v. Asselta, 67 S.Ct. 1178, 1184, citing Walling v. Youngerman-Reynolds Hardwood Co., 325 U.S. 419, 424, 65 S.Ct. 1242, 89 L.Ed. 1705. See also Walling v. Helmerich &amp; Payne, 323 U.S. 37, 65 S.Ct. 11, 89 L.Ed. 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">In the instant case, the \u201cactual fact\u201d concerning the \u201cregular rate\u201d appears in the findings of the trial judge which are supported by the evidence and which we understand the defendants do not dispute. In an Appendix to this opinion, we have set forth pertinent portions of those findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Because government counsel, appearing for the defendants,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> have earnestly asserted the grave precedential importance of these appeals, and because of our respect for the able trial judge, we have considered his opinion with unusual care. None of us, however, is able to agree with that opinion. We conclude that the judgments, in so far as they are adverse to the plaintiffs, must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">Faced with substantially similar collective bargaining agreements and with facts in many respects the same, the Seventh Circuit in 1914 reached a conclusion like ours, as to longshoremen in the Great Lakes area; see Cabunac v. National Terminals Corp., 139 F.2d 853, affirming the able opinion of Judge Duffy, sub nom. International Longshoremen\u2019s Association v. National Terminals Corp., D.C., 50 F.Supp. 26. Judge Cooper, a few months ago, also reached this conclusion as to longshoremen working in Puerto Rico, in a case in which, as here, government counsel represented the employer and apparently advanced the very arguments advanced here. See Fer-ren v. Waterman S. S. Corp., D.C., 70 F. Supp. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-9\">We cannot agree with the argument that our conclusion is unsound because it may require separate computations for each week at rates which may vary from week to week. In Overnight Motor Transport Co. v. Missel, 316 U.S. 572, 580, 62. S.Ct. 1216, 1221, 86 L.Ed. 1682, the Court said that compensation capable of reduction to an hourly basis by application of a uniform principle is \u201cregular in the statutory sense inasmuch as the rate per hour does not vary for the entire week though week by week the regular rate varies with the number of hours worked.\u201d We take this statement as meaning that the statutory element of regularity is met where a single principle or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>rule is uniformly applied in order to obtain the rate.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">We think that the administrative interpretations suggest no conclusion different from ours. <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The one conceivable exception has to do with Sunday and holiday work. In a letter of May 14, 1943, discussing the Cleveland Stevedore Co., the Administrator said that \u201covertime compensation for Sunday or holiday work * * * may be credited toward overtime due under the Act,\u201d because \u201cit can be regarded as time outside the employee\u2019s normal working hours\u201d; but we must also consider the following: (1) The day after that letter of May 14, 1943 was written, Judge Duffy held the contrary; see International Longshoremen\u2019s Association v. National Terminal Corp., D.C., 50 F.Supp. 26, affirmed in Cabunac v. National Terminals Corp., 7 Cir., 139 F.2d 853. (2) In an opinion published in the Wage <em>&amp; </em>Hour Manual, 1944-1945 Cum.Ed. page 227, the Assistant Solicitor referred to a previous ruling, in the Administrator\u2019s Interpretative Bulletin No. 4, that an employer might consider \u201cas overtime compensation\u201d extra amounts of compensation paid \u201cfor hours worked outside the normal or regular working hours\u201d; the opinion said that such extra compensation might be considered overtime compensation only if the \u201chours compensated for\u201d were \u201chours not normally worked by the employees\u201d giviug as an example \u201cwork on Sundays, holidays, or at a time of day when the employee does not normally work\u201d; the opinion, however, went on to explain that \u201chours worked on Sundays and holidays are generally outside the \u2018normal or regular working hours.\u2019 \u201d In the instant cases, on the facts disclosed in the findings,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the hours worked on Saturday afternoons, Sundays and holidays were surely not \u201coutside the normal or regular working hours.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">It is suggested that, if the contractual \u201cstraight time\u201d rate is not the \u201cregular rate,\u201d then that rate for any employee in any week must be ascertained by averaging the rates paid for the first forty hours of work in that week. But in Walling v. Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co., 67 S.Ct. 1056, 1059, the Court stated that \u201cin Overnight Motor Co. v. Missel, 316 U.S. 572, 62 S.Ct. 1216, 86 L.Ed. 1682, we held that the regular rate was to be determined by dividing the wages actually paid by the hours actually worked.\u201d See also Ferren v. Waterman S. S. Co., supra; cf. Walling v. Wm. Schollhorn Co., 54 F.Supp. 1022.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">The Administrator\u2019s Press Release 1913 stated that theretofore, where an employee received more than one rate during a workweek, the Administrator had ruled that the employer must pay the employee an \u201covertime rate of one and one-half his average hourly earnings for the entire week, computed by dividing the weekly earnings at both rates by the total number of hours worked in the week,\u201d but that thereafter an employer would have an option, in the alternative, to compute the overtime rate at one and one-half times the rate at which the employee worked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>during the hours in excess of forty. However, this Release was later qualified by Press Release 1913A, which stated, \u201cIn order to take advantage of this [revised] rule, the records of the employer must show which method of computing overtime com--pensation he had determined to follow.\u201d Nothing in the evidence here indicates that either defendant so kept its records.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Counsel for plaintiffs are allowed $2,000.00 for their services on these appeals.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Reversed and remanded for determination of the amounts due plaintiffs in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Appendix</p>\n<p id=\"ac-dedup-0\">Findings of Fact</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">\u201cNo. 14: \u201cIn the longshore industry in the Port of New York there are no regular or usual hours of work. Employment is highly casual in character, more so than employment in any other major industry. This condition is primarily the product of the uncertainties of maritime; shipping and weather conditions, the unpredictable character of ship and overland cargo arrivals and the use of the \u2018shape\u2019 as a hiring device, as defined in Finding No. 16. The casual character of the work is reflected both in the difficulty of finding employment, the irregularity of the hours of beginning and stopping work, \u2022and in the uncertainty of the duration of employment during any specified period. In these respects the work pattern of longshoremen is unique.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">\u201cNo. 15: During the period in suit, and for many years prior thereto, longshoring in the Port of New York has had the following characteristics. With rare exceptions, longshoremen do not work regularly or continuously for any one stevedoring company, but shift from employer to employer and from pier to pier as casual workers, working when they want, and when and where work is available. There is no regular weekly or even daily, employment. Longshoremen may work for more than one employer in a single day, or during the same week. The total number of hours worked in any day or week varies widely. Irregularity of both daily and weekly hours is characteristic of the industry.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">\u201cNo. 16: Employment of longshoremen is wholly dependent upon the selection of men at one or another of the \u2018shapes\u2019 at the head of each pier where work is to be done. At three stated hours during the day, namely at 7.55 a. m., 12.55 p. m. and 6.55 p. m., men seeking employment gather in a group or semicircle, constituting the \u2018shape,\u2019 at the head of a pier where work is available. The foreman stevedore then selects from the \u2018shape\u2019 such men as he desires to hire, to work until \u2018knocked off,\u2019 that is, told to quit. The selection of a man from the shape carries with it no obligation on the part of the employer concerning any specified length of employment, except for work requirements of the Collective Agreement relating to minimum hours under specified conditions. The duration of employment depends entirely upon the determination of the stevedore or the steamship company. Where longshoremen work during \u2018straight time\u2019 hours, it is customary for the employer to defer until about 4.30 p. m. his decision as to whether the men shall do work after 5 p. m. If it seems likely that night work will be required, the employer may definitely engage the men, or he may order them to shape at 6.55 p. m. If the men are directed to shape at 6.55 p. m., and the employer then decides not to work that night, because of weather conditions or other circumstances relating to the arrival or handling of cargo, he is at liberty not to hire any man at the 6.55 p. m. shape, and thereby he incurs no obligation for compensation. At times the men have been directed to shape up at hours other than the three specified shape hours hereinabove mentioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">\u201cNo. 17: When men have been selected individually at the shape, they are organized into gangs of about 20 men, in charge of a foreman, and put to work loading or unloading a ship. Where a gang has been accustomed to work as a group, it is assigned to a particular hatch or job. A gang may hold together for a few hours, or it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>may operate as a unit as long as there is work in a hatch or ship, which may be for less than a day or for more than a week. They may, and sometimes do, work as a group on frequent occasions for one employer, being employed regularly or steadily. The men are employed only when there is work to be done. At the end of a working period a gang may be told to \u2018knock off,\u2019 in which event the men would shape again at a later shaping' hour, or on the next day, if they so desired, if work was available at the pier.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">\u201cNo. 18: During the period in suit, the defendants in some instances adopted the practice of posting notices on bulletin boards of the arrival of ships, or of calling gangs, working customarily together, by a prior notice posted at the pier or by telephonic communication from the stevedoring foreman to the gang leader or hatch boss, and from him, in turn, to the individual men. This practice, however, did not bring about a departure from the established custom that the men shape up at the customary times, regardless of whether they had been working at that pier on the previous day or even earlier the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">\u201cNo. 19: The amount of work which may be available for longshoremen in the Port of New York, and the time of the day or the day of the week when such work may be available, depend principally upon the number of ships in port and the length of their stay, and varies from day to day, week to week and season to season.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">\u201cNo. 20: Under the terms of the Collective Agreement in effect during the period in suit, and under previous Collective Agreements in effect over a period of many years, the longshoremen in the Port of New York have been obligated to work any night of the week or on Sundays, Holidays or Saturday afternoons, when directed, with special limitations on Saturday nights.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-8\">\u201cNo. 22: The stevedoring business in the Port of New York prior to World War II, had the following characteristics: About seven or eight stevedoring companies worked for one steamship company each, whereas about 60 other stevedoring companies, known as contracting stevedores, worked for a number of steamship lines. Before a ship docked in this port, the stevedores knew the vessel\u2019s definite or approximate date of departure and also the type of cargo to be discharged or loaded. Thereupon, they made a determination concerning the best way of handling the cargo at the lowest possible cost. Tentative plans for the handling of the cargo were readjusted from time to time on account of delayed arrival, necessity for repairs, delay in arrival of outgoing freight, weather conditions and other factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-10\">\u201cStevedoring companies never worked any more \u2018overtime\u2019 than was necessary, because it was more economical for the steamship company, and more profitable to the stevedores, to work during \u2018straight time\u2019 hours. It was the common practice for stevedoring companies to use auxiliary equipment, and to work the largest number of day gangs within the vessels\u2019 limitations o\u00ed space and equipment. Permission to work \u2018overtime\u2019 had to be obtained by the stevedoring company from steamship company. The decision whether to work \u2018overtime\u2019 was controlled by the necessity of meeting scheduled sailing dates in the case of passenger liners, and otherwise by financial considerations turning on whether the over-all cost of a later departure exceeded the cost of \u2018overtime.\u2019 The contract between stevedoring companies and steamship lines usually provided that the former would be paid on a tonnage basis, plus the-actual cost of \u2018overtime,\u2019 including \u2018overtime\u2019 differentials, insurance and Social Security taxes. For the most part, the longshoremen preferred to work during the daytime rather than during the night. The amount of \u2018overtime\u2019 that the men worked depended to a considerable extent upon the stevedoring companies by whom they were employed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">\u201cNo. 25: The steamship companies in the Port of New York have preferred to confine the handling of cargo to \u2018straight time\u2019 hours to the greatest possible extent. They give permission to work \u2018overtime\u2019 when such work is unavoidable. The 50 percent over-riding charge for work done during \u2018overtime\u2019 hours is a deterrent because of the added cost and the intensity of the competition between American ships and ships of foreign registry.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>\u201cNo. 26: Stevedoring companies try to avoid working \u2018overtime\u2019 hours. Their contracts are entered into on a commodity tonnage basis. When permission is granted to work \u2018overtime,\u2019 stevedores receive in addition to the commodity tonnage rate only the actual additional amounts paid out in wages, plus insurance and Social Security tax. \u2018Overtime\u2019 work is less efficient than work in \u2018straight time\u2019 hours. These factors contribute to the reduction of the stevedore\u2019s profits, if his employees are worked \u2018overtime.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">\u201cNo. 30: Night work, Sunday work, work on Saturday afternoons and on certain legal holidays, have been compensated at rates higher than the prevailing day rates in the longshore industry in the Port of New York at least as far back as 1887.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">\u201cNo. 33: In the Fall of 1938, after the enactment of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Collective Agreement for the longshoremen\u2019s industry in the Port of New York introduced, with reference to work at night, Saturday afternoons, Sundays and Holidays, on general cargo, the terms \u2018overtime\u2019 and \u2018overtime which shall be paid for at the overtime rate.\u2019 The parties, nevertheless, from the passage of the Fair Labor Standards Act through the period in suit, made no actual change in the general manner of compensating longshoremen as compared with that prevailing previously, except under the circmstances noted in Finding No. 43(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">\u201cNo. 34: During most of the period in suit the defendants required some longshore work practically around the clock, day in and day out, except Saturday nights. Defendant Huron employed some groups exclusively on night work. Defendant Bay Ridge assigned its gangs either to day or night work as shipping exigencies required, and its gangs frequently commingled day work with night work on different days in the same working week.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">\u201cNo. 35: No stevedoring company worked exclusively from 8 a. m. to 5 p. m. and Saturday mornings. Even prior to World War II some stevedoring companies had fairly regular recourse to some night work.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-10\">\u201cNo. 36: During the peripd in suit defendants endeavored to have longshoremen available for work in regular gangs which were called out by defendants to shape up as shipping exigencies required. Some of the plaintiffs normally sought employment at other piers only when they could not get work at the piers served by the defendants sued herein. Even when ordered out by defendanls, however, the gangs were required to shape up in the customary manner and no man had assurance of employment or guarantee of its duration, except for the provisions of the Collective Agreements for minimum hours of pay under specified conditions of employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-12\">\u201cNo. 41: An examination of the employment record of each of the plaintiffs shows that their work followed no regular pattern. There were many weeks during which they were not employed by the defendants. They worked varying numbers of days in different weeks. The number of hours worked on the days when they did work varied greatly. Many weeks they worked less than 40 hours; other weeks more than 40 hours.
