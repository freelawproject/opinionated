One, Tony Cincotta, the respondent\u2019s plant superintendent, had been one of its most important witnesses, and had denied the statements which the respondent\u2019s employees charged against him, and which were a large factor in the Board\u2019s conclusion that they hai been improperly discharged. The examiner had said: \u201cTony was a good witness. While he got a little confused and had difficulty in expressing himself, it was very evident that he was telling the truth.\u201d When the examiner came to file his report he refused to credit Cincotta\u2019s denials of the statements which had been imputed to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>The words attributed to the examiner\u2014 which arguendo we assume that he uttered \u25a0 \u2014 'show affirmatively that, at any rate at that time, he was impartial and his change of mind, during the seven weeks that intervened before he filed his report, must be ascribed to one of two possible sources: an impartial study of the testimony as a whole; some improper intervening influence. It seems hardly necessary to labor the argument that such a shift in conclusion is not an adequate basis for refusing the first explanation, and adopting the second. Indeed, we should live in much trepidation, if such a standard of consistency during all stages of our deliberations were demanded of us personally.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">Enforcement order granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
