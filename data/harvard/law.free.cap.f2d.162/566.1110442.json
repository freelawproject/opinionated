The dispute is highly factual and while not complicated, is apparently incapable of ami<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>cable settlement, desirable as such a disposition would be.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The Board has ordered the Company to reinstate four employees who the Company contends were discharged for having illegally barred the plant manager from the plant during a strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The Board found the four employees were engaged in peaceful picketing, and employed no threat of violence, and therefore were not guilty of unlawful acts such as might be the legitimate basis of a discharge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Company, on the other hand, earnestly contends that the, picketing was not peaceful, and that its manager was barred from the plant by threat of violence and intimidating action on the part of the four discharged employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The Company has petitioned us to review the Board\u2019s order, and the Board has petitioned us for the enforcement of its order. The order of the Board was made upon the Board\u2019s adoption of the trial examiner\u2019s intermediate report, and his findings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">The Company is engaged in the manufacture of piston rings and gray iron castings. The New Castle plant of the Company employed about five hundred employees. Its sales for the plant for the year exceeded a million dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">The Examiner stated that \u201cthere is no suggestion that other than a harmonious and stable relationship\u201d existed prior to the strike. The strike was \u201cspontaneous\u201d and \u201cabout 3:30 in the afternoon of August 27, a picket line formed before the plant entrance.\u201d Two draftsmen who had left the plant that afternoon on business were not permitted to re-enter the plant upon returning.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">On the next morning, the 28th, the incident occurred which supplies the factual basis for these proceedings. \u25a0 The plant manager, Richard Bancroft, accompanied by the plant engineer, came to work. As he approached the gate to pass into the plant, employee Emerson hurriedly walked to the gate and placed himself between Bancroft and the gate, Emerson\u2019s body covering part of the gate. His arm was somewhat, but not fully extended. It is probable that at least two other employees also hurried to the site and stood either immediately before or behind Bancroft. There then followed conversation between Bancroft and the employees, and Bancroft and the chief of police, regarding Bancroft\u2019s entering the plant. These statements are in some dispute. At least there is not complete accord as to the exact words spoken. We quote several of them in the margin (of page 569). The employees in substance state they asked Bancroft \u201cPlease, Dick, don\u2019t go in.\u201d Bancroft insists there no \u201cplease\u201d in their statement to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-14\">Rather, he was directed not to go in. Bancroft then turned to the Chief of Police and asked him to open the gate, but the Chief refused to do so, stating he could, not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-15\">There was no actual violence. Whether there was threat of violence is a point upon which the parties differ. The plant manager probably believed there would be violence and he therefore desisted in his attempt to enter the plant. He had, of course, the clear legal right to enter the-plant. Any -forceable obstruction to his exercise of his right was unlawful. If the employees unlawfully resisted Bancroft\u2019s-right to enter the plant, the company was within its right in discharging the obstructing employees. If lawfully discharged, the Board erred in ordering their re-employment. The determinative issue, it will thus be seen, becomes an extremely narrow one.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-16\">The pickets, the four discharged employees, on the other hand testified to positive instructions that no violence was to be used<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>; also that no threat of violence was made. In fact, they were merely exer-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>rising their right to use persuasion to sup-pOi t their cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">The Company places strong reliance upon the fact that though its discharge, was predicated upon unlawful picketing and the Board found the picketing to have been lawful, the Company\u2019s bona fide action exonerates it from any charge of discrimination against unionism in violation of Sec. 8(3) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158(3). Its position is stated in the Martel Mills Corporation v. National Labor Relations Board, 4 Cir., 114 F.2d 624, 631, as follows,\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">\u201cWe do not lose sight of the fact that our inquiry is centered upon the motivating cause of the employer\u2019s action. The task is a difficult one. It involves an inquiry into the state of mind of the employer * * *. We do not find substantial evidence to support any illegal motive such as is proscribed by Section 8(3) of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The Board counters with the contention that \u201cGood faith belief by the employer that employee conduct is not protected under the Act does not relieve the employer of responsibility for the discriminatory discharge of employees engaged in such protected conduct.\u201d (Republic Aviation Corp. v. N. L. R. B. and N. L. R. B. v. Le Tourneau Co. of Georgia, 324 U.S. 793, 65 S.Ct. 982, 89 L.Ed. 372, 157 A.L.R. 1081; N. L. R. B. v. Illinois Tool Works, 7 Cir., 153 F.2d 811; Home Beneficial Life Ins. Co. v. N. L. R. B., 4 Cir. 1947, 159 F.2d 280, and Matter of Mid-Continent Petroleum Corp., 54 N. L. R. B. 912.)</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">In N. L. R. B. v. Illinois Tool Works, supra [153 F.2d 814], this Court said</p>\n<p id=\"b623-14\">\u201cIn answer to these contentions it will be enough to say that this court * * * has recognized that the test of interference, restraint and coercion under \u00a7 8(1) of the Act <em>does not turn on the employer\u2019s motive.\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b623-16\">In Republic Aviation Corp. v. N. L. R. B., supra, the discharge of an employee for violation of a company rule against solicitation, which rule was invalid as applied to the union solicitation in which the employee engaged on his own time, was discriminatory within the meaning of See. 8(3) of the Act in that it discouraged membership in a labor union, notwithstanding that the rule was enforced impartially against all solicitors. In that case the Court said [324 U.S. 793, 65 S.Ct. 984],</p>\n<p id=\"b623-17\">\u201cThe discharges of the stewards * * * were found not to be motivated by opposition to the particular union, or we deduce, to unionism.\u201d \u201cThe Board determined that there was no union bias or discrimination by the company in enforcing the rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-18\">The Court added</p>\n<p id=\"b623-19\">\u201cIt seems clear, however that if a rule against solicitation is invalid as to union solicitation on the employer\u2019s premises during the employee\u2019s own time, a discharge because of violation of that rule discriminates within the meaning of Section 8(3) in that it discourages membership in a labor organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"atv-dedup-0\">Notwithstanding the language of these cases from which a rule of law may be deduced, the controversy remains a factual one. We therefore at the sacrifice of brevity, quote the evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>The cases which hold we are bound to accept the Board\u2019s findings when supported by substantial evidence are many. The reasons for these holdings may be found in the provisions of statute (29 U.S. C.A. Sec. 160(e) ) and so we are told, in the superior qualifications of the Examiners and the members of the Board to pass upon the factual questions arising out of labor disputes. In N. L. R. B. v. Waterman S. S. Co., 309 U.S. 206, 208, 60 S.Ct. 493, 495, 84 L.Ed. 704, it is said</p>\n<p id=\"b625-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>\u201c * * * In that Act Congress provided, 'Tile findings of the Board as to the facts if supported by evidence, shall be conclusive.\u2019 It is of paramount importance that courts not encroach upon this exclusive power of the Board if effect is to be given the intention of Congress to apply an orderly, informed and specialized procedure to the complex, administrative problems arising in the solution of industrial disputes. As it did in setting up other administrative bodies, Congress has left questions of law which arise before the Board \u2014 but not more \u2014 ultimately to the traditional review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>of the judiciary. \u25a0 Not by accident, but in line with a general policy, Congress has deemed it wise to entrust the finding of facts to these specialized agencies. It is essential that courts regard this division of responsibility which Congress as a matter of policy has embodied in the very statute from which the Court of Appeals derived its jurisdiction to act. * *</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">The Board in the instant case accepted the Examiner\u2019s report which so far as it dealt with the determinative issue in this controversy reads</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">\u201cThe undersigned finds that attempts to persuade others not to enter the struck plant when unaccompanied by violence or threats of violence, fall well within such limits. Since picketing is a normal and customary concerted action in support of a strike, it follows that picketing if lawfully conducted is a protected activity within the meaning of Section 7 of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">He also found</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">\u201cWhile an inference may be drawn that Lye proposed to prevent management personnel from entering the plant, it does not follow that he proposed to do so by other than peaceful and persuasive means.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">We must accept,this finding of fact, though contrary to what our finding would have been if the issue was one for our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">We are somewhat at a loss to understand how the Examiner or the Board could find that the four employees on a strike who stepped before the superintendent and barred his way into the plant did so with no intention of preventing the employer\u2019s entry into the plant. Nor can we see wherein the Examiner was better qualified to pass on the action which the four would have taken, had B. attempted to go through the gate, than we are now.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">The less said about the policeman\u2019s action and his testimony is the most charitable course we can take. It.could hardly be said that his testimony in the light of his previous action, was favorable to the side for which it was offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">Could it be said the Examiner\u2019s greater familiarity with labor problems made his deductions more intelligent than ours ? The Examiner thought the pickets were merely exercising their right to picket the premises peacefully. By peaceful picketing it was meant that they intended to present only oral argument but did not intend actually to resist the manager\u2019s entrance. In other words, when the striking employee, Emerson, ran to the gate, and placed himself between B. and the gate, he was merely presenting the striking employees\u2019 argument to the plant manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">Our contrary view must give way to the Examiner\u2019s in view of the statute, and the holdings of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-14\">In other words, we bow to the command of the statute and to the decisions of the Supreme Court. If the disposition of this appeal turned on the findings above-quoted, we would grant the Board\u2019s petition for an enforcement order.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-15\">We are satisfied, however, that such disposition can not be made. Our acceptance of the Examiner\u2019s findings leaves a question of controlling importance \"unmet and undisposed of.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-16\">It is not the disputed intention of the four men that is determinative. It was the obstruction of the entrance to the company\u2019s property to the manager which constituted the four discharged men\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-17\">Whatever their motives or intentions may have been, they barred the management out of the place. The Board\u2019s counsel admits frankly, \u201cwhen in the course of a strike or other collective action, individual employees or groups of them seize their employer\u2019s property, the Act provides them with no shield from a discharge based upon their unlawful activity.\u201d National Labor Relations Board v. Fansteel Corp., etc.,, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-18\">We are holding that the forceabledenial of the employer\u2019s right to go upon its property is the equivalent of a seizure of the employer\u2019s property. The seizure of the employer\u2019s property as stated in the Fansteel case, supra, is a bar to reinstatement, because it denied to the employer his right to occupy his own property. The same effect is accomplished when the employee prevents the employer from entering upon his property.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>The discharged employees in this case prevented the entry upon the employer\u2019s property. The effect of such action does not turn on whether the employees intended to yield if the employer persisted. The legal effect of such action is not lessened even though employees intruded to use only oral argument against the manager\u2019s entry. <em>This is a ca\u00a1se where the striking employees prevented the company\u2019s manager from entering the property. </em>Such prevention may be accomplished by physical force or violence; \u201cby beating the manager up,\u201d or it may be accomplished by the employees\u2019 so conducting themselves that the manager is unwilling to take the risk of being \u201cbeat up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">The evidence in this case conclusively establishes that the four men did actually prevent the company\u2019s manager from entering the property. To this action we must give the same legal effect as if they had used physical violence to prevent the entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">It is inconceivable that the law should require the employer to take the chance of physical violence or even death in order to secure possession of its property. The right of the employer to the possession of its property was clear. The employees abridged that right. They kept the employer out of its property. The effect of their action must he judged by the results. Had the manager taken his chance of trying to force his way through the gate he might have suffered violence which in turn could have aroused heated blood on his part with the result there would have been blow for blow. Must the employer in order to get possession of his property take a chance with the life of the manager? We think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">In short, the motive of the wrongdoer is not the controlling and determining factor in this and similar cases. The employer may not avoid the consequence of its interference, restraint and coercion, whatever may be its motive (N. L. R. B. v. Illinois Tool Works, <em>7 </em>Cir., 133 F.2d 811; Republic Steel Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 3 Cir., 107 F.2d 472). Nor may the. employees avoid the consequences of their action in barring the employer from his plant even though they were engaged in picketing the plant. The employees\u2019 right peacefully to picket the plant is clear. This right may not be exercised, however, to the extent, of excluding the employer from his property. Motives (or good intentions) of the employee, like motive of the employer, can not excuse unlawful conduct, either by employer or by the employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">We conclude from the uncontradicted evidence in this case (and no adverse finding of the Examiner avoids this conclusion) that the employer sought possession of its property; it was denied that possession by the four discharged employees; the employer was justified in its belief from the words and acts of the discharged men, that it could not get possession save through a fight, that in a fight it was represented by one man and the striking pickets had four; that it was not required to take the chance of bloodshed before it could discharge those who unlawfully obstructed its entry into its own plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Finally, the order of the Board reinstating the four employees can not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">The petition of the Board to enforce its order is Denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-11\">The petition of the employer to vacate the Board\u2019s order is Granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b622-10\"> National Labor Relations Board v.

Did anyone use the word \u2018Please\u2019? A. No. * * * He was squarely against the gate with his back and his arms stretched across it (Emerson). * * * he was scowling and determined and energetic. A formidable appearance, I\u2019d say.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">\u201cQ. Did he say any threatening words to you? A. No. The tone of his voice was threatening.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">\u201cQ. * * * Did Lye talk in a loud voice or a low voice * * * A. Well, we were both a little excited, Mr. Examiner, and I think it tended toward the ksud side. * \u201c * This was a dramatic incident, it occurred fast. I got out of the car and walked rapidly to the gate. They had to run. Everyone was at high pitch. Under those circumstances, things are a little loud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">Allan Fromuth. personnel manager:</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">\u201cMr. B. drove up in his ear \u00ae * * several men ran toward the gate. * * * Mr. B. * * * hurriedly walked toward the gate. Before he reached the gate, however, Mr. Emerson was there first and placed himself in front of the gate with one arm on the gate. Almost instantaneously Mr. Lye arrived at that spot and ifiaced himself between Mr. B. and Mr. Emerson. * * * Thrasher came into the group * * * and there was another man there along with the group. They sort of farmed a half semicircle around Mr. B.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-13\">Chesley Juday, plant engineer:</p>\n<p id=\"AxL\">\u00ab* * * I observed two men * * * hurry across toward the gate. * * * As Mr. B. approached the gate Mr. Emerson took a position in front of the gato with his back to the gate and shortly thereafter, Mr. Lyo walked up and took a position slightly in front and to the left of Mr. E. * * * I heard Mr. Emerson tell Mr. B., \u2018You can not go in there. * * * I also heard, when Mr. Lye walked up, he also made the statement to Mr. B., \u2018You are not going in there\u2019 and Mr. Lyo repeated that statement more than once. * * * I remember Mr. X5. telling Mr. Lye that he was * * * \u2018plant manager and I have a right to go in that plant.\u2019 I would say Mr. Emerson was excited and his face was rather tense. I don\u2019t know whether this is permissible to say, but then it was my impression that Mr. Emerson was ready to grab Mr. B.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-19\">\u201cQ. Now, don\u2019t you remember that Ed Lye said to * * * B., \u2018Please Dick don\u2019t go in\u2019? A. In fact, I am positive there wasn\u2019t any statement like that. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b625-21\">\u201cQ. On the basis of everything that yoxi hoard and observed with reference to the group congregated at the gate that morning, do you have an opinion as to whether Mr. B. would have been forcibly kept out of the property if he had proceeded? A. My opinion is that he would have been, definitely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-22\">Victor Howell, foreman:</p>\n<p id=\"b625-23\">\u201c * * * just before Dick got to tho gato Emerson beat him there by just an instant. * * * Lye got there almost as B. did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-24\">John Riggs, Policeman:</p>\n<p id=\"b625-25\">\u201cAs he (Bancroft) walked up to the gate there was about two or three fellows standing there at the gate.

First, it is found in the opinion that the picketing was peaceful. The evidence before the Board was conflicting on this point., but the Board found that the picketing was peaceful, and there is an abundance of evidence to support this finding. It must have been with this in mind that the majority opinion of this Court found that the picketing was peaceful. The opinion then says: \u201cWe are holding that the forceable denial of the employer\u2019s right to go upon its property is the equivalent of a seizure of the employer\u2019s property\u201d within the meaning of the Fan-steel case. Assume that a forcible denial of entry to the properly by the strikers would bring the case within the Fansteel doctrine. There is no finding of any such force. The Board found: <em>\u201cit </em>is true that Lye stood partially between Bancroft and the gate but it is found that Bancroft was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>not thereby barred from entering and it is further found that the attitude of Lye, Emerson, and Thrasher was not hostile or threatening.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">This finding is completely at variance with the Court\u2019s finding, and the Board\u2019s finding has ample support by substantial evidence in the record. I set forth in the margin evidence from the record which clearly supports the Board\u2019s view.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Bancroft gave a different version of the situation, which was in conflict with that of the strikers and the police. To support the Court\u2019s statement that the evidence conclusively establishes that the four strikers did actually prevent the company\u2019s manager from entering the property, the Court has to accept Bancroft\u2019s version. This version the Board rejected. It accepted the version of the strikers and the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-21\">Notwithstanding the fact that the Board\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence, the Court disagrees with the Board on a resolution of that conflict in the evidence. We have no part in that conflict. We look only to the evidence which supports the Board\u2019s finding, just as we would a jury\u2019s verdict. The Board accepted the version <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>of the gate incident given by the strikers, who were corroborated by the police. There was no violence or threat of violence in this view of the evidence. The police saw no occasion for their interference and refused to intrude at Bancroft\u2019s request, and the latter turned on his heel and left hurriedly. My credulity as to the politeness and gentility of the picketing is stretched considerably, hut I am not the trier of the facts. I have seen many verdicts of juries that seemed to me off the beam, hut I have found no rule of law that permits an appellate tribunal to retry the facts. I submit that we are hound by the Board\u2019s finding, which is supported by substantial evidence, whether we like it or not.</p>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b628-6\"> Edwin Lye:</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">\u201cA. * <em>-t </em>* Mr. Bancroft got out of the car on one side.
