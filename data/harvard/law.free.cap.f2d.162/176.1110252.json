O\u2019Brien Brothers alleged that the scow \u201cwas unseaworthy\u201d (presumably when she sank). The answer of O\u2019Brien Brothers denied this allegation and then affirmatively alleged that the scow was seaworthy, when delivered on charter to the Moran Company. In its petition im-pleading the Moran Company, O\u2019Brien Brothers also alleged \u2014 Article Fifth \u2014 that the scow was seaworthy when delivered, and this the Moran Company denied in its answer; as it also denied the allegation in the libel that the scow was unseaworthy when she sank. The Moran Company added affirmatively in its answers both to the libel and the petition that the scow was \u201cimproperly loaded\u201d by the stevedores \u201cand as a result capsized\u201d; an allegation which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>that company repeated in its petition impleading the stevedores. This the stevedores denied in their answer to the Moran Company\u2019s petition, and affirmatively alleged that the scow was unseawortliy when \u201cfurnished\u201d \u2014 presumably to the stevedores. In the suit of O\u2019Brien Brothers v. Moran Company, D. C., 66 F.Supp. 614, the libellant alleged in Article Sixth of its libel that the scow was seaworthy when delivered on the charter. The Moran Company denied this \u2014 Article Sixth of its answer \u2014 and added affirmatively \u2014 as in the other suit\u2014 that the scow had been improperly loaded \u201cand as a result she capsized\u201d \u2014 Article Thirteenth.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">At the trial O\u2019Brien Brothers upon its prima facie case called only one witness, whose testimony was relevant only to the seaworthiness of the scow when delivered. When it rested, the judge said: \u201cYou are not only relying on the presumption but on the fact that she was actually doing work and was carrying five hundred tons on those trips to demonstrate the seaworthiness?\u201d To this the advocate answered: \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d After the Moran Company and the stevedores had put in their evidence, O\u2019-Brien Brothers called an expert who was examined at great length, and two other short witnesses; and it then concluded its. case with the bargee who was on the scow until she was delivered on the charter, and whose testimony was relevant only on the issue of seaworthiness. Before swearing this witness \u2014 the last in the case \u2014 the following colloquy took place: \u201cThe Court: This is on your proof of seaworthiness and so forth? Mr. Heckman: Yes, sir. Of course, the charterer alleges that the damage was due to improper loading. I have no issue to meet of unseaworthiness.\u201d That was the first intimation that the issue of seaworthiness was not in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">That from the outset it had in fact been raised in the pleadings appears from the analysis we have just made; for it would be to the last degree unreasonable to suppose that the Moran Company, after expressly denying the allegation, would have withdrawn it when it charged the stevedores with fault. The language of the affirmative allegation did not in fact contradict the denial. To say that the scow was \u201cimproperly loaded\u201d and capsized \u201cas a result\u201d did not imply anything whatever as to its seaworthiness. An unseaworthy scow may not capsize until she is improperly loaded; there may he more than one cause for her collapse, as for any other event. Furthermore, from the course of the trial it became evident that O\u2019Brien Brothers thought the issue open; at least until they said to the judge what we have quoted. If they then really meant what they now say they did, it was idle <em>to </em>call the bargee.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">On the merits plainly the judge\u2019s findings were not \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-9\">Decrees affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
