Ristich v. People of the State of Illinois, 327 U.S. 810, <em>66 </em>S.Ct. 970, 90 L.Ed. 1034. It also appears that prior to the filing of his petition for a habeas corpus in this cause, petitioner filed petitions for a writ of habeas corpus in the Circuit Court of Will County, Illinois, the county in which he is incarcerated, in the Criminal Court of Cook County, Illinois, and in the Supreme Court of Illinois, all of which were denied, and that upon denial of these petitions he filed petitions in the Supreme Court of the United States for writs of certiorari to the Circuit Court of Will County, Illinois, Criminal Court of Cook County, Illinois, and to the Supreme Court of Illinois. The United States Supreme Court refused to entertain his contentions and on October 14, 1946, denied the writs. Ris-tich v. Ragen, 67 S.Ct. 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Under the provisions of 28 U.S.C. A. \u00a7 466, in an appeal \u201cfrom a final decision by a court of the United States in a proceeding in habeas corpus where the detention complained of is by virtue of process issued out of a State court,\u201d a certificate of probable cause is a jurisdictional prerequisite to such an appeal, Bilik v. Strassheim, 212 U.S. 551, 29 S.Ct. 684, 53 L. Ed. 649; Ex parte Patrick, 212 U.S. 555, 29 S.Ct. 686, 53 L.Ed. 650; Dorsey v. Gill, App.D.C., 148 F.2d 857, 877; and United States ex rel. White v. Ragen, 7 Cir., 153 F.2d 778, but even when the District Court denies a certificate of probable cause, it yet remains the duty of the judges of the Circuit Court of Appeals to consider whether the case is one m which a certificate of probable cause should be issued. House v. Mayo, 324 U.S. 42, 65 S.Ct, 517, 89 L.Ed. 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">In this state of the record and due consideration thereof, and upon the authority of White v. Ragen, 324 U.S. 760, 764, 65 S.Ct. 978, 89 L.Ed. 1348, we are impelled to the conclusion that there exists no probable cause for an appeal anil that his petition should be denied and die appeal dismissed. It is so ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
