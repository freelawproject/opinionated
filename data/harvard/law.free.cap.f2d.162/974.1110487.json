Family partnerships are not ipso facto illegal under Federal law but such partnerships must be shown to be accompanied by investment of capital, participation in management, rendition of services by the family partners, or by such other indicia as will definitely demonstrate the actuality, the reality, and the bona fides of the arrangement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">In Allen v. Beazley, 5 Cir., 157 F.2d 970, at page 973, the writer, speaking for the Court, said:</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">\u201cWe are aware of the suspicion with which the taxing authorities and the Courts view family partnerships and arrangements which have the effect of dividing the family income among the members of that family. We are also fully cognizant of the salutary principles so frequently announced that the courts are interested in who has command over the income and for whose benefit it is applied rather than the legal niceties of the title and ownership. [Citing cases.]</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">\u201cWe know, also, that the <em>taxing </em>authorities may \u2014 and we think that they should\u2014 look at the actualities, the substance, the realities, and not the form of the transaction, in determining such tax liabilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-8\">Any family partnership that is real, actual, bona fide, and valid under the law of the state of its domicile is valid for Federal income tax purposes, and in determining the actuality and bona fides of the partnership agreement it is appropriate, among other things, to inquire:</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-10\">(a) Whether the arrangement is between the head of the family and members of his family to whom he owes the obligation of support, and the dominant purpose of the scheme is merely to provide such support and at the same time to divide the income tax consequences among such members of his family;</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-11\">(b) Whether there have been any contributions of their own capital by the other members of the family or any sustained contributions of substantial services to the management or operation of the business;</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-12\">(c) Whether there have been any proportionate distributions of earnings to the members of the alleged partnership;</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-13\">(d) Whether the partnership was established merely to be an operating enterprise from which the dominant head kept in himself the title to physical assets of great value that ordinarity would be highly appropriate to the operation;</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-14\">(e) Whether the power of unfettered command and control over the partnership, its assets, its business, and its profits is retained in, or conferred upon, the family head ;</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-15\">(f) Whether such a partnership interest is unalienable by a partner, or was transferred to him upon condition that he make a will for the return, upon his death, of such interest to his transferor;</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-16\">(g) Whether there is an absence of public notoriety as to the formation or operation of the partnership;</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-17\">(h) Whether large profits were being presently realized or shortly to be anticipated by the head of the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-18\">We cannot catalogue here all of the incidents that may have some probative force in the determination as to whether or not an alleged family partnership is a matter of substance or shadow, but such a determination is ess\u00e9ntial to the solution of cases like the one before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-19\">The facts are fully set out in the opinion of the Tax Court and need not be repeated here- We cannot say that there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"977\">*977</page-number>is a lack of substantial evidence to support the finding as to the lack of reality in the claimed partnership, nor was there error in the application by that Court of the prevailing legal principles to the facts so found.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-4\">The order of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1029-17\"> The opinion of the Tax Court, with full statement of facts, is fully reported in 7 T.C. 182.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1029-18\"> Lusthaus v.
