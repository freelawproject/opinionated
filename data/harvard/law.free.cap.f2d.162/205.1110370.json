That would indeed be an issue which, as between the trustee and himself, the bankruptcy court could decide. The difficulty is that any order, which it might make, would conclude, neither the bankrupt\u2019s sister, nor anyone else interested in the estate of the bankrupt\u2019s father. In the Surrogate\u2019s Court, on the other hand, all interested parties can be joined, and the rights of all can be finally adjudicated. That is obviously the proper forum, and the trustee must be left free and should assert his rights there with all speed that he can, for the matter has been too long delayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-20\">Judge Campbell\u2019s order of May 28, 1942, only forbad the father\u2019s executor to distribute the estate until the bankrupt\u2019s interest had been determined in the bankruptcy proceeding. That does not prevent the trustee from pressing for a decree in the Surrogate\u2019s Court, with which he can return to the bankruptcy court and get its \u201cdetermination.\u201d The order does not prescribe how the bankruptcy court shall determine the bankrupt\u2019s interest; one way would be by an estoppel. If the order meant more than this it was certainly inadvertent, and may be regarded as modified by the order now on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-21\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
