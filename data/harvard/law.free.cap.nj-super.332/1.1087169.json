In reaching its decision, the Board adopted a determination of the Appeal Tribunal which found that claimant had left her employment voluntarily for personal reasons not attributable to the work, and was therefore ineligible for the benefits she sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">The legal basis of that determination was stated to be the principle that \u201c[a] claimant who leaves work for a personal reason, no matter how compelling, is subject to disqualification.\u201d The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Self v. Board of Review, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>453, 453 A.2d 170 (1982) was cited as the authority for that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">Claimant\u2019s testimony was the only evidence before the Appeal Tribunal. She testified that she had been employed by Micro Health Systems (Micro) in West Orange as a \u201ccollector\u201d since October 28, 1996. She lived in Passaic, and the commute to her job was \u201c15 minutes/20 minutes top.\u201d Sometime in early 1998, Micro moved its business operations to Somerset. Claimant testified that the move increased her commuting time to a usual \u201chour and 15 minutes, hour 20 minutes.... sometimes two hours.\u201d She also testified that the commute became particularly difficult because of road construction after she returned to work from maternity leave some four months following the birth of her third child on April 12, 1998. On August 11, 1998, she telephoned her employer and \u201ctold him I have to quit my job because I can\u2019t take the pressure and I had a lot of problem [sic] with my family life, my husband\u201d in addition to the stresses of traveling the longer distance to work. Claimant continued in her testimony to recount how her mother, after agreeing to provide day care for the new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>baby, had become ill and could not so do, requiring claimant to hire someone for the twelve hours claimant was away from home. Because of the additional cost of day care for the increased time claimant was away by reason of the longer commute, and \u201cthe tolls, plus the gas money and everything else[,]\u201d claimant \u201ccouldn\u2019t cope with the pressure.\u201d Claimant offers on appeal facts not in the record before us and not material in our review bearing upon the job she found instead after several months of searching for new employment. <em>See In re Kovalsky, </em>195 <em>N.J.Super. </em>91, 99, 477 A.2d 1295 (App.Div.1984) (noting that a matter \u201craised for the first time on appeal [which] is not supported by the record is not properly before\u201d the reviewing court).</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The Appeal Tribunal found, in part, that claimant \u201cleft work voluntarily because of the stress of commuting to work combined with the pressure from her family life[.]\u201d We take this to be a determination that the reason for plaintiffs quit was personal to some extent and that her personal difficulties were exacerbated, if not caused, by the much longer commute required by the employer\u2019s relocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">\u201cThe purpose of the [Unemployment Compensation Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:21-1 to -65,] is to provide some income for the worker earning nothing, because he is out of work <em>through no fault or act of his own. </em>...\u201d <em>Yardville Supply Co. v. Board of Review, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>371, 375, 554 A.2d 1337 (1989) (quoting <em>Schock v. Board of Review, </em>89 <em>N.J.Super. </em>118, 125, 214 A.2d 40 (App.Div.1965), <em>aff'd, </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>121, 223 A.2d 633 (1966) (quoting <em>Battaglia v. Board of Review, </em>14 <em>N.J.Super. </em>24, 27, 81 A.2d 186 (App.Div.1951))); <em>see also Brady v. Board of Review, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>197, 212, 704 A.2d 547 (1997). \u201c[T]he Act is to be liberally construed in favor of claimant to effectuate its remedial purposes.... \u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">In <em>Bateman v. Board of Review, </em>163 <em>N.J.Super. </em>518, 395 A.2d 250 (App.Div.1978), we upheld the Board\u2019s disqualification decision on the facts developed therein, but observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-9\">[A] case could possibly be envisaged in which a sudden change in employment circumstances greatly increasing the commuting distance from home to job would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>properly be regarded as a condition attributable to the work rather than to the employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 521, 395 A.2d 250.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-8\">In <em>Self, </em>on which the Board relied for its decision in this case, the Supreme Court discussed our <em>dictum </em>in <em>Bateman, </em>distinguishing the principle announced from the case at hand on the facts, but inferentially recognizing its validity as a rule of approach. <em>See Self, supra, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>at 459-60, 453 A.2d 170. Consequently, a case raising a genuine issue generally of the type involved here must be evaluated by weighing the extent to which the employee\u2019s reasons for leaving the job stemmed from a reasonable response to the employer\u2019s conduct against the extent to which those reasons bespoke purely personal choices made by the employee, <em>i.e., </em>not reasonably related to the conditions of employment alone. <em>See Gerber v. Board of Review, </em>313 <em>N.J.Super. </em>37, 43-44, 712 A.2d 688 (App.Div.1998). \u201cThe test to be applied in determining \u2018good cause\u2019 under the Act is one of \u2018ordinary common sense and prudence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 46, 712 A.2d 688 (quoting <em>Brady, supra, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>at 214, 704 A.2d 547).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-9\">We hold that the Board erred in applying <em>Self </em>as embodying a mandatory rule of disqualification. We regard the Board\u2019s brief on appeal, as well, to overstate the barring effects of <em>Self </em>in characterizing it as holding that all \u201cemployees who leave work because of transportation or commuting difficulties leave without good cause attributable to the work and are disqualified for unemployment benefits.\u201d <em>Self </em>and <em>Bateman, </em>especially with the gloss of <em>Brady </em>and <em>Gerber, </em>and in the light of <em>Yardville, Schock, </em>and <em>Battaglia, </em>stand instead for the proposition that a discrete balancing and evaluation of all factors is required in cases of this type where, as a <em>prima facie </em>matter, the claimant has made a showing of substantially increased commuting distance by reason of the employer\u2019s relocation, with significant personal inconvenience attributable to the move.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-10\">The facts in this matter present a close question, but it is the Board\u2019s function to apply its expertise in making well-considered evaluative judgments in close cases by applying correct views of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>the legal tests that govern. Here, at bottom, the Board must decide whether claimant\u2019s job quit was reasonably the product of her employer\u2019s choice to relocate and, therefore, attributable to the employer; or whether it was wholly or essentially a reaction to the stresses of claimant\u2019s personal life and, therefore, attributable to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the Board\u2019s disqualification decision and remand for a determination whether, in the circumstances, claimant\u2019s conduct in quitting her job was an objectively reasonable response to the employer\u2019s choice to relocate, satisfying the \u201cthrough no fault or act of his own\u201d standard of <em>Brady, Yardville, Schock </em>and <em>Battaglia; </em>or whether claimant\u2019s action was, instead, primarily motivated by personal factors which, however related to the move, were essentially independent of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
