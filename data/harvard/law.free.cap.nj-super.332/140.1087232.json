Plaintiffs attributed the outages to defendants\u2019 negligence in operations, maintenance, and planning for a predictable event. Defendants moved without success to dismiss in favor of the primary jurisdiction of the Board of Public Utilities (the Board).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">We granted defendants\u2019 motion for leave to appeal the denial of their motion to dismiss. <em>R. </em>2:2-3(b); <em>R. </em>2:5-6. Defendants argue here that the Board must consider plaintiffs\u2019 claims before a court does, in order to preserve the integrity of its oversight functions. Plaintiffs and the Board, as amicus, disagree. The Board asserts that it has finished its investigation of the power outages and has ordered appropriate measures to prevent a recurrence. It declares that trial of this case in the Law Division will not prejudice the Board or the public interest as long as any new issue within its exclusive jurisdiction is referred to it. No such issue is presently identified. Defendants also argue that plaintiffs have no right to a jury trial of their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">We conclude that the Law Division judge properly retained jurisdiction over these claims, rather than defer to the Board. We affirm that decision. Future developments may require reference of certain issues to the Board, but not at present.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">This is the procedural background. On July 20,1999 the <em>Muise </em>plaintiffs, individual and business customers of the public utility\u2019s electrical service, filed a class-action complaint against GPU, Inc., and related entities, alleging damage \u201cas a result of electrical power interruption and/or electrical deficiency and/or power fail<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>ures and blackouts.\u201d They alleged that those defendants failed \u201cto properly and adequately prepare for and anticipate the demand for electricity,\u201d and pleaded negligence, breach of contract, breach of warranty, intentional misrepresentation, failure to warn, fraud, and consumer fraud. They sought compensatory damages, treble damages pursuant to the consumer fraud statutes, punitive damages, and a jury trial on all issues. The defendants denied liability and asserted numerous affirmative defenses which included the Board\u2019s primary jurisdiction and the court\u2019s lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">On July 22, 1999 the <em>Tzcmnetakis </em>plaintiffs, who were also individual and business customers of the public utility\u2019s electrical service, filed a class-action complaint against GPU, Inc., and other related entities, also alleging damage from the failure of those defendants \u201cto provide safe and reliable delivery of energy in the form of electrical power.\u201d They alleged that those defendants should have known that their infrastructure and maintenance were inadequate to furnish service as represented and required. They pleaded many theories of liability, including negligence, strict liability, fraud, misrepresentation, breach of warranty, breach of contract, and consumer fraud. They sought compensatory damages, treble damages pursuant to the consumer fraud statutes, punitive damages of at least $350,000 \u201cper claimant,\u201d and a trial by jury \u201con all issues so triable.\u201d The defendants denied liability and asserted the same defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">On October 8, 1999 the parties consented to consolidate the <em>Muise </em>and <em>Tzannetakis </em>actions. On October 12, 1999 the judge granted class certification, denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss in favor of the Board\u2019s primary jurisdiction, and denied a motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. Defendants later abandoned their exhaustion contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">At the October 12, 1999 hearing, the judge said that he would deny defendants\u2019 motion for a stay, which defendants had not yet formally filed, in order to allow discovery and class notification to proceed. On October 18, 1999 the judge memorialized the grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>of class certification and the denial of defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. The order defined the class as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-5\">All customers of GPU Energy in New Jersey including, but not limited to, customers in Monmouth and Ocean Counties, and all dependents, tenants, employees and other intended beneficiaries of customers of GPU Energy in New Jersey including, but not limited to, Monmouth and Ocean Counties, who suffered damages as a result of the failure of GPU Energy to deliver electricity during the week beginning Sunday, July 4, 1999. The officers, directors and agents of the defendants are specifically excluded from the class. Any persons with claims for personal injury arising out of the power outages are excluded from the class.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The order also appointed the <em>Muise </em>plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and the <em>Tzannetakis </em>plaintiffs\u2019 counsel as \u201ccounsel for the class.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">On January 11, 2000 we granted defendants\u2019 motion for leave to appeal in order to determine the proper forum for these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">The Board has the power of \u201cgeneral supervision and regulation of and jurisdiction and control over all public utilities ... and their property, property rights, equipment, facilities and franchises so far as may be necessary for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Title.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:2-13. It also has the power to set \u201cjust and reasonable standards, classifications, regulations, practices, measurements or service to be furnished, imposed, observed, and followed\u201d by a public utility. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:2-25(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">The Board\u2019s powers include ordering a public utility to comply with laws and ordinances, maintain a \u201csystem of accounts\u201d in a prescribed manner, furnish periodic detailed reports, and notify the Board of any accident upon the utility\u2019s property \u201cor indirectly arising from or connected with its maintenance or operations.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:2-16. In addition, the Board may \u201c[ijnvestigate upon its own initiative or upon complaint in writing any matter concerning any public utility.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:2-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">The Board may order a public utility \u201cto furnish safe, adequate and proper service, including furnishing and performance of service in a manner that tends to conserve and preserve the quality of the environment and prevent the pollution of the waters, land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>and air of this State, and including furnishing and performance of service in a manner which preserves and protects the water quality of a public water supply, and to maintain its property and equipment in such condition as to enable it to do so.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:2-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">If a management audit, to be conducted every three to six years by Board staff or consultants, demonstrates \u201cthat any of the operating procedures or any other internal workings of the affected utility are inefficient, improvident, unreasonable, negligent or an abuse of discretion,\u201d the Board may hold a hearing and order the utility \u201cto adopt such new or altered practices and procedures as the board shall find to be necessary to promote efficient and adequate service to meet the public convenience and necessity.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:2-16.4. The Board would also determine the \u201creasonable and proper costs and expenses\u201d of such measures and recognize them \u201cas proper business expenses.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>48:2-16.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">The regulations set technical standards for the construction of new utility facilities and installations. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>14:3-2.1 to -2.5. They must be \u201cin accordance with standard utility practice,\u201d and utilities must \u201cmake reasonable efforts to protect the public and its property from injury or damage and shall exercise due care to reduce hazards\u201d that their \u201cequipment and facilities\u201d may pose. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>14:3-2.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">Under the regulations\u2019 general maintenance provisions, a utility \u201cshall have and maintain its entire plant in such condition as will enable it to furnish safe, proper and adequate service.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>14:3-2.6. It also \u201cshall inspect its equipment and facilities at sufficiently frequent intervals to disclose conditions, if existing, which would interfere with safe, adequate and proper service, and shall promptly take corrective action where conditions disclosed by such inspection so warrant,\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>14:3-2.7(a), and must do so as well for the poles and towers that it owns or uses. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>14:3-2.7(e). It must \u201cexercise reasonable diligence to avoid interruptions, curtailments or deficiencies ... of service____\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>14:3-3.9(a). The only specific maintenance provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>require a utility to follow \u201cestablished practice\u201d for inspecting and maintaining \u201clamps and street lighting accessories,\u201d and not to reinstall a removed transformer, high-tension insulator, or \u201cequipment\u201d without reinspeeting it for \u201csafety and serviceability.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>14:5-1.9.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">The regulations mandate that \u201c[pjlanned interruptions for operating reasons shall always be preceded by reasonable notice to all affected customers, and the work shall be planned so as to minimize customer inconvenience.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>14:3-3.9(c). There is no provision in the statutes or regulations to penalize a utility which fails to give such notice. In the event of an unplanned service interruption or \u201cdeficiency,\u201d the utility must restore service \u201cas promptly as possible consistent with safe practice.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>14:3-3.9(a). Utilities must also keep records of \u201cmajor\u201d interruptions \u201cin a manner suitable for analysis for the purpose of minimizing possible future interruptions.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>14:3-3.9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">In 1999, defendants provided electric service to 988,000 customers in two large areas within New Jersey, a northern region comprising all or part of eight counties and a southern region comprising all or part of five other counties. Their tariff covering the period contained two provisions with representations about the continuity of service:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">4.01 Continuity of Service: The Company will use reasonable diligence to provide a regular and uninterrupted supply of service, but should the supply be interrupted, curtailed, or discontinued by the Company for any of the reasons set forth in Section 8 of these Standard Terms and Conditions, or should the supply of sendee be interrupted, curtailed, deficient, defective or fail by reason of any natural disaster, accident, act of a third party, strike, legal process, governmental interference ... or other cause whatsoever beyond its control, the Company shall not be liable for any loss or damage, direct or consequential, resulting from [it].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">8.01 Work on Company\u2019s Facilities: The Company may, upon reasonable notice when it can be reasonably given, suspend, curtail, or interrupt the supply of service to a customer for the purpose of making repairs, changes, or improvements to or in any of its facilities either on or off the customer\u2019s premises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">The power outages which generated this case occurred from July 3 through July 8, 1999 (the period). A July 23, 1999 report from defendants to the Board on the \u201cweather related electric utility outages\u201d outlined the specific problems defendants had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>reported relating to the outages, including the substations affected, and the daily repair work performed during the period. It stated the number of customers who were \u201cout of service,\u201d or who suffered a shorter or \u201crotating\u201d service interruption, as fewer than 100 on July 3, 1999, 1500 on July 4, 1999, 12,000 on July 5, 1999, 105,000 on July 6, 1999, 24,200 on July 7, 1999, and 23,700 on July 8, 1999. The defendants\u2019 report also described the models defendants had used for predicting service demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">On August 2, 1999 the Board sent defendants a notice that it was beginning an investigation. On August 9, 1999 the Department of Law and Public Safety asked defendants to submit certified answers to numerous questions about their operations, infrastructure, maintenance, and contingency planning in connection with the \u201cpower problems and outages\u201d during the period. The questions focused on defendants\u2019 operations and maintenance practices, the impact of the outage on operations, defendants\u2019 responses, and defendants\u2019 knowledge of past troubles or problems experienced by other utilities in similar situations. The questions also asked defendants to name the hospitals \u201caffected by outages or interruptions of electrical service,\u201d to provide \u201can hourly profile of the number of customers out of service\u201d during the period, and to identify the \u201careas\u201d affected by \u201crolling blackouts,\u201d along with the exact duration of the blackouts and the number of customers in each area.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">On August 10,1999 the Board requested proposals from private consulting firms to conduct an investigation of defendants and other utilities. The investigation\u2019s objective was to provide results the Board could use, in conjunction with information gathered by its staff, in determining \u201cwhether New Jersey\u2019s Electric Utilities under the Board\u2019s jurisdiction are providing safe and adequate service now or will be able to provide it in the future based on the far reaching changes taking place in the electric industry.\u201d The attached outline indicated that all proposals were to address the utilities\u2019 transmission and distribution systems, and their power generation and \u201csupply planning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>On September 1, 1999 the Board ordered its own investigation to proceed. During that same month, Stone &amp; Webster Management Consultants developed a response to the Board\u2019s request for proposals. On November 8, 1999 Stone &amp; Webster presented the proposal to the Board and projected the ability to submit a final report on February 22, 2000. The Board selected Stone &amp; Webster to perform the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">We granted leave to appeal on January 11, 2000 to review Judge Chaiet\u2019s decision to retain the matter for trial in the Law Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">On April 28, 2000 the Board issued an order accepting the final report of its staff on whether defendants and the other investigated utilities \u201chad provided safe, adequate and proper service during the July 1999 heat wave event.\u201d The order did not recite the staffs conclusion but it did direct defendant and the other utilities to follow the staffs recommendations, which it set forth. These recommendations included numerous measures for improving the ability to assess the extent of an outage, which the utilities were to \u201csubstantially implement\u201d by December 31, 2000 and other measures for communicating with government officials and customers, which had no target date for implementation. There were also specific \u201ctechnical recommendations,\u201d directed to defendants alone, for improving their \u201ccircuit revamping program,\u201d and for upgrading certain cables and related installations to improve reliability. These had no target date for completion. The order implied that the recommendations reflected the staffs assessment of the effectiveness of the recommendations contained in \u201cthe Board\u2019s prior Reliability and Storm Reports\u201d of December 1997 and December 1998, but it did not indicate the findings or conclusions of those reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">On May 1, 2000 the Board issued an order addressing the adequacy of defendants\u2019 performance during the period. The Board stated that the combination of weather conditions and increased business activity due to the holiday weekend \u201ccreated an unprecedented demand on GPU\u2019s system, 7.5% higher than the prior peak of 1988,\u201d which according to defendants\u2019 and PJM\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>forecasts would not occur until 2004. (PJM \u201crefers to the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland interconnection, a pooled power cooperative used by utilities in those three states.\u201d <em>In re Petition of Atlantic City Elec. Co., </em>310 <em>N.J.Super. </em>357, 362 n. 2, 708 A.2d 775 (App.Div.1998).) The order adopted Stone &amp; Webster\u2019s report, which found that the outages were \u201cprimarily attributable to\u201d the failure of two transmission transformers at the Red Bank substation which were similar in size to eighty-four others which had \u201cperformed as expected.\u201d On that basis, the Board found that \u201cthere is not a prima facie case demonstrating that overall GPU provided unsafe, inadequate or improper service to its customers.\u201d However, the Board did consider the outages \u201csignificant,\u201d because up to 105,000 of defendants\u2019 988,000 customers were without power on the same day during the period. It believed that \u201cGPU can improve its reliability from its decision-making process down to and including its maintenance program, record-keeping, and restoration performance and achieve measurable results for improved reliability.\u201d It further believed that \u201cGPU also must reexamine its workforce adequacy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The Board\u2019s order observed that defendants had responded to the outages and the Board\u2019s investigation by accelerating their capital-improvement projects for the years 2000, 2001, and 2002. The Board expressed three main areas of concern: defendants\u2019 decision to defer from 1998 to 2000 the installation of replacement transformers for Red Bank which had already been purchased; \u201cinaccurate and inadequate inspection and test records\u201d for the transformers in Red Bank that failed; and \u201cdiminished levels of workforce,\u201d as shown by the high average age of employees in certain maintenance positions, the absence of apprenticeship programs to train new ones, and \u201coverall outage restoration time statistics\u201d that were \u201cpoor.\u201d The order contained numerous provisions for defendants to improve maintenance, operations, planning, and workforce development, with the Board to monitor \u201con an ongoing basis\u201d defendants\u2019 compliance with this and prior orders. Some of the provisions required that defendants complete the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>work or furnish a report or plan by specific dates, which ranged from June 1, 2000 to January 31, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The BPU\u2019s May 1, 2000 order touched on two other matters. The first was the Legislature\u2019s mandate for the Board to prepare a new regulatory regime to reflect \u201cthe establishment of full retail competition\u201d in electric service, which the Board did not relate to the other subjects of the order set forth above. Perhaps, the Board meant to suggest that there was no reason to view that deregulatory mandate and the terms of the order as in conflict. The second was the existence of this Law Division action, which the Board did not regard as inconsistent with its own needs and functions, as long as the court remained \u201cmindful of areas as they develop in which the Board\u2019s expertise may be necessary.\u201d The May 1 order stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">We believe that by issuing this Order, monitoring GPU\u2019s compliance, and continuing to establish reliability standards, this Board is appropriately exercising its essential jurisdiction over this utility concerning outages and assuring that the utility provides reliable power to the public____ GPU will have to comply with any and all requirements that are the result of the reliability study now underway. We believe that in the circumstances herein this is the soundest use of the Board\u2019s resources, the approach best suited to our duty to the public to regulate utilities. <em>We are confident that in the Superior Court litigation, the parties and the Court u/ill be mindful of areas as they develop in which the Board\u2019s expertise may be necessary. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">In that light, and because of its general finding that defendants had not provided unsafe, inadequate, or improper service, the Board saw no reason at this juncture to take further action. Thus, the Board declined to exercise any \u201cprimary jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">Defendants claim that the Law Division judge erred by failing to defer to the Board\u2019s primary jurisdiction to make all the factual findings concerning plaintiffs\u2019 claims. They argue that the judge mistakenly believed that plaintiffs\u2019 claims did not involve the interpretation of the regulations or defendants\u2019 tariff, when the claims actually represented the regulatory issue of whether defendants had acted with \u201creasonable diligence\u201d to provide \u201csafe, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>adequate and proper service,\u201d and that such questions come under the Board\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction. They also argue that the reasonableness of their preventive measures can only be judged as part of the operational requirements the Board had decided to impose as the proper balance between serving the public need while allowing a reasonable rate of return under the tariff. Defendants argue that the Board had special, indeed preemptive, competence to judge the reasonableness of their preventive measures, and that judicial fact-finding would be duplicative at best while risking encroachment on the Board\u2019s ability to exercise its essential responsibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Defendants also claim that the court erred by overlooking the importance of the Board\u2019s primary, jurisdiction in the Legislature\u2019s scheme of regulating public utilities. They argue that a proliferation of court cases with disruptive implications for utilities\u2019 operations will destroy the uniformity of standards and legal interpretations which the Legislature has charged the Board with ensuring.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Plaintiffs argue that they have a common-law right to bring a tort damage action, that such actions traditionally are heard in court, and that the silence of the Board\u2019s enabling legislation on the question of customer tort claims means that the Legislature did not intend to preclude judicial jurisdiction. Plaintiffs further argue the exercise of primary jurisdiction is discretionary; even when a court decides to defer, the expertise to which it defers is an agency\u2019s ability to interpret its enabling act and regulations. Plaintiffs urge that the judge properly found that he did not need to interpret any statute or regulation to decide this case. Plaintiffs assert that judicial jurisdiction is concurrent with agency jurisdiction, so the Board\u2019s separate investigation here did not divest the court of jurisdiction. Plaintiffs contend that the Board now conclusively has conceded that it lacks jurisdiction over cases \u201cwhere plaintiffs seek damages as a result of a power outage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">The Board, appearing as amicus, <em>R. </em>1:13-9, declares that it has finished its investigation of the events in issue, and does not need to continue exercising jurisdiction concerning them. It argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>that primary jurisdiction is limited to preserving the prerogatives which the Legislature delegated within the Board\u2019s area of special expertise and that such jurisdiction does not divest courts of the authority to consider the types of claims for which a non-administrative remedy is available. The Board asserts that any possible conflict between its post-investigation monitoring and enforcement activity and the exercise of Superior Court jurisdiction is too speculative to require judicial deference at this time. The Board is satisfied to rely on the likelihood that the judge and the parties will identify issues which arise and are within its exclusive jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Plaintiffs make a similar argument: they admit that \u201ccertain discrete and collateral issues may arise during the course of this litigation which would require deference to or at least input from the BPU,\u201d but then add, as does the Board, that because those issues cannot be predicted now and because a trial court can be trusted to identify them when they arise, the judicial action should proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The Ratepayer Advocate makes arguments similar to plaintiffs\u2019; she adds that primary jurisdiction does not apply when an agency is unable to provide full relief, or when an agency\u2019s responsibility to foster the financial health of one party prevents neutrality, and that appropriate deference to the Board\u2019s expertise is afforded by simply admitting its staff report into evidence in the court proceeding. The staff report should not have preclusive effect, because the consultants on whom the staff relied were (1) identified with defendants\u2019 industry rather than neutral, (2) not charged with investigating plaintiffs\u2019 particular claims, and (3) not required to accept or reflect any input from plaintiffs. The Ratepayer Advocate also argues that there is a conflict of interest for the Board, which is charged with ensuring utilities a fair return on their investment, to adjudicate damage claims against defendants on which it would have to compel payment from utility revenues. The Ratepayer Advocate further urges that a court ruling will not conflict with the Board\u2019s authority to investigate and compel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>improvements in defendants\u2019 installations and operations, and asserts that the Board has not issued any standards or specific procedures for maintenance or prevention of the sort that defendants claim would be threatened by inconsistent court rulings. Finally, the Ratepayer Advocate argues that any preference for primary jurisdiction must be weighed against the disadvantages of delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">The Law Division judge characterized primary jurisdiction as posing the question of whether the complaints presented issues \u201cthat require the special competence of an administrative agency.\u201d He found they did not because the issues were \u201cwhether GPU acted reasonably in supplying electricity and whether [GPU] breached their duty to their customers,\u201d and those issues \u201cdo not involve the interpretation of the tariff, nor do they concern the rates and regulations of the electricity industry nor the interpretation thereof.\u201d In addition, in the context of rejecting the motion that defendants made to dismiss for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and have since abandoned, the judge found that the Board\u2019s expertise was \u201cnot critical\u201d for addressing the \u201cbasic concepts of negligence\u201d which will govern this case, and that the court could not override the Board\u2019s articulated disinclination to \u201cresolve the damage claims in this particular matter.\u201d The judge added that he was retaining jurisdiction to \u201cgive those who have been damaged an even-sided forum to resolve ... those claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">We do not owe deference to the Law Division judge\u2019s determination of the legal question of whether the Board has primary jurisdiction. We are not bound by a trial-level judge\u2019s \u201cconstruction of the legal principles.\u201d <em>Lombardo v. Hoag, </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>36, 47, 634 A.2d 550 (App.Div.1993), <em>certif. denied, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>469, 640 A.2d 850 (1994). \u201cA trial court\u2019s interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts are not entitled to any special deference.\u201d <em>Manalapan Realty v. Township Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Where the Board has issued its opinion finding it had fulfilled its statutory responsibilities and there was no current prospect of identifying an issue which would suggest it ought to retain jurisdiction, those findings are entitled to deference. The agency has the authority to interpret its enabling legislation, and the discretion to determine the scope of its mandate and the means needed to fulfill it. \u201cThe grant of authority to an administrative agency is to be liberally construed to enable the agency to accomplish the Legislature\u2019s goals,\u201d <em>Gloucester Cty. Welfare Bd. v. State Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>384, 390, 461 A.2d 575 (1983), and the agency\u2019s construction of its enabling act \u201cwill prevail\u201d if not plainly unreasonable, <em>Merin v. Maglaki, </em>126 <em>N.J. </em>430, 437, 599 A.2d 1256 (1992). When such a \u201cquasi-legislative\u201d decision reflects \u201cagency expertise,\u201d we must \u201caccord due deference to the policy views of the agency.\u201d <em>In re Bergen County Bd. of Chosen Freeholders v. Bergen County Prosecutor, </em>172 <em>N.J.Super. </em>363, 369, 412 A.2d 130 (App.Div.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">In this case, the Board presently is not asserting its prerogative of statutory interpretation of areas the Legislature declared to be within its exclusive jurisdiction due to its special expertise but rather asserts a factual conclusion the events in issue raise only ordinary questions of negligence, the type no participant in this appeal argues are within its special expertise. The Board\u2019s assessment that judicial jurisdiction does not currently appear to infringe on its statutory mandate merits the type of deference the above authorities recommend.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The Board\u2019s present position accords with the extant case law on primary jurisdiction. Primary jurisdiction is defined as the circumstance in which a \u201ccourt declines original jurisdiction and refers to the appropriate body those issues which, under a regulatory scheme, have been placed within the special competence of an administrative body.\u201d <em>Daaleman v. Elizabethtown Gas Co., </em>77 <em>N.J. </em>267, 269 n. 1, 390 A.2d 566 (1978). The doctrine is related to the practice of requiring the exhaustion of administrative remedies. <em>Boldt v. Correspondence Management, Inc., </em>320 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>74, 88, 726 A.2d 975 (App.Div.1999) (quoting <em>Boss v. Rockland Elec. Co., </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>38, 40, 468 A.2d 1055 (1983)). In primary jurisdiction, \u201cthe case is properly before the court, but agency expertise is required to resolve the questions presented\u201d; by contrast, when a court relies on exhaustion, it \u201cis saying that the case ought to have been brought before the administrative agency in the first place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 83-84, 726 A.2d 975. <em>See Village of Ridgefield Park v. New York, S &amp; W Ry.

WorldCom, Inc., </em>944 <em>F.Supp. </em>352, 357 (D.N.J.1996); <em>Campione v. Adamar of N.J., </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>245, 264, 714 A.2d 299 (1998). For example, <em>Daaleman </em>was a class action in which the plaintiffs alleged that the utility over-billed by overstating an item permitted under the tariff. 77 <em>N.J. </em>at 268, 390 A.2d 566. The Court found that the allegations did not satisfy the Consumer Fraud Act, that the only remaining issue was whether the tariff permitted the charge in issue, and that an issue of tariff interpretation was within the Board\u2019s expertise and its exclusive jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 271-73, 390 A.2d 566. In <em>Glen View Dev. Co. v. Public Serv. Elec. &amp; Gas, Co., </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>304, 306, 271 A.2d 903 (1970), the only dispute was whether the utility, rather than the developer, had to pay to satisfy the municipal requirement that electrical lines to the development be placed underground, because underground lines were necessary for safe and adequate electric service. The Court held that technical expertise needed to determine the requisites of safe and adequate service placed the issue within the Board\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 307, 271 A.2d 903; <em>see also In re Penn Cent. Passenger Station, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>400, 402-04, 273 A.2d 42 (1971) (order for station improvements was within the Board\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction to determine the requirements of safe and reliable service).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>The other main purpose of primary jurisdiction is to preserve uniformity in the interpretation and application of an agency\u2019s regulations. The <em>Campione </em>Court explained this purpose in the context of legalized gambling, an industry regulated as comprehensively as. a public utility.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">The pervasiveness of the regulatory scheme controlling the casino industry indicates that the Legislature intended to invest the [Casino Control Commission] with primary jurisdiction to regulate the casino industry. To the extent that the resolution of a plaintiffs claim depends on an interpretation of the Act or administrative regulations, the CCC should have the first opportunity to provide that interpretation. A referral to the CCC should assure the resolution of the controversy consistent with the views of the entity best positioned to consider the matter. Retaining primary jurisdiction in the courts could dislocate the intricate regulatory structure governing a sensitive industry. Permitting courts and juries across the State to interpret statutory and administrative regulations could introduce confusion where uniformity is needed. The lack of uniform interpretations, in turn, could effect the stability of the industry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\"><em>[Campione, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>at 264, 714 A.2d 299.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The general test for when a court should defer to an agency\u2019s primary jurisdiction is: deference is appropriate only if \u201cto deny the agency\u2019s power to resolve the issues in question\u201d would be inconsistent with the \u201cstatutory scheme\u201d which vested the agency \u201cwith the authority to regulate [the] industry or activity\u201d it oversees. <em>United States ex rel. Haskins v. Omega Inst., Inc., </em>11 F.Supp.2d 555, 561 (D.N.J.1998). We recently have described four prongs for the test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">The factors to be considered in deciding whether to invoke the doctrine include 1) whether the matter at issue is within the conventional experience of judges; 2) whether the matter is peculiarly within the agency\u2019s discretion, or requires agency expertise; 3) whether inconsistent rulings might pose the danger of disrupting the statutory scheme; and 4) whether prior application has been made to the agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-9\"><em>[Boldt, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 85, 726 A.2d 975 (citing <em>IPCO, </em>944 <em>F.Supp. </em>at 356).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">But, primary jurisdiction cannot be invoked when the claim is outside the agency\u2019s jurisdiction, or when the remedy for such a claim is outside the agency\u2019s power. In <em>Brooks v. Public Serv. Elec. &amp; Gas, </em>1 <em>N.J.A.R. </em>243, 243-44 (1981), the petitioner, a customer of the utility, filed a court action claiming damages for the utility\u2019s negligence in failing to restore electric service within a reasonable time following a hurricane and in not notifying him. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>The court transferred the matter to the Board, on the ground that the Board had jurisdiction \u201cof a dispute concerning \u2018the supplying or nonsupplying of power.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243-44. The Board transferred it to the Office of Administrative Law as a contested case. The administrative law judge found that the Board lacked statutory authority \u201cto decide common law tort actions in any respect,\u201d that the Legislature could not constitutionally grant such authority by statute, and that any tariff would be \u201cconstitutionally defective\u201d to the extent that- it was \u201cfound to control, by its terms, the determination of a common law tort action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 244-46. The question of the utility\u2019s duty should be resolved by the common law and a jury, rather than by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>14:3-3.9\u2019s standards for providing and restoring service and the coordinate tariff provisions. <em>Id. </em>at 246. Those principles would be no different if the case were a class action, because the amount of damages which the utility might have to pay could not defeat \u201cconstitutional jury trial rights.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Defendants attempt to distinguish <em>Brooks </em>as involving a singular, simple negligence claim which did not implicate Board standards or policy because, unlike in the cases before us, the plaintiff made no assertions about the utility\u2019s system-wide facilities or operations. An inquiry into the operational, construction, or maintenance mistakes which deprived one customer of electric service perhaps may be different in nature, not just in scope, from an inquiry into how such mistakes deprived many customers of electric service. Nonetheless, as <em>Brooks </em>indicates, the nature of a plaintiffs claim is not diluted simply because there are many plaintiffs with such claims. 1 <em>N.J.A.R. </em>at 246.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">When a claim presents some issues that are within an agency\u2019s special expertise and others which are not, the proper course is for the court to refer the former to the agency, and then to apply the agency\u2019s findings or conclusions to its determination of the remaining issues. Our courts have repeatedly followed this approach. In <em>Boss, </em>which concerned a utility easement across private property, the Court found that the question of how much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>tree removal within the easement was required for the utility to provide safe and reliable service, while at the same time avoiding an infringement of the property-owner\u2019s rights which would amount to a taking, was a contested factual issue within the Board\u2019s expertise. 95 <em>N.J. </em>at 41-42, 468 A.2d 1055. The Court remanded for the trial court to refer that question to the Board for \u201cfact finding,\u201d and then to apply the Board\u2019s findings \u201cagainst the legal issues to be resolved\u201d in reaching a final decision. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\"><em>Boldt </em>was a class-action suit in which we took the same approach. The class-action plaintiffs in that case sought to recover overcharges by physicians and by medical facilities for providing copies of medical records. 320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 77-78, 726 A.2d 975. They also sought injunctions and damages under the Consumer Fraud Act. There were regulations for the copying fees which physicians and medical institutions could charge. We found that the physicians\u2019 facial violation of the $l-per-page limit which the regulations set on charges by physicians did not raise any issue of how to interpret the regulations, so the plaintiffs could proceed \u25a0with their claims against the physicians in court without exhausting their administrative remedies, and we reversed the dismissal of the complaint. <em>Id. </em>at 79-81, 726 A.2d 975.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">However, the regulations allowed medical institutions to charge a copying fee \u201cbased on actual costs,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 81, 726 A.2d 975, which implicated both \u201cthe complexities of hospital cost structures\u201d which required agency expertise to understand, as well as the uniformity of \u201cdefinition and application,\u201d an issue only an agency determination could answer. <em>Id. </em>at 86-88, 726 A.2d 975. We concluded the interests of justice required referral of the question of the medical institutions\u2019 costs to the agency under the primary jurisdiction doctrine, with the trial court to apply the agency\u2019s findings to the plaintiffs\u2019 overcharge claims. <em>Id. </em>at 87-88, 726 A.2d 975.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">In <em>Campione, </em>where the plaintiff claimed a casino discriminated against him for counting cards, 155 <em>N.J. </em>at 249, 714 A.2d 299, the Court held that there was a common-law cause of action for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>discrimination within the jurisdiction of the Superior Court. <em>Id. </em>at 266, 714 A.2d 299. However, on the particular question of whether the Casino Control Commission\u2019s regulations \u201cimplicitly permitted casinos to apply a separate set of rules to card counters seated at the same table as other patrons,\u201d the Court directed the Law Division to remand to the Commission \u201cso that the agency may interpret its own regulations,\u201d the \u201ckind\u201d of issue that is \u201cespecially suited\u201d for primary jurisdiction. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">The federal courts have addressed whether a court should allow an agency which has primary jurisdiction to proceed first. When the issue is how to apply a regulation, it is appropriate for a court to \u201cpostpone such a decision to allow an administrative agency to make the initial decision\u201d when doing so will serve the purposes of primary jurisdiction, which generally are the \u201cUniformity of regulations and the use of the expert and specialized knowledge o.f the agency.\u201d <em>Shell Oil Co. v. Nelson Oil Co., Inc., </em>627 F.2d 228, 232 (Temp.Emer.Ct.App.), <em>cert./ denied, </em>449 <em>U.S. </em>1022, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>590, 66 L.Ed.2d 484 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Even when primary jurisdiction applies, the doctrine does not confer exclusive jurisdiction on an agency, with the attendant effect of limiting cognizable remedies to those within the agency\u2019s authority. On the contrary, a court can consider all judicial remedies, including damages, which are beyond the agency\u2019s authority; a legislative intent to defeat them will be inferred only if the Legislature has \u201cexplicitly limited the availability of that remedy or relief.\u201d <em>Boldt, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 87, 726 A.2d 975 (citing <em>Campione, </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>245, 262, 714 A.2d 299, and <em>Lally v. Copygraphics, </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>162, 178-79, 413 A.2d 960 (App.Div.1980), aff<em>'d, </em>85 <em>N.J. </em>668, 428 A.2d 1317 (1981)). The <em>Campione </em>Court held that the Casino Control Commission had primary jurisdiction \u201cto resolve issues concerning the interpretation of\u2019 the relevant statutes, regulations, and a casino\u2019s internal controls, but that the Legislature \u201cdid not intend to prevent patrons from seeking vindication of common-law claims in the courts.\u201d 155 <em>N.J. </em>at 260, 714 A.2d 299. The Legislature \u201cmay vest an administra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>tive agency with exclusive primary jurisdiction over common-law claims,\u201d but only if it does so expressly, and by \u201cexplicitly\u201d granting the agency the power to \u201caward damages in private matters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 260-62, 714 A.2d 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">In <em>Boldt, </em>while the agency had primary jurisdiction to determine whether the medical institutions had in fact overcharged, it did not have the authority to award damages for overcharging. There was no indication that the Legislature intended to divest the plaintiffs of the right to such common-law damages. 320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 87-88, 726 A.2d 975. For that reason, the agency could not be regarded as having exclusive jurisdiction; instead, the trial court would take the agency\u2019s findings on \u201cactual costs\u201d and use them in determining damages. <em>Id. </em>at 88, 726 A.2d 975. Of particular interest perhaps, in the case before us, is that the damages to the plaintiffs are quite varied, perhaps almost unique to each plaintiff, and do not share a common quality, like copying costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">In <em>New Jersey Div., Horsemen\u2019s Benevolent Protective Ass\u2019n v. New Jersey Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>251 <em>N.J.Super. </em>589, 598 A.2d 1243 (App.Div.1991), we found that the Racing Commission did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the claim. The Commission\u2019s enabling statute conferred the supervisory power of compelling the submission of audits of certain charitable trusts, but the statute was \u201caltogether silent as to what remedies are available and to whom and in what forum\u201d when the Commission failed to exercise that power, such as by failing to enforce a charitable trust. <em>Id. </em>at 602-03, 598 A.2d 1243. The statute \u201chardly constitute[d] a vesting of exclusive supervisory or adjudicatory jurisdiction in\u201d the Commission, and it could not be said to \u201cbespeak an intention to impinge upon the Superior Court\u2019s constitutionally conferred \u2018original general jurisdiction throughout the State in all causes,\u201d\u2019 given its silence on the point and the fact that matters of trust enforcement were within the recognized expertise of the Chancery Division and outside the special competence of the Racing Commission. <em>Id. </em>at 603-06, 598 A.2d 1243.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>In terms of the case before us, these authorities suggest that certain questions about the provision of safe and adequate electric service are within the Board\u2019s exclusive jurisdiction, whereas customer damage claims against defendants for the negligent failure to provide such service are not. The Board\u2019s findings about whether defendants satisfied the regulations and complied with its orders could be probative of whether they had been negligent, but not determinative of the issue. Because the Board\u2019s findings would not control, the Board did not have exclusive \u201cprimary\u201d jurisdiction over these damage claims. Indeed, the Board lacked authority to consider the remedy of damages at all. The Legislature did not explicitly provide that the Board\u2019s lack of authority to award damages had the effect of divesting plaintiffs of that remedy. This lack of the Board\u2019s authority is an additional reason these claims belong in a court. No controlling principle suggests that the court was compelled to let the Board\u2019s investigation proceed first, but that question is moot because the Board has now declared its task concluded and did so during the pendency of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">We affirm Judge Chaiet\u2019s conclusion that the Board did not enjoy primary jurisdiction, or exclusive jurisdiction, over this damage action for ordinary negligence. On the remand, we direct the Law Division judge to grant intervenor status to the Attorney General and the Ratepayer Advocate. <em>R. </em>4:33. Both have expressed a keen desire to follow this matter on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Obviously, we are loathe to predict the nature of the issues which may arise on the remand which could trigger a legitimate desire on the part of defendants or amici to pursue a renewed application for transfer of discrete issues for consideration by the Board under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction. Such issues may surface on defendants\u2019 anticipated motion for summary judgment upon completion of discovery. Any such application for transfer to the agency will be for the Law Division judge to consider within the contours of the case law we have discussed and the issues which emerge upon the remand. We add that the Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>Division judge must decide in the first instance just what weight and validity to give the Board\u2019s findings and conclusions in its May 1, 2000 order. We regret that the matter at the moment is too abstract and novel for us to provide the judge with any more precise guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Finally, we consider defendants\u2019 claim that plaintiffs have no right to a jury trial. This was not ruled upon in the Law Division. We deem the issue important and consider it originally. <em>R. </em>2:10-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Defendants urge that there is no common-law relationship between the public and a regulated public utility, only that provided in the tariff. Thus, there is no recognition of a duty whose breach could support a cause of action with a right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-8\">Plaintiffs argue that they have a state constitutional right to a jury trial for their common-law negligence and contract causes of action. They contend that defendants focus too narrowly in characterizing this action as a uniquely modern \u201cclass-action against a utility,\u201d rather than one of a more prosaic nature, the class members\u2019 underlying tort and contract claims. The Ratepayer Advocate supports the plaintiffs\u2019 contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-9\">This issue has two components: immunity and right to a jury trial. Public utilities do not enjoy a general tort immunity. <em>Weinberg v. Dinger, </em>106 <em>N.J. </em>469, 472, 524 A.2d 366 (1987) (abrogating the immunity of private water companies from customer damage claim for negligent failure to provide sufficient water pressure at fire hydrant, except for certain subrogation claims); <em>Ebert v. South Jersey Gas Co., </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>104, 106-10, 615 A.2d 294 (Law Div.1992) (declining to apply the subrogation exception to <em>Weinberg\u2019s </em>abrogation of immunity), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>127, 704 A.2d 579 (App.Div.1998), <em>aff'd, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>135, 723 A.2d 599 (1999). In allowing the negligence claims to proceed, the <em>Weinberg </em>Court addressed only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>legitimacy of imposing on private water companies a duty to customers to avoid a negligent failure to provide sufficient hydrant pressure, despite the absence of such a provision in their tariffs, and whether such a duty would upset the existing allocation of responsibility between water companies and customers to take reasonable fire-prevention measures. 106 <em>N.J. </em>at 473-95, 524 A.2d 366. The Court did not imply that the case should be remanded to the Board for an initial finding on whether the utility had satisfied the regulations and other administrative standards. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Years before <em>Weinberg, </em>our Supreme Court rejected the proposition which defendants advance here, namely, that if a utility is in compliance with the Board\u2019s regulations and other standards for installations, operations, and maintenance, then as a matter of law it cannot be held liable for a service outage which occurs despite such compliance. In <em>Black v. Public Serv. Elec. &amp; Gas, Co., </em>56 <em>N.J. </em>63, 76-77, 265 A.2d 129 (1970), the utility was in compliance with the National Electrical Safety Code, which the Board had \u201capproved.\u201d The Court held that such compliance failed to establish as a matter of law that the utility could not be held liable, because the industry standards were m\u00ednimums for the handling of electrical wires that \u201cdo not establish the complete duty of the utility under all circumstances.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Nor is there authority for defendants\u2019 proposition that the tariff as a matter of law states the entirety of the relationship between a utility and its customers and is the sole source of the duties between them, much less the proposition\u2019s implication that a tariff can defeat or eviscerate common-law causes of action for negligence or breach of contract simply by failing to mention them. The chief cases defendants rely upon, <em>In re Application of Borough of Saddle River, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>14, 29, 362 A.2d 552 (1976), and <em>Essex County Welfare Bd. v. New Jersey Bell Tel. Co., </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>417, 421-22, 315 A.2d 40 (App.Div.1974), do not go this far. These cases say only that a tariff is \u201cthe law\u201d and \u201cnot a mere contract,\u201d with the effect that subscribers are bound by it whether or not they are aware of its provisions. <em>Ibid. </em>They do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>not address the meaning of a tariffs omissions, much less suggest that they can serve to preclude rights customers would otherwise have at common law. These authorities do not preclude a judicial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Turning to whether plaintiffs have the right to a jury in a civil trial, that right is guaranteed only for causes of action at law, not at equity. Even among causes at law, it is limited to those for which the common law provided such a right at the time \u201cwhen the New Jersey Constitution was adopted.\u201d <em>State v. Anderson, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>191, 207, 603 A.2d 928 (1992); <em>accord, State v. One 1990 Honda Accord, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>373, 377-78, 712 A.2d 1148 (1998), <em>Weinisch v. Sawyer, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>333, 342-33, 587 A.2d 615 (1991), and <em>Shaner v. Horizon Bancorp, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>433, 447, 561 A.2d 1130 (1989). Our Supreme Court has expressly declined to decide whether the guarantee references the common law as it stood in 1947 when the current constitution was adopted, in 1844 at the adoption of our earlier constitution, or in 1776 at the adoption of the original constitution. <em>Ibid. Cf. Insurance Co. of N. Am. v. Anthony Amadei Sand &amp; Gravel, Inc., </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>168, 175-76, 742 A.2d 550 (1999) (\u201cOnly those actions that triggered the right of a jury trial that predated our State Constitutions, and those that were created anew with enactment of New Jersey\u2019s 1776 Constitution, the 1844 Constitution, or the 1947 Constitution serve as the basis for that constitutional right today.\u201d (citing <em>One 1990 Honda Accord, Anderson, Weinisch, </em>and <em>Shaner)). See contra Town of Montclair v. Stanoyevich, </em>6 <em>N.J. </em>479, 485, 79 A.2d 288 (1951) (\u201cThe right of trial by jury protected in each of our .constitutions is the right as it existed at common law and remained on July 2, 1776.\u201d); <em>Ward v. Merrimack Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>162, 165, 711 A.2d 394 (App.Div.1998) (same); <em>Manetti v. Prudential Property &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>317, 320, 482 A.2d 520 (App.Div.1984) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Fortunately, in <em>One 1990 Honda Accord, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 378, 712 A.2d 1148, the Court observed that \u201c[a]s a practical matter, acceptance of one constitution or another probably does not affect the recognition of the right.\u201d At any rate, for determin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>ing the right to a civil jury, our courts look to the nature of the most appropriate remedy, not the nature of the cause of action. <em>Weinisch, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>at 343-45, 587 A.2d 615 (finding no right to a jury, because appropriate relief for insurance agent\u2019s negligence was reformation of the contract, which was an equitable remedy); <em>accord, Insurance Co. of N. Am., </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>at 176-77, 742 A.2d 550. The remedy of damages is legal in nature, and as such our courts have held that it entitles the claimant to a jury trial. <em>Ward, </em>312 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 167, 711 A.2d 394 (contract damages); <em>Kenney v. Scientific, Inc., </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>372, 375, 517 A.2d 484 (App.Div. 1986) (tort damages); <em>Associated Metals Minerals, Corp. v. Dixon Chem. Research, Inc., </em>52 <em>N.J.Super. </em>143, 148-49, 145 A.2d 49 (Ch.Div.1958) (contract damages). The \u201cremedy remains the most persuasive factor.\u201d <em>Weinisch, </em>123 <em>N.J. </em>at 344, 587 A.2d 615. Plaintiffs are entitled to a jury trial in this action at common law for money damages, a form of action which predates any of our constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
