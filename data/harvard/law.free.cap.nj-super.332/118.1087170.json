Dominic Firmani (Firmani) to defendant Firmani Family Limited Partnership (Family Partnership) of real property located at 18 Grove Street in Haddonfield and revested title in Firmani. Plaintiff cross-appeals from an order entered on April 29,1999 which denied her application for counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">This case is an outgrowth of a matrimonial action between plaintiff and Firmani. Pursuant to a settlement agreement between the parties entered into on December 12, 1991, which was later incorporated in a judgment of divorce, Firmani obtained sole ownership of the Haddonfield property, which had been jointly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>owned. In return, Firmani agreed to pay plaintiff $55,000, $30,000 of which was payable within thirty days and the balance within three years. Firmani paid plaintiff the $30,000 but failed to pay her the $25,000 balance. On motion by plaintiff, this obligation was reduced to a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Shortly before the expiration of the three-year period for paying plaintiff the remaining $25,000, Firmani established the Family Partnership and conveyed the Haddonfield property to this entity. The partnership agreement states that Firmani holds a one percent interest as the general partner of the Family Partnership and a ninety-four percent interest as a limited partner. Firmani\u2019s present wife, three children, and stepson received the remaining five percent interest in the Family Partnership in equal proportions as limited partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">When Firmani conveyed the Haddonfield property to the Family Partnership, he had approximately $83,000 in equity in the property. In consideration for the conveyance, Firmani received one dollar from the Family Partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Firmani resides in the Haddonfield property with his present wife and also allegedly operates his financial planning business out of the home. A corporation owned by Firmani pays the $1500 per month mortgage obligation as well as the other expenses of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Plaintiff brought this action to set aside the conveyance of the Haddonfield property on the ground that it was a fraudulent transfer designed to avoid enforcement of Firmani\u2019s obligation under the judgment of divorce to pay plaintiff an additional $25,000 and the subsequent order reducing that obligation to a money judgment. The matter was brought before the trial court on cross motions for summary judgment. At the argument before the trial court, defendants agreed that the case could \u201cbe decided on summary judgment.\u201d The trial court concluded that the conveyance was a transparent effort by Firmani to avoid his obligations to plaintiff by transferring legal title to the property to the Family Partnership entity while \u201cstill retaining the actual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>beneficial interest in the land,\u201d and vacated the conveyance. The court subsequently denied plaintiffs application for counsel fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">On defendants\u2019 direct appeal, we affirm the summary judgment vacating the conveyance of the Haddonfield property to the Family Partnership. On plaintiffs cross appeal, we reverse the denial of her application for counsel fees and remand to the trial court for a determination of the amount of such fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-25(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">A transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor, whether the creditor\u2019s claim arose before or after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred, if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">a. With actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud any creditor of the debtor----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-10\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-26 sets forth a non-exhaustive list of eleven factors, referred to as \u201cbadges of fraud,\u201d that a court may consider in determining whether a party has established an actual intent to hinder, delay, or defraud under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-25(a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-11\">a. The transfer or obligation was to an insider;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-12\">b. The debtor retained possession or control of the property transferred after the transfer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-13\">c. The transfer or obligation was disclosed or concealed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-14\">d. Before the transfer was made or obligation was incurred, the debtor had been sued or threatened with suit;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-15\">e. The transfer was of substantially all the debtor\u2019s assets;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-16\">f. The debtor absconded;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-17\">g. The debtor removed or concealed assets;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-18\">h. The value of the consideration received by the debtor was reasonably equivalent to the value of the asset transferred or the amount of the obligation incurred;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-19\">i. The debtor was insolvent or became insolvent shortly after the transfer was made or the obligation was incurred;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-20\">j. The transfer occurred shortly before or shortly after a substantial debt was incurred; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-21\">k. The debtor transferred the essential assets of the business to a lienor who transferred the assets to an insider of the debtor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-22\">Regarding these factors, our Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>In determining whether the circumstances of a particular transaction give rise to the conclusion that the transferor intended to thwart or evade creditors, courts generally look to factors commonly referred to as \u201cbadges of fraud.\u201d \u201cBadges of fraud\u201d represent circumstances that so frequently accompany fraudulent transfers that them presence gives rise to an inference of intent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">The proper inquiry is whether the badges of fraud are present, not whether some factors are absent. Although the presence of a single factor, i.e. badge of fraud, may cast suspicion on the transferor\u2019s intent, the confluence of several in one transaction generally provides conclusive evidence of an actual intent to defraud.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-6\">\u201c[Fraudulent intent, by its very nature, is rarely susceptible to direct proof____\u201d <em>Marine Midland Bank v. Murkoff, </em>120 A.D.2d 122, 508 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>17, 21 (1986), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>69 <em>N.Y.2d </em>875, 514 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>1029, 507 N.E.2d 322 (N.Y.1987). A defendant rarely will acknowledge that she transferred funds to place them beyond the reach of creditor's. Actual intent often must be established through inferential reasoning, deduced from the circumstances surrounding the allegedly fraudulent act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">We do not suggest that a court must find a specific number of factors before characterizing a transaction as fraudulent. In some eases, the presence of a single factor may suffice. Where several badges of fraud accompany one transaction, however, a strong inference of fraud arises. Unless a sufficient explanation is supplied, clearly rebutting the inference of actual fraudulent intent, the conclusion that the debtor possessed the requisite intent is inescapable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\"><em>[Gilchinsky v. National Westminster Bank, </em>159 <em>N.J. </em>463, 476-77, 484, 732 A.2d 482 (1999) (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-11\">We are satisfied that the undisputed facts show that Firmani\u2019s conveyance of the Haddonfield property to the Family Partnership manifested at least five of the \u201cbadges of fraud\u201d set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-26. Defendant was the sole general partner and primary limited partner of the Family Partnership prior to the conveyance, and therefore the conveyance was made to an insider. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-26(a); <em>see Gilchinsky, supra, </em>159 <em>N.J. </em>at 478-79, 732 A.2d 482. By continuing to use the Haddonfield property as a residence and place of business, and as the sole general partner with a total ninety-five percent interest in the Family Partnership, defendant clearly retained possession or control of the property after the conveyance. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-26(b). Firmani does not dispute that he was aware that the $25,000 had become due to plaintiff, and therefore he knew or should have known that absent voluntary payment, an enforcement action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>probably would be brought. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-26(d). By putting plaintiff in a position where she could only recover the money owed through the Limited Partnership charging process, defendant \u201cremoved ... assets.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2\u201426(g); <em>see Gilchinsky, supra, </em>159 <em>N.J. </em>at 479, 732 A.2d 482 (\u201c[I]n transferring assets from New York to New Jersey [where more debtor-protective IRA laws exist], defendant effectively prevented them from being attached by [her creditor].\u201d). Finally, because Firmani\u2019s obligation to pay the remaining $25,000 he owed plaintiff became due on December 12, 1994, the conveyance to the Family Partnership occurred shortly after a substantial debt was incurred. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-26(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Defendants failed to present any substantial evidence to counter the strong inference of fraudulent intent established by these badges of fraud. Firmani submitted a certification which asserted that he established the Family Partnership and conveyed the Haddonfield property to this entity for \u201cestate planning purposes.\u201d However, we are unable to discern from Firmani\u2019s certification how the transaction could have served any estate planning purposes, except by increasing the total amount of his estate by the $25,000 he seeks to avoid paying plaintiff and by the amounts of the judgments that certain casinos have against him. In any event, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>25:2-25(a) does not require that an intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor be the exclusive motivation behind a transfer in order for the transfer to be deemed fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Defendants also argue that \u201cfinally, and of greatest significance, the transfer did not deprive Ms. Firmani of assets sufficient to satisfy her judgment. The transfer merely changed the type of asset against which she could assert her lien.\u201d In <em>Shapiro v. Wilgus, </em>287 <em>U.S. </em>348, 354, 53 <em>S.Ct. </em>142, 144, 77 <em>L.Ed. </em>355, 358 (1932), the United States Supreme Court observed that \u201c[a] conveyance is illegal if made with an intent to defraud the creditors of the grantor, but equally it is illegal if made with an intent to hinder or delay them.\u201d Under the Uniform Limited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Partnership Law, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>42:2A-1 to -72, the rights of a judgment creditor of a partner are defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>42:2A-48, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">On application to a court of competent jurisdiction by any judgment creditor of a partner, the court may charge the partnership interest of the partner with payment of the unsatisfied amount of the judgment with interest. To the extent so charged, the judgment creditor has only the rights of an assignee of the partnership interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Thus, even if plaintiff were able to secure a charge against Firmani\u2019s partnership interest, she would have to wait until a distribution was made before she could collect any money, and Firmani, as the sole general partner, has sole discretion as to distributions. The partnership is not set to terminate until December 31, 2030, and the partnership agreement allows for an extension beyond that date. Moreover, Firmani has sole discretion to dissolve the partnership, and even upon his death, the other partners retain the right to vote to continue the partnership. Consequently, the conveyance of the Haddonfield property from Firmani to the Family Partnership serves to greatly hinder and delay plaintiffs ability to collect the debt Firmani owes her.'</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">In sum, Firmani\u2019s conveyance of the Haddonfield property clearly manifested at least five badges of fraud. The dubious and weak justifications for the transaction offered by Firmani were insufficient to rebut the inference of actual fraudulent intent provided by these badges of fraud. Therefore, the trial court correctly concluded that the conveyance was fraudulent.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">This action was a direct outgrowth of the parties\u2019 matrimonial action. In fact, instead of filing this action, plaintiff probably could have brought a motion in aid of litigant\u2019s rights under <em>Rule </em>1:10-3 to vacate Firmani\u2019s conveyance of the Haddonfield property. In that event, \u201c[t]he court in its discretion [could] make an allowance for counsel fees to be paid ... to any party accorded relief under this rule.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>But even if plaintiffs claim was not maintainable under <em>Rule </em>1:10-3, we are satisfied that because plaintiffs action involved an attempt by a litigant in a matrimonial action to hinder enforcement of the judgment, it should be treated as a family action within the intent of <em>Rule </em>4:42-9(a)(l), which allows an award of counsel fees to a party to a matrimonial action who is \u201csuccessful in the action, on any claim for equitable distribution [or] enforcement of interspousal agreements relating to family-type matters.\u201d Plaintiffs action to vacate Firmani\u2019s fraudulent conveyance of the Haddonfield property was an action for \u201cenforcement of [the parties\u2019] interspousal agreement\u201d relating to the \u201cequitable distribution\u201d of marital assets. Therefore, even though plaintiffs action may not have been, strictly speaking, a \u201cfamily action,\u201d plaintiffs counsel fee application falls within the intent of <em>Rule </em>4:42-9(a)(1). However, for the reasons set forth in our opinion in <em>Anzalone v. Anzalone Bros. Inc., </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>481, 488-89, 449 A.2d 1310 (App.Div.1982), we conclude that the counsel fee obligation should be assessed solely upon Firmani, and not upon the Family Partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Accordingly, the judgment vacating the conveyance of the Haddonfield property from Firmani to the Family Partnership is affirmed. The order denying plaintiffs application for counsel fees is reversed, and the case is remanded to the trial court for a determination of the amount of counsel fees to be assessed against Firmani.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
