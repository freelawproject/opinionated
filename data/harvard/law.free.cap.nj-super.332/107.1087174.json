(Malpere), a general contractor hired to perform work at the William Brennan Courthouse in Jersey City. The policy was required under a contract between the County of Hudson (the County) and Malpere for masonry restoration work at the courthouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-10\">The endorsement states in relevant part that the policy is amended to add the County as an additional insured \u201cbut only with respect to liability arising out of \u2018your work\u2019 for that insured by or for you\u201d (the endorsement).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-11\">An employee of a subcontractor, while at the courthouse seeking information to prepare a bid, slipped and fell on a marble staircase. The employee sued the County, whereupon the County requested Selective to defend and indemnify it in accordance with the endorsement. Selective declined coverage on the ground that the injured employee was not engaged in the contractor\u2019s \u201cwork\u201d when he fell. Thereafter, the employee obtained an $81,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>judgment against the County,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the County instituted this action against Selective seeking indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">On cross-motions for summary judgment filed by Selective and the County, the Law Division dismissed the County\u2019s complaint, concluding that there was no \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d between the dangerous condition that caused the subcontractor\u2019s employee to fall and the contractor\u2019s \u201cwork\u201d and that Selective properly declined to defend and indemnify the County under the endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The County appealed, contending that the Law Division misinterpreted the \u201carising out of \u2018your work\u2019 \u201d language in the endorsement. We agree and reverse the summary judgment in favor of Selective.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">On July 23, 1992, Selman Cicen, an employee of All Jersey Seamless Company, fell on a slippery step on a marble staircase leading from the first floor to the basement of the William Brennan Courthouse in Jersey City and was seriously injured. Cicen was at the courthouse to obtain information for preparing an estimate for subcontracting services in furtherance of the restoration contract entered into between Malpere and the County on May 15, 1992.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The contract required Malpere to obtain commercial liability insurance. Article 7.3 of the \u201cSpecifications-General Provisions,\u201d which was made a part of the contract, reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">The Contractor shall obtain and keep in force during the term of the contract, public liability and property damage insurance in companies and in form to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>approved by the County. Said insurance shall provide coverage to the Contractor, any subcontractor performing work provided by this Contractor, and the county. The <em>County of Hudson, </em>its officers, agents, servants, and employees as their interest may appear, <em>shall be named as an additional insured on said policy insofar as the work and obligations performed under the Contract are concerned. The coverage so provided shall protect against claims for personal injuries, </em>including accidental death, as well as claims for property damages <em>which may arise from any act or omission of the County, the Contractor or the subcontractor or by anyone directly employed by either of them. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Hence, Article 7.3 of the contract required Malpere to obtain public liability and property damage insurance and to include the County as an additional insured on the policy \u201cinsofar as the work and obligations performed under the Contract are concerned.\u201d The contract also envisioned the use of subcontractors by Malpere in the performance of its work for the County.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">In furtherance of the contract, Malpere sought and obtained a commercial general liability policy from Selective in which the County was named as an additional insured. The endorsement stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-6\">WHO IS AN INSURED (SECTION II) is amended to include as an insured the person or organization shown in the Schedule [the County of Hudson, its agents, representatives &amp; employees] but only with respect to liability arising out of \u201cyour work\u201d for that insured by or for you. * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">\u201cYour work\u201d means [in pertinent part]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">a. Work or operations performed by you or on your behalf____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-10\">The critical issue is whether the County\u2019s liability for the injury Cicen sustained when he slipped and fell in the courthouse in the course of seeking information about the requirements of the subcontracting job comes within the scope of the \u201carising out of \u2018your work\u2019 \u201d language in the endorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">In interpreting the language of the endorsement, we apply the following well settled principles used to construe an insurance policy. We begin by noting that although insurance policies are contractual in nature, they are not ordinary agreements; they are \u201c \u2018contracts of adhesion\u2019 and, as such, are subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>to special rules of interpretation.\u201d <em>Gibson v. Callaghan, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>662, 669, 730 A.2d 1278 (1999) (citing <em>Meier v. New Jersey Life Ins. Co., </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>597, 611-12, 503 A.2d 862 (1986)); <em>see also Home State Ins. Co. v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>313 <em>N.J.Super. </em>584, 713 A.2d 557 (App.Div.1998), <em>aff'd, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>104, 726 A.2d 1289 (1999). Consequently, we are directed to take a broad and liberal view so that the policy is construed in favor of the insured. <em>Franklin Mutual Ins. Co. v. Security Indemnity Ins. Co., </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>335, 340, 646 A.2d 443 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>139 <em>N.J. </em>185, 652 A.2d 173 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">Further, where the language of a policy will support two meanings, one favorable to the insured and the other favorable to the insurer, the interpretation sustaining coverage should be applied. <em>Westchester Fire Ins. Co. v. Continental Ins. Companies, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>29, 35, 312 A.2d 664 (App.Div.1973), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>152, 319 A.2d 732 (1974). In addition, \u201cpurchasers of insurance are entitled to the broad measure of protection necessary to fulfill their reasonable expectations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 36, 312 A.2d 664 (quoting <em>Kievit v. Loyal Protective Life Ins. Co., </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>475, 482, 170 A.2d 22 (1961)); <em>see also Gibson, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 671, 730 A.2d 1278; <em>Franklin, supra, </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 340, 646 A.2d 443. And \u201ctheir policies should be construed liberally in their favor to the end that coverage is afforded \u2018to the full extent that any fair interpretation will allow.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kievit, supra, 34 N.J. </em>at 482, 170 A.2d 22 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Moreover, it is fundamental \u201cthat ambiguities in an insurance policy are to be interpreted in favor of the insured....\u201d <em>Gibson, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 670, 730 A.2d 1278. In construing an ambiguous provision, \u201ccourts should consider whether more precise language by the insurer, had such language been included <em>in </em>the policy, \u2018would have put the matter beyond reasonable question.\u2019 <em>Doto [v. Russo, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>544,] 557, 659 A.2d 1371 [ (1995) ] (quoting <em>Mazzilli v. Accident &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., </em>35 <em>N.J. </em>1, 7, 170 A.2d 800 (1961)); <em>see also Kook v. American Sur. Co., </em>88 <em>N.J.Su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number><em>per. </em>43, 51, 210 A.2d 633 (App.Div.1965).... \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 670, 730 A.2d 1278.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Against this framework, we interpret as a matter of first impression, the \u201carising out of \u2018your work\u2019 \u201d language in the endorsement. Initially, we note that the phrase \u201carising out of\u2019 has been defined broadly in other insurance coverage decisions to mean conduct \u201coriginating from,\u201d \u201cgrowing out of\u2019 or having a \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d with the activity for which coverage is provided. <em>Westchester, supra, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 38, 312 A.2d 664; <em>see also Franklin, supra, </em>275 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 340-41, 646 A.2d 443; <em>Harrah\u2019s Atlantic City, Inc. v. Harleysville Ins. Co., </em>288 <em>N.J.Super. </em>152, 157-59, 671 A.2d 1122 (App.Div.1996); <em>Minkov v. Reliance Ins. Co., </em>54 <em>N.J.Super. </em>509, 516, 149 A.2d 260 (App.Div.1959). <em>Accord American Motorists Ins. Co. v. L-C-A Sales Co., </em>155 <em>N.J. </em>29, 36, 713 A.2d 1007 (1998); <em>see also Records v. Aetna Life and Casualty Ins., </em>294 <em>N.J.Super. </em>463, 468, 683 A.2d 834 (App.Div.1996), <em>certif. denied, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>463, 700 A.2d 876 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">In <em>Westchester, supra, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 37-38, 312 A.2d 664, we held that injuries sustained by a bicyclist when struck by a stick thrown by a passenger from a moving vehicle arose out of the use of an automobile and were covered under the automobile liability policy of the owner of the automobile. In that case, we observed that the words \u201carising out of\u2019 do not mean the same thing as proximate causation in the sense that the injury must be \u201ccaused by\u201d or \u201cresulting from\u201d the use of the automobile. We said there that if such a meaning was intended, the insurer would surely have employed language which clearly conveyed that idea. <em>Ibid. </em>Consequently, we concluded that \u201cthe phrase \u2018arising out of must be interpreted in a broad and comprehensive sense to mean \u2018originating from\u2019 or \u2018growing out of the use of the automobile. So interpreted, there need be shown only a substantial nexus between the injury and the use of the vehicle____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 38, 312 A.2d 664. We also stated, however, that \u201c[wjhether the requisite connection or degree of relationship exists depends upon the circumstances of the particular case,\u201d concluding there that such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>relationship was presented by the allegations of the complaint. <em>Ibid.; see also Records, supra, </em>294 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 463, 683 A.2d 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">Applying this analysis here, we construe the \u201carising out of\u2019 language of the endorsement to mean \u201coriginating from\u201d or \u201cgrowing out of\u2019 Malpere\u2019s work. Having made that determination, we turn next to consider whether the occurrence for which coverage is sought, grew out of \u201c[Malpere\u2019s] work\u201d as required by the endorsement. Initially, we observe that the term \u201cwork\u201d is ambiguous as it is capable of being interpreted in more than one way.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Selective defined the term \u201cwork\u201d in the endorsement as \u201cwork or operations performed by you or on your behalf.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We assume that the inclusion of the term \u201coperations\u201d in the definition of \u201cwork\u201d was not surplusage, and that \u201cwork\u201d must mean, therefore, more than just the contractor\u2019s or its agent\u2019s physical work; it includes administrative work of a type ordinarily performed by a contractor, who is authorized to utilize subcontractors to fulfill its contractual obligations, as is the case here. That \u201cwork\u201d would necessarily involve the contractor\u2019s furnishing information to any potential subcontractor considering whether to bid on a job, and reasonably would entail visits by that subcontractor to the worksite in order to obtain the needed information.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">Indeed, that very \u201coperation\u201d was exactly what was occurring when Cieen arrived at the William Brennan Courthouse to obtain information to enable All Jersey Seamless Company, Cicen\u2019s employer, to decide if it wished to bid on the \u201csubcontracting services for gutters.\u201d Selective concedes as much in its brief when it states that \u201cMalpere was soliciting bids, and All Jersey Seamless Company was on site to inspect the premises in order to submit a bid.\u201d Nonetheless, Selective argues that because Cicen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>and his employer \u201cwere not present at Malpere\u2019s \u2018behest\u2019 or at Malpere\u2019s instruction,\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and because the subcontract had not yet been awarded to All Jersey Seamless Company, he could not have been present to do Malpere\u2019s \u201cwork\u201d and, therefore, the endorsement is not applicable. For the reasons we have already stated, we reject such a narrow interpretation of the endorsement and hold that \u201cwork\u201d includes the subcontractor\u2019s activities on the premises in anticipation of submitting a bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Viewing the issue another way, we reach the same conclusion based on the County\u2019s objectively reasonable expectation that coverage would be provided to Malpere\u2019s potential subcontractors while on the premises. <em>Westchester, supra, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 36, 312 A.2d 664. In <em>Westchester, </em>we explained that in interpreting the phrase \u201carising out of,\u201d \u201cthe inquiry should be whether the negligent act which caused the injury, although not foreseen or expected, was in th\u00e9 contemplation of the parties to the insurance contract^] a natural and reasonable incident or consequence of the use of the automobile, and thus a risk against which they might reasonably expect those insured under the policy would be protected.\u201d 126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 38, 312 A.2d 664, <em>quoted in Lindstrom v. Hanover Ins. Co., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>242, 250, 649 A.2d 1272 (1994); <em>see also Records, supra, </em>294 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 463, 683 A.2d 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Article 7.3 of the \u201cSpecifications-General Provisions\u201d in the contract between Malpere and the County required Malpere to obtain \u201cpublic liability and property damage insurance\u201d naming the County as an additional insured on the policy \u201cinsofar as the <em>work and obligations </em>performed under the Contract are concerned\u201d (emphasis added). Those \u201cobligations\u201d envisioned the use of subcontractors on the project. The article further required \u201cthe coverage ... [to] protect against claims for personal injuries, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>... which <em>may arise from any act or omission of the Coun</em>ty____\u201d (Emphasis added.) Notably, Selective has not claimed that it was unaware of the coverage Malpere was required to obtain to protect the County\u2019s interests. Accordingly, both the County and Selective could reasonably expect coverage essentially in conformity with the requirements of the contract. But even if Selective did not know the County\u2019s exact contractual requirements, Selective could reasonably anticipate that Malpere would use subcontractors to perform its work and that such subcontractors would send representatives to the worksite in preparation for submitting their bids. That the premises might be unsafe due to an \u201c[unjexpected and [unjforseen\u201d dangerous condition is, in the contemplation of Selective, a natural and reasonable incident of the \u201cwork,\u201d and, therefore, a risk against which Selective might reasonably expect the County to be protected. <em>See Westchester, supra, </em>126 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 38, 312 A.2d 664.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Accordingly, we hold that Cicen\u2019s presence at the worksite, and the ensuing accident, was sufficiently connected to Malpere\u2019s \u201cwork\u201d for the County to constitute a \u201csubstantial nexus\u201d between the contract and the contractor\u2019s \u201cwork\u201d requiring Selective to cover the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The summary judgment in favor of Selective is reversed and the matter is remanded to the Law Division for entry of summary judgment in favor of the County.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b141-11\"> We affirmed the judgment on appeal. <em>Cicen v.
