Appellant represents that the charter school\u2019s application for the preceding year had been rejected by the State Board and that the school had filed, then withdrawn, an appeal to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">The application contemplated that the school would be a regional one, serving four districts of residence: Highland Park, New Brunswick, Edison, and Milltown. Apparently Milltown withdrew from the proposed region in December 1997. The board of education in one of the remaining three districts, Highland Park, is the appellant here. The other two districts have not appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">In October 1997 appellant filed its objections to the charter school with the Commissioner of Education (Commissioner), including (1) the application was defective in several respects and (2) the funding mechanism would adversely affect appellant\u2019s own efforts to meet its educational responsibilities. Signifying the deep-rooted public-policy controversy over charter schools, two of the other residence districts filed letters in support of the school\u2019s application while the fourth district joined with Highland Park in opposing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-9\">Two of the Department\u2019s reviewers evaluated the application\u2019s Implementation Plan, one rating it \u201cStrong\u201d and one rating it \u201cExemplary\u201d to \u201cStrong.\u201d The Department issued to Greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>Brunswick a Review Feedback form requesting further information.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">A third reviewer examined the Financial Plan, concluding that it was \u201cA/I\u201d (Adequate/Inadequate). A separate Review Feedback form was issued specifying needed changes in the financial plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The Department also issued an Evaluation Tally, summarizing the reviewers\u2019 assessments and rating the Implementation Plan as \u201cStrong\u201d and the Financial Plan as \u201cA/I.\u201d The \u201cOverall Rating\u201d of the application was that it had the \u201cPotential to Be Approved for Charter \u2014 Pending Revisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">In response to the Department\u2019s concerns, in November and December 1997 Greater Brunswick submitted addenda to the application. Appellant responded to both addenda, again opposing the charter.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">By letter of January 21, 1998 the Commissioner granted contingent approval of the charter, citing six strengths of the Implementation Plan and two of the Financial Plan. He listed eleven sets of documents which the school had to file by stated deadlines, ranging from May 15 to the opening of school. Once those documents were submitted, advised the Commissioner, the charter would be granted unconditionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">Appellant filed a timely appeal with the State Board. In its decision mailed on April 3, 1998, the State Board summarized appellant\u2019s arguments but rejected them, employing the \u201cboilerplate\u201d language used in the other appeals. In addition, the State Board noted that appellant had \u201cchallenged the Commissioner\u2019s subsequent approval of the proposed school\u2019s amendment of its region of residence by a separate appeal, which is currently pending before the State Board.\u201d We must assume this was a reference to Milltown\u2019s withdrawal from the region. None of the parties explain this further. In any event, it is not at issue on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">As with the other appeals, there is no indication of the Commissioner\u2019s issuing the \u201cfinal approval\u201d contemplated by the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Board\u2019s decision. Absent contrary contention, we must assume that the State Board\u2019s ruling is a final, appealable decision. Appellant unsuccessfully moved before the State Board for a stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Appellant board argues that the Commissioner was required to reject the application because the reviewers so recommended. It observes that the reviewers found several deficiencies, which deficiencies were never cured. And it claims that the Commissioner had no power \u201cto override the opinions of his own evaluators\u201d without explaining why and without gauging the application by \u201cobjective criteria.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">Respondent school disputes appellant\u2019s premise that the reviewers recommended that the application be rejected. Rather, as respondent correctly notes, while each reviewer of the Implementation Plan cited some deficiencies, their overall ratings ranged from \u201cStrong\u201d to \u201cExemplary.\u201d The Department asked the school to address the various deficiencies which the school attempted to do in its two addenda in November and December 1997. Appellant filed responses to the addenda. A review of the addenda in \u25a0 the record shows that respondent provided detailed answers to the questions posed in the Review Feedback forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">On this appeal appellant complains that there is no indication that the reviewers examined the addenda and made a new evaluation, or that the Commissioner reviewed the addenda and found that the deficiencies had been cured. Appellant contends it is apparent that the deficiencies with respect to curriculum were not cured.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">It is true that both reviewers of the Implementation Plan found shortcomings in one of the three curriculum standards. But the other two curriculum standards were rated either \u201cAdequate\u201d or \u201cStrong.\u201d And the reviewers\u2019 overall rating of the Educational Program, which included the curriculum standards, was \u201cStrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>As respondent and the State Board observe, neither the Act nor the regulations require that reviewers conduct a reevaluation before the proposal goes to the Commissioner. The Commissioner alone has the power of final approval or rejection. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:36A-4(c). He need not reconcile any findings made at the reviewers\u2019 stage of the process, especially when, as here, those reviewers gave the application acceptable grades overall. As we discussed in the <em>In re the Grant of the Charter School Application of Englewood on the Palisades Charter School, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>174, 217, 727 A.2d 15 (App.Div.1999) (Englewood), the Commissioner in a charter-school-approval case is not acting in an adjudicatory capacity; hence, he need not issue the kind of formal findings and conclusions that must accompany a final decision in a traditional contested case.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Appellant also laments the alleged lack of \u201cobjective criteria\u201d by which the Commissioner could evaluate the application. As a result, appellant complains that, the approval decision was arbitrary and capricious. Appellant offers an example of this alleged arbitrariness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">[B]oth reviewers found that Brunswick\u2019s curriculum was inadequate, yet both inexplicably deemed the overall application to be \u201cSatisfactory'\u2019. How can this be? Is not curriculum a vital if not essential component of any public school? Assuming this question must be answered in the affirmative, how can Brunswick\u2019s application have been deemed \u201cSatisfactory\u201d when an inadequate curriculum was offered by Brunswick?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Again, appellant\u2019s premise fails: as we explained above, both reviewers did <em>not </em>find that \u201cthe curriculum\u201d as a whole was inadequate. Indeed, they rated the Education Program as being \u201cStrong\u201d overall.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">In any event, the application itself required respondent to provide detailed information as to very specific criteria. <em>See, e.g., </em>the six categories of information under the Educational Program section of the application, together with respondent\u2019s detailed responses. As we concluded in the unpublished <em>Matawan-Aberdeen (A-</em>4713-97T1) opinion at 18-23, the approval process provided ample standards by which the application could be judged. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>require further specificity would deprive the Commissioner of the discretion he needed to ensure that the proposed school will foster the goals of the Act. In sum, we affirm the Commissioner\u2019s decision over the criticism that it failed to follow the reviewers\u2019 recommendation or was based on non-objective criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Appellant contends that the Commissioner had no authority to ask respondent for addenda to its application. By allowing the addenda, appellant reasons, the Commissioner \u201cspoon-fed\u201d respondent by identifying defects in the original application, giving respondent an opportunity to cure the defects. Such \u201cremedial assistance\u201d by the Commissioner was not authorized by the Act and was an \u201cobvious and blatant procedural violation\u201d which compels a reversal. Respondent and the State Board counter that addenda are permitted by the Act and regulations and are compatible with the underlying goal of promoting charter schools. The pertinent section of the Act is <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:36A-5(n), which is the last section of the provision which lists the information that must be included in the charter-school application. This subsection provides that the application shall include \u201c[sjuch other information as the commissioner may require.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:36A-5(n).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The implementing regulation is <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:11-2.1(c): \u201cFollowing the review of the applications, the Department of Education may request subsequent information as addenda to the applications.\u201d The regulations further state that the Department \u201cshall evaluate the addenda,\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:11-2.1(d), and that the local board of education \u201cshall review\u201d the addenda and submit its response. <em>N.J.AC. </em>6A:11-2.1(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">On this appeal appellant acknowledges <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:11-2.1(c) but reads it narrowly as forbidding the correction of any deficiencies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AiQ\">However, in this case the Commissioner did not request \u201csubsequent\u201d information from Brunswick; rather, it requested \u201cadditional\u201d and \u201crevised\u201d information from the School. In fact, what the Commissioner did was not simply request additional information but, as will be made clear below, actually provided Brunswick with an opportunity to \u201ccure\u201d significant deficiencies in its application. It was arbitrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>and unfair for the Commissioner to have provided these multiple opportunities for Brunswick to revise and improve upon its original application. Accordingly, the Commissioner\u2019s grant of a charter to Brunswick must be reversed due to this obvious and blatant procedural violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">We agree with the State Board that appellant\u2019s interpretation presumes the charter-school-application process is \u201cadversarial,\u201d in which any defect in an initial filing is fatal and compels a rejection. <em>See Englewood, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 195, 727 A.2d 15. A charter-school application is not analogous to a complaint in a court action which may be dismissed for insufficient pleading. The Legislature, by declaring charter schools in the public interest, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:36A-2, and by authorizing regulations to implement the Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:36A-18, gave the Commissioner all powers reasonably necessary to ensure that the application is complete, so that the Commissioner may properly evaluate it. While appellant is correct that the addenda procedure gives an applicant a chance to cure shortcomings, that kind of second chance is consistent with the public policy behind the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Moreover, appellant was not prejudiced by the filing of the addenda. As permitted by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:11-2.1(e)(2), appellant filed its own responses to the addenda, neither of which response objected to the procedural propriety of the addenda. Hence the submission of addenda did not impair appellant\u2019s opportunity to have the Commissioner consider its arguments against the charter school.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">Appellant argues that the goals, curriculum, and student-assessment portions of the application were deficient, requiring a reversal of the grant of the charter. Appellant relies on <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:36A-5(d), which requires, in part, that the application include \u201c[t]he educational goals of the charter school, the curriculum to be offered, and the methods of assessing whether students are meeting educational goals.\u201d Similarly, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:11-2.1(b) requires that the applicant fill out the Department\u2019s form application, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>\u201cwhich includes a description of the areas listed in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:36A-5.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Respondent\u2019s application included a five-page section entitled \u201cGoals and Objectives,\u201d one goal of which was that students would \u201cmaster the knowledge detailed in the New Jersey State Core Curriculum Content Standards.\u201d In the eighteen-page section entitled \u201cEducational Program,\u201d the application described the school\u2019s curriculum philosophy \u2014 which it termed \u201cconstructivism\u201d \u2014 and which it explained, and described for each grade from \u201cK to 9.\u201d The application then detailed the ways the school would meet each of the Core Curriculum Content Standards. Finally, in the \u201cStudent Assessment\u201d section, the application described how student performance would be measured. As reflected by the Evaluation Tally, the consensus of the two reviewers was that the Goals and Objectives portion was \u201cStrong\u201d to \u201cAdequate,\u201d the Education Program portion was \u201cStrong,\u201d and the Student Assessment portion was \u201cStrong.\u201d In his contingent-approval letter of January 21, 1998, the Commissioner cited the foregoing three areas as having been \u201cwell described.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Appellant complains that, notwithstanding the application\u2019s details \u201cabout how to achieve student goals (in an unspecified curriculum), there is no information provided about what students will learn and how such learning is to be measured.\u201d Apparently appellant\u2019s point \u2014 which is accurate \u2014 is that the application does not set out subjects to be taught in each grade or the content of those subjects.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">By the time we decide this appeal, the charter school in this case will have been operating for most of its first year. Obviously a specific curriculum was devised by September 1998 for opening of the school. As we stated in <em>Englewood, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 195, 727 A.2d 15, it would not be in the public interest, or in the interest of- the school\u2019s current students, to void the charter for any technical deficiencies in the applications. Should experience prove that the school\u2019s curriculum falls short of that required by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>the \u201ct &amp; e\u201d obligation, any aggrieved party may pursue a remedy at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Appellant maintains that the application should have been rejected because it failed to name a head of the school who possessed the appropriate principal\u2019s certification. The Act requires that the application include \u201c[a] description of the charter school staff responsibilities and the proposed qualifications of teaching staff.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:36A-5(h). A charter school\u2019s \u201cclassroom teachers, principals and professional support staff\u2019 must hold the appropriate certificate under the regulations governing traditional public schools. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:36A-14(c). <em>See also N.J.A.C. </em>6A:11-5.1(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">With one exception, neither the Act nor the regulations include any other guidelines for a charter school\u2019s chief leadership position. The exception is the definitional section of the regulations, which offers a definition of \u201clead person\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\">\u201cLead person\u201d means the person(s) who perform(s) the organizational tasks necessary for the operation of a charter school; and where a group of individuals shares these organizational tasks, the person designated as responsible for completion of the tasks required by these rules is the lead person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\"><em>(N.J.A.C. </em>6A:11-1.2.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">The regulations confer various duties on the \u201clead person,\u201d including coordinating pupil transportation, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:11-4.1 and -4.3, filing tenure charges against employees, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:11-6.2, and receiving pupil records from the pupil\u2019s previous school, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:11-8.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">In its initial application, respondent charter school represented that the \u201clead person\u201d of the school would have the title of \u201cDirector,\u201d whose qualifications included New Jersey certifications as teacher and supervisor. The application included a list of the Director\u2019s responsibilities as well as a detailed job description.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-13\">In the Review Feedback form the Department advised respondent as follows: \u201cA lead person called principal or director must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>hold a New Jersey Principal License.\u201d In its first addenda respondent again labelled the \u201clead person\u201d as the \u201cDirector,\u201d but it added a caveat: \u201cIf the individual chosen to head the school does not possess the required licensing to receive the \u2018Director\u2019 or \u2018Principal\u2019 title, the title will be Supervisor of the Greater Brunswick Charter School.\u201d In its response to the addenda, appellant objected to respondent\u2019s apparent attempt to avoid the certification requirement. In its second addenda respondent listed the title of the \u201clead person\u201d as \u201cHead of the Greater Brunswick Charter School.\u201d Appellant again objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">On appeal appellant criticizes respondent\u2019s attempt to avoid the certification requirements by the subterfuge of changing the lead person\u2019s title to \u201cHead,\u201d a label not among those required to carry an appropriate certification. By whatever name, reasons appellant, the leader of a charter school must hold a principal\u2019s certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Respondent counters that appellant\u2019s premise is wrong: the leader of a charter school does not have to be a principal or hold a principal\u2019s certificate. It points out that <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:11-3.1 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">(b) Any employee who is responsible for making recommendations regarding hiring or the purchase or acquisition of any property or services by a charter school shall be an administrator as defined in the School Ethics Act (N.J.S.A.18A.-12-23) and the rules promulgated thereto at N.J.A.C. 6:3-9.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">The referenced statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A: 12-23, defines \u201cadministrator\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-9\">any officer, other than a board member, or employee of a local school district who (i) holds a position which requires a certificate that authorizes the holder to serve as school administrator, principal, or school business administrator; or (ii) holds a position which does not require that the person hold any type of certificate but is responsible for making recommendations regarding hiring or the purchase or acquisition of any property or services by the local school district; or (iii) holds a position which requires a certificate that authorizes the holder to serve as supervisor and who is responsible for making recommendations regarding hiring or the purchase or acquisition of any property or services by the local school district.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">The State Board\u2019s view is that nothing in the Act requires that the top administrative position in a charter school be held by a certificated person. Rather, only teachers and professional sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>port staff must be certified, citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:36A-14(c). The State Board concludes: \u201cThus, Greater Brunswick\u2019s choice to employ a supervisor or headmaster which does not require certification does not render the Commissioner\u2019s determination unreasonable.\u201d The premise of the State Board\u2019s position is that the school\u2019s \u201clead person\u201d in this case will not be classifiable as \u201cprofessional support staff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">While respondent twice downgraded the label attached to its \u201clead person\u201d \u2014 from \u201cDirector\u201d to \u201cSupervisor\u201d to \u201cHead,\u201d respondent did not revise the responsibilities or job description of that person. A reading of those responsibilities and of that description indicates that the \u201clead person\u201d will have the kind of wide-ranging managerial duties that are associated with a traditional principal or superintendent. For example, he supervises and evaluates staff, runs the daily operations of the school, implements the curriculum, and prepares the budget. At minimum, the leader surely qualifies as \u201cprofessional support staff\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:36A-14(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">We agree with appellant that the school\u2019s head, by whatever name, must have a certificate of some kind. Because the school began operation in September 1998, however, this sole technical defect should not void the charter where there otherwise has been substantial compliance with the Act. <em>See Alan J. Cornblatt, P.A. v. Barow, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>218, 239-40, 708 A.2d 401 (1998); <em>Matawan-Aberdeen </em>(A-4713-97T1) opinion at 22-23. As a realistic remedy, we direct the Commissioner to order that the school be headed by a properly-certified lead person as of the start of the next school year, September 1999, if it is not already so headed.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">Appellant complains that the Charter School Program Act does not authorize a charter school to be created on a regional basis, which is the form taken by respondent charter school in this case. Hence, it reasons, the regulations that allow a regional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>charter school exceed the intended scope of the Act and cannot be enforced. '</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">The Act itself does not mention regional charter schools. It authorizes formation of a charter school by, among others, \u201cparents with children attending the schools of the district,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:36A-4(a), and it grants an enrollment preference \u201cto students who reside in the school district in which the charter school is located.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:36A-8. Throughout, the Act uses \u201cdistrict\u201d in the singular. Appellant concludes therefore: \u201cIf the Legislature had intended to authorize regional charter schools, these phrases and others like them in the statute would have been expressed in the plural.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The regulations do express a regional concept, however. The definitional section defines \u201cdistrict of residence\u201d to include, in addition to the district in which a charter school is located, the \u201c \u2018region of residence\u2019 of contiguous district boards of education.\u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:11-1.2. \u201cRegion of residence\u201d is defined as \u201ccontiguous district boards of education in which a charter school operates and shall be the charter school\u2019s \u2018district of residence.\u2019 \u201d <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:11-1.2. Applications for regional charters must meet special requirements. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:11-2.1(b)(2). And the budget-per-pupil amount is computed under a special formula. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>6A:11-7.1(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Appellant claims that to allow regional charter schools \u201chas a tremendously deleterious effect on districts like Highland Park.\u201d First, it contends that it was not able to prepare an accurate budget for 1998-99, because \u201cthe lottery system adopted in the Administrative Code for regional charter schools calls for a \u2018region-wide\u2019 lottery, which means that there is no maximum enrollment which can be set (or even guessed at) until the lottery is actually conducted <em>and </em>parents who are lottery winners have made a final decision about whether their children will attend the charter school.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Second, appellant argues that this charter school sought to regionalize because it could not generate enough interest in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>single district. \u201cThus, Brunswick was forced by pure numerical necessity to create an unwieldy \u2018region of residence\u2019 concept, a concept not envisioned by the Legislature but nonetheless approved by the Commissioner. It is this gerrymandered \u2018region\u2019 which has led to the confusion and uncertainty to which Highland Park objects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Finally, appellant contends that the lottery system will result in unfair treatment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">What Brunswick has done is take the total number of applicants from the 4 towns in question, put them in a big pool, and conduct a lottery. This could lead to Highland Park having a much higher percentage of enrollees at the School than their population or even their percentage of applicants would otherwise warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">Respondent charter school makes no attempt to answer appellant\u2019s pleas of hardship and unfairness. It reasons that the Act authorizes regulations \u201cnecessary to effectuate the provisions of this Act,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:36A-18, and that because allowing regional charter schools will foster the establishment of charter schools, the regulations allowing such schools should be upheld. It adds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-9\">Certain school districts may not be able to support a charter school unless they join with neighboring districts. The regulations merely allow these districts to participate in the charter school program, and therefore appear to be neither arbitrary nor unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">The State Board offers an additional rationale: regional charter schools can increase the diversity of enrollment, as they can draw from both urban and suburban districts and from districts with different racial, ethnic, and economic characteristics. With regard to appellant\u2019s concerns about budgeting, the State Board points out that uncertainty over enrollment inheres in the charter-school concept itself; it is not unique to the regionalization feature. And the State Board claims, without support in the record, that \u201cthe Department has taken great steps to assist school districts to make appropriate budgetary plans based upon statistical calculations and projections.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">We conclude that a regional charter school is a logical variant of the kind of charter school permitted by the Act. If a charter school established to serve a single district may enroll students from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>other districts, as permitted by N.J.S.A 18A:36A-8(a), then a charter school should be allowed to serve a region or collection of districts, as opposed to a single district. While appellant reasonably complains of budgetary headaches, these annoyances are a function of the charter-school concept itself. Appellant\u2019s complaint, in that respect must be directed to the Legislature or the Executive Branch, not the courts. <em>Englewood, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 226-27, 727 A.2d 15. We conclude that the regulations allowing regional charter schools are a legitimate means of effectuating the Act\u2019s purpose of encouraging the establishment of charter schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Appellant contends that the charter grant must be overturned because the Commissioner failed to consider the charter school\u2019s adverse impact on the financial health of appellant\u2019s district. Like most of the appellants in the other charter-school appeals, appellant here cites four ways in which it will be harmed: 1) the amount it must pay to the charter school will not be matched by savings in its own costs; 2) it may have to pay for some students who were not enrolled in its district the year before; 3) the financial drain \u201cmay\u201d impair appellant\u2019s ability to meet its \u201ct &amp; e\u201d obligations; and 4) these effects will occur without approval by the voters in the district. While we find appellant\u2019s protestations deserving of concern, they are in the nature of disagreements with the Legislature\u2019s choice of educational policy, as to which there is no judicial remedy. <em>Dennery v. Board of Educ., </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>626, 643, 622 A.2d 858 (1993); <em>In re Petition, Union County Reg\u2019l High School Dist. No. 1, </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 9, 688 A.2d 1082 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>37, 692 A.2d 50 (1997). In <em>Englewood, </em>320 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 225-27, 727 A.2d 15 we addressed and rejected all four of the theories here asserted by this appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Appellant complains that the Commissioner was required but did not consider the racial impact that the charter school will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>have on appellant\u2019s district. To the extent the Charter School Program Act does not mandate consideration of such racial impact, appellant argues, the Act is unconstitutional. Appellant invites comparison of this Act to the statute governing the termination of a sending-receiving relationship, which requires that a feasibility study be presented to the Commissioner in order to show, among other things, the effect on the racial mix of the districts involved. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:38-13. Appellant finds \u201cno logical reason\u201d why the same factor should not be a prerequisite to the approval of a charter, given that an exodus of white students from appellant\u2019s district would substantially skew the racial balance in that district. Appellant concedes that it \u201cdoes not know\u201d if there will be such an adverse impact in fact, because it did not know as of September 11, 1998, the filing date of its brief, what the racial composition of the charter school will be for the 1998-99 year. We do note that in neither of appellant\u2019s two reply briefs, the last filed in January 1999, does it venture to suggest actual race-population figures; in both reply briefs appellant reiterates only the theoretical bases of its racial-factor argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">As we noted in rejecting this argument in the <em>Matawan-Aberdeen </em>(A-4713-97T1) appeal at 10-13, appellant\u2019s complaint is premature: if and when the existence of the charter school unduly skews the racial mix in appellant\u2019s district, the Commissioner has the power \u2014 independently of the Charter School Program Act\u2014to take remedial action. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:6-9; <em>Jenkins v. Township of Morris Sch. Dist., </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>483, 501, 506-07, 279 A.2d 619 (1971), <em>Board of Educ. of Bor. of Englewood Cliffs v. Board of Educ. of City of Englewood, </em>257 <em>N.J.Super. </em>413, 473-74, 608 A.2d 914 (App.Div.1992), <em>aff'd, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>327, 625 A.2d 483, <em>cert. denied, </em>510 <em>U.S. </em>991, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>547, 126 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>449 (1993). But there is nothing in the Charter School Program Act that requires unconstitutional conduct; we may not declare it facially invalid. <em>See Feriozzi Co. Inc. v. Atlantic City, </em>266 <em>N.J.Super. </em>124, 136-37, 628 A.2d 821 (Law Div.1993) (a law is not invalid on its face if it permits, but does not require, unconstitutional conduct; a court may not assume that an act will be applied in an unconstitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>manner). Appellant has not established that the Act is unconstitutional for failing to compel consideration of race in the approval-decision process.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
