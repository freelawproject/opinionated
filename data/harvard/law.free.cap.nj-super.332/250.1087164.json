On cross motions for summary judgment, the trial court held that New York law governed and that, under the substantive standards of that state in respect of a single issue, plaintiff could not prevail. Accordingly, an order was entered granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, denying plaintiffs motion, and dismissing the complaint. Plaintiff appeals, arguing only that the motion judge erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion. Although we agree with the motion judge\u2019s determination that New York law governed the single issue before him, we disagree that New York law required a ruling in defendant\u2019s favor. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>Both parties maintain their principal offices in New Jersey and both conduct business in New York. The general liability policy in question was sold to plaintiff in New York by a New York \u201cproducer\u201d. It was issued on a renewal basis for the period from August 5, 1995 to August 5, 1996, providing multi-peril, \u201call risks\u201d coverage for plaintiffs buildings in several states. One of the covered buildings, vacant at the time the risk materialized, is in Manhattan. The underlying issue is whether the policy covers the imminent collapse of that New York City structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\">Plaintiff represents that it seeks a judgment of $123,506.38 for repair costs, plus attorneys\u2019 fees, interest and costs. We note that plaintiffs \u201cclaims for extra-contractual damages, including consequential damages, punitive damages and attorney\u2019s fees\u201d were dismissed without prejudice in a consent order entered early in the pendency of the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"AJj\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s ruling that, in general, to the extent a difference in substantive law rule between New York and New Jersey is established on the issue before it, <em>see Pfizer, Inc. v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>187, 199, 712 A.2d 634 (1998)(a choice of law decision is necessary \u201c \u2018only ... when the laws of the involved states differ on the point in issue\u2019 \u201d)(quoting Robert A. Sedler, A <em>Real World Perspective on Choice of Law, </em>48 <em>Mercer L.Rev. </em>781, 783 (1997)), that issue must be seen to be governed by New York law.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">There are two primary arguments for favoring the choice of New Jersey law. The first is based on the connection each of the parties has with New Jersey as a business domicile, and bears upon this State\u2019s interest in ruling the relationships and responsibilities of entities subject to its regulatory sway. The second is grounded upon the fact that the policy at issue covers plaintiffs properties in several states, a factor that tends to weigh in favor of a uniform-contraet-interpretation approach to choice of law determinations over a site-specific approach. <em>See Gilbert Spruance Co. v. Pennsylvania Mfrs., </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>96, 104, 629 A.2d 885 (1993) (where the insurance policy covers a group of risks that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>scattered throughout two or more states, the location of any one risk has diminished significance). Although the Supreme Court employed a site-specific approach in <em>Spruance, </em>as well as in a number of other recent cases having to do with losses from environmental damage, all those cases involved special considerations that do not apply here. <em>See Pfizer, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 207-08, 712 A.2d 634 (holding that, in the event of conflict, the \u201claw of the waste site would appear to have the more dominant significant relationship\u201d); <em>Spruance, supra, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 110-13, 629 A.2d 885 (approving of the idea that commerce would be encouraged by applying the law of the state where toxic waste is deposited and stating that in situations involving foreseeably multistate operations, the \u201cgoverning law is that of the state with the dominant significant relationship according to the principles of <em>Restatement </em>section 6\u201d). Nevertheless, in the instant matter, given the lack of a choice-of-law provision in the insurance policy, and even regarding the preference in favor of uniform-contract-interpretation approaches to be one of general applicability, all significant party-oriented considerations \u2014 save for the fact that both parties do business in New Jersey as well as in New York \u2014 have a New York focus.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The <em>Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws </em>(1971) provides the general choice of law factors to be applied where a claim springs from a contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">\u00a7 188. Law Governing in Absence of Effective Choice by the Parties</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">(1) The rights and duties of the parties with respect to an issue in contract are determined by the local law of the state which, with respect to that issue, has the most significant relationship to the transaction and the parties under the principles stated in \u00a7 6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">(2) In the absence of an effective choice of law by the parties ..., the contacts to be taken into account in applying the principles of \u00a7 6 to determine the law applicable to an issue include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">(a) the place of contracting,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-11\">(b) the place of negotiation of the contract,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-12\">(e) the place of performance,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-13\">(d) the location of the subject matter of the contract, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>(e) the domicil, residence, nationality, place of incorporation and place of business of the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">These contacts are to be evaluated according to their relative importance with respect to the particular issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">(3) If the place of negotiating the contract and the place of performance are in the same state, the local law of this state will usually be applied, except as otherwise provided in \u00a7\u00a7 189-199 and 203.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Applying the type of reasoning used in the flexible governmental interest analysis approach required for resolving other like questions, <em>see Veazey v. Doremus, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>244, 247, 510 A.2d 1187 (1986) (dealing with tort cases); <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Estate of Simmons, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>28, 34-37, 417 A.2d 488 (1980) (recognizing <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7\u00a7 6 and 188 as the source of the \u201cmost significant relationship test\u201d, and that said test, sharing certain factors with the governmental interest analysis, applies in contract actions), we conclude that New York\u2019s connection with the subject matter and the risks it engenders is far more extensive and qualitatively meaningful in the practical sense than is New Jersey\u2019s association with the parties simply because they are business domiciliaries. The omnibus factors to be applied in evaluating the various levels of relationship which are pertinent to the flexible governmental interest analysis approach are also set out in the <em>Restatement:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">\u00a7 6. Choice-of-Law Principles</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\">\u2666</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">(2) ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-11\">(a) the needs of the interstate and international systems,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-12\">(b) the relevant policies of the forum,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-13\">(e) the relevant policies of other interested states and the relative interests of those states in the determination of the particular issue,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-14\">(d) the protection of justified expectations,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-15\">(e) the basic policies underlying the particular field of law,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-16\">(f) certainty, predictability and uniformity of result, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-17\">(g) ease in the determination and application of the law to be applied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-18\">We observe that even if no feature of this ease strongly suggested that the law of one state or the other governed under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Restatement\u2019s choice-of-law tests, no real interest of either of the parties would impel a particular conclusion, apart from a more or less hospitable approach to plaintiffs claim stemming from whatever differing policies and viewpoints may pertain in the two states. <em>See, e.g., Permacel v. American Ins. Co., </em>299 <em>N.J.Super. </em>400, 411, 691 A.2d 383 (App.Div.1997). As noted by the trial court, even if there were an essential equipoise in factors bearing upon the choice of law determination, the preference for New York law would be buttressed by an insurance-specific provision of the <em>Restatement </em>which establishes \u201cthe principal location of the insured risk\u201d as the paramount evaluative standard in the absence of a more significant relationship to another state.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">\u00a7 193. Contracts of Fire, Surety or Casualty Insurance</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2CL\">The validity of a contract of fire, surety or casualty insurance and the rights created thereby are determined by the local law of the state which the parties understood was to be the principal location of the insured risk during the term of the policy, unless with respect to the particular issue, some other state has a more significant relationship under the principles stated in \u00a7 6 to the transaction and the parties, in which event the local law of the other state will be applied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-6\"><em>See, e.g., Pfizer, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 199, 712 A.2d 634 (the satisfaction of the \u201cjustified expectations\u201d of the parties and \u201ctheir need[ ] for predictability of result ... are basic purposes of contract law, especially insurance law\u201d); <em>HM Holdings Inc. v.

Thus, we conclude, essentially for the same reasons employed by the trial court judge, that if and where a difference of law exists, the law of New York governs in the absence of special considerations suggesting a different view as to particular issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">The focal question of whether different rules of law pertain in the two jurisdictions cannot be answered without first identifying the prevailing rule in each separately as to every genuine issue in the ease. <em>See Johnson Matthey Inc. v. Pennsylvania Mfrs. Ass\u2019n Ins. Co., </em>250 <em>N.J.Super. </em>51, 65, 593 A.2d 367 (App.Div.1991) (\u201cConflicts principles do not dictate that all legal issues presented by a single case should be decided under the laws of a single state. The evaluation of significant relationships and governmental interests takes place issue by issue and can lead to the application of different bodies of law.\u201d); <em>see also Veazey, supra, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 248, 510 A.2d 1187 (\u201cAny such conflict is to be determined on an issue-by-issue basis.\u201d); 4 Eric Holmes, <em>Appelman on Insurance </em>\u00a7 21.1, at 226 (2d ed.1998). An understanding of the significant underlying facts in the matter\u2014largely uneontested for summary judgment purposes \u2014 is critical toward this end.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>At the \u201cowner\u2019s\u201d request, a masonry consultant for the New York City Brickwork Design Center, Michael Gurevich, inspected the property on August 12, 1996. His report noted that the property had previously been inspected for the New York City Department of Buildings in February 1992, that the inspection had covered \u201c[t]he north and south walls, and 25 feet returns at east and west walls[,]\u201d and that the report of that inspection \u201chad noted no critical conditions ... and status of exterior maintenance was note[d] as \u2018good\u2019.\u201d As a result of his inspection in 1996, Gurevich prepared a report in which he described in detail a number of cracks, displacements and other defects he had found, including \u201c[r]usted steel ... behind the displaced part of the south wall.\u201d He also concluded that the north elevation \u201cparapet wall is at the verge of collapse[,]\u201d and that at \u201c[t]he base of [the east] parapet wall ... [he] observed severely rusted steel lintels which are causing unsafe wall conditions,\u201d resulting in the possibility that the \u201cparapet wall could collapse.\u201d The \u201canalysis\u201d section of his report contained the following observations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">The main cause of the parapet walls [sic] displacement and imminent collapse is hidden decay of steel beams and lintels which are located inside or behind the brick masonry walls. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">North wall parapet has the emergency condition. The corbel brick masonry cornice has more than 2 inches of displacement out from the wall plain [sic]. The weight of the brick parapet wall located above the corbel cornice is holding this displaced corbel brick cornice in place. Any soil shake or movement could be translated through the foundations to the north wall which could cause collapse of the wall parapet. The building is located within a few hundred feet of the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which is a main route for heavy truck traffic. Thus, no risk should be taken and the north wall parapet should be removed and rebuilt. Similar conditions were observed at the south wall parapet____[R]usted steel was observed____The elevator ... could translate additional vibration to the parapet wall. Thus, the south wall parapet should be removed down to the 7th floor window head level and should be rebuilt including replacement of rusted steel beams and lintels. .. [The] south elevator bulkhead walls should be rebuilt at the same time as the parapet wall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-11\">The middle part of the east parapet wall has similar conditions____[The] displaced middle part of the east parapet wall should be rebuilt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">The Gurevich report concluded: \u201cIt is ... possible ... that additional prevention actions could be identified as corrective work progresses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>Plaintiff immediately undertook to make repairs to the building, allegedly incurring an eventual total of $123,506.38 in costs. Plaintiff filed a claim under the policy with defendant on August 27, 1996. Defendant engaged a building consultant, C.J. Rubino, to investigate the \u201c[clause and [o]rigin of an \u2018alleged collapse\u2019.\u201d The Rubino report, dated September 17, 1996, verified the conditions outlined in the Gurevich report, and opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">[T]he observed conditions ... were caused by a combination of exposure to the elements and the delaminating of the steel lintels which expanded, causing the brickwork movement. This condition was due, for the most part, to the absence of maintenance, and although there is no evidence of any actual collapse, if the conditions are not addressed, failure would be inevitable. It is important to note that all of the movement found was and still is continuous over a long period of time, and that these various points of failure were openly visible and would have been detected during normal site inspections.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">By letter of October 22, 1996, defendant disclaimed liability under the policy, invoking stated exclusions for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMJ\">d.

The term \u201ccollapse\u201d is not defined in the policy itself, so the issue is whether the conditions described constitute \u201ccollapse\u201d as a matter of law. There is a division of authority among the states in that regard.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">Some courts have held that \u201ccollapse\u201d is an unambiguous term \u201cwhich denotes a falling in, loss of shape, or reduction to flattened form or rubble\u201d.

Excelsior Insurance Company, </em>830 F.2d 31, 34-35 (3d Cir.1987), on the basis postulated therein, that New Jersey adheres to the majority view. Under our law, the collapse peril insured against does not require that structures fall; rather, without any narrowing internal definition, such a policy must be taken to cover any serious impairment of structural integrity that connotes imminent collapse threatening the preservation of the building as a structure or the health and safety of occupants and passers-by. <em>Cf. Bromfeld v. Harleysville Ins. Cos., </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>62, 688 A.2d 1114 (App.Div.1997); <em>Ariston Airline &amp; Catering Supply Co. v. Forbes, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>472, 511 A.2d 1278 (Law Div.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">New York\u2019s position on this issue is less easily isolated. To complicate matters further, a preliminary question arises concerning the proper role and function of the forum judge in determining the law of another state. We see no reason why a different rule ought to govern state court judges in determining the law of a sister state than governs federal judges in identifying the law of any state, <em>i.e., </em>to look at the opinions of the state\u2019s highest court and, if it has not addressed the question, to predict how, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>light of developing law both within and without the state to date, it would decide. <em>Gares v. Willingboro, </em>90 F.3d 720, 725 (3rd Cir. 1996) (stating that a federal court is bound by the decisions of the state\u2019s highest court and that in the event that court has not ruled on the issue the federal court is bound by the state\u2019s intermediate appellate courts unless it \u201cis convinced that the state\u2019s highest court would decide otherwise\u201d); <em>McKenna v. Pacific Rail Serv., </em>32 <em>F.</em>3d 820, 825 (3rd Cir.1994) (noting that it is to look first for rulings by the highest court and then to the intermediate appellate courts).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">The New York Court of Appeals has not determined the meaning of \u201ccollapse\u201d as a matter of law. In deciding that New York law barred the coverage sought here, the motion judge relied upon two Appellate Division cases decided some years ago. In <em>Weiss v. Home Ins. Co., </em>9 A.D.2d 598, 189 N.Y.S.2d 355, 357 (1959), the court concluded that the term collapse \u201cinvolves an element of suddenness, a falling in, and total or near total destruction.\u201d In <em>Graffeo v. United States Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., </em>20 <em>A.D.2d </em>643, 246 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>258, 260, <em>motion for leave to appeal dismissed, 14 N.Y.2d </em>685, 249 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>882, 198 N.E.2d 911 (1964), the court held that the settling of a concrete slab under a split-level home so that the interior walls pulled away from the ceilings was not a \u201ccollapse\u201d within the intendment of the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">There is reason to understand, however, that, since <em>Weiss </em>and <em>Graffeo </em>were decided, New York has moved away from its past adherence to what is now the minority view <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> that an actual falling \u2014 in or near total destruction must occur before a condition may be found to be a \u201ccollapse\u201d under the provisions of an insurance policy which does not define the term. In <em>Bailey v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., </em>565 <em>F.</em>2d 826 (2d Cir.1977), the court thoroughly reviewed the then existing state of New York law regarding interpretation of the term \u201ccollapse\u201d, noting that \u201cit is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>at once apparent ... that there is a clear division in the courts of New York in dealing with the word \u2018collapse.\u2019 By any conspectus, the law of New York is unsettled on the point.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 830. The court determined that, despite the uncertainty that prevailed among the intermediate courts in New York, the eases generally adhered to the concept that \u201ccollapse\u201d, in the context of homeowner\u2019s coverage, means a sudden impact that is destructive of the structural integrity of the insured building. <em>Ibid. </em>The court then explained that the expression \u201ccollapse\u201d is a \u201ccoat of varied colors\u201d and \u201cwhat constitutes a collapse is largely [a question] of degree.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Second Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that there was nothing in the law of New York that \u201crequire[d] the insured property be demolished nor reduced to rubble\u201d in order to determine that \u201ccollapse\u201d has occurred. <em>Ibid. </em>The court held that the lower federal court\u2019s grant of summary judgment based on the minority view of the term \u201ccollapse\u201d was error. <em>Id. </em>at 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">Viewed through the lens provided by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Bailey </em>and subsequent state court cases which we will discuss below, we are constrained to conclude that the current law of New York on the issue is unsettled. We are likewise guided by the federal court\u2019s prediction that New York\u2019s highest court, whenever it is confronted with the question, will adopt the majority view, which does not require a sudden and total (or nearly so) destruction of the insured property in order to conclude that a \u201ccollapse\u201d has occurred. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Where a sister state\u2019s court of last resort has not had occasion to address a question, dated holdings of lower courts provide imperfect guidance in determining the current law of that state, especially when they are at variance with present-day prevailing trends and innocent of the intervening history informing those trends. We have no right to assume that the decisional law of a sister state will remain immutable. It seems obvious that a court in any jurisdiction, which thirty-five and more years ago adhered to what is now the minority view, might well as a matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>of judicial policy today, allocate the economic risks of building deterioration in old cities differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Cases decided since <em>Bailey </em>support the correctness of the Second Circuit\u2019s view of New York law. For example, in <em>Barash v. Insurance Co. of North America, </em>114 <em>Misc.</em>2d 325, 451 <em>N.Y.S.</em>2d 603, 605 (Sup.Ct.1982), a trial court held as we have in New Jersey, <em>see Kievit v. Loyal Protective Life Ins. Co., </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>475, 482, 170 A.2d 22 (1961), that if a term is capable of more than one meaning, the doubt must be resolved in favor of the insured. In <em>Barash, </em>the foundation had settled below a home, leaving a void into which part of the foundation of the house fell. The court held that this occurrence was properly characterized as a collapse of the foundation. <em>Barash, supra, </em>451 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>at 605. The court observed: \u201c[i]t is not necessary that the house fall down in a heap before the insured can recover.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 606. The <em>Barash </em>court distinguished its holding from <em>Graffeo </em>in that the policy exclusion in question, regarding settling \u201cin foundations\u201d, did not use the term \u201ccollapse.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">An even more recent appellate court opinion in <em>Royal Indem. Co. v. Grunberg, </em>155 A.D.2d 187, 553 N.Y.S.2d 527 (1990), relied, in part, on the Second Circuit\u2019s holding in <em>Bailey </em>to reach a comparable conclusion. In <em>Grunberg, </em>homeowners sought reimbursement from their insurance company for repairs made to their home which were necessary to prevent its inevitable collapse. The court stated that whether a collapse has occurred as a matter of law rested largely on the degree of damage, and it viewed with favor the majority approach that a substantial impairment of the structural integrity of a building constitutes a collapse. <em>Id. </em>at 529. Because the insurer had not \u201cunequivocally established\u201d that the insureds\u2019 home did not suffer such an impairment, the court held that the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment had been inappropriate. <em>Ibid. </em>The court stressed that the \u201cuncontradicted record evidence is that the house was in imminent danger of caving in. [The insurer\u2019s] own expert appraiser opined that \u2018if [defendants] failed to make any attempts to save [their] property, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>the building would ultimately have collapsed, for which coverage would have been afforded under the policy\u2019.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Noting that the insureds were obligated pursuant to the policy to maintain and repair all covered property in the event of any loss, covered or not, the court determined that the insureds were not to be deprived of reimbursement for the money spent to prevent the actual collapse of their home. <em>Ibid. </em>The court opined that \u201ca construction of the policy faulting them for doing so and triggering coverage only in the event their property was actually demolished or reduced to rubble would be unreasonable, to say the least.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Aside from the contested issue of material fact regarding \u201ccollapse\u201d, the court also saw as genuinely disputed whether the impending collapse was sudden or the product of slow deterioration. <em>Ibid. </em>The 1959 <em>Weiss </em>case was cited as authority in this latter regard. <em>Graffeo, </em>from 1964, was not cited at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">We recognize that all the New York eases we have considered involved homeowner\u2019s insurance policies and that the policy in this case is one of commercial insurance. Even though different rules of construction may sometimes apply in commercial insurance situations than govern the rights of homeowners against their insurance carriers, see, <em>e.g., Werner Industries, Inc. v. First State Ins. Co., </em>112 <em>N.J. </em>30, 38-39, 548 A.2d 188 (1988); <em>cf. Freedom Cashier, Inc. v. Federal Ins. Co., </em>262 A.D.2d 353, 693 N.Y.S.2d 604, 605 (1999), we can discern no reason why the law should attribute different meanings to the same term in the two situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">As a result of our survey, and relying on the Second Circuit\u2019s prediction in <em>Bailey, </em>as well as the views expressed in subsequent state court cases, we conclude that New York would today apply the majority rule in determining whether the imminent collapse of plaintiffs building is covered by the insurance policy at issue, and declare in favor of coverage as to that aspect of the dispute between the parties. As we have noted, this is the rule in New Jersey, as well. Without a difference in the law of the two jurisdictions governing the \u201ccollaps'e\u201d issue, there is no need, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>that regard, to apply the choice of law principles we have outlined. See <em>Pfizer, supra, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>at 199, 712 A.2d 634; Sedler, <em>supra, </em>at 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the non-moving party, <em>see Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995); <em>Judson v. Peoples Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>17 <em>N.J. </em>67, 74-75, 110 A.2d 24 (1954), both inspectors in the matter determined that the building was in imminent danger of collapse and should be immediately repaired in order to prevent an actual fall. Thus, summary judgment in favor of defendant could not correctly be granted. There may or may not be a genuine issue of material fact whether the structural integrity of the building was in such a state as to be considered \u201ccollapsed\u201d under the applicable rule of law, and pursuant to the terms of the insurance policy. Also, defendant asserts that, even if the majority interpretation of \u201ccollapse\u201d is applied in this case, the defects to the building were not caused by \u201chidden decay\u201d and were engendered instead by plaintiffs failure to repair the building; and that, therefore, summary judgment is appropriate. At best, even viewed most favorably for defendant, this argument raises genuine issues of material fact, precluding summary judgment. As held in <em>David Danzeisen Realty Corp. v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>170 A.D.2d 432, 565 N.Y.S.2d 223, 224 (1991), mere negligence in failing to make proper repairs is not a defense to coverage in New York under an \u201call risk\u201d policy, which is seen to cover a fortuitous event, defined as \u201cany occurrence or failure to occur which is ... beyond the control of either party\u201d. <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>New York Insurance Law </em>\u00a7 1101(a)(2) (McKinney 2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Further, plaintiffs building was inspected in February 1992, and none of the problems leading to the imminent collapse of the building were noted at that time. Four years later, plaintiff once again requested an inspector to evaluate the structural integrity of the building. That inspector found the building to be in danger of immediate collapse due to rusting and expansion of internal members, which, among other problems, caused the facade of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>building to pull away from its structural supports. That evaluation may be seen to characterize the defects as being hidden. At the very least, there seems to be a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the damage to the building was latent or patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">To the extent questions of law are involved in respect of any remaining issues, and either party asserts a conflict of laws, <em>see Safer v. Estate of Pack (I), </em>291 <em>N.J.Super. </em>619, 629, 677 A.2d 1188 (App.Div.) (noting that \u201cif no issues of conflict of laws or the need to apply foreign law are raised, New Jersey law will continue to govern\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>568, 683 A.2d 1163 (1996); <em>Graulich Caterer, Inc. v. Hans Holterbosch, Inc., </em>101 <em>N.J.Super. </em>61, 67, 243 A.2d 253 (App.Div.1968), and there is a difference in any prevailing rule between the two states, New York law will apply for the reasons we have posited unless special considerations suggest otherwise in respect of any particular issue. <em>See State Farm, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 34-37, 417 A.2d 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">To summarize, we have concluded that the trial court was correct to rule that the law of New York governs the substantive issues between the parties to the extent there is a difference between the rules of law prevailing in New Jersey and New York governing the issues it addressed. We have also concluded, in respect of the issue pertaining to \u201ccollapse,\u201d that the trial court was incorrect in identifying the applicable rule in New York as being different from the prevailing rule in New Jersey, and as precluding coverage on that question. Because those were the only issues argued by the parties and addressed by the trial court in the cross-motions, we will not rule upon any others that remain. <em>See Nieder v. Royal Indem. Ins. Co., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>229, 234, 300 A.2d 142 (1973) (\u201cIt is a well-settled principle that our appellate courts will decline to consider questions or issues not properly presented to the trial court when an opportunity for such a presentation is available \u2018unless the questions so raised on appeal go to the jurisdiction of the trial court or concern matters of great public interest.\u2019 \u201d); <em>DeVane v. DeVane, </em>280 <em>N.J.Super. </em>488, 490 n. 2, 655 A.2d 970 (App.Div.1995) (considering issues not briefed on appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>to be abandoned); Pressler, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment on <em>R. </em>2:6-2 (2000) (\u201c[A]n issue not briefed is deemed waived\u201d on appeal.). On remand, the trial court will apply New York law to all additional substantive issues in respect of which either party asserts a conflict of laws and where that State\u2019s rule is different from the law of New Jersey, unless it becomes evident that, as to any particular issue, application of the \u201cmost significant relationship test\u201d dictates that New Jersey law should apply. <em>See State Farm, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 34-37, 417 A.2d 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The order granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is reversed and the matter is remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b291-7\"> The Court which decided <em>Graffeo </em>understood it was applying the majority rule at that time. <em>See Graffeo, supra, </em>246 <em>N.Y.S.2d. </em>at 260.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
