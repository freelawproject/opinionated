On April 30, 1999, Judge Herr rendered an oral opinion disposing of the matter based upon her interpretation and application of <em>L. </em>1995, <em>C. </em>360, \u00a7 4, which had amended the Statute of Frauds to provide, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-15\">An agreement to transfer an interest in real estate or to hold an interest in real estate for the benefit of another shall not be enforceable unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-17\">^ ^ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-18\">b. a description of the real estate sufficient to identify it, the nature of the interest to be transferred, the existence of the agreement and the identity of the transferor and the transferee are proved by clear and convincing evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-21\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>25:1-13.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>By reason of this provision, the acquisition of an interest in land may be established by parol evidence for the first time in modern history.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Judge Herr\u2019s oral opinion has since been formalized and is reported at 332 <em>N.J.Super. </em>369, 753 A.2d 758. After reviewing the record in the light of the written and oral arguments advanced by the parties, we are in substantial agreement with the decisional rationale employed by Judge Herr and affirm on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
