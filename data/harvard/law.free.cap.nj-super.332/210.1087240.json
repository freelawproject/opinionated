We conclude that a property owner or other interested party (condemnee) who fails to appear, personally or through counsel, at the scheduled and noticed hearings of the condemnation commissioners is precluded from appealing to the Law Division from the report issued by the commissioners concerning the amount of compensation to be paid to the condemnee by the condemning authority. However, we also hold that the notice to the condemnee of the hearing of the condemnation commissioners, required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-12(c), must fairly apprise the condemnee of the appeal-preclusion consequence of the condemnee\u2019s failure to appear at the hearing. Here, we conclude the notice given to defendant, Stylianos Maropakis, failed to properly advise him that his failure to appear at the commissioners\u2019 hearing would prevent him from appealing to the Law Division from their report.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">This appeal arises from the following undisputed facts and procedural history. On or about March 6, 1990, defendant purchased real property located at 62-66 West Front Street, in Keyport, for $195,000. On March 20, 1992, defendant applied for site plan approval to develop the property for commercial use, and submitted a revised application on May 10, 1993. During the pendency of the application, plaintiff, Borough of Keyport, expressed an interest in acquiring the property for public use. In or around 1994, defendant began negotiating with plaintiff regarding the sale of the property. Defendant offered to sell the property to plaintiff for $260,000 and then for $200,000. Plaintiff rejected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>these offers. Plaintiff had the property appraised, resulting in a value of $73,000. Plaintiff then offered to purchase the property for the appraised value, and defendant refused. Plaintiff had the property appraised again on January 6, 1997, also resulting in a value of $73,000. Plaintiff again offered defendant $73,000 for the property, and defendant again refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">On June 17,1997, plaintiff filed a verified complaint, declaration of taking, and an order to show cause in the Law Division, seeking an order authorizing plaintiff to commence a preliminary entry upon the property. The trial court entered an order on June 30, 1997, allowing the preliminary entry upon defendant\u2019s-property. On November 21, 1997, plaintiff filed an amended verified complaint, naming all other persons with an interest in the property as defendants and seeking condemnation of the property. That same day, the court entered an order for payment of $73,000 for the property to be paid to the court and authorized plaintiff to take immediate possession of the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">On January 9, 1998, the trial court entered an order for judgment, vesting with plaintiff the power of eminent domain to acquire the property and appointing condemnation commissioners to examine and appraise the property. The commissioners\u2019 hearing was scheduled for March 10, 1998, and on February 13, 1998, plaintiff provided all defendants, including Maropakis, with notice of same. The notice, in its entirety, provided, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">Your are hereby given notice of a meeting of the Commissioners appointed in this action, to be held at the office of Commissioner, Adrienne H. MeComber, Esq., MeComber &amp; MeComber, 54 Shrewsbury Avenue, Red Bank, New Jersey 07701, on Tuesday, March 10, 1998 at 10 AM at which time the Commissioners will proceed with their duties and fix the compensation to be paid for the land and premises described in the complaint in this action including damage, if any, resulting from the taking to any remaining property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">However, neither defendant Maropakis, nor anyone on his behalf, appeared at the noticed hearing. At the hearing, plaintiff submitted the appraisal of $73,000 for the property. On March 18, 1998, the appointed commissioners, after hearing plaintiffs expert testimony and representations, recommended compensation be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>paid by plaintiff to defendant Maropakis in the amount of $87,375 as just compensation for the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">On April 8,1998, defendant filed a notice of appeal with the Law Division from the commissioners\u2019 recommended award within the time prescribed by <em>R. </em>4:73-6(a). On April 15, 1998, plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss defendant\u2019s appeal, contending his failure to appear at the commissioners\u2019 hearing precluded his appeal, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-13(a). On May 19, 1998, defendant filed a cross-motion seeking an order denying the motion to dismiss and vacating the condemnation commissioners\u2019 award.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The trial court heard the motions on July 24, 1998. On December 21, 1998, the motion judge issued a written opinion denying defendant\u2019s motion to appeal the commissioners\u2019 decision. In denying defendant\u2019s motion to appeal, the judge stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-8\">The issue before the court is whether a property owner\u2019s failure to appear before the commissioners at the condemnation hearing precludes the owner from appealing the valuation decision entered by the commissioners. Simply stated, the issue is whether <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-13, which allows an interested party who appears before the condemnation commissioners the right to appeal the decision of the commissioners, should be construed in the instant matter, to preclude [defendant] from appealing since he failed to appear at the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b245-9\">I find that [defendant] has not complied with the statute and hereby deny his motion to appeal the commissioners\u2019 valuation decision. His failure to appear before the condemnation commissioners at their valuation hearing, constituted a waiver of his right to appeal. [Defendant] could have and should have appeared before the commissioners even if he chose not to actively participate. <em>See Com\u2019r of Transp. v. Siris, </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>261, 271, 466 A.2d 96 (Law Div.1983). This is a prerequisite to the right to appeal. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-13(a). Moreover, I find no compelling reason why I should circumvent the statute and allow the appeal to go forward. To do so would be to allow the defendant a \u201csecond bite at the apple.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-10\">That opinion was memorialized in an order entered on February 17, 1999, denying defendant\u2019s motion \u201cto set aside and vacate the within action and thereby appeal the decision of the condemnation commissioners!.]\u201d The judge further ordered plaintiff to pay $87,375 to defendant, representing the commissioners\u2019 recommended award for just compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>In his reply brief, defendant raises the following issue for the first time:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-4\">THE ONLY NOTICE OF THE MEETING OF THE COMMISSIONERS ALLEGEDLY RECEIVED BY APPELLANT-MAROPAKIS FAILED TO GIVE ACTUAL OR CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE OF THE ALLEGED CONSEQUENCES OF NOT APPEARING AT THE MEETING.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Ordinarily, issues not raised below will not be considered. <em>See Brock v. Public Serv. Elec. &amp; Gas Co., </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>378, 391, 693 A.2d 894 (1997); <em>Ferraro v. Demetrakis, </em>167 <em>N.J.Super. </em>429, 400 A.2d 1227 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>290, 405 A.2d 834 (1979). However, if the issue is of special significance to the litigant, to the public, or to the achievement of substantial justice, and the record is sufficiently complete to permit its adjudication, we may consider it. <em>See Alan J. Cornblatt, P.A. v. Barow, </em>153 <em>N.J. </em>218, 230, 708 A.2d 401 (1998); <em>Potter v. Village Bank of New Jersey, </em>225 <em>N.J.Super. </em>547, 555, 543 A.2d 80 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>352, 550 A.2d 462 (1988); <em>Brower v. Gonnella, </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>75, 81, 535 A.2d 1006 (App.Div.1987). Here, while we disapprove of the procedures employed by defendant, we are satisfied our consideration of the notice issue is mandated because it involves the propriety of the form of notice used generally in condemnation actions, in view of our conclusion that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-13(a) prevents a properly noticed eondemnee from appealing from the report of the condemnation commissioners if that eondemnee fails to appear at the condemnation commissioners\u2019 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">The issues before us are, (1) whether the appearance of a eondemnee at the hearings of the condemnation commissioners, \u201ceither personally or through an attorney,\u201d is a predicate to the condemnee\u2019s right to appeal the commissioners\u2019 valuation decision and, (2) if so, whether the condemnor has an obligation to notify the eondemnee of the appeal-preclusion consequence of the failure to attend the hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">The statute at issue, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-13 of the Eminent Domain Act, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-8\">(a) Parties. <em>Any party who has appeared at the hearings of the commissioners, </em>either personally or through an attorney, may appeal from the award of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>commissioners. Such appeal shall be taken within the period and in the manner provided by the rules. The necessary parties to the appeal shall be only such parties who have appeared at the commissioners\u2019 hearings. Other parties may be admitted by the court pursuant to the rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-13(a) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">Our courts have \u2018\u201cemphasized repeatedly that when interpreting a statute, [the court\u2019s] overriding goal must be to determine the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cornblatt v. Barow, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 231, 708 A.2d 401 (quoting <em>State, Dep\u2019t of Law &amp; Pub. Safety v. Gonzalez, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>618, 627, 667 A.2d 684 (1995)). When the language is plain and unambiguous, the court must enforce the statute in accordance with its terms. <em>Ibid. </em>The plain language of the statute is the best means to determine the intent. <em>Ibid. </em>If the Legislature has not provided otherwise, words are to be given their \u201c \u2018ordinary and well-understood meanings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citations omitted). When interpretations can differ, the court must determine the legislative intent. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">In searching for the intent of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-13(a), we are provided some guidance by consideration of the legislative history of this section. We trace the origins of the Eminent Domain Act of 1971 (the Act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-1 to -50, to Chapter 53 of the Laws of 1900, which prescribed the procedures required in condemnation cases to ascertain and pay just compensation for the taking. <em>L. </em>1900, <em>c. </em>20, \u00a7\u00a7 1 to 19. The procedures in the 1900 enactment are similar to those outlined in the current Act. Upon the filing of a petition seeking condemnation, the court was authorized to appoint three commissioners \u201cto fix the compensation to be paid[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2. Once appointed, the commissioners were charged, on notice to the interested parties, to examine and appraise the property and file their report. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 5. In those cases where the right of appeal was given by statute, the condemnor or eondemnee was permitted to appeal from the report of the commissioners by filing a notice of appeal with the court within ten days after the date by which the commissioners were required to file their report. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 9. The appeal proceedings and results were declared to be binding on all owners and interested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>parties named in the condemnation petition, and on all persons who appeared personally or through counsel at the hearing before the commissioners, if the appeal was taken only by or against the persons in possession of the property. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 10. Additionally, the notice of appeal was required to be served upon \u201cpersons in possession, and others, if any, who shall have appeared before the commissioners or their attorneys[.]\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>However, the right to appeal to the court from the commissioners\u2019 award was not made dependent upon the appellant\u2019s appearance before the hearing of the condemnation commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">In 1909, the Legislature enacted Chapter 150, amending section nine of Chapter 20 of the Laws of 1900 to permit an appeal by the condemnor or the property owner from the commissioners\u2019 report, whether the right to \u201can appeal has been or may be given by the statute conferring the power to take land or property for public use or not.\u201d <em>L. </em>1909, c. 150, \u00a7 1. This right of appeal was continued in the enactment by the Legislature of Chapter 20 of the Laws of 1953. <em>See L. </em>1953, c. 20, \u00a7 25. Section 20:1-18 of the Revised Statutes was also amended in 1953, to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-5\">The appeal <em>shall be sufficient and binding on all the owners and parties interested, </em>known or unknown, named or designated as parties in the action, if it is brought by or against the persons in possession of the property and such other persons, if any, designated in the action for the appointment of commissioners, as <em>shall have appeared personally or by attorney before the commissioners.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\"><em>[L. </em>1953, c. 20, \u00a7 27 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">The legislative history prior to 1971 reflects no requirement for the appearance at the commissioners\u2019 hearing, personally or through an attorney, of an owner or other interested party, as a condition precedent to an appeal from the commissioners\u2019 award. When delineating the rights of interested parties who had appeared at the commissioners\u2019 hearing, the prior legislative scheme focused on the class of condemnees bound to the results of the appeal process once the appeal was taken from the commissioners\u2019 award. Those condemnees who appeared at the commissioners\u2019 hearing, personally or through an attorney, were bound to the results of the appeal to the court from the commissioners\u2019 report.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>In 1971, the Legislature enacted Chapter 361, which contains the current version of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-13, permitting \u201c[a]ny party <em>who has appeared, at the hearing of the commissioners, </em>either personally or through an attorney,\u201d to appeal from the award of the commissioners. <em>L. </em>1971, c. 361, \u00a7 13 (emphasis added). This section also delineates parties necessary to the appeal as, \u201conly such parties who have appeared at the commissioners\u2019 hearings!,]\u201d although, \u201c[o]ther parties may be admitted by the court pursuant to the rules.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The 1971 enactment retains the delineation of those parties necessary to, and bound by, the appeal. However, by its plain language, the Act limits the class of those eligible to appeal to those parties who have \u201cappeared at the hearings of the commissioners, either personally or through an attorney!.]\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">It has been noted that \u201c[t]he Legislature intended the commissioners\u2019 hearing to be meaningful, particularly for the property owner.\u201d <em>Comm\u2019r of Transp. v. Siris, </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>261, 268, 271, 466 A.2d 96 (Law Div.1983) (noting if the claims of the parties can be resolved at the hearing, the expense of litigation is less, and further, the hearing is the condemnee\u2019s first opportunity to learn about the State\u2019s case). We conclude the Legislature required the attendance of the property owner at the commissioners\u2019 hearing as a predicate to an appeal to ensure that the hearing is a meaningful step in the condemnation process, and to encourage the resolution of condemnation disputes through the utilization of the statutory procedure. <em>See Siris, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 269, 466 A.2d 96 (noting that <em>\u201cN.J.S.A. </em>20:3-13(a) indicates that the <em>defendant, subject to loss of the right to appeal, need not appear at the commissioners\u2019 hearing.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)); <em>see also </em>Edward D. McKirdy, Esq., et al., <em>New Jersey Condemnation Practice </em>\u00a7 10.3.6 (New Jersey Institute for Continuing Legal Education 1997) (stating that if a party does not appear either personally or through an attorney before the condemnation commissioners, that party may not appeal the award). To conclude otherwise would thwart the legislative purpose, blunting the effectiveness of the commissioners\u2019 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Defendant contends the trial court could have admitted him as a party defendant in the instant appeal in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-13(a) which provides, \u201c[o]ther parties may be admitted by the court pursuant to the rules.\u201d Defendant argues this portion of the statute authorizes the courts \u201cto admit <em>any </em>party who declined to appear before the commissioners.\u201d The language of this portion of the statute, however, presumes the existence of a pending appeal. This provision in the statute permits the court to add other parties to a pending action. However, it does not provide authority to initiate the appeal itself nor does it establish a basis for avoiding attendance at the commissioners\u2019 hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Having concluded that the language contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-13(a) precludes an appeal by a condemnee who failed to appear at the hearing of the condemnation commissioners, we now turn to the issue of whether the condemnor is required, when notifying the condemnee of the time, date, and place of the condemnation commissioners\u2019 hearing, to further advise the condemnee of the appeal-preclusion consequences of the failure to attend the hearing. As we have noted, this issue was not briefed, argued, or raised before the trial judge by the defendant, nor on this appeal, until the filing of the reply brief. We consider this issue only because of its special significance to the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and Article 1, \u00b6 20, of the New Jersey Constitution mandate the payment of just compensation for the taking of private property for public use. <em>Comm\u2019r of Transp. v. Silver, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>507, 513, 457 A.2d 463 (1983). The measure of compensation is the fair market value of the property as of the date of the taking. <em>Village of S. Orange v. Alden Corp. </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>362, 368, 365 A.2d 469 (1976). The Eminent Domain Act effectuates these constitutional mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">\u201cThe critical components of due process are <em>adequate </em>notice, opportunity for a fair hearing and availability of appropriate review.\u201d <em>Schneider v. City of East Orange, </em>196 <em>N.J.Super. </em>587, 595, 483 A.2d 839 (App.Div.1984), <em>aff'd, </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>115, 510 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>1118, <em>cert. denied, </em>479 <em>U.S. </em>824, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>97, 93 L.Ed.2d 48 (1986) (emphasis added); <em>see also Department of Community Affairs v.

County of Essex, </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>270, 287, 620 A.2d 1071 (Law Div.1992) (emphasis added). \u201cThe fundamental requisite of notice involves \u2018such notice as is in keeping with the character of the proceedings and <em>adequate </em>to safeguard the right entitled to protection.\u2019 \u201d <em>Wertheimer, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 599, 427 A.2d 592 (quoting <em>State v.

Board of Educ. of Berkeley Township, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>572, 591, 622 A.2d 237 (1993); <em>Hopkins v. Board of Review, </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>84, 90, 591 A.2d 1371 (App.Div.1991). While the purposes of the Act are to allow the acquisition of private property for public use and to direct the manner in which it may be acquired, <em>Comm\u2019r of Transp. v. South Hackensack Township., </em>111 <em>N.J.Super. </em>534, 543, 269 A.2d 769 (App.Div.1970), <em>certif. denied, </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>433, 273 A.2d 60 (1971), the government is bound to observe the constitutional mandate of the payment of just compensation for property taken in condemnation proceedings. <em>Siris, supra, </em>191 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 266, 466 A.2d 96.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">In the light of the intent and purpose of the Act, the appeal-preclusion consequences of the failure to appear personally or through counsel at the commissioners\u2019 hearing, contained in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-13(a), make that hearing a critical stage in the condemnation procedure. Because the right of property owners to just compensation for a taking through the exercise of the power of eminent domain is constitutionally founded, we are persuaded that a party entitled to notice of the commissioners\u2019 hearing is also entitled to notice of the appeal-preclusion conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>quenees of the failure to appear. Without the right to appeal, the award of the commissioners becomes final, and is tantamount to entry of a default against the non-appearing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">We find that the form of hearing notice used in this case is insufficient in that it fails to adequately advise property owners, or other interested parties, that should they fail to appear at the commissioners\u2019 hearing, personally or through counsel, they will not be permitted to appeal from the commissioners\u2019 report.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">In view of our rulings and conclusions, we need not address the remaining issues raised in defendant\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">In summary, we affirm the interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-13(a) by the trial judge that the failure of a properly noticed property owner or other interested party to appear at the hearing of the condemnation commissioners constitutes a waiver of the right of that party to appeal from the commissioners\u2019 award. However, because of the inadequacy of the content of the notice provided to defendant, we reverse and remand for appeal proceedings in accordance with <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:3-13. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
