ORS 164.325.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Those convictions stem from a single incident in 1994, in which defendant started a fire in the unoccupied first floor of a two-story duplex. A woman and her two young children, who lived in the second story, died as a result. Defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of reckless burning. ORS 164.335.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He also raises two assignments of error concerning his sentencing. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Defendant\u2019s first assignment contends that the trial court erred by denying his request to instruct the jury on the crime of reckless burning as a lesser included crime of arson in the first degree. We review the refusal to instruct the jury on a lesser included crime for errors of law. ORS 138.220; <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>320 Or 47, 57, 880 P2d 431 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The right to a lesser included crime instruction is limited to those cases where there is \u201c \u2018evidence, or an inference which can be drawn from the evidence, which supports the requested instruction so that the jury could rationally and consistently find the defendant guilty of the lesser offense and innocent of the greater.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58 (quoting <em>State v. Washington, </em>273 Or 829, 838, 543 P2d 1058 (1975)). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>state does not dispute defendant\u2019s claim that reckless burning is a lesser included offense of arson. <em>See State v. Booth, </em>284 Or 615, 618, 588 P2d 614 (1978). However, the state does contend that there is no evidence that would rationally support a reckless burning instruction here. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">At trial, defendant argued that the fire was caused by faulty electrical wiring. On appeal, he points to no specific evidence in the record that would indicate that he recklessly damaged the building by starting the fire. Rather, defendant argues that because he was charged in the manslaughter<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> counts with having a reckless mental state, there must necessarily be evidence in the record from which the jury could find that defendant acted with the reckless mental state to support a finding of reckless burning. We disagree with defendant\u2019s assertion that the mental element as to each offense is identical: the mental state exists in relationship to a particular circumstance or result. ORS 161.085(9). \u201cRecklessly\u201d in the reckless burning statute, thus, describes a mental state associated with the act of damaging property. \u201cRecklessly\u201d in the manslaughter statute describes a mental state associated with the act of causing a person\u2019s death. Evidence that a person acted recklessly in causing another person\u2019s death does not necessarily establish that a person recklessly damaged property. Therefore, in the absence of evidence to support a reckless burning charge, defendant\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">We turn to defendant\u2019s sentencing. The trial court sentenced defendant to three consecutive life terms on each count of aggravated murder. Each count also carried a minimum term of confinement of 30 years without possibility of parole. ORS 163.105(l)(c). The three counts of felony murder and three counts of arson were merged with the aggravated murder counts. The court refused to merge the manslaughter counts with the aggravated murder counts, and defendant was sentenced to three consecutive sentences on the manslaughter counts, totaling over 48 years. Those sentences are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>to be served concurrently with the sentences imposed on the aggravated murder counts. The court ordered post-prison supervision for life on the aggravated murder counts and three years on the manslaughter counts. Defendant was also ordered to pay $20,000 for attorney fees and $10,476 for restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">Defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s failure to merge his manslaughter convictions with his convictions for aggravated murder. We review for errors of law. ORS 138.220.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Relying on our decision in <em>State v. Henry, </em>138 Or App 286, 288, 907 P2d 1133 (1995), defendant argues that this is a case of \u201ctrue merger\u201d in that \u201cthere are no elements of manslaughter in the first degree which are not included in the crime of aggravated murder.\u201d In <em>Henry, </em>we held that manslaughter in the first degree, as defined in ORS 163.118(l)(a) is a lesser included offense of intentional murder, as defined in ORS 163.115(l)(a). That holding, however, provides no support for defendant\u2019s merger argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Defendant was charged with aggravated murder, as defined in ORS 163.095(l)(d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That particular formulation of the aggravated murder statute requires that the state prove the elements of felony murder, as defined in ORS 163.115(l)(b)(A), and that \u201cthere was more than one murder victim in the same criminal episode [.]\u201d Arson in the first degree, as defined in ORS 164.325(l)(b) was alleged as the underlying felony. Under the state\u2019s aggravated murder formulation, it did not have to prove that defendant intentionally caused the victims\u2019 deaths. Rather, the state needed only to prove that defendant \u201cintentionally damaged property\u2019 and that the \u201cact [of damaging property] recklessly placed another person in danger of physical injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">However, even assuming that \u201crecklessly,\u201d as used in the arson statute describes a <em>mens rea </em>element identical to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>that found in manslaughter in the first degree, the manslaughter statute contains an additional element that is not in the state\u2019s aggravated murder formulation. To prove manslaughter in the first degree, the state must prove not only that defendant recklessly caused the victim\u2019s death, but also that defendant did so \u201cunder circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to the value of human life.\u201d In <em>State v. Boone, </em>294 Or 630, 661 P2d 917 (1983), the Supreme Court concluded that the \u201cextreme indifference\u201d language contained in the definition of assault in the second degree in ORS 163.175(l)(c), which is identical to that found in manslaughter in the first degree, did not create an additional culpable mental state but, instead, described conduct that exhibits a heightened degree of culpability, greater than mere recklessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Thus, under the statutory comparison analysis required by the \u201canti-merger\u201d statutes, manslaughter in the first degree contains an element \u2014 conduct manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life \u2014 that is not in the state\u2019s aggravated murder charge here. Because the statutory elements of the aggravated murder and manslaughter in the first degree charges are different, merger is not required. The trial court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Lastly, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s order that he pay attorney fees and restitution totaling over $30,000. He argues that the trial court erred by ordering any attorney fees or restitution during his prison term because the court failed to identify any of his current assets, as required under ORS 161.675(1).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">At the sentencing hearing, defendant disputed the amount of restitution, arguing that anything above a nominal amount would be futile because he would not likely be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>able to pay. To the extent that defendant makes that argument here, we reject it. Defendant did not, however, dispute at sentencing, as he does here, that the court lacked authority to order restitution during his prison term. Because defendant failed to preserve that argument below, we do not address it now.
