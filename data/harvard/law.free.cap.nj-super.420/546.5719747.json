We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">On March 16, 2007, a van owned by defendant Community Options, Inc. (Community Options) and operated by defendant William E. Ringenwald (Ringenwald) collided with the rear end of an automobile, which was being driven by Toni A. Kan-Boatwright (Kan-Boatwright). Kan-Boatwright allegedly suffered serious injuries in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-11\">The Community Options vehicle was insured under a commercial automobile insurance policy issued by Philadelphia Indemnity. The Kan-Boatwright vehicle was insured under a policy issued by GEICO, which provided personal injury protection (PIP) benefits. GEICO paid $34,974.59 for the medical care of Kan-Boatwright. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>GEICO filed an action in the trial court against Philadelphia Indemnity, Community Options and Ringenwald, in which it alleged that the accident had been caused by Ringenwald\u2019s recklessness, negligence and failure to make proper observations. GEICO asserted that Philadelphia Indemnity was obligated to reimburse GEICO for the PIP benefits that it paid on Kan-Boatwright\u2019s behalf. Philadelphia Indemnity, Community Options and Ringenwald filed an answer denying liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Thereafter, defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, and GEICO filed a cross-motion for summary judgment. The trial court considered the motions on July 23, 2010. GEICO and Philadelphia Indemnity consented to the dismissal of the claims against Community Options and Ringenwald.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">The court determined that GEICO had the right to seek reimbursement of its PIP benefits from Philadelphia Indemnity pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-9.1 because, although Community Options was required to maintain insurance with PIP benefits for the private passenger automobiles in its fleet, it was not required to maintain such coverage for the van involved in the subject accident. The court entered an order dated July 23, 2010, denying Philadelphia Indemnity\u2019s motion for summary judgment, granting summary judgment in GEICO\u2019s favor, and dismissing the claims against Community Options and Ringenwald. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Philadelphia Indemnity argues that the court erred by finding that GEICO may seek reimbursement of its PIP payments from it pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-9.1. We disagree and affirm the trial court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-9.1 provides in pertinent part that an insurer, health maintenance organization (HMO) or governmental agency that pays PIP benefits pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-4.3, <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-4 or <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:6A-10, or medical expense benefits pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-3.1, as a result of an accident that occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>in New Jersey, has the right to recover the amount of those payments</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-4\">from any tortfeasor who was not, at the time of the accident, required to maintain personal injury protection or medical expense benefits coverage, other than for pedestrians, under the laws of this State, including personal injury protection coverage required to be provided in accordance with <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>17:28-1.4], or although required did not maintain personal injury protection or medical expense benefits coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The statute further provides that, in the case of an accident occurring in New Jersey involving an insured tortfeasor, the determination of whether the insurer,. HMO or government agency is entitled to reimbursement \u201cshall be made against the insurer of the tortfeasor, and shall be by agreement of the involved parties or, upon failing to agree, by arbitration.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>89:6A-9.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Here, Philadelphia Indemnity issued a commercial insurance policy to Community Options, which included various types of coverage, including automobile insurance. The policy covered 211 vehicles and 139 of those vehicles were garaged principally in New Jersey. Forty-three of the New Jersey vehicles were considered to be \u201cprivate passenger automobiles,\u201d and the policy provided PIP coverage for those vehicles. However, the Community Options vehicle involved in the subject accident was a commercial van. PIP coverage was not required for that vehicle, and the Philadelphia Indemnity policy did not provide it. The trial court correctly found that, under these circumstances, GEICO could seek reimbursement' of PIP payments from Philadelphia Indemnity, the insurer for the alleged tortfeasors.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">Philadelphia Indemnity argues, however, that Community Options should be considered a tortfeasor \u201crequired\u201d to maintain PIP coverage for purposes of <em>N.J.SA </em>39:6A-9.1 because, although it was not required to maintain PIP coverage for the van involved in the accident, it was required to maintain PIP coverage for the private-passenger-type of automobiles in its fleet. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Philadelphia Indemnity\u2019s argument is inconsistent with the language of the statute. By enacting <em>N.J.SA </em>39:6A-9.1, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>Legislature intended that an insurer could seek reimbursement of its PIP or medical expense benefit payments from any tortfeasor who was not \u201crequired\u201d to maintain PIP or medical expense benefits coverage for the vehicle involved in the subject \u201caccident.\u201d There is no indication in the language of the statute that the Legislature intended to preclude an insurer from seeking reimbursement of its PIP or medical expense benefit payments from a tortfeasor who was not \u201crequired\u201d to maintain PIP or medical expense benefits coverage for the vehicle involved in the \u201caccident\u201d but was \u201crequired\u201d to maintain such coverage for other vehicles. <em>See Drive N.J. Ins. Co. v. Gisis, </em>420 <em>N.J.Super. </em>295, 21 A.3d 216, 2011 <em>WL </em>2623560 (App.Div.2011) (holding that insurer could recover its PIP benefits from insurer for tortfeasor who was not \u201crequired\u201d to maintain PIP or medical expense benefits coverage for vehicle involved in accident).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Furthermore, Philadelphia Indemnity\u2019s argument is inconsistent with the purpose of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-9.1. The statute permits an insurer paying PIP or medical expense benefits to recover those payments from two classes of tortfeasors: insured tortfeasors who were required by law to maintain PIP and medical expense benefits coverage, and tortfeasors that failed to maintain such coverage, although required to do so. <em>Unsatisfied Claim &amp; Judgment Fund Bd. v. N.J. Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>185, 193, 649 A.2d 1243 (1994). \u201cThe first class refers to insured commercial or public vehicles without PIP coverage.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The second class includes uninsured tortfeasors who failed to maintain the required coverage. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">In <em>Unsatisfied Claim &amp; Judgment Fund, </em>the Court explained the purpose in allowing an insurer to recover its PIP and medical expense payments from such tortfeasors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">Uninsured and commercial-vehicle tortfeasors do not share in the costs of maintaining the no-fault system; however, without [N.J.S.A. 39:6A-9.1], they would otherwise reap its benefits. That is so because the No-Fault Law forces insurers to pay for their own insureds\u2019 expenses and also prohibits injured parties from suing tortfeasors for the same costs, resulting in those tortfeasors avoiding any responsibility for their roles in the accidents. Allowing recoupment simply ensures that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>private-passenger automobile insurers do not subsidize other insurers and that those savings are passed on to consumers\u2014the same consumers the No Fault Law was designed to protect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 205, 649 A.2d 1243.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">When a tortfeasor does not maintain PIP or medical expense benefit coverage for the vehicle involved in the accident, it is not sharing in the cost of maintaining the no-fault system as it pertains to the use of that vehicle. Permitting an insurer to recoup its PIP or medical expense benefit payments under these circumstances ensures that a tortfeasor does not avoid responsibility for its role in an accident, and allows the savings to be passed on to the consumers the No-Fault Law was designed to protect. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">We therefore conclude that the trial court correctly determined that GEICO was entitled to assert a claim under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:6A-9.1 for reimbursement of its PIP payments from Philadelphia Indemnity, as insurer for Community Options and Ringenwald, the alleged tortfeasors in the subject accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
