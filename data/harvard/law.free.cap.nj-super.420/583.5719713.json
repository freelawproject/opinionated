We conclude that the use of such information to determine a suspect\u2019s general location on public roadways or other places in which there is no legitimate expectation of privacy does not violate the suspect\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Defendant was indicted for burglary, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:18-2; theft of movable property, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:20-3(a); receiving stolen property, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:20-7(a); and possession of marijuana, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:35-10(a)(3). Defendant filed a motion to suppress the evidence against him. Following a three-day evidentiary hearing, the trial court delivered a comprehensive oral opinion granting the motion in one limited respect, but denying the motion as to most of the evidence against defendant. Defendant then entered into a plea bargain under which he agreed to plead guilty to the burglary and theft charges, and the State agreed to recommend an aggregate sentence of seven years imprisonment, with three years of parole ineligibility. The trial court sentenced defendant in accordance with the plea bargain to an extended seven-year term, with three years of parole ineligibility, for burglary, and a concurrent five-year term, with two-and-a-haif years of parole ineligibility, for theft of movable property.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">Defendant filed an appeal from the judgment of conviction, which we heard on an excess sentence calendar. <em>See R. </em>2:9-11. We affirmed defendant\u2019s sentence as not excessive by an oral opinion and order entered on June 23, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">Defendant subsequently filed a motion to reopen his appeal to challenge the denial of his motion to suppress, which we granted. The State has not cross-appealed from the part of the trial court order suppressing a limited part of the evidence against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">The searches that revealed the evidence upon which defendant\u2019s convictions are based were the result of a Middletown Township Police Department investigation of a series of residential burglaries. The victim of one of the burglaries reported that a cell phone taken from his home was still in active use. The police obtained a communications data warrant authorizing them to monitor the incoming and outgoing calls on this phone, which enabled the police to determine the identity of the person in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>possession of the phone. When the police arrested that person, he told them he had purchased the phone from defendant. That person also told the police defendant had been engaged in a series of residential burglaries and that he kept many of the items he had stolen in a storage unit leased either by defendant or his girlfriend, Desiree Gates.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The police subsequently located Gates and told her they believed defendant was keeping stolen property in a storage unit she had leased with him. Gates stated that she and defendant previously had a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship and confirmed they had leased a storage unit together. After Gates agreed to cooperate with the police, she showed them the storage facility where she and defendant had leased a unit. Although defendant paid the rent for the unit, it was leased solely in Gates\u2019 name, and Gates stored her summer clothing in it. However, defendant retained the sole key.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">After the police arrived at the storage facility with Gates, she executed a written consent for the police to search the unit. Since Gates did not have a key, she also executed a form provided by the storage facility authorizing the breaking of the lock. Pursuant to these authorizations, the police entered the unit, where they discovered a substantial quantity of what appeared to be stolen property, including golf clubs, electronic equipment such as flat screen televisions, expensive jewelry, and sports memorabilia. Gates told the police the storage unit had contained only her property the last time she had been there and that she was unaware defendant was using it to store stolen property. The police seized the apparent stolen items and returned to police headquarters in the late afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Based on the evidence discovered in the storage unit and other evidence gathered in their investigation, the police obtained a warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest. In addition, Gates\u2019 cousin told the police defendant had threatened to harm Gates when he found out Gates had allowed the police access to the storage unit and that she had not seen Gates since the search of the unit. Consequent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>ly, Gates\u2019s cousin expressed concern about Gates\u2019s safety. The police undertook to find defendant both to execute the arrest warrant and to assure that he did not harm Gates.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">In an effort to locate defendant for these purposes, the police contacted T-Mobile, which was defendant\u2019s cell phone carrier. T-Mobile was able to determine defendant\u2019s general location at any given time because every seven seconds, a cell phone scans for the strongest signal, which is usually from the nearest tower, and then registers with that tower by sending in a signal to identify itself. <em>See In re Pen Register &amp; Trap/Trace Device with Cell Site Location Auth, </em>396 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>747, 750 (S.D.Tex.2005). T-Mobile first notified the police around 8 p.m. that defendant was in the general area of Route 35 in Eatontown and then, after the police again contacted T-Mobile around 9:30 p.m., it notified them that defendant was in the general area around Routes 33 and 18 in Neptune. However, the police were unable to locate defendant in either of those areas. Around 11 p.m., the police again contacted T-Mobile, which notified them that defendant\u2019s cell phone was emitting signals in the general area of Route 9 in Howell. A search of that area revealed defendant\u2019s car in a motel parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">By speaking with the clerk in the motel office, the police were able to determine the room in which defendant and Gates were staying. The police called the room, spoke to Gates, and later arrested defendant when he came to the door. At that time, the police observed a flat screen television and luggage in the middle of the room. The police entered the room and seized those items, which they brought back to police headquarters. While in the room, the police opened a dresser drawer in which they found a pillowcase filled with stolen property, which they also brought back to police headquarters.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">After the police brought defendant to headquarters, he signed written consents for the police to search the luggage seized in the motel room. The searches of the luggage revealed additional stolen property and marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>At the suppression hearing, defendant called Gates as a witness on his behalf. She testified that the police officers who presented the consent to search form for her to sign told her they could obtain a warrant in twenty minutes if she did not sign it. According to Gates, the police also told her that if they found any stolen property in the storage unit, she could be \u201ccharged with it.\u201d Gates testified that she only signed the consent form because she was \u201cscared\u201d and did not do so voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Defendant also testified on his own behalf. He denied giving oral consent to the search of the dresser drawer in the motel room. Defendant admitted executing the consent to search form at police headquarters, but claimed that he did so only because he was afraid he would lose his property if he refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The trial court concluded in an oral opinion that Gates, as the person who had leased the storage unit, had authority to consent to a search of the unit. The court found Gates\u2019s testimony that she had been coerced into giving her consent to be incredible and upheld its validity. The court also concluded that a person generally would have a constitutionally protected privacy interest in preventing his cell phone provider from disclosing the general area where he is located, but that the police inquiries to T-Mobile concerning defendant\u2019s whereabouts were justified under the emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement because the police had an objectively reasonable basis for believing defendant planned to cause physical harm to Gates. Therefore, the court concluded that the police \u201clawfully obtained\u201d information about defendant\u2019s presence in the general area of the motel and thus lawfully entered defendant\u2019s motel room to arrest him. The court further concluded that the seizure of the flat screen television and luggage that was in plain view inside the motel room was valid. However, the court found that the State had not proven that defendant or Gates gave verbal consent to the search of the dresser drawers and therefore suppressed evidence of the stolen jewelry contained in the pillowcase found in the drawer. Finally, the court found that defendant\u2019s written consent to the search of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>the luggage found in the motel room was freely and voluntarily given and therefore denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence found in that search.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">On appeal, defendant argues: (1) Gates did not have authority to consent to the search of the storage unit; (2) the monitoring of defendant\u2019s cell phone location was not justified under the emergency aid exception to the warrant requirement, and therefore, the evidence discovered in his motel room as a result of his arrest must be suppressed; and (3) even if the police entry into his motel room to arrest him was valid, the seizure of the flat screen television and luggage found in the room was not justified under the plain view exception to the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">We conclude that Gates had authority to consent to the search of the storage unit. We also conclude that defendant had no constitutionally protected privacy interest in preventing T-Mobile from disclosing information concerning the general location of his cell phone. Therefore, we uphold the validity of defendant\u2019s arrest based partly on that information without considering the applicability of the emergency aid exception. Finally, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that the seizure of the flat screen television and luggage was not justified under the plain view exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-9\">\u201c[WJhen the prosecution seeks to justify a warrantless search by proof of voluntary consent, it is not limited to proof that consent was given by the defendant, but may show that permission to search was obtained from a third party who possessed common authority over or other sufficient relationship to the premises or effects sought to be inspected.\u201d <em>United States v. Matlock, </em>415 <em>U.S. </em>164, 171, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>988, 993, 39 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>242, 249-50 (1974). A showing of such common authority \u201crests ... on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>access or control for most purposes, so that it is reasonable to recognize that any of the co-inhabitants has the right to permit the inspection in his own right and that the others have assumed the risk that one of their number might permit the common area to be searched.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 171 n. 7, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 993, 39 L.Ed.2d at 250. A determination whether a person has authority to consent to a search \u201cmust \u2018be judged against an objective standard: would the facts available to the officer at the moment ... warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that the consenting party had authority over the premises?\u2019 \u201d <em>Illinois v. Rodriguez, </em>497 <em>U.S. </em>177, 188, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>2793, 2801, 111 L.Ed.2d 148, 161 (1990) (quoting <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>1, 21-22, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1868, 1880, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, 906 (1968)). Our courts generally follow these same principles in determining the validity of a consent to search under Article I, paragraph 7, of the New Jersey Constitution.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See State v. Suazo, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>315, 319-20, 627 A.2d 1074 (1993); <em>State v. Coyle, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>194, 215-18, 574 A.2d 951 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Applying these principles, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals concluded in <em>United States v. Kim, </em>105 <em>F.</em>3d 1579 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 <em>U.S. </em>940, 118 <em>S.Ct. </em>353, 139 L.Ed.2d 275 (1997), that a lessee of a storage unit named Wee had actual authority to consent to a search of the unit even though the rental agreement indicated that other individuals, including the defendant Eim, also had a right of access, and Wee did not have possession of the key to the unit when he gave consent. In reaching this conclusion, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>By instructing Wee to lease the units in Wee\u2019s name, Kim assumed the risk that Wee could exercise his rights as lessee to have the storage company open the unit. In addition, Kim allowed Wee to keep possession of the leases, supervise unloading of the goods and retain the keys on occasion. At any time, Wee could have accessed the storage locker without Kim\u2019s knowledge or permission. Because Kim ceded partial control of the [storage] lockers to Wee at all times, and allowed him total control on occasion, he assumed the risk that Wee would allow a search of the units.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 1582.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Similarly, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals concluded in <em>United States v. Camp, </em>157 <em>Fed.Appx. </em>121 (11th Cir.2005), that a woman named Compton, who leased a storage unit in her own name for the defendant, who was her \u201clive-in companion,\u201d to store his illegally possessed firearms, and also stored her own firearms in the unit, could consent to a search even though the defendant had changed the lock and refused to give her a key. In reaching this conclusion, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">Here, there was both mutual use and joint access such that [defendant] and Compton had common authority over the storage unit in which the firearms were found, ... and Compton, accordingly, could consent to a warrantless search of it. Compton and Camp both stored property in the unit (mutual use) and Compton retained joint access to the unit since she was the <em>only </em>name on the unit\u2019s lease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-W\"><em>[Id. </em>at 123.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">We conclude that, as in <em>Kim </em>and <em>Camp, </em>Gates, as the lessee, had actual authority to consent to a search of the storage unit even though she did not possess the key to the lock when she gave that consent. As far as the operator of the storage facility was concerned, Gates was the only person with a right of access. She provided her driver\u2019s license with her photo and her insurance information in applying to lease the unit, and the lease was solely in her own name. Any right of access defendant may have had was a purely private arrangement between him and Gates, to which the operator of the storage facility was not a party. Moreover, although Gates permitted defendant to use the storage unit, she also stored her own personal belongings in it. And even though defendant had the key to the lock when the search was conducted, Gates undoubtedly could have gained access to the unit at any time simply by executing the storage facility\u2019s \u201cTenant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Permission to Cut Off Lock\u201d form, as she did after consenting to the search. Therefore, there was the same kind of \u201cmutual use\u201d and \u201cjoint access\u201d to the storage unit by Gates and defendant as in <em>Camp. </em>Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence of the stolen property discovered in the storage unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">We turn next to defendant\u2019s argument that the trial court should have suppressed evidence of the stolen property found in his motel room because the police violated his rights under the Fourth Amendment and its counterpart under the New Jersey Constitution by obtaining information about the general location of his cell phone from T-Mobile without a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Initially, we note that defendant does not question the validity of the warrant for his arrest. Defendant also does not question the right of the police to execute that warrant in the motel room in which he was staying. <em>See Payton v. New York, </em>445 <em>U.S. </em>573, 602-03, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>1371, 1388, 63 L.Ed.2d 639, 660-61 (1980); <em>State v. Cleveland, 371 N.J.Super. </em>286, 294-95, 852 A.2d 1150 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>148, 862 A.2d 57 (2004). Defendant\u2019s only argument is that because the police used information obtained from T-Mobile concerning the location of his cell phone to assist in determining where he could be found, the evidence found in the motel room must be suppressed as a fruit of the illegal search of his cell phone information.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">The Supreme Court of the United States first addressed the validity of electronic tracking of a criminal suspect in <em>United States v. Knotts, </em>460 <em>U.S. </em>276, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>1081, 75 L.Ed.2d 55 (1983). In that case, the government obtained information that three individuals were engaged in the manufacture of illicit drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 278, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1083, 75 L.Ed.2d at 59-60. One of the chemicals used in this manufacturing process was chloroform. <em>Ibid. </em>With the consent of the seller of the chloroform, the government installed a beeper in a container of chloroform that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>subsequently sold to one of the participants in the drug manufacturing enterprise, Armstrong, who drove his car to the residence of another participant, Petschen, and transferred the container to his car. <em>Ibid. </em>Petschen then drove his car to a cabin occupied by the third participant, defendant Knotts. <em>Ibid. </em>The government was able to track the transportation of chloroform first to Petschen\u2019s house and then to Knotts\u2019 cabin by means of intermittent visual surveillance of Armstrong\u2019s and Petschen\u2019s cars and also by the electronic signals emanating from the beeper. <em>Ibid. </em>Based partly on that evidence, the government obtained a warrant for the search of Knotts\u2019 cabin, which revealed evidence that resulted in his conviction for a drug offense. <em>Id. </em>at 279, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1084, 75 <em>L.Ed.2</em>d at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">In rejecting Knotts\u2019s argument that the warrant was invalid because the government violated the Fourth Amendment by utilizing the beeper installed in the container of chloroform to track the chloroform\u2019s movement to his cabin, the court stated that \u201c[a] person traveling in an automobile on public thoroughfares has no reasonable expectation of privacy in his movements from one place to another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1085, 75 L.Ed.2d at 62. The court reasoned that the movements of Armstrong\u2019s and Petschen\u2019s cars that eventually led the police to Knotts\u2019s cabin could have been tracked through visual surveillance on public roads and that the \u201cenhancement\u201d of natural, visual surveillance capabilities with the use of \u201cscience and technology\u201d did not raise a Fourth Amendment problem. <em>Id. </em>at 282, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1086, 75 L.Ed.2d at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">The Court next addressed the issue of electronic tracking in <em>United States v. Karo, </em>468 <em>U.S. </em>705, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>3296, 82 L.Ed.2d 530 (1984). In that case, the government was told by an informant that Karo and three confederates had ordered from him fifty gallons of ether, which is used to extract cocaine from clothing. <em>Id. </em>at 708, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3299, 82 L.Ed.2d at 537. With the informant\u2019s consent, the government installed a beeper in one of the cans used to transport the ether. <em>Ibid. </em>For the next five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>months, the government used the beeper, together with visual surveillance, to track the movement of the ether. <em>Id. </em>at 708-10, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3300, 82 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 537-38. During part of this time, the ether was stored in public storage facilities and at other times in private residences. <em>Ibid. </em>The ether was eventually transported to a private residence in Taos, New Mexico. <em>Id. </em>at 709, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3300, 82 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 538. Based partly on evidence obtained through use of the, beeper, the government secured a warrant to search the Taos residence. <em>Id. </em>at 710, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3300, 82 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 538. The execution of this warrant revealed cocaine and drug paraphernalia. <em>Ibid. </em>The lower federal courts invalidated the warrant on the ground that it was obtained based on information revealed by the beeper.. <em>Id. </em>at 710,104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3301, 82 <em>L.Ed.2</em>d at 538.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">The Court described the primary issue presented by the appeal as \u201cwhether monitoring of a beeper falls within the ambit of the Fourth Amendment when it reveals information that could not have been obtained through visual surveillance,\u201d specifically the continuing presence of the ether within the Taos residence. <em>Id. </em>at 707, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3299, 82 L.Ed.2d at 536. The Court concluded that such use of a beeper, without a warrant, violates the Fourth Amendment. In reaching this conclusion, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-6\">Even if visual surveillance has revealed that the article to which the beeper is attached has entered the house, the later monitoring not only verifies the officers\u2019 observations but also establishes that the article remains on the premises____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-7\">... Indiscriminate monitoring of property that has been withdrawn from public view would present far too serious a threat to privacy interests in the home to escape entirely some sort of Fourth Amendment oversight.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 715-16, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3303-04, 82 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 541-42 (footnote omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">However, the Court reaffirmed its holding in <em>Knotts </em>that the use of a beeper or other electronic tracking device for surveillance of a suspect\u2019s or contraband\u2019s movements along highways or in other public places does not violate the Fourth Amendment. <em>See id. </em>at 714-15, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3302-03, 82 L.Ed.2d at 540-42. The Court also concluded that the government had obtained sufficient evidence through such means to uphold the validity of the warrant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>for the search of the Taos residence. <em>Id. </em>at 719-21, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3305-06, 82 L.Ed.2d at 544-45. In reaching this conclusion, the Court stated that \u201cit is evident that under <em>Knotts </em>there was no violation of the Fourth Amendment\u201d in the use of the beeper to monitor the movement of the truck on public highways until it reached the Taos residence. <em>Id. </em>at 721, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3306, 82 <em>L.Ed.2</em>d at 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Courts in other jurisdictions have relied upon <em>Knotts </em>in concluding that the use of information derived from a suspect\u2019s cell phone to determine his general location does not violate the Fourth Amendment. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Forest, </em>355 F.3d 942, 950-52 (6th Cir.2004), <em>remanded on unrelated sentencing grounds, </em>543 <em>U.S. </em>1100, 125 <em>S.Ct. </em>1050, 160 L.Ed.2d 1001 (2005); <em>Devega v. State, </em>286 <em>Ga. </em>448, 689 S.E.2d 293, 300-01 (2010); <em>Stone v. State, </em>178 <em>Md.App. </em>428, 941 A.2d 1238, 1249-50 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">In <em>Forest, </em>Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents who were experiencing difficulty conducting visual surveillance of two suspects believed to be awaiting the arrival of a large shipment of cocaine dialed one suspect\u2019s cell phone, without allowing it to ring, and determined his general location by \u201ccell-site data\u201d provided by the suspect\u2019s cell phone provider. 355 F.3d at 947. In determining that the use of this electronic tracking, together with visual surveillance, to follow and eventually arrest the suspects, did not violate the Fourth Amendment, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">[T]he cell-site data was used to track [the defendant\u2019s] movements only on public highways. The rationale of <em>Knotts </em>therefore compels the conclusion that [the defendant] had no legitimate expectation of privacy in the cell-site data because the DEA agents could have obtained the same information by following [the defendant\u2019s] car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 951.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">The court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that his case was distinguishable from <em>Knotts </em>because he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in his cell site data even if he did not have a legitimate expectation of privacy regarding his location:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-11\">[T]he cell-site data is simply a proxy for [the defendant\u2019s] visually observable location. But as previously noted, [the defendant] had no legitimate expectation of privacy in his movements along public highways. We believe, therefore, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Knotts </em>is controlling and conclude that the DEA agents did not conduct a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when they obtained [the defendant\u2019s] cell-site data.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 951-52.] <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Similarly, in <em>Devega, </em>the police ascertained a murder suspect\u2019s general location on a public highway by having his cell phone provider \u201cping\u201d his phone. 689 S.E.2d at 299. In rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that his trial counsel had been ineffective in failing to move for suppression of evidence on the theory that such electronic monitoring violated the Fourth Amendment, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">\u201cThe GPS tracking device [and \u2018ping1 information] in the case at bar is simply the next generation of tracking science and technology from the radio transmitter \u2018beeper\u2019 in <em>Knotts, </em>to which the <em>Knotts </em>Fourth Amendment analysis directly applies.\u201d ... Because the warrantless monitoring of his cell phone location revealed the same information as visual surveillance, there was no Fourth Amendment violation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">[Id. at 300 (quoting <em>Stone, supra, </em>941 A.2d at 1250).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">We conclude, as did the courts in Forest and <em>Devega, </em>that the use by the police of information obtained from T-Mobile concerning defendant\u2019s general location, derived from signals emitted by his cell phone, which together with visual surveillance resulted in discovery of his ear in a motel parking lot, did not violate any legitimate expectation of privacy defendant may have had regarding the location of his car. As in <em>Knotts, </em>\u201c[w]hen [defendant] traveled over the public streets he voluntarily con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>veyed to anyone who wanted to look the fact that he was traveling over particular roads in a particular direction ... and the fact of his final destination\u201d at the motel, 460 <em>U.S. </em>at 281-82, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1085, 75 L.Ed.2d at 62, and \u201c[n]othing in the Fourth Amendment prohibited the police from augmenting the sensory faculties bestowed upon them at birth with such enhancement as science and technology afforded them,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 282, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1086, 75 L.Ed.2d at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">We reach the same conclusion under Article I, paragraph 7, of the New Jersey Constitution. Our courts have long recognized that the driver of an automobile does not have a constitutionally protected right of privacy in the movements of his car on public roadways. <em>See State v. Foley, </em>218 <em>N.J.Super. </em>210, 214-18, 527 A.2d 482 (App.Div.1987). Our courts have also recognized that police officers may utilize modern technology in conducting surveillance of public places and private property that is not subject to constitutional protection. <em>See State v. Marolda, </em>394 <em>N.J.Super. </em>430, 442-46, 927 A.2d 154 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>482, 932 A.2d 32 (2007). Our Supreme Court has construed the New Jersey Constitution to provide more extensive search and seizure protections than the Fourth Amendment only when a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy in particular information. <em>See, e.g., State v. Reid, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>386, 395-402, 945 A.2d 26 (2008) (Internet subscriber information); <em>State v. Hunt, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>338, 344-48, 450 A.2d 952 (1982) (telephone billing records). We conclude for all the reasons previously set forth that a person has no reasonable expectation of privacy in their movements on public highways or the general location of their cell phone, and therefore, there is no basis in this context for construing the New Jersey Constitution more expansively than the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">We have no occasion in deciding this appeal to determine whether a warrant would be required for the police to obtain cell phone information to determine the specific location of a suspect, particularly the suspect\u2019s location in a private place. We only hold that the Middletown police did not violate the Fourth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>or Article I, paragraph 7, of the New Jersey Constitution in utilizing the cell-site information provided by T-Mobile to assist in locating defendant to execute the warrant for his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Finally, defendant argues that the flat screen television and the luggage found in the middle of the motel room at the time of his arrest were unlawfully seized because the plain view exception to the warrant requirement did not apply. This argument is clearly without merit and only requires brief discussion. <em>R. </em>2:11-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">For the plain view exception to apply, the State must show: (1) the police officer was \u201clawfully in the viewing area\u201d; (2) the officer discovered the evidence \u201cinadvertently, meaning that he did not know in advance where evidence was located nor intend beforehand to seize it\u201d; and (3) the officer had \u201cprobable cause to associate the [item] with criminal activity.\u201d <em>State v. Mann, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>328, 341, 2 A.3d 379 (2010) (quoting <em>State v. Bruzzese, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>210, 236-37, 463 A.2d 320 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 <em>U.S. </em>1030, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>1295, 79 L.Ed.2d 695 (1984)). All three of these prerequisites for the seizure of evidence under the plain view exception were satisfied. The police were \u201clawfully in the viewing area\u201d because they had a warrant for defendant\u2019s arrest that authorized their entry into his motel room to execute. <em>See Cleveland, supra, </em>371 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 294-95, 852 A.2d 1150. The police discovered the flat screen television and luggage \u201cinadvertently\u201d because they did not \u201cknow in advance\u201d that this evidence would be found in defendant\u2019s motel room. Furthermore, the police officers had probable cause to believe that the fiat screen television was criminal contraband because it was not the motel room television and was one of the items that had been stolen in the residential burglaries they were investigating. The officers also had reason to believe defendant possessed additional stolen property he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>be transporting in the numerous suitcases standing in the middle of his motel room.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-10\"> This finding is not challenged on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b638-6\"> Our Supreme Court has construed the New Jersey Constitution more broadly than the United States Constitution in one respect relating to consensual searches. In <em>State v. Johnson, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>349, 354, 346 A.2d 66 (1975), the Court held that a consent to search must be shown to have been not only \"voluntary,\" which is the federal standard, but also that the person who authorized the search had \"knowledge of the right to refuse consent.\" <em>Accord State v. Elders, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>224, 240-41, 927 A.2d 1250 (2007). This higher standard for the validity of consent searches under the New Jersey Constitution is not implicated in the present appeal because defendant does not dispute the trial court's factual finding that Gates\u2019s consent to the search of the storage unit was both voluntary and knowing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b644-10\"> In addition to rejecting defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment argument, the court in <em>Forest </em>also rejected defendant\u2019s argument that suppression of the evidence against him was required under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (\"ECPA\"), Pub.L. No. 99-508, 100 Stat. 1848 (1986), which amended Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, Pub.L. No. 90-351, 82 Stat. 212. 355 F.3d at 948-50. The court questioned whether this federal statute would apply to the cell site information provided by the defendant\u2019s cell phone provider, but concluded it did not have to decide the issue because none of the arguably relevant sections of the statute provide a \"suppression remedy\" for a violation. <em>Id. </em>at 949-50; <em>see also In re Pen Register &amp; Trap/Trace Device with Cell Site Location Auth., supra, </em>396 F.Supp.2d at 753-65. Defendant did not rely upon any federal statutory provision in seeking suppression of the evidence found in the motel room at the time of his arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b647-7\"> As previously noted, defendant does not challenge the validity of his consent to the search of the luggage after it was brought to police headquarters.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
