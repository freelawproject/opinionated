The harassment charges were signed by James and Diane Gaffney, who lived next door to defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">Defendant raises the following points on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">\n<em>POINT I</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">THE BERGEN VICINAGE II MUNICIPAL COURT WAS OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE DEFENDANT WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL AND ITS FAILURE TO DO SO IS REVERSIBLE ERROR AS IS THE LAW DIVISION\u2019S FAILURE TO SO FIND IN THE MUNICIPAL APPEAL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-11\">\n<em>POINT II</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-12\">THIS COURT SHOULD EXERCISE ITS INHERENT POWERS TO DISMISS ALL OF THE CHARGES AGAINST DEFENDANT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-14\">\n<em>POINT III</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-15\">DEFENDANT IS ENTITLED TO THE DISMISSAL OF THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM ON THE MERITS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-17\">A. THE STATE DID NOT PROVE BY COMPETENT EVIDENCE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT DEFENDANT WAS GUILTY OF RESISTING ARREST AS CHARGED IN SUMMONS NO.

THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED AT THE SECOND MUNICIPAL COURT TRIAL IS INSUFFICIENT TO PROVE HARASSMENT BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT AS ALLEGED IN COMPLAINT NOS. SC-2006-000183, S-2006-000416, SC-0005383, S-2006-000202 AND SC-5185.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-20\">After considering these arguments in light of the record and the applicable law, we conclude that defendant was entitled to be represented by assigned counsel when the case was tried in the Garfield Municipal Court. Accordingly, the order entered by the Law Division is reversed and the matter is remanded to the municipal court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-21\">This case was first tried in the Garfield Municipal Court on July 27, 2006. Notwithstanding a Law Division order dated March 31, 2006, which allowed defendant to proceed as an indigent in an unrelated matter, he was not represented by assigned counsel in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>the municipal court proceeding, and he was convicted of six charges. The municipal court judge sentenced defendant to sixty days in jail, significant fines, and two years of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Defendant filed a notice of appeal and, on September 11, 2006, the Law Division ordered that he be provided with the transcript of the municipal court trial at public expense because he was \u201cindigent and unable to bear the cost.\u201d However, counsel was not appointed to represent defendant in the Law Division. After a de novo review, defendant was convicted of three harassment charges, fined, and sentenced to probation on February 9, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal with this court, and we granted his motion to proceed as an indigent and to be assigned counsel. Our order, entered on April 10, 2007, provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-7\">Although defendant did not receive a custodial decision in the Law Division, he received a 60-day sentence in municipal court. Therefore, as the Law Division order of September 11, 2006 found him to be indigent, the Law Division should have assigned <em>counsel____See, e.g., Rodriguez [Rodriguez </em>] <em>v. Rosenblatt, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>281 [277 A.2d 216] (1971). Accordingly, the Clerk shall arrange for the assignment of counsel and free transcripts, if necessary, on the appeal from the convictions in the Law Division. A motion for summary disposition and remand for a new trial in the municipal court or on trial de novo is invited. <em>See Rodriquez [Rodriguez </em>] <em>v. Rosenblatt, supra.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">On July 3, 2007, the Law Division ordered that \u201ccounsel be assigned to represent the Defendant-Appellant at public expense.\u201d Less than a week later, on July 9, 2007, the Law Division further ordered that \u201cthe matter [be] remanded for a new trial in the Garfield Municipal Court and the court administrator shall arrange for the assignment of counsel.\u201d We then dismissed defendant\u2019s appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">Nearly a year-and-a-half later, on February 18, 2009, the Bergen County Municipal Division Manager sent defendant a letter stating that the Garfield Municipal Court had scheduled a new trial and that a municipal public defender had been appointed to represent him. Nevertheless, at a Garfield Municipal Court case management conference on July 2, 2009, defendant was questioned about his financial ability to pay for a private attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>THE COURT: ... [A]re you going to retain a private attorney or are you going to apply for a public defender?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-6\">THE DEFENDANT: I was promised ... representation____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-7\">THE COURT: ... You only get a public defender if financially you\u2019re incapable of paying for your own attorney. Do you feel that you\u2019re in that position?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-8\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, I am, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-9\">THE COURT: All right. We\u2019re going to give you a form in a little while. And I\u2019m going to have you fill it out ... [alnd I\u2019m going to see whether you qualify financially. If you do, I\u2019ll assign a public defender to represent you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">On a \u201cFinancial Questionnaire to Establish Indigency,\u201d defendant listed his 2009 annual income as $2700, and his wife\u2019s as $50,000. The municipal court judge determined that both incomes should be combined, reasoning as follows: \u201c[Ujnfortuantely, the law imputes your wife\u2019s income to your income as well. You\u2019re each responsible for each other\u2019s support. And she\u2019s responsible for contributing to your support, just as you\u2019re responsible for contributing to her support.\u201d As a result, the court found that the \u201cfamily income\u201d \u201cexceed[ed] the threshold for qualifying for a [municipal] public defender.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2B:24-9. Thus, defendant again proceeded to trial without counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">The second municipal court trial occurred on August 27, September 3, and September 10, 2009.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant was found guilty of eight charges: five charges of harassment, resisting arrest, disorderly conduct, and failure to license dogs. Defendant was ordered to pay fines, court costs, and other monetary penalties in the amount of $3314.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-12\">Defendant filed a notice of appeal with the Law Division on September 15, 2009. In an order dated October 6, 2009, a Law Division judge found that defendant was indigent, waived the filing fee, and ordered Bergen County to pay the cost of the transcripts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Additionally, counsel was assigned to represent defendant on the appeal. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">Following oral argument, the Law Division rendered a written decision on March 15, 2010. Defendant was found guilty of the same eight offenses and the court imposed the same fines, penalties, and court costs as the municipal court. Although assigned counsel argued that defendant \u201cwas unduly prejudiced on the municipal level by being forced to proceed to trial without the benefit of counsel,\u201d the Law Division rejected the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Defendant appealed to this court and, on April 26, 2010, we granted his motion to \u201cproceed as an indigent, for transcripts and for assignment of counsel.\u201d Our order also noted that \u201c[t]he aggregate of fines and penalties\u201d constituted a consequence of magnitude under the <em>Rodriguez </em>guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">Defendant now contends the municipal court violated \u201cthe law of the case\u201d because \u201che had already been granted indigency status on several occasions.\u201d The \u201c \u2018[l]aw of the case\u2019 [doctrine] most commonly applies to the binding nature of appellate decisions upon a trial court if the matter is remanded for further proceedings, or upon a different appellate panel which may be asked to reconsider the same issue in a subsequent appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Hale, </em>127 <em>N.J.Super. </em>407, 410, 317 A.2d 731 (App.Div.1974); <em>see also </em>Pressler &amp; Verniero, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>comment 4 on <em>R. </em>1:36-3 (2011) (\u201cClearly, when an appellate court has decided an issue, its decision, even if not final in terms of the controversy, establishes the law of the case.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">In the present matter, the Garfield Municipal Court determined that defendant did not meet the indigency income threshold and declined to appoint a municipal public defender on July 2, 2009. However, orders had been previously entered by this court, as well as the Law Division, which explicitly found that defendant was indigent and entitled to the assignment of counsel. Additionally, the Bergen County Municipal Division Manager confirmed that counsel had, in fact, been assigned to represent defendant. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>Under these circumstances, the law of the case required the Garfield Municipal Court judge to provide defendant with assigned counsel at his second municipal court trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Furthermore, our independent review of the record confirms that defendant was improperly denied appointed counsel. Pursuant to <em>Rule </em>7:3-2(b), \u201c[i]f the [municipal] court is satisfied that the defendant is indigent and ... faces a consequence of magnitude or is otherwise constitutionally or by law entitled to counsel, the court shall assign the municipal public defender to represent the defendant.\u201d <em>See also Rodriguez v. Rosenblatt, supra, </em>58 <em>N.J. </em>at 295, 277 A.2d 216 (\u201c[A]s a matter of simple justice, no indigent defendant should be subjected to a conviction entailing imprisonment in fact or other consequence of magnitude without first having had due and fair opportunity to have counsel assigned without cost.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">\u201cIndigency\u201d is \u201cdetermined by the municipal court on the basis of the need of the defendant.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2B:24-9. Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158A-14, need is measured according to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">a. <em>The financial ability of the defendant </em>to engage and compensate competent private counsel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">b. The current employment, salary and income of the defendant including prospects for continued employment if admitted to bail;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-9\">c. The liquid assets of the defendant, including all real and personal property and bank accounts;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-10\">d. The ability of the defendant to make bail and the source of bail posted;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-11\">e. <em>Where appropriate the mllingness and ability of the defendant\u2019s immediate family, friends or employer to assist the defendant in meeting defense costs;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-12\">f. Where appropriate an assessment of the probable and reasonable costs of providing a private defense, based upon the status of the defendant, the nature and extent of the charges and the likely issues;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-13\">g. Where appropriate, the ability of the defendant to demonstrate convincingly that he has consulted at least three private attorneys, none of whom would accept the case for a fee within his ability to pay; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-14\">h. The ability of the defendant to provide all other necessary expenses of representation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-15\">[ (Emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-16\">Thus, a municipal court must first consider the financial wherewithal of the defendant. Additionally, in appropriate circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>stances, the court may consider a spouse\u2019s \u201cwillingness and ability\u201d to assist \u201cin meeting defense costs.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:158A-14(e). That did not happen here. Rather, the court \u201cimputed\u201d to defendant his -wife\u2019s income without any assessment of her \u201cwillingness\u201d to contribute to her husband\u2019s legal costs. Consequently, we conclude that defendant was eligible for indigent defense services based on his annual income of $2700.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Moreover, the imposition of monetary sanctions in the sum of $3314 confirms that defendant was facing a consequence of magnitude. <em>See </em>Guidelines for Determination of Consequence of Magnitude, Pressler &amp; Verniero, <em>Current N.J. Court Rules, </em>Appendix to <em>R. </em>7:3-2 at 2355 (2011) (stating that \u201c[a]ny monetary sanction imposed by the court of $750 or greater in the aggregate\u201d establishes a consequence of magnitude); <em>see also State v. Hermanns, </em>278 <em>N.J.Super. </em>19, 29, 650 A.2d 360 (App.Div.1994) (\u201c[A]ggregate monetary sanctions of $1,800 in a single proceeding gives rise to the right to counsel under <em>Rodriguez.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">\u201cThe right to be heard [in court] would be, in many eases, of little avail if it did not comprehend the right to be heard by counsel.\u201d <em>Powell v. Alabama, </em>287 <em>U.S. </em>45, 68-69, 53 <em>S.Ct. </em>55, 64, 77 <em>L.Ed. </em>158, 170 (1932). Accordingly, the Law Division\u2019s March 15, 2010 order is reversed, and the matter is remanded to the municipal court for a new trial. Defendant shall be entitled to representation by assigned counsel at the remand trial. In view of this disposition, there is no need to address defendant\u2019s remaining arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b255-22\"> There is no dispute that defendant moved in 2008.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b257-13\"> The second trial consisted of three categories of complaints: (1) two complaints that had been adjourned in the first trial; (2) the six complaints that defendant was found guilty of in the first trial; and (3) seven new complaints filed subsequent to the first trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
