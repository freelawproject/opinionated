After finding that the State had established probable cause to conclude each of the four had committed an offense that subjected him to waiver, namely, second-degree aggravated assault, the judge denied the State\u2019s motion based on his conclusion that the State\u2019s decision to seek waiver constituted a patent and gross abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">During the proceeding, the judge expressed his strong disagreement with the objectives of the waiver statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26, and voiced his objection to what he perceived to be the statute\u2019s impact on juveniles who are waived. We conclude that the judge impermissibly allowed his personal opinions and views, and his antipathy to the waiver statute, to color his evaluation of the legal issue before him, namely, whether the Prosecutor\u2019s waiver decision constituted a patent and gross abuse of discretion. We thus reverse the orders under review, and remand for further proceedings, to be described later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-15\">V.A., T.H., M.R. and C.T. were charged with juvenile delinquency, namely, committing acts constituting second-degree aggravat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>ed assault, <em>N.J.SA </em>2C:12-l(b) (count one); first-degree robbery, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:15-1 (count two); and second-degree conspiracy to commit robbery, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:5-2/2C:15-l (count three). The juvenile delinquency complaints stem from an assault and robbery on Omar Estrada on November 8, 2009 in Woodbridge Township. At the time of the incident, V.A., M.R. and C.T. were sixteen years of age, and T.H. was fifteen.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Estrada was walking along St. Georges Avenue when he was hit from behind. The blow to the back of his head caused him to temporarily lose consciousness and fall to the ground. While on the ground, he was kicked several times in the face, and lost two teeth as a result. Estrada felt someone remove his wallet from his pocket. The wallet was then thrown to the ground and he saw people running away.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">On December 3, 2009, the State moved for waiver of all four juveniles to the Law Division, supporting each motion with a statement of reasons addressing the seven factors contained in the Attorney General\u2019s \u201cJuvenile Waiver Guidelines\u201d (Guidelines), issued on March 14, 2000. With the exception of the section describing each juvenile\u2019s prior record, the four statements of reasons were identical. Each starts with a detailed description of the attack on Estrada in a section entitled \u201cNature of Offense.\u201d As for \u201cDeterrence,\u201d the statement of reasons explains that the \u201cneed to deter the juvenile and others from engaging in this sort of activity is abundantly clear.\u201d Next, in describing the \u201cEffect on Co-Defendants,\u201d the State commented that \u201c[i]n the interests of judicial efficacy and parity in sentencing, [this juvenile] and his co-defendants should be tried together in the Superior Court Criminal Division.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">Addressing \u201cMaximum Sentence,\u201d the State explained that if prosecuted in the Family Part, each juvenile would face a maximum term of ten years, whereas if prosecuted as an adult, each would face \u201cup to forty years imprisonment\u201d and would be subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>to the eighty-five percent parole ineligibility term required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:43-7.2. As for \u201cTrial Consideration^],\u201d the State commented on the \u201csubstantial likelihood of indictment\u201d and the \u201cstrong likelihood of conviction,\u201d and noted that its waiver applications were \u201cfurther supported by the seriousness of the crime committed, along with the need to adequately punish this offender and his co-defendants[.]\u201d Last, the State noted in the \u201cVictim Input\u201d section that the \u201c[v]ictim supports this application [for waiver].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">At the waiver hearing on March 8, 2010, the State called Detective Laughery, who summarized the details of his investigation. Detective Laughery interviewed three witnesses; none of the witnesses actually saw the attack, but the witnesses were able to place two of the juveniles, C.T. and T.H., near the scene minutes before the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">Laughery described the statement of James Collins, who was in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven on St. Georges Avenue when Collins was approached by T.H., who asked him for a cigarette. Collins said \u201cno.\u201d Then, Collins overhead the group say, \u201cLet\u2019s get that nigger now.\u201d Initially, Collins believed they were referring to him, but then Collins watched as three of them walked southbound on St. Georges Avenue with a fourth person following behind. He identified two individuals, T.H. and C.T.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Police officers went to the home of C.T. and requested that his parents voluntarily bring him to police headquarters for questioning. Initially, C.T. denied any involvement, but eventually told the police that he was with T.H., V.A. and M.R. on November 8, 2009 as they were walking on St. Georges Avenue in Woodbridge Township. According to C.T., they saw Estrada ahead of them, and T.H. said \u201clet\u2019s go get him.\u201d C.T. told the police that T.H. hit Estrada from the side, and Estrada did not see the attack coming. Estrada fell, and T.H. continued hitting him, while V.A. and M.R. kicked him. At first, C.T. told the police he stood there while the other three attacked Estrada, but eventually C.T. conceded he \u201cbumped\u201d Estrada and then admitted he also kicked him twice. C.T. insisted that no one had removed Estrada\u2019s wallet.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>V.A. testified at the probable cause hearing that he was with T.H., C.T. and M.R. on the night in question. V.A. watched as C.T. and M.R. \u201cran across the street\u201d and approached Estrada. C.T. hit Estrada on the side of his face, and when Estrada fell to the ground, M.R. \u201cran up and kicked [Estrada]\u201d two or three times in the face. V.A. testified that as he moved toward C.T. and M.R., he heard \u201cgrunts and groans.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">T.H. also testified at the probable cause hearing. According to T.H., after he, V.A., C.T. and M.R. left the 7-Eleven, the other three attacked Estrada from the rear. T.H. admitted he \u201cjumped in\u201d and \u201cpunched the dude.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">The judge issued his oral decision on October 6, 2010. He began by circulating four documents: an article entitled \u201cThe Effects on Violence of Law and Policies Facilitating the Transfer of Youth from Juvenile to Adult Justice System\u201d; a court brief filed in the ease of <em>In the Interest of P.M.P., </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>166, 975 A.2d 441 (2009); an article by Abigail Baird, \u201cThe Emergence of Consequential Thought: Evidence of Neuroscience\u201d; and an advertisement from Allstate Insurance Company,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cwhich has a brain with a piece out of it,\u201d and according to the judge, \u201cgraphically captures adolescence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">The judge held that the State\u2019s proofs were sufficient to establish, as to all four juveniles, probable cause for second-degree robbery and second-degree aggravated assault; however, the judge made no oral findings on the charge of second-degree conspiracy, although in the orders of disposition, he found the existence of probable cause on that charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">The judge then evaluated the Guidelines, and as to the first factor, the nature of the offense, found that there was no death of the victim; all four juveniles were involved; there was no serious harm inflicted on the victim; and no weapon present.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Addressing the second factor, deterrence, the judge concluded that it was \u201cnot abundantly clear\u201d that the juveniles were in need of deterrence. In reaching this conclusion, the judge reasoned that \u201cpeople have interpreted the [waiver] statute\u201d to mean that juveniles \u201cwith these type of charges ... [are] not really entitled to rehabilitation.\u201d The judge observed that the part of the Guidelines<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that addresses deterrence is unclear because deterrence is divided into two categories, general and specific, and \u201chas to be articulated\u201d by the State. The judge then referenced the report, \u201cThe Effects on Violence of Law and Policies Facilitating the Transfer of Youth from Juvenile to Adult Court System,\u201d and noted that the research found that \u201cchildren that [are] waived into the adult court actually commit more crimes than children that don\u2019t get waived into the adult court.\u201d The judge took judicial notice of the studies contained in the report, and commented that \u201cthese kinds of studies should be reviewed by the State rather then just saying the need to deter juveniles and others from engaging in this sort of activity is abundantly clear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Evaluating the third factor, the effect on co-defendants, the judge found that waiving juveniles to the Law Division \u201ccreates a tremendous potential for injustice,\u201d because the juveniles might be tried by four different juries, each with a different verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">Turning to the fourth factor, the maximum sentence and length of time to be served, the judge observed that the juveniles would \u201cface up to 40 years imprisonment on these offenses and be subject to the No Early Release Act\u201d if they were waived into the Law Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">As to the fifth factor, the juvenile\u2019s prior record,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the judge found that M.R. and C.T. had no prior record, T.H. received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>probation for a prior aggravated assault, and V.A. received probation for a prior assault and endangering the welfare of a child. He concluded that T.H. and V.A.\u2019s prior record did not \u201center into a decision to move the matter into the adult court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">With the sixth factor, trial considerations, the judge noted that there \u201cwere a lot of trial considerations raised by the juveniles\u201d regarding Miranda;* *<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Bruton.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The judge then concluded that the State\u2019s waiver motion was \u201cvoid of any substantive reasons\u201d and \u201cthere [was] nothing stated in the reasons by the prosecutor ... [explaining] why [the juveniles] ha[d] to go to the adult court.\u201d The judge continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Akm\">I would like to assert other serious consequences that result in a waiver decision, and I find that these are anticipated and should be considered by a court when making a decision about waiving a juvenile into the adult court. And if the Court is not, I say if the Court is not allowed to consider these things at a probable cause hearing, then I find that there is clearly a separation of powers issue, [and] that would give total carte blanche to the executive branch to the prosecutor, and I find that cannot be the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">The \u201cserious consequences\u201d mentioned by the judge included: the juveniles losing the right to vote, the right to enlist in the armed forces, the ability to run for public office, the opportunity to attain certain professional licenses and to serve as jurors. The judge criticized the waiver statute, as it both caused the \u201cjuveniles [to be] stripped of their inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,\u201d and removed the protective role of the Family Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">The judge then turned to an evaluation of whether the Prosecutor\u2019s decision to seek waiver was so wide of the mark that fundamental fairness required judicial intervention. He concluded that the Prosecutor\u2019s decision to waive the four juveniles was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>\u201cpatent and gross abuse of power\u201d because the Prosecutor\u2019s discussion of the Guidelines in each of the four statements of reasons was not \u201carticulated or delineated sufficiently to satisfy [the court].\u201d He also commented that the Prosecutor should have conducted a \u201crisk assessment\u201d to determine each juvenile\u2019s \u201cpotential for danger.\u201d In conclusion, the judge observed that although the juveniles had engaged in conduct that was \u201cvery bad,\u201d they were nonetheless entitled to protection and his decision was an \u201cattempt ... to exercise those protections.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Accordingly, by orders of October 13, 2010, the judge denied the State\u2019s waiver motions and held that V.A., M.R., C.T. and T.H. would be tried as juveniles. On November 18, 2010, we granted the State\u2019s motion for leave to appeal, as well as the State\u2019s motion to consolidate the four appeals. On January 5, 2011, we permitted the State to supplement the record on appeal with a March 24, 2010 written opinion by the same judge in four unrelated juvenile matters in which the judge had denied the State\u2019s waiver motions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">On appeal, the State argues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">THE STATE ESTABLISHED PROBABLE CAUSE ON ALL OF THE CHARGED OFFENSES AND V.A., M.R. AND C.T. FAILED TO PROVE TH[A]T THE PROSECUTOR\u2019S WAIVER DECISION WAS A PATENT AND GROSS ABUSE OF DISCRETION; THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S RULINGS IN FAVOR OF THE JUVENILES ARE THE RESULT OF THE TRIAL COURT\u2019S EXPRESS BIAS AGAINST THE JUVENILE WAIVER STATUTE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">The decision whether to grant the State\u2019s waiver application is \u201cthe single most serious act that the juvenile court can perform.\u201d <em>State in the Interest of A.D., </em>420 <em>N.J.Super. </em>144, 155, 19 A.3d 482 (App.Div.2011) (citation omitted). A trial court\u2019s waiver decision is reviewed under an abuse of discretion standard. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number><em>Ibid. </em>However, if the judge \u201c \u2018acts under a misconception of the applicable law,\u2019 \u201d we need not afford the decision such deference. <em>State in the Interest of T.M., </em>412 <em>N.J.Super. </em>225, 231, 989 A.2d 302 (App.Div.2010) (quoting <em>State v. Brown, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>595, 604, 573 A.2d 886 (1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">A juvenile will be waived to the Law Division for prosecution as an adult if there is probable cause to believe that the juvenile committed one of the violent crimes enumerated in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26(a)(2), and the juvenile is sixteen years of age or older. <em>State v. J.M., </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>402, 411-12, 866 A.2d 178 (2005). Juveniles who are between fourteen and sixteen years of age are entitled to the additional protection of a hearing at which the juvenile can avoid waiver by showing that the probability of his rehabilitation prior to reaching the age of nineteen \u201csubstantially outweighs the reasons for waiver.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:4A-26(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">In relevant part, the waiver statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">a. On motion of the prosecutor, the court shall, without the consent of the juvenile, waive jurisdiction over a case and refer that case from the Superior Court, Chancery Division, Family Part to the appropriate court and prosecuting authority having jurisdiction if it finds, after hearing, that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">(1) The juvenile was 14 years of age or older at the time of the charged delinquent act; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\">(2) There is probable cause to believe that the juvenile committed a delinquent act or acts which if committed by an adult would constitute:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-10\">(a) ... robbery which would constitute a crime of the first degree, ... [or] aggravated assault which would constitute a crime of the second degree[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-11\">e. If the juvenile can show that the probability of his rehabilitation by the use of the procedures, services and facilities available to the court prior to the juvenile reaching the age of 19 substantially outweighs the reasons for waiver, waiver shall not be granted. <em>This subsection shall not apply with respect to a juvenile 16 years of age or older who is charged with committing any of the acts enumerated in subparagraph (a) </em>[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-12\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>2A:4A-26 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">The County Prosecutor is vested \u201cwith the primary responsibility for juvenile waiver decisions when the juvenile is sixteen years or older and charged with a designated offense,\u201d because such decision is made \u201cwithout regard to rehabilitative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>evidence.\u201d <em>J.M., supra, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>at 412, 866 A.2d 178. Consistent with the Attorney General\u2019s Guidelines, the Prosecutor \u201cmust submit a written statement of reasons for waiver.\u201d <em>State v. Read, </em>397 <em>N.J.Super. </em>598, 605, 938 A.2d 953 (App.Div.), (citing <em>State in the Interest of R.C., </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>248, 256-59, 798 A.2d 111 (App.Div.2002)), <em>certif. denied, </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>85, 951 A.2d 1038 (2008). The Prosecutor is obliged to consider:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">(1) the nature of the offense; (2) deterrence; (3) the effect on co-defendants of waiver to adult court; (4) the maximum sentences that could be imposed under the juvenile or criminal codes and the amount of time likely to be served; (5) the juvenile\u2019s prior record; (6) trial considerations\u2014that is, the likelihood of conviction and potential need for grand jury investigation; and (7) victim input.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 605, 938 A.2d 953 (citing <em>Attorney General\u2019s Juvenile Waiver Guidelines </em>(March 14, 2000)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">The Guidelines are based \u201cprimarily on objective factors, such as the nature of the offense, rather than subjective factors, such as the juvenile\u2019s individual characteristics.\u201d <em>Guidelines, supra, </em>at 4. The Prosecutor should not consider factors other than those set forth in the Guidelines. <em>Read, supra, </em>397 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 606, 938 A.2d 953. Comparing the juvenile waiver guidelines to those applicable in other contexts, we observed in <em>R.C., </em>that the Guidelines for juvenile waiver decisions are designed to \u201c \u2018promote uniformity and provide a means for prosecutors to avoid arbitrary or abusive exercise of discretionary power.\u2019\u201d <em>R.C., supra, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 256-57, 798 A.2d 111 (quoting <em>State v. Lagares, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>20, 32, 601 A.2d 698 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\"> Although a Prosecutor\u2019s reasons for waiving a juvenile are subject to judicial review, a trial judge must afford a Prosecutor\u2019s waiver decision considerable deference. <em>Id. </em>at 260, 798 A.2d 111. Indeed, the Prosecutor\u2019s waiver decision must be evaluated in the same deferential manner as the review of a Prosecutor\u2019s refusal to consent to a defendant\u2019s admission into a Pretrial Intervention (PTI) program. <em>Id. </em>at 259, 798 A.2d 111. The Prosecutor\u2019s decision to waive a juvenile must be upheld unless it constitutes a patent and gross abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 260, 798 A.2d 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>\u201cA patent and gross abuse of discretion is more than just an abuse of discretion as traditionally conceived\u201d; rather, the decision must be \u201cso wide of the mark ... that fundamental fairness and justice require judicial intervention.\u201d <em>State v. Wallace, </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>576, 582-83, 684 A.2d 1355 (1996) (discussing the standard for judicial review in the PTI context) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Therefore, the Family Part should grant the waiver motion unless the juvenile is able to \u201cshow by clear and convincing evidence that the decision constituted a patent and gross abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>R.C., supra, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 251, 798 A.2d 111.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Here, the judge found that the State established probable cause on three charges: second-degree robbery, second-degree aggravated assault, and second-degree conspiracy. Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26(a), V.A, C.T. and M.R., who were age sixteen, should have been waived to the Law Division because probable cause existed for second-degree aggravated assault, one of the offenses for which waiver is automatic when the juvenile is sixteen years of age at the time of the offense, unless the juvenile proves by clear and convincing evidence that the Prosecutor\u2019s decision was a patent and gross abuse of discretion. <em>R.C., supra, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 251, 798 A.2d 111. T.H. was entitled to a rehabilitation hearing because he was younger than sixteen at the time of the offense. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:4A-26(e). Thus, the issue on appeal is whether the judge erred when he determined that the Prosecutor\u2019s decision constituted a patent and gross abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The State argues that the judge allowed his personal opinion about the waiver statute to override his obligation to conduct a reasoned analysis of its waiver motion. The State also argues that the written statement of reasons it provided for each juvenile appropriately addressed each of the seven factors required by the Guidelines. The juveniles disagree, arguing that the judge\u2019s decision was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Turning to the judge\u2019s findings, we conclude that he did not explain how V.A., T.H., C.T. and M.R. demonstrated by clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>and convincing evidence that the Prosecutor\u2019s waiver decision constituted a patent and gross abuse of discretion. Instead, the judge impermissibly used the Guidelines as a springboard from which to opine that the Prosecutor\u2019s application for waiver was \u201cvoid of any substantive reasons.\u201d First, the judge criticized the Prosecutor\u2019s statement of reasons because the Prosecutor did not consider factors the judge deemed important, even though those factors are not contained in the Guidelines. The judge commented that the reasons submitted by the Prosecutor did not consider the \u201cserious consequences\u201d (loss of the right to vote, for example), that each juvenile would face if waived to adult court and thereafter convicted. The judge also stated that if he were not permitted to consider these consequences, a serious separation of powers problem would result.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The judge\u2019s reasoning was flawed. A Prosecutor is prohibited from applying factors that are not set forth in the Guidelines. <em>Read, supra, </em>397 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 606, 938 A.2d 953. Indeed, as we observed in <em>Read, </em>\u201c[i]t would be inconsistent with th[e] legislative objective of uniform statewide application for an individual prosecutor to apply factors that are not set forth in the Attorney General\u2019s Guidelines in determining whether to waive a juvenile complaint to adult court.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, the judge\u2019s critique of the Prosecutor\u2019s failure to consider these potential collateral consequences of waiver was itself based on a misapprehension of the governing legal principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The same is true of the judge\u2019s conclusion that the State\u2019s failure to conduct a risk assessment of each juvenile was a fatal flaw in the State\u2019s waiver request. The Guidelines impose no such requirement. Thus, because the State is not entitled to consider factors not contained in the Guidelines, <em>ibid., </em>the judge erred when he concluded that the State\u2019s failure to conduct a risk assessment was further evidence of the State\u2019s patent and gross abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Third, the judge incorrectly expected the Prosecutor to differentiate between general deterrence and specific deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>rence. A Prosecutor\u2019s reasons for waiving a juvenile to the Law Division should be based upon objective factors, not subjective factors. <em>See Guidelines, supra, </em>at 4 (instructing that the Prosecutor\u2019s decision \u201crests primarily on objective factors, such as the nature of the offense, rather than subjective factors, such as the juvenile\u2019s individual characteristics\u201d). The judge\u2019s insistence that the Prosecutor \u201carticulate\u201d specific deterrence as it relates to each juvenile would require the Prosecutor to improperly consider \u201cindividual characteristics\u201d of the juvenile, which is contrary to the express provisions of the Guidelines. Thus, the judge\u2019s conclusion that the Prosecutor\u2019s failure to differentiate between general deterrence and specific deterrence rendered the State\u2019s waiver decision an abuse of discretion, again constitutes a mistaken application of the governing legal principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Fourth, the judge incorrectly considered the very process by which the State had reached the decision to seek waiver. After noting that there had recently been a \u201cdramatic improvement ]\u201d in the ability of experts to assess the risk that a juvenile will re-offend, the judge chastised the State for failing to avail itself of such scientific research and techniques, calling the Prosecutor or assistant prosecutors who had made the waiver decision \u201clegal cavemen.\u201d The judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">Now, there\u2019s been dramatic improvements in assessments ... and we\u2019re still analyzing cases by a couple of prosecutors sitting in a room and making some kind of decision and I\u2019m supposed to accept that? I don\u2019t accept it____I\u2019m trying to think [of] what I might call that. It is like being a legal caveman[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">The judge\u2019s rejection of the Prosecutor\u2019s waiver decision because that decision was not science-based, but was instead the product of lawyers analyzing the facts and the law, is yet another deviation from the standard of review the judge should have applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">Fifth, the judge improperly injected his personal beliefs about the waiver statute into his decision. At the status conference for each juvenile, long before the probable cause hearing was held, the judge expressed his vehement opposition to the waiver of juveniles. At V.A.\u2019s status conference, for example, the judge expressed the opinion that juveniles who have been involved with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>the Division of Youth and Family Services should not be waived to adult court. He also remarked, \u201cWe don\u2019t get a very good return on our dollar because these children commit even more serious crimes when they are waived and they commit more of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">At C.T.\u2019s status conference, the judge stated he wanted to \u201cmake the record clear\u201d that the prosecutor \u201cshouldn\u2019t be waiving these kids into [adult] court.\u201d The judge acknowledged that he has \u201cno control over that by the way the statute is written,\u201d but he nonetheless believed that waiver \u201cis just wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Additionally, at M.R.\u2019s status conference, the judge stated that he was \u201ctrying to make a record, a historical record\u201d because \u201cwe have to stop waiving [these] children as first offenders.\u201d He explained that \u201cdata indicates that all you get out of [waiving juveniles] is more crime and more serious crime[,]\u201d and \u201cat some point this nonsense has got to stop.\u201d He asserted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">[W]e all have our jobs, I understand the prosecutor\u2019s job. You know, I understand their position, ... but I\u2019m not going to sit by quietly____[Tlhis is wrong. It\u2019s just wrong to waive a child like that. The prosecutor should know it. Hope you tell him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">The State also points to statements made by the judge in his March 24, 2010 written opinion in the four appeals that were the subject of our January 5, 2011 supplementation order. There, the judge expressed his opinion that the juvenile waiver statute is bad public policy, does not rehabilitate juveniles, vests too much discretion with the State, violates the separation of powers, and prevents the family court from fulfilling its function of protecting juveniles. The State maintains that these statements, both individually and cumulatively, demonstrate that the judge\u2019s \u201cimpartiality was compromised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">We recently addressed an instance where a judge\u2019s personal opinion and sentiments about an issue interfered with the judge\u2019s impartial discharge of his judicial responsibilities, <em>State v. Tindell, </em>417 <em>N.J.Super. </em>530, 571-72, 10 A.3d 1203 (App.Div.2011). We observed that \u201cjudges are not immune from having strong feelings about such mattersf,]\u201d but judges \u201care charged with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>great responsibility of administering our criminal justice system in a fair, rational, and impartial manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 571, 10 A.3d 1203. When a judge \u201cpermit[s] his or her sense of moral outrage and indignation to overwhelm the legal process,\u201d we are obliged to reverse the decision in question. <em>Ibid. </em>Trial judges must \u201cbe guided exclusively by the factors established by law and not by the judge\u2019s personal code of conduct.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">The record before us in the present consolidated appeals demonstrates the judge\u2019s pervasive hostility to the philosophy and procedures of the juvenile waiver statute. The judge has also ignored the legal principles governing juvenile waiver motions and insisted upon including his own factors for consideration. While a judge is entitled to his personal opinion on an issue, he is not entitled to permit his personal views to \u201coverwhelm the legal process.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The judge\u2019s comments here demonstrate that his decision was the product of his \u201cpersonal code of conduct\u201d and not \u201cthe factors established by law[.]\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">As we have already noted, we review a trial judge\u2019s waiver decision for an abuse of discretion, <em>A.D., supra, </em>420 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 155-56, 19 A.3d 482, but we will not afford the decision such deference if it results from a misconception, or misapplication, of the governing legal principles. <em>T.M., supra, </em>412 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 231, 989 A.2d 302. Here, apart from the errors we have already discussed, the judge mistakenly determined that he was entitled to reject the Prosecutor\u2019s waiver motion unless it was supported by a justification for waiver over and above the factors the State had already articulated in the statement of reasons. Quite simply, the judge misapplied the law when he so found. <em>J.M., supra, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>at 411-12, 866 A.2d 178. For all of these reasons, we reject the judge\u2019s conclusion that the State\u2019s decision to waive these four juveniles was the result of a patent and gross abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Absent an abuse of prosecutorial discretion, which was not present here, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26(a) required the immediate waiver of the juvenile complaints against V.A., C.T. and M.R. to the Law Division as each was sixteen years of age or older and there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>probable cause to conclude that each had committed a qualifying offense, namely second-degree aggravated assault. <em>Ibid. </em>The fourth juvenile, T.H., who was less than sixteen at the relevant time, is entitled to the opportunity to prove that \u201cthe probability of his rehabilitation ... substantially outweighs the reasons for waiver\u201d and if he does so, he will be entitled to remain in the Family Part. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:4A-26(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">As to V.A., M.R. and C.T., we reverse the orders of October 13, 2010 and remand for the entry of orders requiring the waiver of these three juveniles to the Law Division for prosecution as adults. T.H., who was less than sixteen years of age at the relevant time, is entitled to a rehabilitation hearing. In light of the strong views expressed by the trial judge with respect to waiver applications, we direct this hearing under <em>Rule </em>5:22-2(c)(2) be conducted by a different judge. <em>Tindell, supra, </em>417 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 572, 10 A.3d 1203.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b356-9\">The advertisement read: \"Why do most 16-year-olds drive like they're <em>missing a part of their brain? </em>BECAUSE THEY ARE.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b357-9\"> The judge actually referred to the \"statute,\u201d but because it is the Guidelines, rather than the statute, that addresses deterrence, we believe he misspoke, and meant to say \"Guidelines.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b357-10\"> C.T. had an open charge for simple assault.
