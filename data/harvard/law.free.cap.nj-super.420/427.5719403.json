We conclude that in the absence of any allegation that the successor attorney used wrongful means, such as fraud or defamation, to induce the client to discharge the original attorney, such an action is not maintainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Plaintiff Frank Nostrame, a New Jersey attorney, was retained by defendant Natividad Santiago on January 18, 2007, to represent her in connection with a proposed medical malpractice action, apparently under a contingent fee agreement. Plaintiff performed certain preliminary work, and on May 23, 2007, he filed a complaint on her behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">On May 31, 2007, Santiago entered into a contingent fee retainer agreement with defendant Mazie, Slater, Katz and Freeman, LLC (Mazie Slater), a New Jersey law firm, to represent her in the medical malpractice action. On that day, Santiago sent a letter to plaintiff discharging him as her attorney and directing him to turn over his file to Mazie Slater.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">After retaining experts to support Santiago\u2019s malpractice claim and engaging in substantial discovery, Mazie Slater settled the claim on her behalf for a total of $1,200,000. Under Mazie Slater\u2019s contingent fee agreement with Santiago, this settlement resulted in an attorney\u2019s fee of $358,396.31.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">Plaintiff asserted a hen of $11,623.75 on that fee for the legal work he performed in connection with Santiago\u2019s malpractice action. The trial court eventually determined that plaintiff was entitled to the full amount of his hen. Mazie Slater has now paid plaintiff that amount, which is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">In addition to asserting a hen against the Mazie Slater contingent fee for the services he performed before his discharge, plaintiff brought this tortious interference with contract action against Mazie Slater. Plaintiffs complaint alleged in pertinent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>part that \u201cNatividad Santiago was induced to discharge plaintiff and dissolve the contingent fee contract between them by [Mazie Slater].\u201d The complaint named not only Mazie Slater but also Santiago, her daughter Betsy Santiago, and fictitious John Does as defendants. The complaint did not include any specific allegation with respect to Betsy Santiago. However, the complaint alleged that unnamed \u201cJohn Does without legal justification interfered with the contractual relation between Natividad Santiago and plaintiff [by] contacting] the office of [Mazie Slater] for the purpose of creating a contractual relation between [Mazie Slater] and Natividad Santiago and to terminate the contractual relation between Natividad Santiago and plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Shortly after the filing of this complaint, Mazie Slater filed a motion to dismiss on its own behalf and on behalf of Natividad and Betsy Santiago. Plaintiff submitted a certification in opposition to the motion, which stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">The Complaint alleges facts that, if proven, would establish that Natividad Santiago was induced by defendant and third persons to discharge me and retain Mazie Slater as counsel....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">While I am aware of the <em>RPC </em>and related cases holding the right of a client to discharge an attorney and engage another of their choosing, this Complaint alleges that a third person intervened and interfered with that agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The trial court denied defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. We granted defendants\u2019 motion for leave to appeal from this denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">Some confusion was engendered by the fact that Mazie Slater\u2019s motion also sought leave to appeal an order in the medical malpractice action that denied its motion to limit the amount of plaintiffs lien to $11,623.75. Our order granting leave to appeal both orders also summarily reversed the order relating to plaintiffs lien. However, we did not rule summarily upon Mazie Slater\u2019s appeal from the denial of its motion to dismiss. Mazie Slater apparently failed to understand that this interlocutory appeal was still pending and, as a result, filed a second motion to dismiss in the trial court, which was also denied. Mazie Slater filed a notice of appeal from this order, which was docketed by the clerk of this court and under which this appeal has proceeded. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>The second motion to dismiss was unnecessary, and in view of the pendency of this interlocutory appeal, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to rule upon it. Consequently, even though it does not affect our consideration of the merits, we view this appeal as solely from the order denying Mazie Slater\u2019s first motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Before considering the maintainability of a claim for tortious interference with contract by a discharged attorney against a successor attorney, we first consider the nature of a contract between an attorney and client. In <em>Jacob v. Norris, McLaughlin &amp; Marcus, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>10, 607 A.2d 142 (1992), the Court concluded that a provision in a law firm partnership agreement that barred withdrawing partners from collecting termination compensation if they continued to represent firm clients was invalid. In reaching this conclusion, the Court stated that \u201c[a] client is always entitled to be represented by counsel of his own choosing,\u201d and that an attorney \u201cmay do nothing which restricts the right of the client to repose confidence in any counsel of his choice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20, 607 A.2d 142 (quoting <em>Dwyer v. Jung, </em>133 <em>N.J.Super. </em>343, 346-47, 336 A.2d 498 (Ch.Div.), <em>aff'd, </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>135, 348 A.2d 208 (App.Div.1975)). Thus, although a client is liable for the payment of services rendered during the course of an attorney-client relationship, the client is free to discharge the attorney at any time without being subject to suit for breach of contract. <em>See Glick v. Barclays De Zoete Wedd, Inc., </em>300 <em>N.J.Super. </em>299, 309, 692 A.2d 1004 (App.Div.1997); <em>Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers </em>\u00a7 32(1) (2000). A client\u2019s freedom to terminate the attorney-client relationship unilaterally means that a contract between an attorney and client is a contract that is \u201cterminable at will.\u201d <em>Glick, supra, </em>300 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 309, 692 A.2d 1004; <em>see </em>Alex B. Long, <em>The Business of Law &amp; Tortious Interference, </em>36 <em>St. Mary\u2019s L.J. </em>925, 939-44 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>With this understanding of the nature of a contract between an attorney and client, we turn to the question whether a discharged attorney may maintain an action against a successor attorney for tortious interference with contract. In considering claims for tortious interference with existing or prospective contractual relations, our courts generally follow the principles set forth in the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>(1979). <em>See MacDougall v. Weichert, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>380, 403-05, 677 A.2d 162 (1996); <em>Printing Mart-Morristown v. Sharp Elecs. Corp., </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>739, 752-55, 563 A.2d 31 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The elements of a cause of action for tortious interference with contract are set forth in section 766 of the <em>Restatement, </em>which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-7\">One who intentionally and improperly interferes with the performance of a contract (except a contract to marry) between another and a third person by inducing or otherwise causing the third person not to perform the contract, is subject to liability to the other for the pecuniary loss resulting to the other from the failure of the third person to perform the contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">A claim for tortious interference with a contract that is terminable at will, such as a contract between attorney and client, falls within section 766. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 766 cmt. g. However, the comments to the <em>Restatement </em>recognize that a determination of the viability of such a claim may require a different analysis than other tortious interference with contract claims, particularly if the defendant is a competitor of the claimant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-9\">One\u2019s interest in a contract terminable at will is primarily an interest in future relations between the parties, and he has no legal assurance of them. For this reason, an interference with this interest is closely analogous to interference with prospective contractual relations.... If the defendant was a competitor regarding the business involved in the contract, his interference with the contract may bo not improper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-10\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">Section 767 of the <em>Restatement </em>sets forth a series of general factors that a court should consider in determining whether an alleged interference with a contract was improper, which our Supreme Court applied in <em>MacDougall, supra, </em>144 <em>N.J. </em>at 404-05, 677 A.2d 162. However, those general factors do not need to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>addressed if a ease falls within one of the \u201cspecial situations\u201d addressed in sections 768 through 773 of the <em>Restatement. Id. </em>\u00a7 767 cmt. a.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">One of those special situations\u2014an alleged tortious interference with contract by a competitor seeking to pursue its own economic interests by encouraging a prospective customer to discontinue a terminable at will contract with another party\u2014is addressed by section 768(1) of the <em>Restatement, </em>which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">One who intentionally causes a third person not to enter into a prospective contractual relation with another who is his competitor or not to continue an existing contract terminable at will does not interfere improperly with the other\u2019s relation if</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">(a) the relation concerns a matter involved in the competition between the actor and the other and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">(b) the actor does not employ wrongful means and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">(c) his action does not create or continue an unlawful restraint of trade and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-10\">(d) his purpose is at least in part to advance his interest in competing with the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">In explaining the application of this section to a competitor\u2019s efforts to persuade a party to terminate a terminable at will contract, the comments to the <em>Restatement </em>state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-12\">If the third person is free to terminate his contractual relation with the plaintiff when he chooses, there is still a subsisting contract relation; but any interference with it that induces its termination is primarily an interference with the future relation between the parties, and the plaintiff has no legal assurance of them. As for the future hopes he has no legal right but only an expectancy; and when the contract is terminated by the choice of the third person there is no breach of it. The competitor is therefore free, for his own competitive advantage, to obtain the future benefits for himself by causing the termination. Thus, ... he may make use of persuasion or other suitable means, all without liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-13\"><em>[Id. </em>\u00a7 768 cmt. i]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-14\">Under the plain terms of section 768(1) of the <em>Restatement, </em>Mazie Slater\u2019s alleged inducement of Santiago to discharge plaintiff as her attorney in the medical malpractice action did not constitute a tortious interference with contract. The contract between plaintiff and Santiago \u201cconcernfed] a matter involved in the competition between [Mazie Slater] and [plaintiff],\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 768(l)(a), because both Mazie Slater and plaintiff are attorneys who represent clients in medical malpractice actions. Plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>complaint does not allege that Mazie Slater employed any \u201cwrongful means,\u201d such as fraud or defamation, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 768 cmt. e, to induce Santiago to discharge him, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 768(l)(b), or that Santiago\u2019s discharge of him and retention of Mazie Slater would \u201ccreate or continue an unlawful restraint of trade,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 768(l)(c). Moreover, it is undisputed that Mazie Slater\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d in allegedly inducing Santiago to discharge plaintiff was \u201cat least in part to advance [its] interest in competing with [plaintiff.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 768(l)(d). Therefore, we conclude that under section 768 of the <em>Restatement, </em>plaintiffs complaint does not state a cause of action against Mazie Slater for tortious interference with contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the contractual relationship at issue in this case is a contract between an attorney and client. Whatever interest plaintiff may have had in maintaining his contract with Santiago was outweighed by her interest in exercising her right to select counsel of her own choosing, including her right to discharge plaintiff, and to retain new counsel who she believed could better represent her in the medical malpractice action. <em>See Jacob, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 18-24, 607 A.2d 142. Our Supreme Court has described a \u201cclient\u2019s freedom of choice\u201d as a \u201cparamount interest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22, 607 A.2d 142. Hence, the courts should not recognize a cause of action for tortious interference with a contract between an attorney and client that could impede that freedom of choice unless the alleged interference involves wrongful means, such as fraud or defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The decisions in other jurisdictions are generally supportive of this conclusion. <em>See, e.g., Storm &amp; Assocs., Ltd. v. Cuculich, </em>298 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>1040, 233 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>101, 700 <em>N.E.2d </em>202, 210 (1998); <em>Cavicchi v. Koski </em>67 <em>Mass.App.Ct. </em>654, 855 <em>N.E.2d </em>1137, 1141-44 (2006); <em>Fred Siegel Co. v. Arter &amp; Hadden, </em>85 <em>Ohio </em>St.3d 171, 707 <em>N.E.2d </em>853, 860-61 (1999); <em>see generally </em>Phoebe Carter, <em>Liability in Tort for Interference with Attorney-Client Relationship, </em>90 <em>A.L.R.4th </em>621, 705-10 (1991). <em>But see Anderson v. Anchor Org. for Health Maint., </em>274 <em>Ill.App.3d </em>1001, 211 <em>Ill.Dec. </em>213, 654 <em>N.E.2d </em>675, 685-86 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Plaintiff suggests that even though his complaint does not allege that Mazie Slater used any \u201cwrongful means\u201d to induce Santiago to discharge him and retain Mazie Slater, he should be allowed to conduct discovery to determine whether such wrongful means may have been used. Our courts ordinarily take a liberal view in determining whether a complaint states a cause of action. <em>See Printing Mart, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 746, 563 A.2d 31. However, New Jersey is a \u201cfact\u201d rather than a \u201cnotice\u201d pleading jurisdiction, which means that a plaintiff must allege facts to support his or her claim rather than merely reciting the elements of a cause of action. <em>Id. </em>at 768, 563 A.2d 31; <em>Glass v. Suburban Restoration Co., </em>317 <em>N.J.Super. </em>574, 582, 722 A.2d 944 (App.Div.1998); <em>Kotok Bldg. v. Charvine Co., </em>183 <em>N.J.Super </em>101, 104-05, 443 A.2d 260 (Law Div.1981). A plaintiff cannot simply assert that \u201cany essential facts that the court may find lacking can be dredged up in discovery.\u201d <em>Printing Mart, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 768, 563 A.2d 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Plaintiff does not allege in either his complaint or his certifications in opposition to Mazie Slater\u2019s motion to dismiss that Mazie Slater employed any wrongful means in whatever communications it may have had with Santiago before she discharged plaintiff and retained Mazie Slater. Indeed, plaintiffs certifications, which converted Mazie Slater\u2019s motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment, <em>R. </em>4:6-2(e), simply reiterated his complaint\u2019s allegations that Mazie Slater \u201cinduced\u201d Santiago to discharge him. For all the reasons previously set forth, such an allegation does not state a cause of action for tortious interference with contract by a discharged attorney against a successor attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">We also note that permitting discovery to proceed based on the kind of conclusionary allegations contained in plaintiffs complaint could have a chilling effect upon a client\u2019s exercise of the right to select counsel of his or her choosing. Plaintiffs complaint joined not only Mazie Slater but also Santiago and her daughter Betsy as defendants. Plaintiff now recognizes that he has no basis for a claim against Natividad Santiago because a party cannot tortiously interfere with his or her own contract. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number><em>See Printing Mart, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 752-53, 563 A.2d 31. Nevertheless, plaintiff contends that he needed to join Santiago as a defendant to obtain discovery from her. This contention is obviously incorrect; discovery may be obtained from a person without joining that person as a party. However, the threat of joinder as a defendant or being required to submit to a deposition in this Mnd of action could deter a client in the position of Santiago from exercising her right to change counsel. Furthermore, the prospect of being sued for tortious interference with contract could cause a potential successor attorney such as Mazie Slater to decline representation of a client previously represented by another attorney, especially in a smaller case, thus interfering with a client\u2019s right to seek counsel of his or her choosing. Therefore, the facts alleged in plaintiffs complaint do not provide an adequate legal foundation for him to be allowed to proceed with discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Finally, we consider plaintiffs tortious interference claim against Betsy Santiago. This claim requires only brief discussion. Section 770 of the <em>Restatement </em>states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-8\">One who, charged with responsibility for the welfare of a third person, intentionally causes that person not to perform a contract or enter into a prospective contractual relation with another, does not interfere improperly with the other\u2019s relation if the actor</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-9\">(a) does not employ wrongful means and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-10\">(b) acts to protect the welfare of the third person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">This rule \u201cdeals with cases in which, by ordinary standards of decent conduct, one is charged with some responsibility for the protection of the welfare of another.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 770 cmt. b. We have no hesitancy concluding that \u201cby ordinary standards of decent conduct\u201d a daughter may encourage her mother to terminate a contract that is terminable at will without being subjected to possible liability for tortious interference with contract, at least in the absence of any allegation that she used wrongful means.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Accordingly, the order denying defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
