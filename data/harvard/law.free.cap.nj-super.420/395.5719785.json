We must determine whether <em>N.J.S.A </em>58:10B-17.1 (the extension statute) applies to a claim for relief based on common law strict liability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">The Law Division judge concluded that the statute of limitations barred the claim and that the extension statute did not apply. He dismissed the fourth count of plaintiffs complaint asserting that cause of action. We granted leave to appeal and now conclude that the extension statute preserves this common law cause of action. Accordingly, we reverse, reinstate the fourth count of the complaint and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">We first set forth the procedural history. In August 2004, DEP filed two complaints against defendant, asserting Spill Act claims and common law claims of public nuisance and trespass, and seeking natural resource damages for the discharge of hazardous substances at two sites in Linden and Bayonne. <em>Exxon Mobil I, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number><em>supra, </em>393 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 397, 923 A.2d 345. After we decided the loss of use claim issue in DEP\u2019s favor, DEP moved to amend the complaints, over defendant\u2019s objections, to include strict liability counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Thereafter, the trial court heard argument on defendant\u2019s motions for partial summary judgment asserting, among other things, that the statute of limitations had expired on DEP\u2019s common law claims for nuisance and trespass, and that the extension statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>58:10B-17.1, did not apply. The judge granted that motion, and DEP did not seek interlocutory relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Defendant then moved for partial summary judgment seeking to dismiss count four of DEP\u2019s complaint, alleging a common law strict liability claim, under that same statute of limitations rationale. The judge granted defendant\u2019s motion and dismissed that count. We granted leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">These relevant facts are best summarized in our decision in <em>Exxon Mobil I, supra, </em>393 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 397, 923 A.2d 345, and in the trial court\u2019s January 22, 2009 letter opinion. Included in that latter summary, the judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">During the course of operations at the Bayonne and Bayway refineries, crude oil and refined products were lost through spills and leaks. Neither party disputes that these products, which include, <em>inter alia, </em>monocyclic aromatics, PAHs, amines, pesticides, and various inorganics such as chromium and arsenic, are considered hazardous substances. The contamination at both of these sites is well-documented. It was estimated in 1977 that at least some seven million gallons of oil, ranging in thickness from 7 to 17 feet, are contained in the soil and groundwater underlying a portion of the former Bayonne site alone. As of 2006, 17 non-aqueous phase liquid plumes were present in the groundwater at Bayonne. The documented level of contamination in the waters and sediment of the Platty Kill Canal in Bayonne is so high that ExxonMobil has recommended permanently closing and filling in the canal with an impermeable barrier (estimating 50,000 cubic yards of impacted sediments). Additionally, Morses Creek has been subject to years of discharges resulting in a hydrocarbon content ranging from 640 to 280,000 ppm which has subjected the area to a gelatinous, oily emulsion overlying gray silt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Focusing on the statute of limitations, prior to 1991, statutes of limitation did not run against the State, pursuant to the common law doctrine of <em>nullum tempus occurrit regi. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot. v. Caldeira, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>404, 407, 794 A.2d 156 (2002). When <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>the Court abolished that doctrine in 1991, \u201cinsofar as it would preclude the application of general statutes of limitations to the State,\u201d the Legislature responded by adopting the ten-year statute of limitations. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1.2. <em>Caldeira, supra, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>at 408-09, 794 A.2d 156 (quoting <em>N.J.

The further expansion to \u201cfive years and six months\u201d was adopted in December 2005 by <em>L. </em>2005, c. 245, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-15\">The extension statute further defines the term \u201cState\u2019s environmental laws,\u201d providing that it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>means the \u201cSpill Compensation and Control Act,\u201d P.L.1976, c. 141 (C.58:10-23.11 et seq.), the \u201cWater Pollution Control Act,\u201d P.L.1977, c. 74 (C.58:10A-1 et seq.), P.L.1986, c. 102 (C.58:10A-21 et seq.), the \u201cBrownfield and Contaminated Site Remediation Act,\u201d P.L.1997, e. 278 (C.58:10B-1.1 et al.), the \u201cIndustrial Site Recovery Act,\u201d P.L.1983, c. 330 (C.13:lK-6 et al.), the \u201cSolid Waste Management Act,\u201d P.L.1970, c. 39 (C.13:1E-1 et seq.), the \u201cComprehensive Regulated Medical Waste Management Act,\u201d P.L.1989, c. 34 (C.13:1E-48.1 et seq.), the \u201cMajor Hazardous Waste Facilities Siting Act,\u201d P.L.1981, c. 279 (C.13:lE-49 et seq.), the \u201cSanitary Landfill Facility Closure and Contingency Fund Act,\u201d P.L.1981, c. 306 (C.13:1E-100 et seq.), the \u201cRegional Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Facility Siting Act,\u201d P.L.1987, c. 333 (C.13:1E-177 et seq.), <em>or any other law or regulation by which the State may compel a person to perform remediation activities on contaminated property </em>[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>58:10B-17.1(e) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">In its January 22,2009 letter opinion, the trial court agreed with defendant that the statute of limitations had expired on DEP\u2019s common law claims for nuisance and trespass, and that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10B-17.1 did not apply. Defendant had argued that DEP was required to file the claims within ten years of January 1, 1992, because the extension statute was inapplicable. Referencing the extension statute\u2019s definition of \u201cState\u2019s environmental laws,\u201d the trial court wrote that the nuisance and trespass claims at issue in that motion were not among the enumerated statutes, and they \u201calso are clearly not statutory law but are common law claims. They also, at their foundation are not environmental laws per se but laws of general application to a wide variety of situations.\u201d After setting forth the parties\u2019 contentions, the letter opinion continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-7\">The court is confident that the legislature\u2019s intent in referring to a \u201claw or regulation!,\u201d] in light of the previously mentioned nine statutes, did not intend to incorporate general common law into the limitations exceptions of 58:10B-17.1c. This reading is consistent with the principle of <em>ejusdem generis </em>raised by Exxon ... [citing to and block quoting from <em>State v. Hoffman, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>564, 584, 695 A.2d 236 (1997) ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">Reading the statute on its face, the court is not convinced that such a broad reading should take place in order to apply general common law claims into a statute which clearly was intended to apply to only certain types of laws. This court is simply left with no authority for the presumption that such a wide ranging expansion of the statute of limitations for environmental statutes should be extended to common law claims. Therefore the motion for summary judgment as [to] common law claims in regards to statute of limitations is GRANTED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>DEP did not seek leave to appeal this January 2009 ruling regarding the common law claims for nuisance and trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">At the July 23, 2009 hearing on the motion regarding the strict liability claim, the court referenced the history of the litigation and its denial of relief as to the nuisance and trespass claims. The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">Exxon now moves to extend this ruling to the recently filed common-law elaim of strict liability. DEP in their opposition, if they didn\u2019t attempt to convey to the court that the court perhaps had used faulty reasoning originally and if they didn\u2019t really want me to reconsider, they certainly suggested that perhaps a review of the matter again might lead this court to a contrary analysis.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-8\">I\u2019m not convinced as to why the strict liability claim should be treated any differently [than] we treated the nuisance and trespass claim. They argue that the environmental laws often involve aspects of strict liability and therefore the common-law claim could fit into the statute as state environmental laws. Again, the court is not persuaded, the Motion is granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">On appeal, DEP argues that the judge erred in dismissing the strict liability claim. It asserts that the common law is part of the \u201cState\u2019s Environmental Law\u201d so that the extension statute applies; the judge\u2019s conclusion is contrary to easelaw; and the conclusion reached by the motion judge will lead to absurd results. We address each issue seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">DEP first argues that the State\u2019s authority to seek redress for environmental harms includes both common law and statutory law. To summarize its argument, DEP claims that the authority originated in the common law establishing the \u201cpublic trust doctrine,\u201d under which the State as trustee invokes common law rights against polluters. The argument continues that at common law, strict liability was developed to fill a gap where trespass and nuisance claims inadequately protected landowners; later, a 1979 Spill Act amendment provided statutory strict liability against dischargers of hazardous substances. Additionally, courts have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>held that Spill Act liability does not eliminate common law liability, and nothing in the extension statute demonstrates a legislative intent to so limit DEP\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">DEP further asserts that the extension statute is \u201cclear and unambiguous.\u201d The statute\u2019s purpose is to extend the statute of limitations for actions that seek redress for natural resource damages, and the relevant statutory phrasing has been interpreted in other contexts to include common law and statutory law. The Legislature\u2019s intent was to expand, and not constrict, the State\u2019s ability to recover damages from dischargers. DEP contends that the Legislature has shown a \u201cstrong and unyielding commitment to holding dischargers of hazardous substances accountable,\u201d further shown by its acts in extending the statute of limitations. The extension statute, as part of the remedial Spill Act, should be construed broadly to ensure that the Legislature\u2019s goal is met. According to DEP, the trial court\u2019s reliance on the doctrine of <em>ejusdem generis </em>was contrary to the Legislature\u2019s intent to preserve DEP\u2019s broad authority to pursue natural resource damage claims. Moreover, the trial court\u2019s approach renders as mere surplusage the phrase \u201cany other law or regulation,\u201d which the Legislature could have refined to refer only to statutes or to expressly exclude common law had that been the Legislature\u2019s intent. The common law remains important in DEP\u2019s litigation efforts, especially for filling in any gaps in relief that the statutes may fail to cover, so justice demands that polluters not be allowed to erode DEP\u2019s broad enforcement authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Defendant responds that DEP is arguing against a \u201cstraw man,\u201d because the trial court did not exclude or eliminate common law liability; it merely held that DEP waited too long to assert those claims. In any event, the Spill Act provides DEP with complete relief for any existing complaints as to which the common law claims would be barred. According to defendant, the Legislature and courts routinely use the phrase \u201cenvironmental laws\u201d to refer to the state\u2019s various statutory schemes that touch upon environmental issues. The limits of the term \u201cthe State\u2019s environmental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>laws\u201d is key, and courts have held that similar phrases following lists of statutes refer only to positive enactments and not to common law. Defendant also notes that the definition of the term \u201cthe State\u2019s environmental laws\u201d was not original to the extension statute, but rather was borrowed from the Brownfield and Contaminated Site Remediation Act (the Brownfield Act), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10B-12(e); in both instances, the legislative focus was on statutes, and not common law. Finally, the trial court correctly applied the interpretive principle of <em>ejusdem generis, </em>concluding that the use of \u201cany other law\u201d after a list of statutes meant that the Legislature was referring only to \u201cother\u201d statutes. Had it meant \u201cor common law,\u201d the Legislature would have used that phrase, as it did in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>17:16T-4(a), for example.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">\u201cIn interpreting a statute, our overriding goal is to give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Bd. of Trs., Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys., </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>189, 195, 927 A.2d 543 (2007). \u201c \u2018[T]he best indicator of that intent is the statutory language,\u2019 thus it is the first place we look____If the plain language leads to a clear and unambiguous result, then our interpretive process is over.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>DiProspero v. Penn, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>477, 492, 874 A.2d 1039 (2005)). As the Court has described its interpretive role:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">We ascribe to the statutory words their ordinary meaning and significance, and read them in context with related provisions so as to give sense to the legislation as a whole. It is not the function of this Court to rewrite a plainly-written enactment of the Legislature or presume that the Legislature intended something other than that expressed by way of the plain language. We cannot write in an additional qualification which the Legislature pointedly omitted in drafting its own enactment, or engage in conjecture or surmise which will circumvent the plain meaning of the act. Our duty is to construe and apply the statute as enacted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-11\"><em>[Soto v. Scaringelli, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>558, 569-70, 917 A.2d 734 (2007) (quoting <em>DiProspero, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 492, 874 A.2d 1039).J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">Only if there is ambiguity in the statutory language will a court turn to extrinsic evidence; when such evidence is needed, central among the variety of sources available is a statute\u2019s legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>history, <em>Richardson, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 195-96, 927 A.2d 543. A reviewing court \u201cmay also resort to extrinsic evidence if a plain reading of the statute leads to an absurd result or if the overall statutory scheme is at odds with the plain language.\u201d <em>DiProspero, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 493, 874 A.2d 1039.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">If an agency is charged with enforcing a statute, courts generally afford substantial deference to that agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute. <em>Richardson, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 196, 927 A.2d 543 (citing <em>R &amp; R Mktg. v. Brown-Forman Corp., </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>170, 175, 729 A.2d 1 (1999)). On appellate review, however, we are \u201c \u2018in no way bound by the agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute or its determination of a strictly legal issue.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Taylor, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>644, 658, 731 A.2d 35 (1999) (quoting <em>Mayflower Sec. Co. v. Bureau of Sec., </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>85, 93, 312 A.2d 497 (1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Our analysis recognizes that, as both parties assert, eases exist to support either side\u2019s position regarding principles of statutory interpretation. For example, DEP argues that \u201cany other law\u201d includes both common law and statutory law, consistent with the interpretation of our state constitution\u2019s phrase \u201c[a]ll law\u201d in <em>State v. Culver, </em>23 <em>N.J. </em>495, 503, 129 A.2d 715, <em>cert. denied, </em>354 <em>U.S. </em>925, 77 <em>S.Ct. </em>1387, 1 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1441 (1957). But as defendant correctly points out, that constitutional provision states more fully \u201c[a]ll law, statutory and otherwise ...,\u201d and that second clause provides a basis for the broad reading, which the extension statute lacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">In contrast, defendant cites cases where phrases following lists of statutes refer only to positive enactments, and not to common law, particularly when paired with the phrase \u201cor regulation.\u201d For example, in <em>Sprietsma v. Mercury Marine, </em>537 <em>U.S. </em>51, 63, 123 <em>S.Ct. </em>518, 526, 154 L.Ed.2d 466, 477-78 (2002), in interpreting a preemption provision of the Federal Boat Safety Act, 46 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 4306 (a state or political subdivision \u201cmay not establish, continue in effect, or enforce a law or regulation establishing\u201d certain boating performance or safety standards), the United States Supreme Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>We think that this language is most naturally read as not encompassing common-law claims for two reasons. First, the article \u201ca\u201d before \u201claw or regulation\u201d implies a discreteness\u2014which is embodied in statutes and regulations\u2014that is not present in the common law. Second, because \u201ca word is known by the company it keeps,\u201d <em>Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>561, 575, <em>115 </em>S.Ct. 1061, 131 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>1 (1995), the terms \u201claw\u201d and \u201cregulation\u201d used together in the pre-emption clause indicate that Congress pre-empted only positive enactments. If \u201claw\u201d were read broadly so as to include the common law, it might also be interpreted to include regulations, which would render the express reference to \u201cregulation\u201d in the pre-emption clause superfluous.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Applying this reasoning, we note that the extension statute lacks the article \u201ca\u201d before \u201claw or regulation\u201d and lacks a savings clause referring to the common law, both of which proved persuasive to the <em>Sprietsma </em>Court. <em>See also Do Sung Uhm v. Humana, Inc., </em>620 <em>F.3d </em>1134, 1153-54 (9th Cir.2010) (noting that the absence of a savings clause and article distinguished <em>Sprietsma </em>and compelled an evaluation of the statute\u2019s legislative history). Further, the approach of preemption, seeking to foreclose any action that a local government entity may undertake, is restrictive and contrary to the expansive attempt to maintain regulatory authority over polluters that applies here. Initially, we disagree with DEP that the statute is clear and unambiguous. Our analysis requires further inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">To properly interpret the extension statute, recognizing a lack of clarity, we focus on discerning the Legislature\u2019s intent. The extension statute was enacted to provide DEP with a specific period of additional time within which to initiate natural resource damages litigation. The Legislature did not use words of limitation such as \u201conly,\u201d \u201cnot to exceed,\u201d \u201climited by,\u201d or the like. Instead, the Legislature wrote that this provision applies except where some other provision \u201cexpressly and specifically applies,\u201d demonstrating breadth in applicability, and that the statute would be \u201csubject to any statutory provisions or common law rules extending limitations,\u201d demonstrating breadth in duration. The definition of \u201cState\u2019s environmental laws\u201d is also broad, identifying nine statutes that address spills, water pollution, contaminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>\u201cBrownfield\u201d sites, industrial sites, solid waste management, medical waste management, hazard waste facilities siting, sanitary landfill facility closure and low-level radioactive waste disposal facility siting. To that long and varied fist, the Legislature added \u201cor any other law or regulation by which the State may compel a person to perform remediation activities on contaminated property[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10B-17.1(c). The term \u201cor regulation\u201d refers to a duly promulgated administrative rule, so the focus is on whether \u201cany other law\u201d is restricted to a legislative enactment or whether it includes other sources of law, such as common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The available legislative history supports DEP\u2019s position. In the 2001 Senate Environment Committee statement, the focus was on expanding the limitations period; no mention was made of curtailing the scope of DEP\u2019s regulatory authority:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">The committee substitute would also establish a separate statute of limitations for civil actions brought by the State for the payment of compensation for damage to, or loss of, natural resources due to the discharge of a hazardous substance, pursuant to the State\u2019s environmental laws. A civil action must be commenced by the State no more than four years after the cause of action accrues. The substitute provides that the no cause of action would accrue for payment of compensation for damage to, or loss of, natural resources prior to January 1, 2002 or until the performance of the preliminary assessment, site investigation, and remedial investigation, if necessary, of the contaminated site or sanitary landfill facility, whichever is later. The substitute would also provide that actions covered by the limitations period established in section 5 of the committee substitute would not be subject to the limitations period established in P.L.1991, c. 387 (C.2A:14-1.2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-7\">[Senate Environment Committee Statement To Senate Committee Substitute For Senate Bill No. 2345 (June 11, 2001).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">The Acting Governor\u2019s press release upon enactment of <em>L. </em>2001, c. 154, provided a more definitive statement that DEP\u2019s regulatory authority was not being curtailed. That statement provided that the enactment</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">gives the state additional time to pursue legal actions against those who are responsible for contaminating sites around New Jersey. As a result of this act, responsible parties, not the taxpayers, will continue to be required to pay for the cleanup and the restoration of natural resources injured by that contamination. This bill continues the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection\u2019s authority to require restoration of natural resources injured by a hazardous discharge as part of the remediation process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>[News Eelease, Office of the Governor, Acting Governor Donald D. DiFranceseo (July 18, 2001).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The sponsor\u2019s statement and related history for the bill that became <em>L. </em>2005, c. 245, specified the intent to \u201cextend by 18 months the statute of limitations for civil actions brought by the State for the payment of compensation for damage to, or loss of, natural resources due to the discharge of a hazardous substance, pursuant to the State\u2019s environmental laws.\u201d Sponsor\u2019s Statement to Assembly Bill No. 4469, <em>L. </em>2005, c. 245 at 3. That statement explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">for those sites on which the remedial investigation has been completed, the statute of limitations would have expired on January 1, 2006. This bill would provide the State an additional 18 months in which to bring a civil action for the payment of compensation for damage to, or loss of) natural resources due to the discharge of a hazardous substance, pursuant to the State\u2019s environmental laws.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">The Legislature\u2019s goal was to provide DEP additional time, and it crafted the statute without using words of restriction. We are reluctant to interpret the extension statute to foreclose common law causes of action unless the legislative intent specifically provided otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">We reject defendant\u2019s argument that DEP took a contrary position five years ago, during briefing and argument in <em>New Jersey Society for Environmental &amp; Economic Development v. Campbell (NJSEED), </em>No. MER-L-343-04. Our review of that proceeding reflects that it involved different factual and legal issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">Ultimately, that litigation acknowledged the valid distinction between the State\u2019s right to litigate on behalf of its people to reclaim or recover natural resources that have been taken or destroyed, and its right to recover monies in civil litigation to compensate for prior periods of lost use of natural resources. DEP correctly recognized that the former right can be pursued without any statutory deadline, while reasonably believing that the latter right must be brought in a timely fashion now that the <em>nullum tempus </em>doctrine has been abolished. DEP has not ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>vanced inconsistent legal positions in the <em>NJSEED </em>matter and the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Although DEP next claims that the trial judge\u2019s conclusion here is contrary to other caselaw, we note that the only cases cited are unreported and are neither precedential nor binding on us or the trial judge. <em>See R. </em>l:36-3(\u201cNo unpublished opinion shall constitute precedent or be binding upon any court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">For completeness, we identify the cases referred to: <em>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection v. Occidental Chemical Corp., </em>No. ESX-L-9868-05 (Law Div. March 31, 2008); <em>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection v. Azon Corp., </em>No. L-1-05 (Law Div. January 9, 2007); and <em>New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection v. Higgins Disposal Service, Inc., </em>No. 01-0476 (D.N.J. September 1, 2009). These cases support the position that the extension statute applied to DEP\u2019s assertion of common law claims. A contrary result was reached in <em>New Jersey Transit Corp. v. American Premier Underwriters, Inc. (American Premier), </em>2005 <em>U.S. Dist. LEXIS </em>43212 (D.N.J. November 22, 2005).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> None of these cases are precedential or binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Finally, DEP contends that the trial court\u2019s decision leads to absurd results. Because DEP would be required to file all of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>claims in one action under the entire controversy doctrine, a shorter statute of limitations for common law claims against polluters would render the extension statute meaningless, an interpretive result that courts should avoid. The courts also have recognized legitimate timing issues relevant to DEP\u2019s filing of natural resource damages actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">Defendant responds that this \u201cabsurdity\u201d presumably refers to DEP\u2019s need to bring common law claims before site remediation would be complete, when the full natural resource injury may not yet be known. Defendant notes that this situation \u201cwould only occur at the unusually large and complex sites, where remediation takes longer than 10 years to complete ... such as our Bayway and Bayonne sites____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">DEP responds by noting that if defendant is correct, then DEP would have been required to bring the natural resource damages actions by January 1, 2002, for \u201cthe biggest and dirtiest sites with the widest array of impacted natural resources.\u201d The site remediation investigations for defendant\u2019s sites remain ongoing after eighteen years. Although defendant contends that under federal law, natural resource damages should be sought while site remediation is ongoing, DEP asserts that the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 9607(g) bars pursuit of federal natural resource damages actions while remediation proceedings are ongoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">DEP\u2019s position regarding the federal law analogy is well founded. Under the CERCLA, \u2018Tt]he President, or the authorized representative of any State, shall act on behalf of the public as trustee of such natural resources to recover for such damages.\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 9607(f)(1). The period within which actions for natural resource damages may be brought are governed by 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 9613(g)(1), a statute that applies with respect to any site listed on the National Priorities List (NPL), and \u201cany vessel or facility at which a remedial action under this Act is otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>scheduled____\u201d The statute provides that \u201can action for damages under this Act must be commenced within 3 years after the completion of the remedial action (excluding operation and maintenance activities)____\u201d 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 9613(g)(1)(B). The statute further provides that \u201c[i]n no event\u201d may such an action be commenced \u201cbefore selection of the remedial action if the President is diligently proceeding with a remedial investigation and feasibility study\u201d under 42 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7\u00a7 9604(b) or 9620. <em>Ibid.; Utah v. Kennecott Corp., </em>801 <em>F.Supp. </em>553, 568 (D.Utah.1992) (quoting <em>In re Acushnet River &amp; New Bedford Harbor, </em>712 <em>F.Supp. </em>1019, 1035 (D.Mass.1989)), <em>appeal dismissed by </em>14 F.3d 1489 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>513 <em>U.S. </em>872, 115 <em>S.Ct. </em>197, 130 L.Ed.2d 129 (1994) (\u201c \u2018customarily, natural resource damages are viewed as the difference between the natural resource in its pristine condition and the natural resource after the cleanup, together with the lost use value and the costs of assessment. As a residue of the cleanup action, in effect, they are thus not generally settled prior to a cleanup settlement\u2019 \u201d). Natural resource damage claims are not permitted under CERCLA while remedial work is underway at a Superfund Site.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">Actions to recover for damage to natural resources may depend upon the type of remedial action undertaken at a particular site, because the specifics of the remedial action may determine the extent of damage to natural resources that will remain at the site. If the remedial action takes care of most of the natural resource damage at the site, then a separate action for damages may not be necessary. Conversely, if at the conclusion of the remedial action substantial damage remains, then action to recover damages may be warranted. Since the judgment of the necessity for pursuing a damages action must necessarily await the final decision on the remedial action, it is best to ensure that the statute of limitations for bringing such damages actions does not force a premature decision. <em>[H.R. Rep. No. </em>99-253, pt. IV, at 53-54 (1985), reprinted in 1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3068, 3083-84.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">These federal law sources underscore the relevance of the timing of the commencement of natural resource damages claims. To insist that the common law claims must precede the statutory claims turns this rational procedure on its head. The reasoning that would allow for such a scenario would indeed generate an absurd result.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>We conclude that the Legislature intended that \u201cany other law\u201d in the extension statute includes the common law strict liability claim at issue here.
