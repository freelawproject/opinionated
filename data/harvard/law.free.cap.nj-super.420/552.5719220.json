The other regulation, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:15-5.25(e), sets a maximum nitrate level for septic system discharge. Appellant Bi-County Development Corporation challenges these provisions as constituting non-water related land use regulations and therefore ultra vires, prohibited by and inconsistent with various statutes and principles, and arbitrary and capricious. For the reasons that follow, we conclude these regulations are valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">By way of background, the DEP\u2019s enabling statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:1D-1 to -137, authorizes the agency to \u201cformulate comprehensive policies for the conservation of the natural resources of the State [and] the promotion of environmental protection----\u201d <em>N.J.SA </em>13:lD-9. With specific regard to water resources, the Water Quality Planning Act (WQPA), <em>N.J.S.A </em>58:11A-1 to -16, provides for the restoration and maintenance of water quality in this State, including a planning process to control and maintain water quality. <em>N.J.S.A </em>58:llA-2. Similarly, the Water Pollution Control Act (WPCA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:10A-1 to -60, \u201cprovides for restoration, enhancement and maintenance of the State\u2019s waters, including ground and surface waters, and set[s] up administrative controls respecting various treatment facilities.\u201d <em>N.J. Builders Ass\u2019n v. Fenske, </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>60, 64, 591 A.2d 1362 (App.Div. 1991). Together, these acts constitute the Legislature\u2019s response to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Federal Act), 33 <em>U.S.CA </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1251 to 1376, which established an integrated federal system to address water pollution throughout the country. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>the Legislature directed the DEP to develop and implement water quality programs \u201cin concert with other social and economic objectives,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>58:llA-2a, and integrate other \u201cFederal, State, regional and local comprehensive land use, functional and other relevant planning activities, programs and policies\u201d into its water quality planning program. <em>N.J.SA </em>58:llA-2b; <em>see also N.J.SA </em>58:llA-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The Federal Act \u201crequires identification of areas with substantial water quality control problems and initiation of areawide Waste Treatment Management plans.\u201d <em>N.J. Builders Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 63, 591 A.2d 1362 (referring to 33 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1288(a), (b)). Accordingly, towards the goal of \u201crestorfing] and maintainfing] the chemical, physical and biological integrity of the waters of the State[,]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:llA-2b, the WQPA mandates the creation of wastewater treatment management planning areas and authorizes the DEP to set water quality standards, implement areawide waste treatment management plans within each of the planning areas, and adopt rules and regulations to effectuate the objectives of the WQPA. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:llA-5, -7 and -9; <em>see also Toll Bros., Inc. v. N.J., Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot., </em>242 <em>N.J.Super. </em>519, 526, 577 A.2d 845 (App.Div.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">These areawide plans address, among other things, the facilities necessary to meet the municipal and industrial wastewater treatment needs of the area over a twenty year period; acquisition of land; financing; and construction priorities. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:llA-5a. The plans also include the establishment of a regulatory program to provide control or treatment of all point and nonpoint sources of pollution to the extent practical, and to regulate the location, modification and construction of any facilities within the planning area which may result in any discharge. <em>N.J.S.A </em>58:llA-5c(l) and (2). Moreover, to address pollution associated with construction and land use activities, each areawide plan must include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">(h) A process: (1) to identify construction activity related sources of pollution; and (2) to set forth procedures and methods, including land use requirements, to control to the extent feasible such sources; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>(k) A process to control the disposal of pollutants on land or in subsurface excavations within such area to protect ground and surface water quality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>6&amp;11A-6.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">In accordance with the WQPA and Section 208 of the Federal Act, twelve areawide water quality management areas in New Jersey have been designated, and areawide plans exist for each one. These plans designate some areas as sewer service areas and others as areas for individual subsurface sewage disposal systems (ISSDSs). Sewer service areas use public sewers to dispose of wastewater through a collection system and interceptors to a centralized facility for treatment and ultimate discharge into surface water or groundwater. ISSDSs consist of on-site treatment systems, commonly referred to as septic systems, that discharge directly into groundwater.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">All projects and activities affecting water quality must be developed and conducted in a manner consistent with the areawide plan adopted for that area. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:11A-10. Thus, if a planned development project is located outside the designated sewer service area of an areawide plan, the project must be developed using septic systems or the areawide plan must be amended to include the project in the sewer service area.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">In 1989, the DEP promulgated the WQMP Rules, <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:15-1.1 to -9.8. In general, the WQMP Rules provide for a continuing water quality planning process and wastewater management planning requirements. The rules create the procedures to establish, amend and revise areawide water quality management (WQM) plans and wastewater management plans (WMP), which are components of the areawide plan. A WMP is \u201ca written and graphic description of existing and future wastewater-related jurisdictions, wastewater service areas, and selected environmental features and treatment works.\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:15-1.5. When a WMP is approved by the DEP, it is incorporated into the areawide WQM plan as an amendment. <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:15-5.3. Every six years, county and local planning authorities must update the WMP. <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:15-5.23(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>On May 7, 2007, the DEP proposed to readopt and amend the WQMP Rules. Following public notice, extensive public comment, agency responses, and three public hearings, the DEP adopted the amendments on July 7, 2008. As noted, the two amendments challenged here respectively restrict the extension of public sewer lines in areas with protected habitat or natural heritage sites, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:15\u20145.24(b)l and 2, and set a two mg/L nitrate level for septic system discharge, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:15-5.25(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">A <em>OVERVIEW OF N.J.AC. 7:15-5.24</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aui\"><em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:15-5.24 restricts the extension of public sewer lines in environmentally sensitive areas, which, in turn, limits the density of development that a property can sustain because it must use a septic system for waste water management.

The DEP explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-10\">The goal of the rules is not to prohibit all development in threatened and endangered species habitats. The rules intend to eliminate significant conflicts between the Department\u2019s natural resource protection mandates and the extension of centralized sewer service, consistent with the intent of the continuing planning processes required under Section 208 of the Federal Clean Water Act and reinforced through the New Jersey Water Quality Planning Act. In places where sewer service is not provided, the rules allow individual subsurface sewage disposal systems (septic systems) as an appropriate wastewater management alternative. In general, septic system development will occur at a lower density than development that would be supported by public sewers. This lower density development is more consistent with the conservation of these sensitive environmental resources. However, the real emphasis of the rules is to eliminate the encouragement and public subsidy of development in environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands, category one stream buffers, Natural Heritage Priority Sites and threatened and endangered species habitats.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-11\">[40 <em>N.J.R. </em>4113 (July 7, 2008).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>\n<em>B.

ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Appellant\u2019s primary argument is that the regulations contained in <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:15-5.24(b)l and 2 are not water quality regulations authorized by the WQPA, but rather are land use regulations that limit density, the authority for which belongs to the municipalities pursuant to the Municipal Land Use Law (MLUL), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-1 to -163. We disagree. The challenged rule regulates the extension of sewage lines in environmentally sensitive areas, which the DEP undeniably is authorized to promulgate pursuant to both the WQPA and the WPCA. That the regulation may have the collateral effect of limiting the density of development that such property can sustain with a septic system does not transform the rule into an unauthorized land use regulation. Nor does the incidental benefit of protecting endangered and threatened species and natural heritage sites render the regulation ultra vires or contrary to, or beyond, the stated statutory purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">In the findings section of the WQPA, the Legislature declared</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5S\">that the people of the State have a paramount interest in the restoration, maintenance and preservation of the quality of the waters of the State <em>for the protection, and preservation of </em>public health and welfare, food supplies, public water supplies, <em>propagation offish and wildlife, agricultural and industrial uses, aesthetic satisfaction, recreation, and other beneficial uses;</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-8\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>58:llA-2a (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">The Legislature continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-10\">[T]he severity of the water pollution problem in the State necessitates continuing water quality management planning in order to develop and <em>implement water quality programs in concert with other social and economic objectives. </em>The Legislature further finds that <em>water quality is dependent upon factors of topograr phy, hydrology, population concentration, industrial and commercial development, agricultural uses, transportation and other such factors </em>which vary among and within watersheds and other regions of the State and that <em>pollution abatement programs should consider these natural and man-made </em>conditions that influence water quality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-11\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>58:llA-2a (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">Thus, the Legislature instructed the DEP to formulate water quality plans and regulations \u201cin concert with other social and economic objectives,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>58:llA-2a, and to \u201ccoordinate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>integrate\u201d the plans \u201cwith related Federal, State, regional and local comprehensive land use, functional and other relevant planning activities, programs and policies.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>58:llA-2b. This directive serves as a standard to guide the DEP\u2019s discretion in setting water quality rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">(i)</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">One such related environmental, social and land use policy is embodied in the Endangered and Nongame Species Conservation Act (ENSCA), <em>N.J.SA </em>23:2A-1 to -13, which is intended to \u201cmanage all forms of wildlife to insure their continued participation in the ecosystem\u201d and to \u201cmaintain and to the extent possible enhance their numbers.\u201d <em>N.J.SA </em>23:2A-2a and b. Of course, a species cannot continue its participation in the ecosystem or enhance its numbers without suitable habitat.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">Contrary to appellant\u2019s contention, however, <em>N.JAC. </em>7:15-5.24 is not a \u201chabitat\u201d regulation, but simply implements the legislative intent that DEP consider threatened and endangered species <em>as well as </em>their habitat in setting water quality rules. On this score, the ENSCA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-8\">\u201cEndangered species\u201d means any species or subspecies of wildlife whose prospects of survival or recruitment are in jeopardy or are likely within the foreseeable future to become so due to any of the following factors: (1) <em>the destruction, drastic modification, or severe cuitailment of its habitat, </em>or (2) its over-utilization for scientific, commercial or sporting purposes, or (3) the effect on it of disease, <em>pollution, </em>or predation, or (4) <em>other natural or manmade factors affecting its prospects of survival or recruitment within the State, </em>or (5) any combination of the foregoing factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">[N.J.S.A 23:2A-3c (emphasis added).]</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">The ENSCA also authorizes the DEP to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-11\">conduct investigations concerning wildlife in order to develop information relating to populations, distribution, <em>habitat needs, </em>limiting factors and other biological and ecological data to determine management measures necessary <em>for their continued ability to sustain themselves successfully. On the basis of such determinations the commissioner shall develop management programs which shall be designed to insure the continued, ability of midlife to perpetuate themselves successfully.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b612-12\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>23:2A~4a (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Thus, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:15-5.24(b)l helps \u201cinsure the continued ability of wildlife to perpetuate themselves successfully\u201d by restricting development in areas with protected habitat. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>23:2A-4a.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Finally, ENSCA authorizes penalties for violations thereof and allows for the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-6\">[r]eeovery of compensatory damages for any loss or destruction of natural resources, including but not limited to, wildlife, fish, aquatic life, <em>habitat, </em>plants, or historic or archeological resources, and for any other actual damages____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-8\"><em>IN.J.S.A. </em>23:2A-10c(4) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">A violator may also be ordered to \u201crestore the site of the violation.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>23:2A-10c(5). If the Legislature had intended to restrict the DEP\u2019s authority to species only, as appellant contends, it would not have included habitat restoration in the penalty section of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">Appellant also argues that <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:15-5.24(b)l is invalid because it uses overly broad Landscape Maps to designate \u201chabitat,\u201d which is not limited to land that is in fact occupied by protected or threatened species, but includes land that protected and threatened species may be expected to use based on past sightings. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-11\">Because most species are \u201cmobile and transient,\u201d the DEP\u2019s protected habitat designation is based on whether the land is suitable for a species known to occupy the area, not strictly on whether the species was seen on the land during any particular survey. 40 <em>N.J.R. </em>4113 (July 7, 2008). The DEP explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-12\">[TJhe absence of a particular specie on a particular site and survey date cannot result in a conclusion that the specie does not rely on the habitat. It is more appropriate to assess the habitat characteristics through a habitat suitability determination to determine whether the habitat has been altered in such a way as to render it unsuitable for that specie. The rules recognize that the Landscape Project maps present a snapshot in time and that subsequent legal alterations to the landscape may have occurred that affect the suitability of the habitat. <em>N.J. AC. </em>7:15-5.26 establishes a Habitat Suitability Determination procedure for rebutting the Landscape data. This determination provides agencies the ability to rebut the presumption of habitat in an area where it can be demonstrated that the area, through legal alteration, is no longer suitable habitat for the relevant endangered or threatened species.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-13\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>In <em>In re Adopted Amendments to N.J.AC. 7:7A-2.4, </em>365 <em>N.J.Super. </em>255, 259, 839 A.2d 60 (App.Div.2003), we considered the validity of <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:7A-2.4, a regulation that \u201cadopt[ed] the Landscape Project method to classify those wetlands which support the habitats of threatened or endangered species.\u201d The DEP had promulgated <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:7A-2.4 pursuant to the Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act (FWPA), <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:9B-1 to -30, which required the DEP to \u201c \u2018develop a system for the classification of freshwater wetlands based upon criteria which distinguish among wetlands of exceptional resource value, intermediate resource value, and ordinary resource value.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 260, 839 A.2d 60 (quoting <em>N.J.SA </em>13:9B-7). Although \u201chabitat\u201d was not defined, the FWPA described wetlands of exceptional resource value as wetlands</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-5\">which are present habitats for threatened or endangered species, or those which are documented habitats for threatened or endangered species which remain suitable for breeding, resting, or feeding by these species during the normal period these species would use the habitat. A habitat shall be considered a documented habitat if the [DEP] makes a finding that the habitat remains suitable for use by the specific documented threatened and endangered species, based upon information available to it, including but not limited to, information submitted by an applicant for a freshwater wetlands permit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\"><em>[.N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-7a(2)J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Thus, whether wetlands had exceptional resource value was dependent upon whether the land was presently habitat for, or was documented habitat for, endangered or threatened species.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Like appellant here, the challengers in that case argued that the Landscape Project method of determining protected habitat was overly broad because it was not limited to land on which protected and endangered species had been seen. <em>In re Adopted Amendments to N.J.A.C. 7:7A-2.4, supra, </em>365 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 259, 839 A.2d 60. We rejected that argument, reasoning that \u201c[t]he concept of habitat is rather broad,\u201d and, according to <em>Webster\u2019s II New College Dictionary </em>497-98 (1999), is \u201cthe environment in which an organism or biological population usu[ally] lives or grows.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261, 839 A.2d 60 (alteration in original). We found the DEP\u2019s use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>of the Landscape Project and Maps proper, explaining that the FWPA</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">does not restrict classification of such wetlands to habitats in which an endangered or threatened species either has presently been sighted or has been sighted in the past. Its focus is upon the habitats of such species and affords DEP broad discretion to document such habitats. \u201c[A] documented habitat\u201d exists if DEP \u201cmakes a finding that the habitat remains suitable for use by the\u201d threatened or endangered species. <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:9B-7(a)(2). The Landscape Project method broadens the inquiry to include habitats in which there have been actual sightings or other physical evidence of an endangered or threatened species, and contiguous wetlands which contain the natural characteristics that make it suitable for that species to populate. The evident premise is that endangered or threatened species are not stationary. As DEP has found, \u201c[mjany rare species populations require large contiguous blocks of habitat to survive.\u201d It is difficult to quarrel with DEP\u2019s observation that \u201c[t]he rapid suburbanization of our landscape has led to the loss and degradation of critically important wildlife habitats, and the fragmentation and isolation of the habitats that remain.\u201d Moreover, Builders <em>[ie., </em>the challenger] does not dispute DEP\u2019s examples of a 40 percent loss of \u201cthe remaining critical migratory bird stopover habitat on the lower third of the Cape May peninsula\u201d and \u201capproximately 50 percent of the State\u2019s bog turtle habitat.\u201d DEP\u2019s effort to adopt a more protective approach through the Landscape Project method is neither inconsistent with the governing statute, unsupported by the record, nor arbitrary or capricious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 266, 839 A.2d 60.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">We discern no reason to depart from our ruling in <em>In re Adopted Amendments to N.J.AC. 7:7A-24. </em>Like the FWPA, the ENSCA does not define \u201chabitat.\u201d As in that case, we adopt its ordinary meaning, which is \u201crather broad,\u201d and includes \u201cthe environment in which an organism or biological population usu[ally] lives or grows.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261, 839 A.2d 60. Thus, \u201chabitat\u201d includes areas in which species can be expected to live based on past sightings. <em>Id. </em>at 266, 839 A.2d 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Moreover, the challenged regulations provide both for a process to dispute the protected \u201chabitat\u201d designation and rebut the presumption that environmentally sensitive lands are not suitable for the extension of sewage lines, and for an exemption from this restriction. Thus, <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:15-5.24(e) allows an applicant to \u201crebut the presumption that the environmental data identified in (b)\u201d is correct. Subsection (e)3 allows the applicant to challenge the accuracy of the DEP\u2019s geographic information system (GIS) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>information. Additionally, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:15-5.24(h)l allows for the extension of sewer lines into environmentally sensitive areas to accommodate center based development. Thus, an applicant has the ability to both demonstrate that the DEP erroneously identified endangered species habitat on the Landscape Map and to extend sewage lines for center based development.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">(ii)</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Another related State policy which the WQPA instructs the DEP to consider in setting water quality rules is that expressed in the Natural Heritage Program Act (NHPA), <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:1B-15.146 to -15.150, namely to preserve and protect the State\u2019s \u201crich natural heritage.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:1B-15.146. The Act\u2019s findings and declarations section provides that \u201cthis State has a rich natural heritage which is in danger of disappearing as the State continues to experience economic and industrial growth.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:1B-15.146. In 1984, \u201ca program to conduct an inventory of rare plants, animals, and natural communities throughout New Jersey was established\u201d through an agreement between the DEP and The Nature Conservancy, a nonprofit conservative organization.. <em>Ibid. </em>That program, however, had an end date. <em>Ibid. </em>Thus to further the purpose of that program and \u201cpreserve the State\u2019s natural diversity,\u201d the Legislature created the DEP-administered Natural Heritage Program. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">The purpose of the program is to identify the most critically important natural areas in the State and provide detailed up-to-date information on rare species and natural communities to planners, developers, and conservation agencies for use in resource management, environmental impact assessment, and both public and private land protection efforts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>18:1B-15.147J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">The functions of the program include, but are not limited to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-10\">a. Maintaining and updating, through data collection and field work, a partially computerized data base which includes lists of rare and endangered species, and natural communities ranked according to rarity, as well as information on the location, quality, protection status, and sources of information of individual occurrences of the above species [\u00bfe., rare species] and natural communities; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>b. Providing information on species and natural community occurrences to other government agencies, consultants, and private landowners seeking to preserve natural diversity and advice on how best to protect these occurrences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahq\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>13:1B-15.148.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Despite this clear expression of State policy, appellant nevertheless contends the NHPA merely authorizes the DEP to create a database for informational purposes, without even notifying owners that their property has been designated a natural heritage site, and therefore offers no support for <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:15-5.24(b)2. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">The NHPA makes clear that the purpose of the program is to provide information and advice on how to preserve natural resources \u201cfor use in resource management, environmental impact assessment, and both public and private land protection efforts.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:1B-15.146 and -15.147. The Act\u2019s legislative history further provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-8\">The program would benefit the State by: 1) assisting managers of State-owned lands in preserving the natural diversity contained therein; 2) providing information on critical natural areas to developers and regulatory agencies in the early planning stages of projects; 3) directing public and private conservation organizations concerned with land acquisition to the most critically important natural areas in need of protection; and 4) working to avoid unnecessary destruction of rare species and natural communities through disbursement of ecological information.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnM\"><em>[Senate Natural Res. &amp; Agric. Comm. Statement, </em>No. 1366 (N.J. 1988).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">Thus, the information provided by the NHPA was intended for the preservation of the State\u2019s natural heritage sites. That the Legislature did not provide for individual notice to property owners does not establish otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">(hi)</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">The public policies just discussed are reinforced in a host of other statutes, all strongly supportive of protecting the State\u2019s natural resources. For instance, the State Planning Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>52:18A-196 to -207, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-12\">It is in the public interest to encourage development ... in locations that are well situated with respect to present or anticipated public services and facilities ... and to discourage development where it may impair or destroy natural resources or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>environmental qualities that are vital to the health and well-being of the present and future citizens of this State----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>52:18A-196d.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The WPCA \u201cprovides for restoration, enhancement and maintenance of the State\u2019s waters, including ground and surface waters, and set[s] up administrative controls respecting various treatment facilities.\u201d <em>N.J. Builders Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>249 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 64, 591 A.2d 1362. Among other things, the WPCA directs the DEP to promulgate regulations on \u201cclassification of the surface and ground waters of the State and the determination of water quality standards for each such classification.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>58:10A-4c. Similar to the WQPA findings, the WPCA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-8\">It is the policy of this State to restore, enhance and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of its waters, to protect public health, <em>to safeguard fish and aquatic life and scenic and ecological values, and to enhance the domestic, municipal, recreational, industrial and other uses of water.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-9\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>58:10A-2 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">Thus, the WPCA reiterates the State policy to protect natural resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">Lastly, the DEP\u2019s general enabling statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:1D-1 to -137, grants the agency vast authority to set policy and promulgate regulations \u201cfor the conservation of the natural resources of the State, the promotion of environmental protection and the prevention of pollution of the environment of the State.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:lD-9.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> '</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>Thus, while each of the cited statutes, by itself, may not provide direct support for the WQMP Rules, which we find are expressly authorized by the WQPA, collectively they provide implicit authority for <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:15-5.24(b)l and 2. In <em>In re Stormwater Management Rules, </em>384 <em>N.J.Super. </em>451, 894 A.2d 1241 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>489, 909 A.2d 724 (2006), we relied on the WQPA, the WPCA, the Stormwater Management Act, and the DEP\u2019s enabling statute to uphold a regulation that created \u201ca 300-foot buffer on each side of water bodies designated as \u2018Category 1\u2019 waters and their associated perennial or intermittent streams.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 453, 894 A.2d 1241. None of the four statutes explicitly authorized the DEP to create buffers, but the statutes implied the authority. <em>Id. </em>at 464-65, 894 A.2d 1241. The DEP\u2019s enabling statute gave it \u201cbroad powers of conservation and ecological control,\u201d and the WQPA, the WPCA and the Stormwater Management Act sought to \u201cpromote water quality and prevent water pollution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460-61, 894 A.2d 1241. The DEP determined that buffers provided the best method to protect Category 1 waters and the facts supported that determination. <em>Id. </em>at 466, 894 A.2d 1241. Thus, we found the regulation valid. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Appellant attempts to distinguish <em>In re Stormwater Management Rules </em>by arguing that the creation of buffers was necessary to effectuate the intent of the WQPA, the WPCA and the Storm-water Management Act, whereas here, none of the statutes, read together or apart, authorizes the DEP to adopt water management rules that have a \u201cnon-water related purpose\u201d like protecting endangered species habitat and natural heritage sites. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">As we explained in <em>In re Stormwater Management Rules, supra, </em>384 <em>N.J.Super </em>at 461, 894 A.2d 1241:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>In determining whether the requisite authority is implied, if not expressed, a court will \u201cconsider not only the particular statute in question, but also the entire legislative scheme of which it is a part.\u201d <em>Kimmelman v.

In other words, in deciding whether a particular regulation is statutorily authorized, a \u201ccourt may look beyond the specific terms of the enabling act to the statutory policy sought to be achieved by examining the entire statute in light of its surroundings and objectives.\u201d <em>N.J.

In this case, in promulgating the WQMP Rules, the DEP took a comprehensive approach to water quality management by considering the effects that sewage lines and development would have on environmentally sensitive land. This comprehensive approach to regulating is consistent with the WQPA directive to consider related policies and land use in setting water quality rules, as well as with the breadth of the DEP\u2019s enabling legislation. Thus, while the WQPA provides direct support for <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:15-5.24(b)l and 2, the WPCA, ENS-CA, NHPA, State Planning Act and the DEP\u2019s enabling statute, read together, implicitly authorize the challenged regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>(iv)</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Appellant next contends that <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:15\u20145.24(b)4 is inconsistent with and precluded by the Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act because it imposes significant development restrictions on areas adjacent to wetlands extending well beyond the restrictions imposed by the FWPA. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The FWPA establishes a DEP-administrated permitting process for the following activities on freshwater wetlands:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-8\">(1) The removal, excavation, disturbance or dredging of soil, sand, gravel, or aggregate material of any kind;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-9\">(2) The drainage or disturbance of the water level or water table;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-10\">(3) The dumping, discharging or filling with any materials;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-11\">(4) The driving of pilings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-12\">(5) The placing of obstructions; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-13\">(6) The destruction of plant life which would alter the character of a freshwater wetland, including the cutting of trees;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b621-14\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-3.J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b621-15\">Additionally, the FWPA prohibits certain types of construction in \u201ctransition areas\u201d or \u201cbuffers.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13.-9B-3, -16, -17. A transition area is an \u201carea of land adjacent to a freshwater wetland which minimizes adverse impacts on the wetland or serves as an integral component of the wetlands ecosystem.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:9B-3. The FWPA groups freshwater wetlands into three categories (those of exceptional, intermediate and ordinary resource value, <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:9B-7), and restricts construction in transition areas adjacent to wetlands of exceptional and intermediate resource value. <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:9B-16a.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-16\">The regulatory program established by the FWPA \u201cconstitute[s] the only program for\u201d the regulation of freshwater wetlands \u201cin the State except to the extent that these areas are regulated consistent with the provisions of section 6 of this act,\u201d which relate to wetlands in the Meadowlands and Pinelands. <em>N.J.S.A </em>13:9B-30. <em>See also In re Freshwater Wetlands Prot.

The FWPA supersedes all other laws regulating freshwater wetlands. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>13:9B-30. Thus, in <em>In re Freshwater Wetlands Protection Act Rules, supra, </em>our Court struck down as preempted by the FWPA a DEP regulation that added a buffer to wetlands areas. 180 <em>N.J. </em>at 490-91, 852 A.2d 1083.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">In contrast, here, the challenged <em>rule\u2014N.J.A.C. </em>7:15-5.24(b)4\u2014 is not a wetlands braiding regulation and neither imposes significant restrictions on areas adjacent to wetlands nor expands the size of the buffer zone. The plain language of the regulation provides that sewage lines may not be extended to wetlands. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:15-5.24(b)4. It does not impose restrictions on areas adjacent to wetlands.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Further, the regulation is not precluded by the FWPA because it is does not regulate wetlands \u201cbased upon \u2018wetlands\u2019 concerns alone.\u201d <em>N.J.

Admittedly, recognizing and harmonizing these overlapping regulatory concerns cannot be reduced, in advance, to a precise formula which can be easily applied to each situation that arises. The DEP will no doubt have to harmonize these regulatory interests when considering applications both within and outside the Wetlands program. Suffice it for us to say that the DEP has no power under the Wetlands Act to regulate any wetlands aspects of exempt programs through other State permit programs. Wetlands regulatory aspects may only be administered under the Wetlands Act. However, the DEP must, of course, operate the other state permit programs effectively and conscientiously in pursuit of each program\u2019s statutory mandate; if such operation implicates wetlands aspects of these programs incidentally, we see no inexorable conflict. Each program has a primary goal. But harmony of administration with proper respect for property rights is the object, not sharply balkanized or insular programs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 156-57, 574 A.2d 514.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b623-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>The regulation at issue here is not based strictly on wetlands concerns.

The limitations on the extension of sewer service in these areas are consistent with the Department\u2019s mandate to protect the ecological integrity and natural resources of New Jersey, including water, threatened and endangered species, wetlands and unique and rare assemblages of plants.

Cyanamid Co. v. State, Dep\u2019t of Envtl. Prot., </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>292, 555 A.2d 684 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>89, 563 A.2d 847 (1989); <em>Deskovick v.

Aside from being highly speculative, appellant\u2019s argument is fatally flawed because <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:15-5.24(a) does not require large lot zoning and allows for \u201c[i]n fill development, revitalization and redevelopment in appropriate locations.\u201d 40 <em>N.J.R. </em>4013, 4014 (July 7, 2008). Additionally, <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:15-3.5(b) provides incentives for cluster development via a simplified administrative process.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">Equally lacking in merit is appellant\u2019s other argument that <em>N.J.AC. </em>7:15-5.24 violates the <em>Mount Laurel </em>doctrine. That principle espouses that all municipalities must provide a realistic opportunity for the construction of their fair share of the region\u2019s present and prospective need for low-and moderate-income housing. <em>S. Burlington Cnty. N.A.A.C.P. v. Twp. of Mt. Laurel, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>151, 336 A.2d 713, <em>cert. denied, </em>423 <em>U.S. </em>808, 96 <em>S.Ct. </em>18, 46 L.Ed.2d 28 (1975); <em>(Mount Laurel I); S. Burlington Cnty. N.A.A.C.P. v. Twp. of Mt. Laurel, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>158, 456 A.2d 390 (1983) <em>(ML Laurel II). </em>This obligation also applies to State agencies when the agency has \u201ccomplete control over the planning and zoning\u201d of land. <em>In re Adoption of N.J.AC. 19:3, 19:4,19:5 &amp; 19:6, </em>393 <em>N.J.Super. </em>173, 182, 922 A.2d 852 (App.Div.2007), <em>certif. denied, </em>194 <em>N.J. </em>267, 944 A.2d 28 (2008). An example of this type of State agency is the Meadowlands Commission. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">Appellant contends that the <em>Mount Laurel </em>doctrine applies in this case because the DEP is a State agency and the water quality rules regulate land use. Appellant relies on <em>In re Egg Harbor Associates, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>358, 464 A.2d 1115 (1983), for the proposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>that the <em>Mount Laurel </em>obligation attaches to DEP land use regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">The WQMP Rules, however, are not land use regulations, and the DEP does not have complete control over the planning and zoning of the land to which the WQMP Rules apply. The Rules are general regulations that apply to all environmentally sensitive land. The holding in <em>In re Egg Harbor Associates, supra, </em>does not establish otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">There, the Court found that the DEP \u201cmay condition its approval of a proposed development within the coastal zone on the construction of a certain number of low and moderate income housing units,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 361, 464 A.2d 1115, because the DEP had the authority to \u201cregulate land use within the coastal zone for the general welfare.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364, 464 A.2d 1115. The DEP does not exercise similar land use authority in relation to the WQMP Rules. For this reason alone, the <em>Mount Laurel </em>doctrine has no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">(vi)</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">In conclusion, in promulgating the WQMP rules, the DEP struck the proper balance between, on the one hand, a property owner\u2019s interest in developing land and, on the other hand, the State\u2019s interest in preserving protected species habitat, preserving water quality, protecting the environment, and conserving public sewage resources. As to the latter group of interests, both the WQPA and the WPCA authorize the DEP to set water quality standards and the WQPA also instructs that, in doing so, the DEP consider related environmental, social and land use policies. Thus, the DEP clearly has the authority to promulgate water quality regulations that promote water quality and environmental goals. Embodying the agency decision that structuring sewage lines to limit the density of development in environmentally sensitive areas was the most efficient and beneficial way to address water quality concerns in environmentally sensitive areas, <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:15-5.24 represents a valid and reasonable exercise of the DEP\u2019s statutory authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Appellant challenges as arbitrary and capricious <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:15-5.25(e), which sets the maximum nitrate level for septic system discharge, and provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">For areas not covered by (d) above [on sewer service areas], the future wastewater treatment needs of the entire remaining wastewater management planning area shall be evaluated in conformance with the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">1.

Instead, the DEP set the standard significantly lower without any scientific evidence showing that the lower rate would benefit the environment or the public health. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">In support of its argument, appellant relies on <em>Industrial Union Department, AFL-CIO v. American Petroleum Institute, </em>448 <em>U.S. </em>607, 653, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>2844, 2870, 65 L.Ed.2d 1010,1042 (1980), where the Court struck down a federal work-place regulation that decreased the accepted level of benzene exposure from ten ppm to one ppm because there was no proof that one\u2019s risk of developing cancer lessened if the exposure to benzine was less than ten ppm.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">Appellant\u2019s reliance on this case is misplaced because nitrate levels for drinking water and ground water are different. The DEP based the acceptable nitrate level for septic system discharge on the statewide average level of nitrate in groundwater, which is reasonable because septic system discharge will flow into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>ground water. Consistent with the principle that groundwater quality should be preserved, the DEP set the nitrate level at an amount consistent with the State average. That the drinking-water level is higher is beside the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">Appellant criticizes the DEP average as a \u201ctheoretical calculation,\u201d \u201cnot based on existing nitrate levels of any specific groundwater.\u201d Further, the DEP holds all septic systems to the two <em>mg/L </em>standard regardless of the nitrate level in the groundwater near the septic system and regardless of whether two mg/L would degrade the surrounding groundwater. Appellant contends that the DEP has failed to explain \u201chow its one-size-fits-all standard ... [will] \u2018restore and maintain\u2019 water quality in areas where ambient nitrate levels are lower then [two] mg/L.\u201d Conversely, in areas where nitrate levels are greater than two mg/L, the standard will not restore and maintain water quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">While appellant correctly notes that the two mg/L standard applies to all septic systems regardless of the nitrate level in the surrounding groundwater, this circumstance does not render the regulation arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">\u201clR]egulations which fall within the scope of the statutorily delegated authority and are not ultra vires on their face,\u201d are presumed to be valid. <em>Soc\u2019y for Envt\u2019l Econ.

In fact, we followed this approach in <em>In re Highlands Water Protection &amp; Planning Act Rules, N.J.A.C. 7:38-1, </em>401 <em>N.J.Super. 587, 595, 952 </em>A.2d 487 (App.Div.2008), where an objector argued that the DEP\u2019s septic density standard for the Highlands was not supported by adequate scientific evidence. We remanded the matter to an administrative law judge for an evidentiary hearing on the scientific basis for the standard. <em>Id. </em>at 596, 952 A.2d 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">Here, we are satisfied that the record provides adequate evidence and therefore a rational basis for the nitrate standard. The DEP cites numerous studies in support of the standard, and appellant presents no evidence to establish that any of those studies produced incorrect results.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Further, applying the standard to all septic systems simplifies the process for the DEP and property owners. The alternative would require individual standards applicable to the nitrate levels in the groundwater of each property, which would result in additional expensive and time-consuming testing and regulating. Therefore, we defer to the unilateral approach chosen by the DEP to regulating septic system discharge as reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">Appellant contends that the two <em>mg/L </em>average is meaningless because it is \u201cfraught with arbitrary and unsupported assumptions.\u201d There is no indication, appellant asserts, that the two wells from which the DEP took readings represented nitrate levels in other parts of the State, and some of the readings dated back to 1978. Further, the DEP removed from the calculation sixty wells located in agricultural areas. Because agricultural areas have higher nitrate levels in the groundwater, excluding readings from these areas resulted in a lower average.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">This argument not persuasive. The DEP conducted numerous calculations to determine the average amount of nitrate in groundwater. It removed from some calculations areas that have higher concentrations of nitrate due to man-made sources, like fertilizer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>That does not render the calculations meaningless or arbitrary. On the contrary, we find <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:15-5.25(e) to be a valid exercise of the DEP\u2019s regulatory authority and rationally supported in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">We have considered appellant\u2019s remaining arguments both with respect to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:15-24(b)l and 2 and <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:15-5.25(e), and find them lacking in sufficient merit to warrant discussion in this opinion. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(l)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b607-12\"> According to the DEP, when <em>N.J.A.C. </em>7:15 was amended in 2008, DEP directed applicants and local planning agencies to use GIS coverages provided by the DEP when preparing WMPs.
