He pled guilty to the offense following denial of his motion to suppress evidence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">We discern the following facts and procedural history from the record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">Shortly after 10:00 p.m. on August 8, 2008, North Arlington Police Officer Michael Horton received a message from the police dispatcher to the effect that a caller had reported a vehicle with a specific license plate driving around on Belmont Avenue. According to Horton, the dispatcher told him that the caller had said that the vehicle was \u201ccontinually driving around the neighborhood, and the driver keeps exiting the vehicle.\u201d Defense counsel also read an entry from the dispatcher\u2019s notes into the record at the beginning of the hearing: \u201cAnd I can read that into the record. \u201822:05 caller ... repeats vehicle driving around neighborhood, male. Then driver keeps exiting the vehicle!.] [A]nd there\u2019s a license plate number provided.\u2019\u201d Horton, who did not know or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>speak to the caller, testified that he \u201cbelieve[d] [the dispatcher] indicated that it was a possible intoxicated male.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">When Horton and his partner arrived at Belmont Avenue, he observed a 1989 four-door Honda with the same license plate number given to him by the dispatcher. The vehicle was stopped by the side of the road, with its headlights on and engine running. The male occupant was speaking loudly on a cell phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Horton activated the emergency flashers on his patrol car and pulled up behind the vehicle.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As he approached the driver, he detected a strong odor of alcohol. When he got to the driver\u2019s side front window, he observed that the driver\u2019s eyes were bloodshot and his speech slurred. Horton asked the driver where he was coming from, and the driver told him that he had been drinking at a pub in Bloomfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Horton instructed the driver to get out of his ear, after which he administered field-sobriety tests. Based upon the results of those tests, the driver, who was identified as Adubato, was arrested and charged with DWI, along with other offenses not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-8\">At the time of the arrest, Adubato was parked in front of his residence on Belmont Avenue. However, Horton testified that he was not aware of that fact at the time, because he had not yet performed a record check on the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-9\">Adubato filed a motion to suppress the evidence resulting from Horton\u2019s \u201cstop\u201d of his vehicle, alleging that Horton lacked probable cause to make the stop and administer field-sobriety tests. The municipal court judge held an evidentiary hearing on April 28, 2009, at which Horton was the only witness. In a written decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>dated May 1, 2009, the judge determined that Horton acted with probable cause and denied the motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">On July 23, 2009, Adubato entered a conditional plea of guilty to the DWI charge. He was sentenced, as a first offender, to a seven-month suspension of his driving privileges and required to attend twelve hours of a program for intoxicated drivers, in addition to the required fines and penalties. The sentence was stayed pending Adubato\u2019s appeal to the Law Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">The Law Division judge heard the appeal on January 29, 2010. In an oral decision, he denied the motion to suppress de novo. He concluded that, because there was testimony that the driver was \u201cgetting in and out of his vehicle,\u201d there was \u201csome risk that the residential neighborhood [was] being cased for targets,\u201d which gave \u201cthe police officer the right to inquire.\u201d Citing <em>State v. Martinez, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>75, 615 A.2d 279 (App.Div.1992), the judge concluded that Horton had a \u201ccommon-law right to inquire based upon a founded suspicion that criminal activity might be afoot.\u201d The judge accepted the conditional plea, and imposed the same sentence as had been imposed by the municipal judge. He stayed the sentence pending Adubato\u2019s appeal to us, which was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">On appeal, Adubato raises the following issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">THE MOTOR VEHICLE STOP AND SEIZURE OF THE DEFENDANT WAS UNLAWFUL.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">Our role in an appeal such as this one is limited, in that we \u201cconsider only the action of the Law Division and not that of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>the municipal court.\u201d <em>State v. Oliveri, </em>336 <em>N.J.Super. </em>244, 251, 764 A.2d 489 (App.Div.2001) (citing <em>State v. Joas, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>179, 184, 168 A.2d 27 (1961)). The Law Division determination is de novo on the record from the municipal court, <em>Rule </em>3:23-8(a), but the Law Division judge must give \u201cdue, although not necessarily controlling, regard to the opportunity of the magistrate to judge the credibility of the witnesses.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 157, 199 A.2d 809 (1964). In this ease, the municipal judge made no specific credibility findings, although we note that the truthfulness of Horton\u2019s testimony has not been challenged on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">We are ordinarily limited to determining whether the Law Division\u2019s de novo findings \u201ccould reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence present in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162, 199 A.2d 809. Nevertheless, our review of purely legal issues is plenary. <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995); <em>State v. Goodman, </em>415 <em>N.J.Super. </em>210, 225, 1 A.3d 767 (App.Div.2010), <em>certif. denied, </em>205 <em>N.J. </em>78, 12 A.3d 210 (2011). Finally, because an appeal is taken from a trial court\u2019s ruling rather than reasons for the ruling, we may rely on grounds other than those upon which the trial court relied. <em>See State v. Maples, </em>346 <em>N.J.Super. </em>408, 417, 788 A.2d 314 (App.Div.2002); <em>State v. Deluca, </em>325 <em>N.J.Super. </em>376, 389, 739 A.2d 455 (App.Div.1999), <em>aff'd as modified, </em>168 <em>N.J. </em>626, 775 A.2d 1284(2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 1, paragraph 7 of the New Jersey Constitution, \u201c[a] warrantless search is presumed invalid unless it falls within one of the recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement.\u201d <em>State v. Cooke, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>657, 664, 751 A.2d 92 (2000); <em>see also State v. Alston, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>211, 230, 440 A.2d 1311 (1981). The same is true of the warrantless seizure of a person or property. <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>1, 19-21, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>1868, 1879-80, 20 L.Ed.2d 889, 905-06 (1968) (seizure of a person); <em>State v. Hempele, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>182, 218-19, 576 A.2d 793 (1990) (seizure of property).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The seizure of a person occurs in a police encounter if the facts objectively indicate that \u201c\u2018the police conduct would have communicated to a reasonable person that the person was not free to decline the officers\u2019 requests or otherwise terminate the encounter.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Tucker, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>158, 166, 642 A.2d 401 (1994) <em>(quoting Florida v. Bostick, </em>501 <em>U.S. </em>429, 439, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>2382, 2389, 115 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>389, 402 (1991)). In applying that test, our courts implement the constitutional guarantee to protect the \u201creasonable expectations of citizens to be \u2018secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165, 642 A.2d 401 (quoting <em>N.J. Const. </em>art. 1,117).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">In <em>State v. Pineiro, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>13, 20, 853 A.2d 887 (2004), the Supreme Court defined a field inquiry as \u201cthe least intrusive encounter,\u201d occurring when a police officer approaches a person and asks if he or she is willing to answer some questions. \u201cA field inquiry is permissible so long as the questions \u2018[are] not harassing, overbearing, or accusatory in nature.\u2019\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>State v. Nishina, </em>175 <em>N.J. </em>502, 510, 816 A.2d 153 (2003)). During such a field inquiry, \u201cthe individual approached \u2018need not answer any question put to him; indeed, he may decline to listen to the questions at all and may go on his way.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Privott, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>16, 24, 999 A.2d 415 (2010) (quoting <em>State v. Maryland, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>471, 483, 771 A.2d 1220 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">An investigatory stop, unlike a field inquiry, is characterized by a detention in which the person approached by a police officer would not reasonably feel free to leave, even though the encounter falls short of a formal arrest. <em>State v. Stovall, </em>170 <em>N.J. </em>346, 355-56, 788 A.2d 746 (2002); <em>see also Terry, supra, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>at 19, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1878-79, 20 L.Ed.2d at 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">The <em>Terry </em>exception to the warrant requirement permits a police officer to detain an individual for a brief period, and to pat him down for the officer\u2019s safety, if that stop is \u201cbased on \u2018specific and articulable facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts,\u2019 give rise to a reasonable suspicion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>criminal activity.\u201d <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>117, 126, 796 A.2d 857 (2002) (quoting <em>Terry, supra, </em>392 <em>U.S. </em>at 21, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1880, 20 L.Ed.2d at 906). <em>See also, Privott, supra, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>at 25, 999 A.2d 415 (describing the <em>Terry </em>stop and the limited nature of the pat down for weapons). Under this well-established standard, \u201c[a]n investigatory stop is valid only if the officer has a \u2018particularized suspicion\u2019 based upon an objective observation that the person stopped has been [engaged] or is about to engage in criminal wrongdoing.\u201d <em>State v. Davis, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>490, 504, 517 A.2d 859 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\u201cTo determine whether the State has shown a valid investigative detention requires a consideration of the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Elders, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>224, 247, 927 A.2d 1250 (2007); <em>see also Privott, supra, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>at 25-26, 999 A.2d 415. As the Supreme Court observed in <em>Davis, supra, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>at 505, 517 A.2d 859,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">Such encounters are justified only if the evidence, when interpreted in an objectively reasonable manner, shows that the encounter was preceded by activity that would lead a reasonable police officer to have an articulable suspicion that criminal activity had occurred or would shortly occur. No mathematical formula exists for deciding whether the totality of circumstances provided the officer with an articulable or particularized suspicion that the individual in question was involved in criminal activity. Such a determination can be made only through a sensitive appraisal of the circumstances in each case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">In evaluating the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d we \u201care to give weight to \u2018the officer\u2019s knowledge and experience\u2019 as well as \u2018rational inferences that could be drawn from the facts objectively and reasonably viewed in light of the officer\u2019s expertise.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Citarella, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>272, 279, 712 A.2d 1096 (1998) (quoting <em>State v. Arthur, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>1, 10-11, 691 A.2d 808 (1997)). \u201cThe fact that purely innocent connotations can be ascribed to a person\u2019s actions does not mean that an officer cannot base a finding of reasonable suspicion on those actions as long as \u2018a reasonable person would find the actions are consistent with guilt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 279-80, 712 A.2d 1096 (quoting <em>Arthur, supra, </em>149 <em>N.J. </em>at 11, 691 A.2d 808).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>The Law Division judge relied on the following language in our opinion in <em>Martinez, </em>260 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 78, 615 A.2d 279 (citations omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">We take notice, however, that operation of a motor vehicle in the middle of the night on a residential street at a snail\u2019s pace between five and ten m.p.b. is indeed \u201cabnormal,\u201d as the Trooper testified. Such abnormal conduct suggests a number of objectively reasonable concerns: (a) something might be wrong with the car; (b) something might be wrong with its driver; (c) a traffic safety hazard is presented to drivers approaching from the rear when an abnormally slow moving vehicle is operated at night on a roadway without flashers; (d) there is some risk that the residential neighborhood is being \u201ccased\u201d for targets of opportunity. Possibilities (a), (b) and (c) involve the \u201ccommunity caretaking function\u201d expected of alert police officers. Possibility (d) implicates the \u201ccommon-law right to inquire\u201d based upon a founded suspicion that criminal activity might be afoot. It is appropriate to consider all of these applicable concerns and balance them against the minimal intrusion involved in a simple inquiry stop.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-7\">The \u201ccommunity caretaking\u201d doctrine, which was implicated in the first three \u201cpossibilities\u201d mentioned in <em>Martinez, </em>\u201capplies when the \u2018police are engaged in functions, [which are] totally divorced from the detection, investigation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a [criminal] statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Diloreto, </em>180 <em>N.J. </em>264, 275, 850 A.2d 1226 (2004) (quoting <em>State v. Cassidy, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>150, 161 n. 4, 843 A.2d 1132 (2004)). However, we view the \u201ccommon-law right to inquire,\u201d to the extent it is not part of \u201ccommunity caretaking,\u201d as a precursor of a \u201cfield inquiry,\u201d as articulated in <em>Pineiro, </em>181 <em>N.J. </em>at 20, 853 A.2d 887.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">With these principles in mind, we examine the facts of this case and consider whether, under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d Horton\u2019s conduct violated Adubato\u2019s constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-10\">When he arrived at the vicinity of Adubato\u2019s car, Horton had been told by the dispatcher that the car had been observed \u201ccontinually driving around the neighborhood\u201d and that the driver kept \u201cexiting the vehicle.\u201d He may have been told that the driver was \u201ca possible intoxicated male.\u201d On arrival, Horton observed the car stopped on the side of the road, with the engine running, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>the lights on, and the driver speaking loudly on a cell phone. He did not know at the time that Adubato was parked in front of his own house.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Consequently, Horton did not know whether he was dealing with an intoxicated driver, a lost driver, someone with car trouble, or, as the Law Division judge suggested, someone who was looking around the neighborhood for opportunities to engage in criminal conduct. Under those circumstances, we conclude that Horton was justified in making further inquiry, whether one views the situation as governed by the search and seizure concepts articulated in <em>Pineiro </em>or the \u201ccommunity caretaking\u201d concepts articulated in <em>Martinez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The question then becomes whether the fact that Horton had his flashers on when he pulled up behind Adubato\u2019s ear transformed a <em>Pineiro </em>or <em>Martinez </em>field inquiry into a <em>Terry </em>stop. The answer to this question is important because it is clear that, at the time he observed Adubato stopped by the side of the road speaking on his cell phone, Horton did not have a factual basis for \u201ca particularized suspicion\u201d sufficient to warrant a <em>Terry </em>stop. The anonymous call did not supply a sufficient basis for a <em>Terry </em>stop under the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court in <em>State v. Golotta, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>205, 221-22, 837 A.2d 359 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">We again look at the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d Horton did not, in actuality, stop Adubato\u2019s vehicle.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It was already parked by the side of the road, for reasons then unknown to Horton. The incident took place at night, after 10 p.m. While Horton could, of course, have pulled up behind Adubato without his flashers on, we are not willing to find that his decision to use his flashers when pulling up behind a stopped car late at night elevated his field inquiry into a <em>Terry </em>stop. We view the conduct as constitutionally ambiguous. The driver of such a car might be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>concerned that he or she was not free to drive away, <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>at 129, 796 A.2d 857 (\u201c[A]s a practical matter, citizens almost never feel free to end an encounter initiated by the police\u201d), but would also have been reassured that the person parking behind was a police officer rather than a stranger with potentially unfriendly intentions. The use of the flashing lights enhanced Horton and his partner\u2019s safety, as well as Adubato\u2019s. Finally, common experience suggests that police officers routinely use their flashers when rendering roadside assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">In addition, in <em>State v. Goetaski, </em>209 <em>N.J.Super. </em>362, 366, 507 A.2d 751 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>104 <em>N.J. </em>458, 517 A.2d 443 (1986), we held that sufficiently unusual circumstances sounding in community-caretaking concepts can \u201cwarrant the closer scrutiny of a momentary investigative stop and inquiry.\u201d <em>See also State v. Harris, </em>384 <em>N.J.Super. </em>29, 45, 894 A.2d 8 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>357, 907 A.2d 1016 (2006) (\u201cBrief, non-intrusive encounters with individuals on the street or in parked cars implicate none of the privacy or security concerns engendered by discretionary police spot checks of moving vehicles.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">As Horton approached the driver\u2019s side window, he detected the odor of alcohol, which he determined was coming from Adubato\u2019s \u201cbreath.\u201d Horton also noted that Adubato\u2019s eyes were \u201cbloodshot and watery,\u201d and that \u201chis speech was also affected.\u201d When Horton asked Adubato where he was coming from, Adubato responded that he had been drinking at a pub in Bloomfield. At that point, Horton had the factual basis for an \u201carticulable suspicion\u201d that Adubato had engaged in criminal conduct, i.e., driving while intoxicated, sufficient to warrant a <em>Terry </em>stop, including the administration of field-sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">In summary, when he arrived on the scene, Horton and his partner had a sufficient basis to make further inquiry under the concepts of both <em>Pineiro </em>(field inquiry) and <em>Martinez </em>(community earetaking). Horton\u2019s decision to turn his flashers on when he pulled behind Adubato\u2019s parked car did not, under the particular facts of this case, elevate that inquiry into a <em>Terry </em>stop. Once <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Horton ascertained that Adubato had the odor of alcohol on his breath, bloodshot and watery eyes, slurred speech, and that he had been drinking, he had a sufficient basis for a <em>Terry </em>stop. As a result, the Law Division\u2019s decision denying the motion to suppress was correct as a matter of law, although not for the exact reasons stated by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b220-10\"> During cross-examination, Horton was asked whether the dispatch notes said anything about an intoxicated driver. He responded that they did not.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b220-11\"> During cross-examination, Horton was asked whether he \"effectuated a motor vehicle stop\" and he responded that he did.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b221-12\"> Although the municipal judge made findings of fact, some of them are not supported by the record. He found that there had been multiple calls to the dispatcher, but there was no mention of more than one call at the hearing. He also found that the callers stated that the driver was using a cell phone and speaking so loudly it could be heard in the adjacent houses, but there was no such testimony. Horton\u2019s testimony was that Adubato was speaking on the cell phone when his car was parked by the side of the road.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b226-8\"> We have noted that Horton agreed with defense counsel on cross-examination that he made a \"stop,\u201d but we are not bound by Horton's view of the legal effects of his actions, one way or the other.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
