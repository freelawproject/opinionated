RODR\u00cdGUEZ, P.J.A.D.</author>\n<p id=\"b321-13\">In this appeal from a public bidding dispute regarding a school building project, the central issue is the construction and application of <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:19-2.13(c). This regulation provides in pertinent part that, \u201c[a] firm shall not be awarded a contract which, when added to the backlog of uncompleted construction work ... would exceed the firm\u2019s aggregate rating.\u201d The dispute is whether this requirement applies to subcontractors as well as general contractors. We hold that the regulation applies to both subcontractors and contractors pursuant to the Public Schools Contract Law (PSCL), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:18A-1 to -59, and the Educational Facilities Construction and Financing Act (EFCFA), <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A7G-1 to -48.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-14\">The Kearny Board of Education (Board) opened bids for the \u201cKearny High School\u2014Aircraft Noise Abatement and Renovations Project\u201d (Project) on September 15, 2010. Dobco, Inc. (Dobco) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>was the lowest bidder, followed by Brockwell &amp; Carrington (B <em>&amp; </em>C). The Board awarded the contract to Dobco. Dobco\u2019s bid identified Environmental Climate Control, Inc. (ECC) as the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) subcontractor for the Project. ECC indicated that it would perform its portion of the HVAC work for $7,500,000. In connection with Dobco\u2019s bid, ECC submitted a \u201cNotice of Classification\u201d and a \u201cState of New Jersey Form DBC 701 (Form 701).\u201d These forms are required by the Division of Property Management and Construction (DPMC), which classifies contractors by permissible aggregate work volume based upon the given contractor\u2019s submissions detailing financial ability. It is undisputed that, at the\u2019 time the bid was submitted, ECC\u2019s aggregate limit was $15,000,000. With Dobco\u2019s bid, ECC also submitted a Form 701 indicating that it had a backlog of uncompleted contracts totaling $3,500,000. Therefore, it could bid on this project as Dobco\u2019s subcontractor without exceeding its $15,000,000 aggregate limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">B &amp; C challenged Dobco\u2019s bid, asserting defects in the bid. B &amp; C claimed that the HVAC work was valued at near $9,500,000 and ECC had therefore underbid the project. B &amp; C also claimed that it had received a Form 701 from ECC for an unrelated contract a month earlier in which ECC had disclosed a backlog of uncompleted contracts exceeding $9,000,000. According to B &amp; C, therefore, not only was ECC\u2019s Form 701 for the Project likely incorrect, but by bidding $7,250,000 on the Project, ECC had exceeded its aggregate limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The Board investigated. Peter Pivko, the architect for the Project, relayed Dobco\u2019s explanation that ECC had bid the project at $7,250,000 because Dobco planned on completing a portion of the HVAC work itself. Martin Hestor, the ECC estimator, determined that ECC\u2019s backlog of uncompleted contracts was actually $10,125,579 at the time of the bid submission. When this backlog was added to ECC\u2019s $7,250,000 bid on the Project, the sum exceeded ECC\u2019s aggregate limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>B &amp; C moved by way of order to show cause to disqualify Dobco\u2019s bid. Judge Maurice J. Gallipoli granted the order to show cause. In opposition, Dobco submitted the certification of Kenneth O\u2019Boyle, ECC\u2019s president, asserting that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">As of August 31, [2010,] ECC\u2019s uncompleted contract work had a dollar value of $10,125,579; $3,231,329.20 of the work is being self-performed, $4,193,983.30 is being subcontracted, and $2,700,267.00 reflects the value of materials being purchased. As of September 30, [2010,] the dollar value of uncompleted work was reduced to $8,227,191.15; $2,603,211.35 of the work is being self-performed, $3,917,452.80 is being subcontracted, and $1,706,527.00 reflects the value of materials being purchased.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">On the return date, Dobco and the Board argued that <em>N.J.AC. </em>17:19-2.13 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:7G-37, generally do not apply to subcontractors; and, that <em>N.J.AC. </em>17:19-2.1(a) requires only that a subcontractor possess, rather than comply with a valid classification and rating. Specifically, Dobco argued that although <em>N.J.AC. </em>17:19-2.11(b) and -2.1(a) explicitly refer to subcontractors, the only section that requires the backlog calculation, <em>N.J.AC. </em>17:19-2.13(c), refers only to a \u201cfirm.\u201d Given the separate treatment given to subcontractors in other sections, Dobco argued that subcontractors are not included in the broad use of \u201cfirm\u201d in <em>N.J.AC. </em>17:19-2.13(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">In a November 29, 2010 written opinion, Judge Gallipoli rejected these arguments. He relied primarily on the EFCFA and our holding in <em>Advance Electric Co. v. Montgomery Township Board of Education, </em>351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>160, 175, 797 A.2d 216 (App.Div.2002), where we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\">the Legislature has determined that the classification of bidders, as accomplished by the Treasurer\u2019s regulations, is a reasonable method by which <em>to qualify both bidders and their </em>subcontractors....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-10\">This conclusion is buttressed by the requirement in [the PSCL,] <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:18A-26[,] that bidders be classified, and that a board of education can only accept bids from those \u201cqualified in accordance with such classification.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-11\">[ (emphasis added).J</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">This interpretation supports the broad legislative intent of \u201cin-surfing] that quality work will be provided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176, 797 A.2d 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Judge Gallipoli found that ECC was a \u201cfirm\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.A.C, </em>17:19-2.13(c) and subject to its terms. Thus, the judge decided that ECC was subject to the aggregate rating limit set by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:19-2.13(a). He also determined that the legislative intent articulated in 35 <em>N.J.R. </em>1701(a) demonstrated that \u201cthe 85-percent deduction<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was not intended to benefit a subcontractor, but a contractor seeking the award of a prime contract.\u201d Based on these findings and analysis, the judge concluded that Dobeo\u2019s bid was materially defective, and denied Dobco the opportunity to cure its bid. The judge ordered the Board to award the contract B &amp; C, the next lowest responsible bidder.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Dobco appealed and sought a temporary stay. We granted this request and expedited the appeal. No. M-2081-10 (App.Div. Dee. 10, 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">On appeal, Dobco raises three contentions. First, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:7G-37, ECC is within its aggregate rating limit because a subcontractor\u2019s backlog of uncompleted work is not considered when assessing its compliance with its aggregate rating limit. Second, if ECC is subject to <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:19-2.13(a), they are entitled to deduct eighty-five percent of the value of work that it is subcontracting to others pursuant to <em>N.J.AC. </em>17:19-2.13(e) and (e), thereby keeping its bid within its aggregate rating limit. Third, Dobco argues that we should not consider whether Dobeo\u2019s submission of ECC\u2019s erroneous DBC Form 701 was fraudulent, as B &amp; C argues, because the trial judge did not reach that issue. We do not reach this issue either.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">As did Judge Gallipoli, we reject Dobco\u2019s first two arguments and conclude that the PSCL and <em>Advance Elec, </em>support the conclusion that any subcontractor\u2019s bid on a project must not exceed the subcontractor\u2019s aggregate rating limit. Moreover we conclude that EFCFA, which was enacted subsequent to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number><em>Advance Elec, </em>decision, provides an independent basis for holding that ECC must meet the requirements set by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:19-2.13(c). ECC\u2019s non-compliance is a material defect that is fatal to Dobeo\u2019s bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:7G-37, which outlines the requirements for a \u201ccontractor certification,\u201d is explicitly applicable to subcontractors. Contrary to the Board\u2019s and Dobco\u2019s arguments, subsection (a) requires that \u201c[a] pre-qualified contractor seeking to bid school facilities projects, and <em>any subcontractors required to be named </em>..., shall, as a condition of bidding, submit a sworn contractor certification regarding qualifications and credentials.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(emphasis added). The statute goes on in subsection (b) and (c) to explain what \u201cqualifications and credentials\u201d are required, which includes, in subsection (c), a certification as to the contractor\u2019s aggregate rating. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:7G-37(a)-(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Dobco argues that the certification of aggregate rating referenced in subsection (c) is a separate certification that only contractors must submit. Dobco contends that this aggregate rating certification is not required in the typical subcontractor certification because it is not included in the four \u201cqualifications and credentials\u201d that subsection (b) lists. We disagree. To read the requirement of a certification of aggregate rating in subsection (c) as being only applicable to contractors and not subcontractors because of the literal arrangement of the subsections is not only illogical, but would hamper the Legislature\u2019s mandate that \u201c[tjhis act shall be construed liberally to effectuate the legislative intent and the purposes of this act.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:7G-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Moreover, the introduction in subsection (a) does not differentiate between the certification that a contractor or subcontractor must submit. Indeed, as Judge Gallipoli noted, the title to the statute, \u201cSubmission of <em>a sworn contractor certification,\u201d </em>refers to a single certification applicable to contractors and subcontractors alike. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:7G-37 (emphasis added). Therefore, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:7G-37(c), both subcontractors and contractors \u201cseeking to bid school facilities projects\u201d must include a certifica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>tion that their bid \u201cand the value of all of [their] outstanding incomplete contracts do[ ] not exceed the firm\u2019s existing aggregate rating limit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">We also hold that subcontractors are \u201cfirms\u201d subject to the certification requirements of <em>N.J.SA </em>18A:7G-37 and <em>N.J.AC. </em>17:19-2.13(a), Contrary to Dobco\u2019s arguments, the regulations do not distinguish between subcontractors and firms. For example, <em>N.JAC. </em>17:19-2.11(b) explains that \u201ca firm must have a valid classification and rating appropriate to any project on which the firm may bid, or under which <em>a firm, will be designated as a subcontractor </em>in principal trade----\u201d <em>See also N.J.AC. </em>17:19\u2014 2.11(a)(1) (referring to both contractors and subcontractors as \u201cfirms\u201d). In fact, a subcontractor may only obtain an aggregate rating limit from the DPMC if the \u201cfirm\u201d submits, <em>inter alia, </em>a financial statement; a statement as to the \u201cadequacy of the firm ... to undertake the project;\u201d and a statement as to the \u201cnumber of years that the firm has been engaged in the contracting business.\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>17:19-2.1(a), (b)(1), (2), (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Considering <em>N.J.SA </em>18A:7G-37, <em>N.J.AC. </em>17:19-2.11(b) and our holding in <em>Advance Elec, </em>together, it is clear that the Legislature intended \u201cto ensure that only qualified bidders perform the work.\u201d 40 <em>N.J.R. </em>3959(a); <em>see also Seacoast Builders Corp. v. Jackson Twp. Bd. Of Educ., </em>363 <em>N.J.Super. </em>373, 378, 833 A.2d 84 (App.Div.2003) (\u201c[T]he plain intent of the regulation <em>[N.J.AC. </em>17:19-2.13 is] to insure the bidder\u2019s financial responsibility to undertake the work by requiring aggregate-rating compliance____\u201d). To differentiate between subcontractors and contractors would not advance this goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-10\">Here, ECC was a \u201cfirm\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.AC. </em>17:19-2.13 and <em>N.J.AC. </em>17:19-2.1, and \u201cbid\u201d the Project within the meaning of <em>N.J.SA </em>18A:7G-37 and <em>N.J.AC. </em>17:19-2.13(a). ECC was therefore required to certify that it was bidding within its aggregate rating limit pursuant to <em>N.J.SA </em>18A:7G-37 and <em>N.J.AC. </em>17:19-2.13(a) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>We also hold that any contractor is entitled to the benefit of the eighty-five percent reduction provision in <em>N.J.AC. </em>17:19-2.13(e) and (e), provided that the contractor\u2019s backlog includes single prime contracts in which that contractor has subcontracted a portion of that work. Where a firm subcontracts a large portion of its outstanding work, the total value of its backlogged contracts could be unreliable for determining the financial ability of that firm to bid on a given project. Thus, \u201cto eliminate some of the previous barriers to firms that were capable of performing work but were nevertheless barred by the existing regulatory provisions,\u201d the DPMC amended <em>N.J.AC. </em>17:19-2.13. 35 <em>N.J.R. </em>1701(a). Specifically, <em>N.J.AC. </em>17:19-2.13(c) and (e) now provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">(e) A firm shall not be awarded a contract which, when added to the backlog of uncompleted construction work, as shown on Form DPMC 701, would exceed the firm\u2019s aggregate rating. The backlog of uncompleted construction work shall be the total contract value of unbilled work, as evidenced by the most recent approved invoice ... received by the bidder before or on the date of the bid. The firm may deduct 85 percent of the total contract value of the work performed by principal trades, as described in (e) below, on such uncompleted work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">(e) On any project where a firm is awarded a <em>single prime contract </em>which encompasses work to be performed by a subcontractor in a principal trade, as defined in N.J.S.A 52:32-2, including ... ventilation ... work, and general construction, and where the work to be performed by the subcontractors is specifically identified in the bid, the firm shall calculate the value of the awarded contract <em>(for purposes of determining how much the contract will contribute toward determining the firm\u2019s </em>backlog) by deducting 85 percent of the actual subcontract price of the work to be performed by principal trades from the actual price of the contract awarded to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">[ (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">According to the unambiguous language of this regulation, if a firm has a \u201csingle prime\u201d contract as part of its backlog of uncompleted work, then that firm may deduct eighty-five percent of the value of the subcontracted work on that prime contract when calculating the value of its backlogged contracts for future bids.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">The legislative history of subsection (e) supports our interpretation. As we explained in <em>Advance Electric, </em>prior to 1999, schools were required \u201cto seek both bids for each separate branch of work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>to be performed (i a, plumbing, electrical, etc.), and also, included in a single, overall contract, bids for all services to be performed.\u201d 351 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 169, 797 A.2d 216. In 1999, however, the regulation was amended to limit school boards to accepting only single prime contract bids. <em>Id. </em>at 170-71, 797 A.2d 216. To encourage competition in the bidding process, the regulations were also amended to include subsection (e) to allow firms with lower aggregate ratings to reduce the value of a significant portion of its backlogged work. <em>Ibid. </em>Therefore, interpreting this regulation as applying only to contractors with a backlog of single prime contracts harmonizes the explicit language of the regulation with its legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Here, it is clear that Dobco is entitled to employ the eight-five percent reduction provision set by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:19\u20142.13(e) and (e) to reduce the value of any of its backlogged, single prime contracts on which a portion of the work was subcontracted. Pursuant to our analysis, however, ECC can also do so in calculating its backlog of contracts, provided that it has backlogged contracts in which it is a prime contractor and has subcontracted a portion of that contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">We are mindful that O\u2019Boyle\u2019s certification asserts that $4,193,983.30 of its backlog \u201cis being subcontracted.\u201d However, O\u2019Boyle did not certify that ECC was a single prime contractor with respect to any of those contracts. ECC therefore bid in excess of its aggregate rating. The inclusion of an unqualified subcontractor rendered Dobco\u2019s bid defective. We agree with Judge Gallipoli that \u201cpermitting a post-bid cure under these circumstances would afford Dobco an unfair advantage.\u201d <em>See Stano v. Soldo Constr. Co., </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>524, 535-36, 455 A.2d 541 (1983) (holding that a contract could not be awarded to a \u201cbidder employing [an unqualified] subcontractor\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b324-8\"> <em>N.J.A.C. </em>17:19-2.13(e) permits a firm to reduce the value of its backlogged work by eighty-five percent in limited circumstances, which are addressed later in this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
