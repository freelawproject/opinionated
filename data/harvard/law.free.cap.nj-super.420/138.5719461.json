Because Bozzi was not a \u201cprosecuting attorney\u201d as required by the rules, Judge Bookbinder dismissed his Law Division appeal from the municipal court administrator\u2019s decision not to issue the complaint. We agree that Bozzi lacks standing and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">The following facts are taken from the certification Bozzi submitted in support of his appeal. On July 19, 2008, Bozzi attended a party during which a fight erupted. When he intervened, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>was struck by one guest, Dave Wallace, and punched repeatedly in the back of the head by Bradley, who was also a guest. Two weeks later, he tried to file citizen complaints against both in the Eastampton Municipal Court. For reasons not contained in the record, the municipal court administrator accepted the complaint against Wallace, but found no probable cause as to Bradley despite Bozzi\u2019s repeated attempts to convince her otherwise. Nothing in the record explains why Bozzi did not seek the intervention of the municipal or county prosecutor in pursuing the complaint. <em>See R. </em>2:23-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In any event, Bozzi appealed the municipal court administrator\u2019s decision de novo to the Law Division. <em>See R. </em>7:13. The next day, a municipal court judge from an adjoining municipality wrote \u201cno PC found\u201d at the bottom of the affidavit of probable cause Bozzi had submitted in support of his request that a complaint issue against Bradley.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As we have previously stated, Judge Bookbinder found Bozzi lacked standing to appeal because he was not a prosecuting attorney as defined by the applicable court rules. Judge Bookbinder also observed that Bozzi could have requested either the municipal or county prosecutor to review his complaint and determine whether their intervention was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Bozzi raises the following points in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">I. Any Determination That Bozzi\u2019s Complaint Lacks Probable Cause Was an Abuse of Discretion Because His Complaint Plainly Pleads Simple Assault</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-8\">II. The Municipal Court Administrator Lacked Authority to Substitute For the Municipal Judge For Purposes of Determining Probable Cause</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-9\">III. The After-the-Fact/Post-Appeal Probable Cause Determination by the \u201cConflict\u201d Municipal Court Judge Was Invalid</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-10\">IV. The Superior Court Committed Legal Error By Concluding That Bozzi Does Not Have a Right to Appeal in These Circumstances</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-11\">A The Court Rules and Bozzi\u2019s Right To Appeal Can Be Harmoniously Construed</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>B. If the Rules Cannot Be Harmonized, They Must Be Relaxed</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0R\">As it is dispositive, we only address the question of standing.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Our standard of review on legal issues is de novo and we owe no deference to the trial court\u2019s \u201cinterpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts____\u201d <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm. of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995); <em>see also Zabilowicz v. Kelsey, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>507, 512-13, 984 A.2d 872 (2009). Likewise, we are not bound by the trial court\u2019s application of the law, even on questions involving interpretation of court rules. <em>Washington Commons, LLC v. City of Jersey City, </em>416 <em>N.J.Super. </em>555, 560, 7 A.3d 225 (App.Div.2010). In this case, however, de novo review of Judge Bookbinder\u2019s analysis results in precisely the same outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">The starting point is <em>Rule </em>7:13-1, which provides that appeals from municipal court judgments shall be heard in accordance with <em>Rules </em>3:23, 3:24, and 4:74-3.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Rule </em>3:24(b) states: \u201c[t]he prosecuting attorney may appeal, as of right, a pre-trial or post-trial judgment dismissing a complaint____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">In turn, <em>Rule </em>3:23-9 defines \u201cprosecuting attorney\u201d as the Attorney General, municipal attorney, county prosecutor, or</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-11\">[wjith the assent of the prosecuting attorney and the consent of the court, the attorney for a complaining witness or other person interested in the prosecution may be permitted to act for the prosecuting attorney; provided, however, that the court has first reviewed the attorney certification submitted on a form prescribed by the Administrative Director of the Courts, ruled on the contents of the certification, and granted the attorney\u2019s motion to act as private prosecutor for good cause shown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-12\"><em>[R. </em>3:23\u20149(d).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-13\">Bozzi argues that <em>Rule </em>3:23, titled \u201cAppeals from Judgments of Conviction in Courts of Limited Criminal Jurisdiction,\u201d relates only to judgments, not findings of probable cause. Hence the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>rule, Bozzi asserts, does not prevent a private litigant from initiating proceedings by the filing of complaints, and at that stage there is no necessity for a \u201cprosecuting attorney.\u201d This contention is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">In our State, there is simply no circumstance.in which a private complainant can act as a prosecuting attorney without the special approval and process provided in <em>Rule </em>3:23\u20149(d). In fact, Bozzi lacks standing not only to have taken the initial appeal in the Law Division, but to further pursue the matter to this court. <em>State v. Vitiello, </em>377 <em>N.J.Super. </em>452, 455-56, 873 A.2d 591 (App.Div.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The public policy behind the limitation on who may act as a \u201cprosecuting attorney\u201d is well-established: \u201c[u]nlike private citizens, prosecutors are guided and governed by the Rules of Professional Conduct and our ease law to ensure fairness in the process.\u201d <em>In re Loigman, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>133, 144, 870 A.2d 249 (2005); <em>see also State v. Storm, </em>141 <em>N.J. </em>245, 252-55, 661 A.2d 790 (1995) (discussing the detriments and benefits of private prosecutors in municipal court and observing that private prosecutors frequently \u201cundermine confidence in the integrity of the proceedings\u201d); <em>Vitiello, supra, </em>377 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 455-56, 873 A.2d 591 (explaining State\u2019s exclusive control over whether to appeal dismissal of prosecution); <em>cf. R. </em>3:23-2 (providing for appeal by criminal defendants or \u201c[the] State\u201d); <em>R. </em>3:23-9 (outlining who may serve as a prosecuting attorney); <em>R. </em>7:8-7(b) (defining who may appear at trial for the prosecution). Because they are mandated to ensure the fairness of the process, only prosecutors, as defined in the court rules, are authorized to act in cases that may result in incarceration or other penalties of magnitude. Such consequences require that prosecution be limited to those more interested in the \u201cfairness [of] the process\u201d than the vindication of individual interests. <em>See In re Loigman, supra, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>at 144, 870 A.2d 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">In the alternative, Bozzi requests that we broadly interpret the term \u201cprosecuting attorney\u201d to include him, relying upon <em>State ex rel. Qarmout v. Cavallo, </em>340 <em>N.J.Super. </em>365, 774 A.2d 612 (App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Div.2001). In that case, we reversed the dismissal of a municipal court complaint based on a finding of lack of probable cause. The appeal was taken directly by the private citizen who had attempted to file the complaint in municipal court, but the issue of standing was not disputed. In fact, the designation of counsel in the reported case indicates neither the county nor the municipality were parties. <em>Id. </em>at 366, 774 A.2d 612.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Here, the Burlington County Prosecutor\u2019s Office disputes Bozzi\u2019s right to challenge the finding of no probable cause. The absence of any discussion about standing in <em>Qarmout </em>does not necessarily validate Bozzi\u2019s position on the subject and, to the extent <em>Qarmout </em>impliedly holds otherwise, we respectfully disagree. We are satisfied that an adverse ruling as to probable cause, warranted or otherwise, cannot be appealed by any person except a \u201cprosecuting attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Bozzi also contends the Court Rules conflict with the Victim\u2019s Rights Amendment, as set forth in art I., f 22 of the New Jersey Constitution. Furthermore, he complains that, pursuant to <em>Title </em>52, he was entitled to notice of his rights pursuant to the Amendment, and none was afforded to him. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>52:4B-22 (providing for the distribution of information regarding recourse available to victims of crimes).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Both constitutionally and legislatively, victims have been granted myriad rights, privileges, and accommodations. <em>N.J.SA </em>52:4B-1 to -49. Nowhere in the constitutional or legislative scheme, however, are they granted the right to individually prosecute charges. The Victim\u2019s Rights Amendment entitled Bozzi to approach the municipal or county prosecutor, who would then have had the duty to assess, in his or her discretion, the denial of probable cause and decide whether taking an appeal was in the public interest. It did not authorize Bozzi to prosecute the matter directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-12\"> Presumably, that municipal court judge forwarded the complaint to a different municipal judge to avoid the potential appearance of impropriety- Nothing in the record suggests that the second judge was aware of Bozzi's pending Law Division appeal when he made the determination of no probable cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b187-14\"> <em>Rule </em>4:74-3, not relevant to this appeal, addresses situations where penalties have been imposed by the municipal court. Additionally, <em>Rule </em>4:74-2 specifies that such appeals are appropriately brought to the Law Division of the Superior Court. <em>See also R. </em>3:23-2 (governing time and other procedural requisites for such appeals).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
