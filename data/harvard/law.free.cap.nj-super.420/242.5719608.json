Defendants, J.W. and E.W., are the adoptive parents and are cousins of the children\u2019s biological mother, J.M.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-15\">This appeal requires us to consider plaintiffs\u2019 request for grandparent visitation where (1) plaintiffs were the children\u2019s temporary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>foster parents for almost two years; (2) the children were later adopted by defendants who are related to the children\u2019s mother; and (3) defendants afforded plaintiffs visitation for two years following the adoptions and then terminated visitation for personal reasons. We conclude that the Adoption Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:3-38 to -56, does not preclude plaintiffs from seeking visitation under the grandparent visitation statute, <em>N.J.SA </em>9:2-7.1, as the judge below found largely in reliance on <em>In re Adoption of a Child by W.P., </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>158, 748 A.2d 515 (2000). <em>W.P., </em>which addressed the issue of grandparent visitation in the context of a nonrelative adoption, <em>id. </em>at 160, 748 A.2d 515, is not dispositive of plaintiffs\u2019 claims. We therefore reverse the October 15, 2010 order granting summary judgment to defendants; we reinstate plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for grandparent visitation <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The children were born in New York to J.M. and M.S.; the latter is the biological son of J.M.S. and S.S. In 2003, the New York Department of Social Services (NYDSS) for Rockland County terminated the parental rights of J.M. and M.S. NYDSS placed the children with J.M.S. and G.S. as temporary foster parents in March 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">In December 2004, NYDSS transferred custody of the children to defendants, who reside in New Jersey. Plaintiffs consented to this transfer. J.M.S. asserted that plaintiffs consented \u201cto the change with th[e] clear understanding that [they] would stay very closely involved with the children.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Defendants adopted the children in Rockland County on April 20, 2006. The orders of adoption state that \u201call ... persons whose consents are required ... hav[e] personally appeared before th[e] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>[c]ourt for examination.\u201d There is no indication in the record that plaintiffs opposed the adoptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">On April 16, 2010, plaintiffs filed their complaint for custody and/or grandparent visitation, as well as a motion for a change of custody and the appointment of a guardian for the children. The complaint alleged that from December 2004 to October 2008, plaintiffs \u201cremained an integral and essential part of the children\u2019s lives, including regular and frequent day, overnight, weekend, and school break, holiday and summer visits____ [They] participated with the children and ... [defendants in family gatherings, school activities, church and sporting events.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">The complaint further alleged, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b291-10\">[b]eginning in or about Deeember[ ] 2008, ... [d]efendants began to cut ... [pjlaintiffs out of the children\u2019s lives. Immediately, almost all visits to ... [plaintiffs\u2019 home were denied and [plaintiffs were excluded from all activities with the children unless in [defendants\u2019 presence. With increasing frequency [defendants refused to inform [plaintiffs of events, and then flatly denied them visits and/or access to the children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">The complaint further asserted that since 2009 defendants\u2019 \u201clevel of care for the children, the children\u2019s living environment, their physical health, mental health, safety and general well-being have all deteriorated. The children are now suffering both emotionally and physically as a result of a lack of diligent care by ... [defendants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-12\">In support of plaintiffs\u2019 motion, J.M.S. certified that they \u201chave now been effectively cut out of the children\u2019s lives completely and the loss of contact is causing immediate and serious psychological and emotional harm to the children.\u201d He set forth at length allegations that the children\u2019s health, well being and safety were at risk, including: (1) the complete loss of contact between the children and their grandparents who had been the children\u2019s caretakers from March 2003 to December 2004; (2) the children were experiencing a \u201cfeeling of isolation through a controlling environment ... [and] do not feel the warmth of a loving family\u201d; (3) they have \u201cnot undergone regular, comprehensive medical checkups\u201d; (4) they \u201chave suffered physical harm at the hands of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>their older adoptive siblings\u201d; and (4) J.W. has particular needs that require an individualized education program (IEP) and the IEP afforded him in New York has not been continued in New Jersey. J.M.S. asserted that the children\u2019s best interests would be served if they were returned to plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cpermanent custody. At the very least, if custody is not granted, their best interests will be served by open, regular, scheduled access to [plaintiffs] through substantial visitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Defendants filed a cross-motion seeking (1) dismissal of the complaint for \u201clack of jurisdiction and standing to proceed\u201d; (2) an order enjoining plaintiffs from contacting the children\u2019s \u201cschools, athletic coaches or health care providers\u201d; and (3) counsel fees. E.W. certified that the children \u201care integral members of [their] family unit\u201d; plaintiffs refused to adopt the children because they \u201cbelieved that it would conflict with their lifestyle at that time\u201d; and plaintiffs had unduly interfered in defendants\u2019 efforts to raise and care for the children by criticizing their lifestyle and unilaterally contacting the children\u2019s schools and health care providers against defendants\u2019 wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">Regarding the jurisdictional issue, E.W. asserted that it \u201cis improper, based upon the New York adoption, for ... [plaintiffs to come to a New Jersey court seeking information and access regarding ... [the] children.\u201d Furthermore, she contended, the \u201cnet effect of the New York adoption is to eliminate [p]laintiff[s\u2019] legal standing to bring th[is] application.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">At oral argument, defendants supported their standing and jurisdictional contentions by noting that as recently as November 2009, proceedings had been held in the family court in Rockland County, resulting in an order granting M.S. visitation with the children. Plaintiffs pointed out that M.S. was a resident of Rockland County, whereas they, as New Jersey residents, were properly before this court under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:34-53 to -95 (UCCJEA).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>In her decision rendered from the bench, the judge determined that New Jersey \u201cis a proper forum for this matter,\u201d and that plaintiffs had standing to bring their complaint. The judge found no \u201cprima facie demonstration of evidence ... warranting the appointment of a guardian ad litem ... [or] a plenary hearing.\u201d Noting that defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss had been based on issues of standing and jurisdiction, the judge denied their motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety. The judge did, however, dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for custody.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Defendants then moved for summary judgment. In their \u201cStatement of Undisputed Material Facts\u201d defendants contended: (1) the \u201cadoption decree was ... a non-family adoption pursuant to\u201d New York law; (2) the decree \u201cdoes not reserve any rights or otherwise afford any privileges of contact or enhanced status to ... [plaintiffs\u201d; (3) the \u201cNew Jersey statute pertaining to adoptions ... does not allow for the invasion of the autonomy of adoptive parents\u201d; and (4) \u201cthere is no legal basis for ... [plaintiffs to obtain relief consistent with their [c]omplaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Plaintiffs filed a response, disputing most of defendants\u2019 facts. Plaintiffs specifically noted that defendants were \u201cclearly \u2018family members\u2019 [as] biological relatives of the children\u2019s mother[,]\u201d and that it was \u201cclear that the children were placed with ... [defendants], at least in part, due to the fact that they were relatives.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Following oral argument, the judge dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for grandparent visitation. The judge \u201cexamined whether the grandparent visitation statute <em>[N.J.S.A </em>9:2-7.1] was at odds with the public policy of New Jersey\u2019s Adoption Act <em>[N.J.S.A </em>9:3-37 to -56]\u201d and concluded that \u201cthe overriding public policy and statutory law ... emphasizes the complete termination of the biological parents\u2019 rights, thus having the logical effect of terminating a biological grandparent[\u2019s] rights to visitation.\u201d The judge noted that her \u201cfinding was premised on the [Legislature's specif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>ic rejection in New Jersey of the open adoption provision[,]\u201d and concluded that \u201cto require post-adoption visitation by grandparents would be in direct conflict\u201d with New Jersey law.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal but did not request oral argument. They contend that (1) the trial judge erred in granting summary judgment to defendants on the grandparent visitation claim; and (2) they have \u201can independent right to visitation as a result of their role as \u2018psychological parents\u2019 to the children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">We scheduled oral argument and requested the parties to submit supplemental briefs on the following question: should New York or New Jersey\u2019s adoption law govern resolution of plaintiffs\u2019 rights under New Jersey\u2019s grandparent visitation statute? We discuss this issue later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">Initially, we note our standard of review. When reviewing a decision granting summary judgment, we apply the same standard as the motion judge used. <em>Henry v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>204 <em>N.J. </em>320, 330, 9 A.3d 882 (2010). Summary judgment is appropriate where the entire record before the judge, viewed in the light most favorable to the non-movant, demonstrates that \u201cthe moving party is entitled to a judgment or order as a matter of law.\u201d <em>R. </em>4:46-2; <em>Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995). Where, as here, the summary judgment decision rests on an interpretation of law, however, we review it de novo. <em>City of Atl. City v. Trupos, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>447, 463, 992 A.2d 762 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">The grandparent visitation statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">a, A grandparent ... of a child residing in this State may make application before the Superior Court ... for an order for visitation. It shall be the burden of the applicant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the granting of visitation is in the best interests of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-10\">b. In making a determination on an application filed pursuant to this section, the court shall consider the following factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-11\">(1) The relationship between the child and the applicant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-12\">(2) The relationship between each of the child\u2019s parents or the person with whom the child is residing and the applicant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-13\">(3) The time which has elapsed since the child last had contact with the applicant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>(4) The effect that such visitation will have on the relationship between the child and the child\u2019s parents or the person with whom the child is residing;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">(5) If the parents are divorced or separated, the time sharing arrangement which exists between the parents with regard to the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">(6) The good faith of the applicant in filing the application;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">(7) Any history of physical, emotional or sexual abuse or neglect by the applicant; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">(8) Any other factor relevant to the best interests of the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-10\">c. With regard to any application made pursuant to this section, it shall be prima facie evidence that visitation is in the child\u2019s best interest if the applicant had, in the past, been a full-time caretaker for the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-11\">[N.J.S.A 9:2-7.1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">Our adoption statute provides, in pertinent part: \u201cThe entry of a judgment of adoption shall ... terminate all parental rights and responsibilities of the parent towards the adoptive child except for a parent who is the spouse of the petitioner and except those rights that have vested prior to entry of the judgment of adoption[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:3\u201450(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-13\">The judge determined that the Legislature had \u201cspecific[ally] reject[ed] ... open adoption\u201d; this led the judge to conclude that the termination of parental rights inherent in adoptions has \u201cthe logical effect of terminating ... biological grandparents\u2019 rights to visitation.\u201d In support of this determination, the judge relied upon <em>W.P., supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>158, 748 A.2d 515. The judge\u2019s reliance upon <em>W.P. </em>was, in fact, outcome determinative, as it precluded her from considering the factors set forth in the grandparent visitation statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-14\">We are satisfied that the judge erred in concluding that <em>W.P. </em>is dispositive of this matter. There, the adoptive parents were not relatives of either biological parent of the child. In that context, the Court \u201cbelieve[d] that the [grandparent visitation] statute that permits visitation rights of parents of the biological parents of a child adopted by intact <em>nonrelative </em>adoptive parents is in conflict with the provisions of the Adoption Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 168, 748 A.2d 515 (emphasis added). The Court\u2019s analysis of the relationship between the Adoption Act and the grandparent visitation statute was grounded entirely in the context of the nonrelative adoption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>involved in that case. By contrast here, one of the adoptive parents is a blood relative of the children. In fact, plaintiffs alleged, defendants\u2019 status as relatives played a part in the decision to place the children with them in December 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The Court in <em>W.P. </em>noted that the Legislature had failed to pass a proposed amendment to the Adoption Act that would have provided for \u201c \u2018visitation or other type of communication with the child after the adoption by any person who had a relationship with or was biologically related to the adopted child[,]\u2019 \u201d with \u201c \u2018the consent of the adopting parent.\u2019 \u201d 168 <em>N.J. </em>at 172, 748 A.2d 515. This legislative history led the Court to conclude that the Legislature had \u201crejected\u201d the concept of open adoption. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">However, we consider another aspect of the legislative history of the Adoption Act to be particularly instructive here. In <em>Mimkon v. Ford, </em>66 <em>N.J. </em>426, 429, 332 A.2d 199 (1975), the Court considered whether the maternal grandmother of a child whose mother had died was \u201centitled to visit [the child] by virtue of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2-7.1 when the natural father and his second wife, who ... legally adopted the child, refuse to permit visitation[.]\u201d The particular adoption statute that the Court considered <em>vis-a-vis </em>the grandmother\u2019s request provided that \u201c[t]he entry of a judgment of adoption shall terminate all relationships between the child and his parents, and <em>shall terminate all rights, duties and obligations of any person which are founded upon such relationships[.]\u201d N.J.S.A </em>9:3-30(A) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number><em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:3-30(A) was repealed in 1977. <em>L. </em>1977, c. 367, \u00a7 20. It was replaced by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:3-50(c)(l) which, notably, eliminated the highlighted language above. We thus read this statutory amendment as eliminating the automatic termination of \u201call rights ... of any person which are founded upon\u201d the child\u2019s relationship with his or her parent. <em>See State v. Crawley, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>241, 246, 447 A.2d 565 (1982) (the deletion of a statutory provision indicates \u201cthat the Legislature made a conscious decision to exclude [the] provision\u201d). Thus, although the Legislature at one time declined to enact a provision that would have permitted \u201c \u2018visitation or other type of communication with the child after the adoption by any person who ... was biologically related to the adopted child[,]\u2019 \u201d <em>W.P., supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 172, 748 A.2d 515, no provision of the current Adoption Act expressly prohibits such visitation or communication.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Moreover, the judge failed to consider that defendants, by their conduct, had previously indicated that they did not regard the adoptions as barring plaintiffs\u2019 visitation. Defendants afforded plaintiffs such visitation for at least two years after the adoptions were finalized in New York. E.W. certified in 2010 that she and her husband \u201cattempted to include [plaintiffs] in the children\u2019s lives over the last few years ... by inviting them to ball games and occasionally allowing them to visit.\u201d Only when defendants allegedly \u201cencountered harsh and severe criticism and unconditional demands for fixed and regularized [grand]parenting time[,]\u201d did they \u201cobject to [plaintiffs] attempting to intervene in [their] lives and telling [them] how to raise the[] children.\u201d Thus, defendants initially acknowledged plaintiffs\u2019 visitation rights but subsequently terminated those rights for reasons other than the finality of the adoptions per se.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>The judge also failed to take into consideration the fact that M.S., the children\u2019s biological father, obtained an order in New York permitting him to have periodic visitation with the children post-adoption. Clearly these plaintiffs, who were the children\u2019s caretakers for almost two years, should be entitled to seek the same rights as the father whose parental rights were terminated by court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">For these reasons, we conclude the judge\u2019s analysis should not have stopped short with reliance on <em>W.P. </em>The judge should have addressed the standards, both statutory and in the case law, pertinent to grandparent visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">In <em>Moriarty v. Bradt, 177 N.J. </em>84, 827 A.2d 203 (2003), the Court cited studies confirming \u201cthe importance of the grandparent/ grandchild relationship in the lives of children\u201d because the \u201clove, nurturance, and acceptance which grandchildren have found in the grandparent/grandchild relationship \u2018confers a natural form of social immunity on children that they cannot get from any other person or institution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 97, 827 A.2d 203 (quoting Arthur Kornhaber M.D. &amp; Kenneth L. Woodward, <em>Grandparents!Grandchildren: The Vital Connection </em>xiii-xiv (1981)). In consideration of these findings, the Court declined to prohibit grandparent visitation outright even where \u201cfundamental right[s]\u201d of \u201cfamily and parental autonomy,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 103, 827 A.2d 203, were implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">In deference to those \u201cfundamental right[s]\u201d the Court held that the grandparent visitation statute \u201cis subject to strict scrutiny and will only pass muster if it is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citations omitted). To achieve that purpose and strike the appropriate balance between the rights of parents (whether natural or adoptive) and the rights of grandparents, the Court reiterated the standard it adopted three years earlier in <em>Watkins v. Nelson, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>235, 748 A.2d 558 (2000).:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-8\">\u201cSince the right of parents to the custody of their minor children is both a natural and legal right, the law should not disturb the parentychild relationship except for the strongest reasons and only upon a clear showing of a parent\u2019s gross misconduct or unfitness or of other extraordinary circumstances affecting the welfare of the child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number><em>[Moriarty, supra, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>at 112, 827 A.2d 203 (quoting <em>Watkins, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 245, 748 A.2d 568).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The Court in <em>Moriarty </em>concluded that \u201cavoiding harm to the child is the polestar and the constitutional imperative that is necessary to overcome the presumption in favor of the parent\u2019s decision and to justify intrusion into family life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113, 827 A.2d 203. The Court \u201capprove[d]\u201d imposing \u201cthe preponderance of the evidence burden\u201d upon grandparents invoking the visitation statute, and held that such burden will \u201cfully protect[ ] the fundamental rights of parents when coupled with the harm standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 117, 827 A.2d 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">We conclude that plaintiffs are entitled to be heard on the merits of their request for grandparent visitation. On remand, the judge shall weigh the standards and principles governing grandparent visitation in light of the record in this case, which, as noted, discloses: (1) defendants\u2019 consent to plaintiffs\u2019 visitation and participation in the children\u2019s lives for at least two years after the adoptions; (2) the children\u2019s biological father has been granted certain post-adoption visitation rights; and (3) plaintiffs \u201chad, in the past, been ... full-time caretaker[s] for the child[ren].\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:2\u20147.1(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Furthermore, as part of this analysis the judge shall also consider whether plaintiffs\u2019 request for grandparent visitation should properly be weighed against New Jersey\u2019s adoption laws or those of New York, as the children were adopted in that state. In that context, we note that New York\u2019s adoption statute provides that upon a child\u2019s adoption, \u201cthe birth parents ... shall have no rights over [the] child\u201d and the \u201cadoptive parents ... and the adoptive child shall sustain toward each other the legal relation of parent and child____\u201d <em>N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law </em>\u00a7 117(1)(a), (c) (Con-sol.2011). New York courts have permitted \u201c \u2018open adoption^]\u2019, ... in which contact, including visitation, is permitted between the adopted child and members of his birth family\u201d where such contact \u201cmay serve to promote the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>In re Adoption of Anthony, </em>113 Misc.2d 26, 448 N.Y.S.2d 377, 378 (Fam.Ct.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>Section 72 of New York\u2019s Domestic Relations Law specifically grants a grandparent the right to seek visitation either where the parents are deceased or \u201cwhere circumstances show that conditions exist which equity would see fit to intervene.\u201d <em>N.Y.

Sheppard, </em>54 N.Y.2d 320, 322, 445 N.Y.S.2d 420, 429 <em>N.E.2d </em>1049 (1981), the New York Court of Appeals \u201cuph[eld] the right of a natural grandparent to visitation rights with her grandchild, when authorized by court decree, despite an adoption of the child and the protestations of the adoptive parents\u201d where such visitation was \u201cin the best interest of [the] adopted child.\u201d The Court rejected the adoptive parents\u2019 argument that section 117 of the Domestic Relations Law \u201csevers all of the child\u2019s ties to its natural family,\u201d finding that such an analysis of the statutory language was \u201coverbroad[ ] and would interfere with the court\u2019s ability to protect the best interest of the child.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 324, 445 N.Y.S.2d 420, 429 N.E.2d 1049. In fact, it is now well-established in New York that \u201c[a] grandparent may seek visitation with a grandchild even after parental rights have been terminated or the child has been freed for adoption.\u201d <em>In re Ann M.C. v. Orange Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>250 <em>A.D.2d </em>190, 682 N.Y.S.2d 62, 64 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Considering that the children were adopted according to the laws of New York, we conclude that on remand the judge must address which adoption law applies. This choice will not affect the analysis we require in this opinion, however, as we have determined that New Jersey\u2019s adoption statute does not preclude plaintiffs\u2019 quest for grandparent visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">We briefly address plaintiffs\u2019 contention that their right to grandparent visitation derives from their role as the children\u2019s \u201cpsychological parents.\u201d In <em>V.C. v. M.J.B., </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>200, 748 A.2d 539, <em>cert. denied, </em>531 <em>U.S. </em>926, 121 <em>S.Ct. </em>302, 148 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>243 (2000), the Court set forth a \u201ctest [to] provide[ ] a good framework for determining psychological parenthood ... cases[,]\u201d consisting of the following: \u201cthe third party must have lived with the child; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>the third party must perform parental functions for the child to a significant degree; and ... a parent-child bond must be forged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223, 748 A.2d 539. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, we assume that these elements were met during the time the children lived with plaintiffs from March 2003 to December 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">On remand, the judge should consider whether those elements continued to be met during the period of plaintiffs\u2019 visitation with the children from the time they were placed in defendants\u2019 custody in December 2004 until 2008 when visitation ceased. In short, plaintiffs are entitled to full consideration of their claims supporting their grandparent visitation request.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-16\"> The record does not reflect which defendant is a cousin to J.M. It is, however undisputed that a family relationship exists between defendants and J.M.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b290-8\"> In their complaint, plaintiffs alternatively sought custody of the children. The October 15, 2010 order dismissed their complaint in its entirety. On appeal, plaintiffs challenge only the denial of grandparent visitation and have abandoned their quest for custody.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b290-9\"> We summarize the pertinent factual background from the various pleadings filed in this matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b293-9\"> The judge did not issue an order dismissing plaintiffs' custody count until the October 15, 2010 order dismissing their complaint in its entirety.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b296-7\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:3-30(A) also provided that \"when the adopting parent is a stepfather or stepmother, and the adoption is consummated with the consent and approval of the mother or father, ... such adoption shall not affect or terminate any relationships between the child and such mother or father[.]\u201d Relying, in part, on that statutory language, the Court in <em>Mimkon </em>concluded that \"grandparent visitation, in the context of the facts of this case, does not clash with the policies apparently embodied in the adoption statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436, 332 A.2d 199. Insofar as plaintiffs here rely on <em>Mimkon, </em>we consider the case factually distinguishable; we recognize, however, that the Court acknowledged generally the benefits of grandparent visitation, noting that \"[i]t is common human experience that the concern and interest grandparents take in the welfare of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>their grandchildren far exceeds anything explicable in purely biological terms.
