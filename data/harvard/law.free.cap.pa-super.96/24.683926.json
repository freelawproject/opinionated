In this case there has been such general disregard of our rules that we. must again call attention to the matter. It is said that the action is assumpsit, but the pleadings raising the issue for trial are not printed as required by rule 45, while at the same time rule's 55 and 56 were.disregarded. The assignments of error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>\u2014an es'sential part of the pleadings in this court (Cessna\u2019s Estate, 192 Pa. 14, 18; Standard Brewing Co. v. Knapp, 79 Pa. Superior Ct. 252, 254) \u2014 were also drawn and printed in obvious disregard of rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">In the circumstances we apply rule 57 (Eason v. U. S. Shipping Board, 89 Pa. Superior Ct. 485) and dispose of the case without discussion of the merits, though it would 'seem that appellant had no defense to the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
