The claim was based on materials and labor furnished, consisting of tile, bath room accessories, cement, lime, sand, gravel, labor, as set forth in the bill of particulars. The work was done and materials were furnished upon an oral bid to a general contractor for the sum of two hundred forty ($240) dollars, \u201cwhich <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>was orally accepted by Mm at or about the time said labor and materials were furnished.\u201d Attached to the claim was the following bill of particulars:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\">\u201c138 sq. ft. 6 in. x 3 in. glazed tile</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amx\">35 lin. ft. 6 in. x 2 in. glazed cap</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AIuT\">24 lin. ft. 6 in. x 2 in. glazed cove</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADU8\">60 sq. ft. 1 in. white hex vitreous tile</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4e\">Bath Boom Accessories.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-5\">(1) one 6 in. x 6 in. CMna soap and grab rail</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3o\">(1) one 24 in. towel bar</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXt\">(1) one 6 in. x 6 in. china tumbler holder</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AP1\">(1) one 6 in. x 6 in. china soap holder</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaL4\">(1) one 6 in. x 6 in. china paper holder</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARE\">(1) tooth brush holder</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5s\">7 sacks of cement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai7W\">4 sacks of lime</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AI75\">25 bushel of sand</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXW\">10 bushel of gravel</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-6\">4 days labor for tile-setter and helper Contract price for the above........$240\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">It will be noted that the claimant did not aver that its bid was accepted prior to, but \u201cat or about the time\u201d of the furnishing of the labor and materials. As the materials were furnished and the work was done over a period of two weeks, to wit, from December 4, 1925, to December 18, 1925, we can not assume that the contract was entered into for a definite sum prior to the furnishing of materials and doing the work. As there was no contract for a lump sum, the claim should have set forth the dates when the materials were furnished and the work done.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">This case is controlled by our discussion and conclusion in the opinion filed this day in Johnson Service Company v. Fayette Title and Trust Building, Corporation et al.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">The judgment of the lower court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
