Personal service was made on the wife, who did not appear. November 4,1927, a decree of divorce was granted on testimony taken by a judge in open court. February 25, 1928, the wife filed her petition averring that the divorce was obtained by fraud; that the charges in the libel were untrue and that she wished to prove it. The fraud alleged was that after she had been served with process her husband told her he \u201cwould not proceed with this case and...... [that she should not] pay any attention to it;\u201d that \u201cafter notice of the trial was served upon her\u201d he again repeated the assertion, in consequence of which, she avers, she took no steps to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">If these assertions were true, the conduct of the husband would constitute such extrinsic fraud as to justify granting her petition: McFadden v. McFadden, 91 Pa. Superior Ct. 301; Willets v. Willets, 96 Pa. Superior Ct. 198; Field v. Field, 66 Pa. Superior Ct. 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">To her petition, her husband filed an answer denying all her averments. On the issue so made, testimony was taken by a judge in open court, who says in his opinion dismissing the petition; \u2018 \u2018 The respondent was regularly and personally served with process and there was nothing to prevent her appearing and defending the action if she felt justified in doing so. She had counsel at the time in another matter [in April, 1927, she was represented by counsel in charging her husband with aggravated assault and battery]. At all events she had ample means of being advised of her legal rights. She chose to make no defense and from the testimony taken on the rule granted on her petition we are satisfied she was not kept away from court by the libellant and that no good purpose would be served by re-opening the ease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>We likewise disbelieve her evidence, which requires us to conclude that judicial discretion was wisely exercised by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Order affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
