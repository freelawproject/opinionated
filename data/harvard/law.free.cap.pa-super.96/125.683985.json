Berg, the appellant, is a grandson of Reverend Andrew Berg, the decedent, and by this appeal complains of the action of the court below in holding that he is not entitled to participate in the distribution of the corpus of a certain trust fund created by his grandfather\u2019s will. The testator died February 6, 1884, and was survived by his widow, Eliza Ann Berg, and six children \u2014 Justine E., intermarried with Eli McDonnell, Elsie E. ('subsequently intermarried with A. H. Lafean), J. Harry, M. Luther, Isaac E., and Mary (Mamie) E. Berg.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The general plan of his will dated October 31, 1882, and probated Feb. 27, 1884, was (a) to bequeath his whole estate to his executor in trust to pay the entire income thereon to his wife \u201cduring her natural life;\u201d (b) to make special provisions fqr each of his two then unmarried daughters, Mamie E. and Elsie E., if they survived their mother, by directing that his executor hold $1,000 for each of them upon the trusts hereinafter described; and (c) to divide, at the death of his widow, the residue of his estate among his six children equally, having regard to the advancements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>made to each, \u201cso that all and each shall have share and share alike from home, and a 'strictly equitable distribution of my estate be made among my children.\u201d The daughters specially provided for survived their mother who died some time prior to 1895. The portion of the will creating trusts primarily for their benefit reads: \u201cAnd when she [testator\u2019s widow] dies, I direct that my executor keep at interest one thousand dollars for my daughter Mamie E. Berg and one thousand dollars for my daughter Elsie E. Berg; if they survive my wife their mother. These named one thousand dollars for each of my above named daughters shall remain on interest, and the interest annually or semi-annually paid to them so long as they live in single blessedness. But should either of them die or enter into a state of matrimony then the thousand dollars of that one is, in case of her death, to be equally divided among my remaining children, and in case of her marriage, it is to be divided equally among my children her included. And so the same if the other should die or get married.\u201d The trust in favor of Elsie E. terminated upon her marriage 'sometime prior to 1901 and we are now concerned only with the distribution of the corpus of the fund placed in trust for Mamie (Mary) E. Berg.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-3\">On August 17, 1895, the predecessor of the Peoples Trust Company of Lancaster, accountant in this proceeding, was appointed trustee of that $1,000 as the successor of the original executor. Mary E. Berg never married and the trust was administered in accordance with the provisions of the will until it was terminated by her death, intestate, on January 2,1928. Shortly thereafter the trustee filed its account, showing a balance for distribution of $918.51 \u2014 of which $900 is corpus \u2014 and the present controversy arose over the distribution of this balance. The testator directed that this fund, under the circumstances here present, should \u201cbe equally divided among [his] re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>maining children.\u201d One sister, Justine E. McDonnell, and one brother, J. Harry Berg, survived Mary E. Berg; two brothers and one sister had predeceased her. They were M. Luther Berg, who died in 1900, intestate and leaving to survive him a widow, Alice A. Berg, and two children, Elsie R. Berg and Elmer A. Berg, the appellant;-Elsie E. (Berg), intermarried with A. H. Lafean, who died in 1901, intestate and leaving her husband but no issue; and Isaac E. Berg, who died in 1903, intestate and leaving a \"widow, Emma H. Berg, who died in 1927, and two children, Leroy Berg and Randal Berg.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Justine E. McDonnell in 1909 entered a judgment for more than $2,000 against her brother, J. Harry Berg, and attached in the hands of the accountant his interest in this trust fund. Answering the interrogatories, the accountant admitted that it has in its hands the interest of J. Harry Berg in the fund, as the same may be determined upon final distribution. The proceedings in the court below resulted finally in a decree awarding to Justine E. McDonnell the entire fund for distribution \u2014 one-half thereof in her own right and the other as an attaching creditor of her brother, J. Harry Berg.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">Appellant contends that each of Mary E. Berg\u2019s brothers and sisters, including his deceased father, M. Luther Berg, had an interest, in remainder, in the fund upon which she was to receive the income during her life, or until her marriage, which interests vested upon the death of the testator and were not contingent upon surviving Mary E. Berg; and that the fund should therefore have been divided into five equal shares, three of which should have been distributed to the persons entitled to participate in the respective estates of the three deceased children of Andrew Berg. If appellant\u2019s contention is sound he would be entitled to one-third of one-fifth of the corpus. A majority of the members of this court are of opinion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>Ms contention should not he sustained. There is in tMs will no direct or express gift to remaindermen; the gifts to them arise only by implication from the direction that the fund \u201cbe equally divided among [testator\u2019s] remaimng children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\">The opinion of the learned president judge of the court below is to the effect that the intention of the testator is not so reasonably clear as to justify a court in ignoring the rule of construction in existence in tMs state from Moore v. Smith, 9 Watts 403, 407, to Feeney\u2019s Estate, 293 Pa. 273, 280, that \u201cwhere a gift is only implied from a direction to pay, it is necessarily inseparable from the direction, and must partake of its quality; insomuch that if the one is future and contingent, so must the other be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">\u201cWhere there is no gift but in a direction to pay or transfer or divide among several persons, at a future period, though the future period is annexed to the payment, possession or enjoyment, yet it is also annexed to the devise or bequest itself. For, in this case, the direction to pay or transfer or divide, constitutes the devise or bequest itself; and therefore, the vesting in intere'st is postponed, and not merely the vesting in possession or enjoyment\u201d: Smith on Executory Interests, section 314, cited and approved in Kountz\u2019s Estate, No. 1, 213 Pa. 390, 395, and Rosengarten v. Ashton, 228 Pa. 389, 394. \u201cThe rule is conceded that where there is bequest in the form of a direction to pay, or pay and divide \u2018from and after\u2019 the happemng of any event, \u2018then the gift being to persons answering a particular description, if a party cannot bring himself within it he is not entitled to take the benefit of the gift.\u2019 There is no gift in these cases except in the direction to pay or in the direction to pay and divide\u201d: Man\u2019s Estate, 160 Pa. 609, 612. Additional authorities are cited in Reiff\u2019s Appeal, 124 Pa. 145, 151, in wMch it is said: \u201cAnd in many cases, following the rule in England, our Supreme Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>held that where there is no antecedent gift, independent of the period fixed for payment, then the gift is not vested but contingent.\u201d See also Evans\u2019 Estate, No. 1, 264 Pa. 357. The qualification to the rule is also stated in Man\u2019s Estate, supra, and discussed at length in Groninger\u2019s Estate, 268 Pa. 184. It is that \u201cif, upon the whole will, it appears that the future gift is only postponed to let in some other interest, or, as the court has commonly expressed it, for the greater convenience of the estate......the interest is vested notwithstanding, although the enjoyment is postponed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">It was said in Marshall\u2019s Estate, 262 Pa. 145, and repeated in Groninger\u2019s Estate, supra, that \u201cthough there be no other gift than in the direction to pay or distribute in futuro, yet if such gift or distribution appears to be postponed for the convenience of the fund or property, or where the gift is only postponed to let in some other interest, the vesting will not be deferred till the period in question.\u201d We also quote the following from the case last cited: \u201cWhere the enjoyment of the gift over is postponed to accommodate the estate, or for the payment of debts, or to meet any other burden first imposed, and not chiefly on account of the character of the donee, it is regarded as a decisive circumstance in favor of immediate vesting: 2 Redf. on Wills, 236, section 37....... The mode or form of the bequest seems to be regarded by Vice-Chancellor Wigram as immaterial....... The question is one of substance and not of form, and in all cases it is whether the testator intended it [as] a condition precedent that the legatees should survive the time appointed by him for the payment of their legacies; the answer to this question must be sought for out of the whole will, and not in the particular expression only in which the gift is made\u201d: (citing cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Considering this will as a whole we are unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>discover anything in it indicating that the enjoyment of the estate over was postponed for any reason other than the protection of the beneficiary for life. We also think there is inherent evidence that the intention of the testator was that those who were to take a's remaindermen were such of his children as survived the termination of the trust. The natural meaning of the phrase, \u201cmy remaining children,\u201d is those remaining or surviving when the event terminating the trust occurred. Manifestly, it was his intent that different persons were to share in the corpus, depending upon the manner of the termination. If it terminated by the marriage of the beneficiary the fund was to be divided among \u201cmy children her included;\u201d if by her death, among \u201cmy remaining children.\u201d It could not be determined who would share until it was known in which way the trust terminated. As events transpired the first trust to terminate was that in favor of Elsie E. Berg, which, as stated, ended with her marriage. One of the results of the adoption of appellant\u2019s contention would be to give her surviving husband a share in the fund now for distribution. We find nothing in the will to indicate such intent upon the part of the testator. His primary intent was to benefit his own children rather than their husbands, widows or descendants. Nor can we see that the provision in the second paragraph for the division of the balance of the estate among testator\u2019s children share and share alike, subject to the advancements made to each, supports the contention of appellant. That portion of the will dealt only with the balance remaining after the two trust funds had been taken out of the estate. The advancements were to be deducted only from shares in this balance. In Bau\u2019s Estate, 254 Pa. 464, cited in behalf of appellant, there was not only a directed gift over to the children of the testator\u2019s daughter, the beneficiary for life, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>also a charge against the portion of the estate given in trust for her and her children.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">Walker\u2019s Estate, 240 Pa. 1, is an illustration of the principle that the intention of the testator is to be gathered from the whole will. There the bequest was to a daughter for life and at her death to her \u201cchild or children\u201d or in case she \u201cshould die without living issue\u201d then to \u201call my children, their heirs and assigns. \u2019 \u2019 The daughter was survived by a grandchild and it was held that this grandchild was entitled to the bequest because it was clear that the testator did not intend that his other children should have any part of the legacy given to the daughter for life if she left a lineal descendant; It seems equally clear that this testator intended that, if the necessity for the protection of this unmarried daughter ceased by reason of her death, her surviving brothers and sisters \u2014 his \u201cremaining children\u201d \u2014 alone should benefit. The time appointed by him for payment to them was the marriage or death of Mary E. Berg; survival of the event, upon the happening of which payment was to be made, was a condition precedent to the vesting of their interests. In this ca'se the rule of construction and the intent of the testator, as disclosed by the language of the will, are in harmony.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">The interest of appellant\u2019s father in the fund now for distribution was contingent upon the termination of the trust during his lifetime; as it was not terminated during that period, appellant acquired no interest as one of his father\u2019s representatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">The decree of distribution is affirmed at the cost of appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
