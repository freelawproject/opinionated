I find that shortly after the execution of this agreement, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>was effected a reconciliation; and further, that at the decease of the husband, both he and petitioner were living together as man and wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-5\">The executor further contends that since the two children of deceased assigned to their mother a one-third interest in the estate, subsequent to the filing of the notice of election, there is no justiciable issue before the court. With this contention I cannot agree. The right to file a notice of election under section 18 of the Decedent Estate Law is a personal right, as distinguished from a property right. <em>(Matter of Carll, </em>201 Misc. 829, and cases cited therein.) The widow is not deprived of this purely personal right with all of its benefits and implications by accepting a gift of a one-third interest in her husband\u2019s estate from her children, who received the entire estate under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b20-6\">Submit decree accordingly on notice.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
