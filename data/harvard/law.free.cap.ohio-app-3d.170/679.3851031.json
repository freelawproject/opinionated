Painter, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">{\u00b6 1} The media has great freedom in this country because we value its watchdog role. Yet the public\u2019s right to know must be balanced by an individual\u2019s privacy interests \u2014 and it is where these intersect that the courts must be careful to balance both interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">{\u00b6 2} Here, a TV station did investigative reporting. It was sued for defamation. We hold that the trial court was correct in granting summary judgment to the station because it acted reasonably.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">\n<em>I. The Investigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">{\u00b6 3} Plaintiff-appellant J. Michael Fuchs, D.D.S., Inc., d.b.a. Family Dental Care Associates (\u201cFDCA\u201d), has one of the largest dental practices in the Cincinnati area. FDCA has approximately 200,000 patient records in 125,000 separate accounts and generates 60,000 patient visits per year at five locations. J. Michael Fuchs is the president, CEO, sole shareholder, and sole officer of FDCA. Fuchs controls all aspects of FDCA\u2019s business, including billing practices, patient care, customer service, hiring and firing, employee training, and compliance with state and federal regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-8\">{\u00b6 4} Defendant-appellee Hagit Limor is a reporter for defendant-appellee Scripps Howard Broadcasting Company, d.b.a. WCPO-TV\u2019s (\u201cWCPO\u201d), in its consumer and citizen advocacy investigational series, the I-Team. WCPO\u2019s consumer reporter, John Matarese, forwarded to Limor complaints from defendants-appellees Steve Francis and Rebecca Benoit about FDCA. Matarese also forwarded to Limor a videotaped interview with Francis. Limor began to investigate the complaints \u2014 which concerned billing problems and the inability of Francis and Benoit to reach FDCA to resolve the problems because of busy signals and full voice-mail boxes at FDCA\u2019s corporate headquarters. Limor followed up on the complaints by contacting Francis and viewing his videotaped interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">{\u00b6 5} Following these preliminary steps, in December 2002, Limor tried to contact Fuchs for comment, but she was also met with unanswered phone calls and full voice-mail boxes. Limor contacted the Ohio State Dental Board, but she was told that the board dealt only with clinical issues and did not keep open public records. The board directed Limor to the Ohio Attorney General\u2019s Office (\u201cAG\u201d), which dealt with billing complaints. Limor spoke by phone with the AG\u2019s public-relations representative, Peter Gribbon. Later, Limor conducted a videotaped interview with Gribbon, who stated that the AG had received an \u201cunusual\u201d number of complaints about FDCA but was unable to say how many of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>complaints were valid. Gribbon also stated that the AG was not currently-investigating FDCA\u2019s billing practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">{\u00b6 6} Limor contacted the Cincinnati Better Business Bureau (\u201cBBB\u201d) and spoke to its president, Jocile Ehrlich. The BBB had well over 100 unresolved complaints against FDCA, which had an unsatisfactory rating. Ehrlich later stated that the complaints were mainly about billing issues. Limor videotaped interviews with Ehrlich, Francis, Benoit, and the Kutcheras, a married couple who had complained to the BBB about FDCA\u2019s billing practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">{\u00b6 7} Limor continued to investigate FDCA. She discovered that FDCA was involved in more than 180 lawsuits in Hamilton County. When Limor spoke to some of the people involved in the lawsuits, she heard more complaints about FDCA\u2019s billing practices and customer service. Limor also spoke to two dentists not affiliated with FDCA about their own billing practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">{\u00b6 8} Limor tried to contact Fuchs for his response. Fuchs telephoned Limor on February 4, 2003, and stated that he did not \u201cdouble-bill\u201d his patients. Fuchs told Limor that neither she nor the complaining patients understood dental insurance. Fuchs stated that when he told Limor to speak to insurance companies about dental billing, Limor told him that she \u201cdidn\u2019t have to.\u201d Limor denied making that statement. Fuchs directed Limor to obtain releases from the patients if she wanted to inspect the relevant patient records.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">{\u00b6 9} Limor obtained releases from Francis, Benoit, and the Kutcheras and took them to FDCA\u2019s corporate office. Hoping to get an on-camera interview with Fuchs, Limor brought her videographer, Rod Griola. Fuchs refused to appear on camera. Fuchs also refused to release the relevant patient records, even though Limor had obtained the requested releases.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">{\u00b6 10} Fuchs wrote a series of letters to Limor and WCPO, stating that the \u201ccharges\u201d they were making were false, threatening legal action, and requesting the opportunity to respond to the \u201callegations\u201d in a list of written interrogatories. Limor refused to send written questions to Fuchs on the advice of defendantsappellees Robert Morford, WCPO\u2019s news director, and William Fee, WCPO\u2019s general manager. Morford and Fee denied Fuchs\u2019s request for written questions because they preferred face-to-face interviews for the visual medium of television and because they could not be sure of the identity of the person who would actually answer the written questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">{\u00b6 11} Limor made two more attempts to interview Fuchs or a representative of FDCA. The first attempt was early one morning when Limor and Griola showed up uninvited at Fuchs\u2019s home. Fuchs would not appear on camera. The second attempt resulted in a meeting between Fuchs\u2019s attorney and representatives of WCPO. Fuchs did not attend the meeting. Fuchs\u2019s attorney refused to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>speak on the record. And rather than addressing the issues raised by WCPO, he merely related his own experiences with dentists and the basic standards of dental-billing practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">\n<em>II. The First Broadcast</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">{\u00b6 12} After about three months of investigation, WCPO aired its first I-Team report about FDCA on WCPO\u2019s February 24, 2003,11 p.m. newscast.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">{\u00b6 13} In the broadcast report, Francis, Benoit, and the Kutcheras complained that they did not understand the amounts that FDCA had billed them, because the bills did not match the patient portions that their insurance companies had specified and because the bills did not reflect the dental treatment that they had requested. The patients also talked about the substantial difficulty they had met in trying to contact FDCA to resolve the billing issues. Benoit stated that her account had been turned over to a collection agency by FDCA for an amount that she did not owe. Limor reported that FDCA had an unsatisfactory rating with the BBB, with 125 complaints, \u201cthe vast majority over billing disputes.\u201d Jocile Ehrlich stated that the 125 BBB complaints represented an \u201cextremely high number\u201d and that the average number of complaints about a dental firm was \u201cnone, one maybe.\u201d Limor reported that Fuchs had stated that the problem was that \u201cpatients don\u2019t necessarily understand their insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\"><em>III. The Second Broadcast </em>\u2014 and <em>the Response</em></p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">{\u00b6 14} Following the first FDCA broadcast, WCPO received more than 90 telephone calls and e-mails from patients and former employees of FDCA supporting the claims made in the broadcast. As a result, WCPO aired a second FDCA report on February 25, 2003. The second broadcast was a short update reporting the more than 90 calls and e-mails that WCPO had received in support of the first broadcast. The second broadcast also contained a statement by Peter Gribbon that the AG had received approximately 30 complaints about FDCA\u2019s billing practices and that \u201cthe number of complaints [the AG had received was] a little bit out of the ordinary.\u201d The broadcast contained a telephone number for contacting the AG with complaints. The report also stated that the current number of complaints the BBB had received about FDCA was 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">{\u00b6 15} Fuchs and FDCA began to receive negative comments from patients who had seen WCPO\u2019s broadcasts. To defend his integrity and to attack Limor and WCPO, Fuchs paid $18,500 for a full-page advertisement in the Sunday, March 23, 2003 Cincinnati Enquirer, denying the allegations. The advertisement stated that Fuchs had asked Limor and WCPO to contact insurance companies to verify that FDCA\u2019s billing practices were \u201cwell within the norm\u201d but that Limor had responded, \u201cI don\u2019t have to.\u201d The ad also stated that FDCA\u2019s \u201cbilling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>procedures [had] been reviewed by the Ohio State Dental Board and found to be within standard practice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">\n<em>IV. But They Buy Videotape by the Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">{\u00b6 16} In response to FDCA\u2019s advertisement, WCPO reran the February 24, 2003 broadcast on March 23, 2003. During the March 23 broadcast, WCPO made several statements defending the investigation. Limor stated that WCPO had heard from \u201cmore than a hundred unhappy patients and eight former employees\u201d of FDCA, confirming the claims made in the I-Team broadcasts. Limor reported that Fuchs stated that he had resolved some of the BBB complaints without the BBB\u2019s knowledge. Limor also reported that the BBB had received 44 new complaints about FDCA, bringing the total to 169. Limor also announced a follow-up report to air later that week raising new issues such as safety, cleanliness, refusing to treat patients unless they paid first, and ordering unnecessary treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">{\u00b6 17} Following the FDCA broadcasts, WCPO received almost 200 responses from former patients and employees asserting more complaints about FDCA\u2019s business practices and patient care. The patient-care complaints were the center of WCPO\u2019s March 26, 2003 broadcast, which reminded viewers with stand-alone graphics about the original complaints that included \u201cdouble billing.\u201d Limor conducted a group interview with former patients who had tried to resolve various issues with FDCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">{\u00b6 18} The patients complained about unresolved billing problems, poor customer service, \u201cfilthy\u201d dental offices and equipment, FDCA\u2019s refusal to treat patients without a payment first, and FDCA\u2019s dentists prescribing unnecessary treatment. The broadcast included statements from former FDCA employees that confirmed the patients\u2019 complaints. The former employees also raised questions about FDCA\u2019s dental equipment and Fuchs\u2019s alleged prior knowledge of the State Dental Board\u2019s inspections.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-8\">{\u00b6 19} Because Fuchs refused to comment on camera, Limor read portions of a letter Fuchs had faxed to WCPO in which he denied all allegations and stated that (1) FDCA\u2019s offices were clean, safe, and fully compliant with \u201call dental standards,\u201d (2) FDCA did not order unnecessary care, and (3) FDCA directed all its efforts toward providing patients \u201cwith quality care at a reasonable fee in a comfortable and caring manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b729-9\">{\u00b6 20} On June 1, 2003, WCPO aired a fifth I-Team report about sterilization and cleanliness issues at FDCA. The June 1 broadcast focused on the board\u2019s role in policing complaints against FDCA and its dental practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-10\">{\u00b6 21} Statements by former patients and defendant-appellee Penelope Orr, a former FDCA office manager, were included in the broadcast. Orr stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>FDCA dentists had not had the time to adequately sterilize equipment between patients and that the \u201conly thing\u201d separating a patient and \u201csomebody else\u2019s germ [was] a quick spray of Lysol and a paper towel.\u201d Orr said that she had tried to report FDCA to the board and the AG, but nothing was resolved. Two former FDCA dentists, their identities hidden, described unsanitary dental practices they had engaged in while employed at FDCA. They described inadequate infection control and sterilization, poor-quality dental work, and generally poor patient care. The dentists also stated that Fuchs had received word ahead of time about the board\u2019s inspections. The board disputed that claim, denying any special relationship with Fuchs. The broadcast also included a statement by Gribbon that the AG was looking into 60 complaints it had received about FDCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\"><em>V Fuchs and FDCA Sue </em>\u2014 and <em>Lose</em></p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">{\u00b6 22} On August 8, 2003, Fuchs and FDCA filed this case against various former patients and employees for defamation in the I-Team reports. Then WCPO, Fee, Morford, and Limor moved to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">{\u00b6 23} WCPO aired another report on August 28, 2003, describing the lawsuit. The report included statements by Francis, Benoit, and several other defendants responding to the lawsuit. All the defendants stood by their previous statements about FDCA. The broadcast also described WCPO\u2019s efforts to intervene in the lawsuit to defend its I-Team reporting.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">{\u00b6 24} The trial court granted the motion to intervene. On the October 3, 2003 newscast, WCPO noted that it had been allowed to intervene in the lawsuit. FDCA filed an amended complaint on October 9, 2003, including the WCPO defendants. Francis, Benoit, Orr, WCPO, Fee, Morford, and Limor moved for summary judgment, which the trial court granted. Fuchs and FDCA then voluntarily dismissed all other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-9\">\n<em>VI. Fuchs and FDCA Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b730-10\">{\u00b6 25} Fuchs and FDCA have appealed, raising one assignment of error, alleging that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-11\">{\u00b6 26} Summary judgment is proper under Civ.R. 56(C) when (1) no genuine issue of material fact remains to be litigated; (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law; and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and with the evidence viewed most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that conclusion is adverse to that party.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellate review of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment is de novo.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>{\u00b6 27} Summary judgment is appropriate in defamation actions because whether words are defamatory is a question of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And it is especially appropriate in cases involving First Amendment free-speech issues.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\"><em>VII. Defamation </em>\u2014 Public <em>Figure or Not?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">{\u00b6 28} Defamation is the publication or communication of a false statement of fact that injures someone by adversely affecting the person\u2019s (1) reputation, (2) business, or (3) position \u2014 by exposure to public hatred, contempt, ridicule, shame, or disgrace.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The essential elements of a claim for defamation are that (1) the defendant made a false statement, (2) that false statement was defamatory in the sense that it reflected unfavorably on the plaintiffs character or injured his trade or business, (3) the statement was published or communicated, and (4) the defendant acted with the necessary degree of fault.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">{\u00b6 29} A defamation plaintiff can be one of four types: (1) a private person, (2) a public official, (3) a public figure, or (4) a limited-purpose public figure.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Classification determines the plaintiffs burden of proof.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And a plaintiffs classification is a matter of law for the court to decide.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-8\">{\u00b6 30} Public officials, public figures, and limited-purpose public figures must show that the challenged statements were made with actual malice, that is, with knowledge that the statements were false or with reckless disregard of whether they were false.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In cases involving the defamation of private persons, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>an ordinary negligence standard is applied.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Private-person defamation plaintiffs must show by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant failed to act reasonably in attempting to discover the truth or falsity or defamatory character of the publication.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">\n<em>VIII. The Fight Doesn\u2019t Start When They Hit Back</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">{\u00b6 31} The trial court held that Fuchs and FDCA were private-person plaintiffs for the broadcasts that occurred before March 23, 2003, when the advertisement appeared in the Cincinnati Enquirer. But the trial court held that by taking out the advertisement, Fuchs and FDCA had injected themselves into the controversy. Therefore, the trial court held, Fuchs and FDCA were limited-purpose public figures for the broadcasts that appeared after March 23. In this decision, the trial court was mistaken.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">{\u00b6 32} The decision whether a plaintiff is a limited-purpose public figure or a private person must be made on a case-by-case basis by considering all the relevant facts and circumstances.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-8\">{\u00b6 33} Limited-purpose public figures are those who have become public figures for a specific range of issues.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A private person may become a limited-purpose public figure if he \u201cvoluntarily injects himself or is drawn into a particular public controversy.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> A court should decide whether a person is a limited-purpose public figure by examining the person\u2019s \u201cparticipation in the controversy from which the alleged defamation arose, and whether he has attained a general notoriety in the community by reason of that participation.\u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">{\u00b6 34} But \u201c[a] plaintiff does not become a public figure merely because the allegedly defamatory statements create a controversy; the controversy must have existed prior to the statements.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>{\u00b6 35} And the alleged defamers cannot, by provoking a response to an attack, make the subject of the statements \u2014 the one attacked \u2014 a public figure simply because the attacked person responds. \u201cClearly, those charged with defamation cannot, by their own conduct, create their own defense by making the claimant a public figure.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> That is, they can\u2019t say, \u201cIt started when he hit me back.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">{\u00b6 36} We hold that Fuchs and FDCA did not voluntarily inject themselves into a public controversy by placing the defensive advertisement in the Cincinnati Enquirer. Fuchs and FDCA were drawn into a public controversy that had been created, for the most part, by the I-Team reports. We hold that Fuchs and FDCA held the status of private-person plaintiffs for the entire series of broadcasts. This is not to say that in another case, with different facts, placing ads or replying to charges could not rise to a level to change a private person to a public figure. But not here.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">\n<em>IX. Summary Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">{\u00b6 37} Because the facts were undisputed \u2014 no one contests what was said\u2014 summary judgment was the proper vehicle to resolve this defamation case. To withstand the motions for summary judgment, Fuchs and FDCA, as private-person plaintiffs, had to show that statements were false and that the defendants did not act reasonably in attempting to discover the truth or falsity of the publications. For the summary judgment to be valid, the trial court had to hold \u2014 and this court must agree \u2014 that no reasonable jury could have so found. It did and we do.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">{\u00b6 38} Fuchs and FDCA alleged that Francis defamed them by stating: (1) \u201cThey [FDCA] billed my insurance for the same thing they billed me for. In my heart I honestly think that\u2019s a way to get double paid\u201d and (2) \u201cThis is not what happens accidentally. You don\u2019t have 125 accidents and that is just what the Better Business Bureau is aware of. It just doesn\u2019t seem right. And you know what\u2019s so funny is you think if there\u2019s that many people that complained, how many didn\u2019t.\u201d Benoit was alleged to have defamed Fuchs and FDCA by stating: (1) \u201cThey continued to bill me for monies that I did not owe\u201d and (2) \u201cThey don\u2019t care about the customer or the patient. They care about their money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b733-9\">{\u00b6 39} Statements of opinion are protected speech under the Ohio Constitution.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> For a statement to be defamatory, it must be a statement of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>and not of opinion.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Whether the alleged defamatory statement is fact or opinion is a question of law.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">\n<em>X. Fact or Opinion?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">{\u00b6 40} A totality-of-the-circumstances test determines whether a statement is fact or opinion.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In applying that test, a court should consider the specific language used, whether the statement is verifiable, the general context of the statement, and the broader context in which the statement appears.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Application of the test is fluid, and the weight to be given any one factor will necessarily vary depending on the circumstances of each case.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">(\u00b6 41} The meaning of an allegedly defamatory statement is the meaning a reasonable viewer would attach to the statement.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The question is whether a reasonable viewer would view the words used to be language that normally conveys factual information or merely hyperbole or opinion.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The court must consider whether the specific language is ambiguous or has a meaning that is readily ascertainable; and whether the purpose of the language is to elicit an emotional response.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">{\u00b6 42} Troubleshooting investigations in a newscast, such as the I-Team reports, are generally regarded as fact rather than opinion.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Therefore, the general context in which the alleged defamatory statements appeared in this case was factual.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>{\u00b6 43} Next, we must focus on the specific language used and the common meaning ascribed to the words by a reasonable viewer. A viewer is placed on notice by objective, cautionary terms, or \u201clanguage of apparency,\u201d that what is being said is the opinion of the speaker.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Terms such as \u201cin my opinion\u201d or \u201cI think\u201d are highly suggestive of opinion.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> That labeling strongly militates in favor of the statement as opinion.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In <em>Scott v. News-Herald, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held that the language \u201cknows in his heart\u201d created the undeniable conclusion that a statement was one of opinion.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\">{\u00b6 44} Under the <em>Scott </em>test, Francis\u2019s statement that \u201c[i]n my heart I honestly think that\u2019s a way to get double paid\u201d was protected opinion. Further, we hold that Francis\u2019s second statement was also protected opinion. The words \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t seem right\u201d and \u201cyou know what\u2019s so funny\u201d gave Francis\u2019s second statement an air of hyperbole and subjectivity. Francis\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]his is not what happens accidentally\u201d elicited an emotional response and was not readily verifiable. A reasonable viewer would have recognized that the statements were Francis\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">{\u00b6 45} Francis\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]hey billed my insurance company for the same thing they billed me for\u201d was readily verifiable. Francis had firsthand knowledge about the facts underlying the statement. A reasonable viewer would have believed the statement to be factual in nature. Therefore, the statement was not protected opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">{\u00b6 46} Turning to Benoit, we hold that her statements that \u201c[t]hey don\u2019t care about the customer or the patient,\u201d and that \u201c[t]hey care about their money\u201d were statements of protected opinion. The statements were made to elicit an emotional response, and they were not readily verifiable. A reasonable viewer would have believed that the statements reflected Benoit\u2019s opinion about her treatment by FDCA. No reasonable viewer would have believed that the statements were factual.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">{\u00b6 47} But Benoit\u2019s statement \u201cThey continued to bill me for monies that I did not owe\u201d was a statement of fact. It was readily verifiable, and a reasonable viewer would have believed that the statement was factual.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number><em>XI. Truth Is a Defense </em>\u2014 Francis <em>and Benoit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">{\u00b6 48} Considering the two statements of fact, we must decide whether the statements were true. Though in early common law truth was not necessarily a defense, truth is now a complete defense to defamation.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Were Francis\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]hey billed my insurance for the same thing they billed me for\u201d and Benoit\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]hey continued to bill me for monies that I did not owe\u201d true?</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">{\u00b6 49} Francis and his wife went to FDCA for a standard cleaning and checkup. Francis understood that preventive dental services were fully covered under his insurance policy. FDCA employees verified Francis\u2019s insurance. After Francis and his wife had been treated, Francis was told that he had to pay FDCA a $100 \u201cdeductible.\u201d Francis paid the $100 and later attempted to contact FDCA for an explanation about why he had been made to pay a deductible when his insurance did not require a deductible for preventive dental services. Francis was unsuccessful in contacting FDCA. Humana, Francis\u2019s insurance company, agreed that FDCA \u201cshould not be collecting a deductible when preventive services are not subject to a deductible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">{\u00b6 50} Subsequently, Francis received a bill from FDCA for $92. Francis also received an \u201cexplanation of benefits\u201d (\u201cEOB\u201d) from his insurer, which described the insurance coverage and stated that FDCA had billed the insurance company. Francis\u2019s insurer ultimately covered all but $30 of FDCA\u2019s charge for the dental services. Eventually, it was determined that FDCA had overcharged Francis and his insurer. Francis received a refund check from FDCA for $70. Francis\u2019s insurer also received a refund from FDCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">{\u00b6 51} We hold that Francis\u2019s statement was essentially true. We do not view the statement as an allegation of illegal behavior by FDCA. Rather, we view it as a straightforward statement from Francis about his experience at FDCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">{\u00b6 52} Benoit received a series of dental treatments from FDCA from August through December 2000. Soon after her treatments began, FDCA started to bill Benoit for more than she thought she owed for the services. Benoit had great difficulty contacting FDCA to resolve her billing problem. She began to receive threatening collection letters from FDCA. In July 2001, Benoit went to FDCA\u2019s corporate office and demanded answers to her questions about the bills. During a conference call between Benoit, her insurer, and FDCA, it was determined that Benoit\u2019s insurance claim had been processed incorrectly. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>FDCA promised that the billing problems would be solved and that Benoit would be removed from collection and sent a refund. Sometime later, Benoit received another collection letter. After an 18-month ordeal, Benoit finally received a refund check from FDCA, but the mark against her credit because of the erroneous collection was never removed from her credit record.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">{\u00b6 53} We hold that Benoit\u2019s statement that she was billed for money that she did not owe was essentially true. Thus we hold that the trial court was correct in granting summary judgment in favor of Francis and Benoit.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">\n<em>XII. Orr\u2019s Allegations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">{\u00b6 54} We now turn to Penelope Orr\u2019s statements that FDCA\u2019s dentists had not had the time to adequately sterilize equipment between patients and that the \u201conly thing\u201d separating a patient and \u201csomebody else\u2019s germ [was] a quick spray of Lysol and a paper towel.\u201d Orr\u2019s statements were based on information given to her by Stephanie Mays, a dental assistant in the FDCA office that Orr managed. Mays\u2019s job was to sterilize instruments between patients. Orr never personally saw Lysol sprayed on equipment or instruments that had not been properly sterilized and that had then been used on patients. Orr did not do any investigation on her own to verify Mays\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">{\u00b6 55} Assuming that there was a genuine issue of material fact about whether Orr\u2019s statements were true, we hold that Fuchs and FDCA failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that Orr did not act reasonably in attempting to discover the truth or falsity of the statements. There was no evidence to suggest that Orr had any reason to disbelieve Mays, whose job it was to sterilize instruments between patients. In addition, we point out that Orr\u2019s claims about inadequate sterilization were supported by other former FDCA employees and dentists. One former FDCA dentist stated, \u201cWhen the office got very busy[,] the instruments would not sit for the prescribed time to achieve sterilization.\u201d Another former FDCA dentist stated, \u201c[W]e utilized the Lysol spray and let it sit for ten minutes on a non-critical instrument * * * because there wasn\u2019t another one available, and so we had surface disinfection.\u201d We hold that the trial court was correct in granting Orr\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">\n<em>XIII. Limor, WCPO, Morford, and Fee</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">{\u00b6 56} Private-figure defamation plaintiffs must show by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant failed to act reasonably in attempting to discover the truth or falsity or defamatory character of the publication.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>{\u00b6 57} Thus, to decide whether the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Limor, WCPO, Morford, and Fee, the question is whether reasonable minds could have found by clear and convincing evidence that Limor and WCPO had failed to act reasonably in attempting to discover the truth or falsity of the publications.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The focus is on the state of the evidence as it related to Limor\u2019s efforts to discover the truth of the broadcast statements.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">{\u00b6 58} Limor began to investigate FDCA based on complaints she received from Francis and Benoit. She tried to contract Fuchs for his comments, but she encountered unanswered telephone calls and full voice-mail boxes. Limor contacted the State Dental Board, the AG, and the BBB. The AG and the BBB noted the unusual number of complaints against FDCA, most of which were complaints about billing. Limor discovered that FDCA was involved in more than 180 lawsuits in Hamilton County. She also interviewed dentists not affiliated with FDCA about dental billing practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">{\u00b6 59} At Fuchs\u2019s request, Limor obtained patient releases in an attempt to get patient records to confirm the complaints \u2014 but was stonewalled by Fuchs. Limor repeatedly tried to interview Fuchs. In the time the reports aired, Limor and WCPO received over 200 responses from former FDCA patients and employees. As Limor stated in her deposition, \u201cWhen you look at the general context of the hundreds of people who contacted us, in addition to the hundreds involved either in lawsuits or with the Better Business Bureau * * * anything any one person said was multiple-sourced and backed up usually dozens of times * * * over. So every one person you saw on any of those stories has at least dozens of people standing behind him or her, saying the exact same thing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">{\u00b6 60} Fuchs and FDCA allege that WCPO and Limor defamed them by broadcasting claims that they had an improper relationship with the State Dental Board. The record shows that the Ohio State Dental Inspector had been on vacation twice with Fuchs. FDCA\u2019s former employees told Limor that Fuchs always seemed to know when inspections were imminent. Limor had no reason to doubt the claims, which she heard from multiple unconnected sources. Moreover, WCPO\u2019s broadcasts included statements by the board denying the allegations of an improper relationship with Fuchs.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">{\u00b6 61} Fuchs and FDCA argue that Limor should have contacted dental insurance companies to \u201ceducate herself\u2019 about dental billing practices. But Fuchs himself prevented just such an investigation by refusing to turn over the patient records for which Limor had obtained releases.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>{\u00b6 62} Fuchs and FDCA also argue that they were defamed in the March 26, 2003 broadcast by WCPO\u2019s use of stand-alone graphics informing viewers about the original complaints, which included \u201cdouble billing.\u201d The \u201cdouble billing\u201d graphic must be construed within the content of the entire broadcast to determine any defamatory effect.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> We have already determined that the statements by Francis and Benoit about the billing issues were essentially true. Therefore, WCPO was not liable for publishing them. Further, the gist or sting of the broadcasts was the poor customer service provided by FDCA and the cavalier attitude of FDCA toward its patients, not \u201cdouble billing.\u201d And even though Fuchs refused to speak to Limor, she attempted to tell Fuchs\u2019s side of the story by reading portions of his letter during the broadcasts.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">{\u00b6 63} Whether the claims were in fact true is not the issue \u2014 it is whether reasonable minds could find by clear and convincing evidence <em>that she did not act reasonably. </em>We are not sure what more she could have done, given the intransigence she encountered.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">{\u00b6 64} We hold that no reasonable minds could have found with convincing clarity that Limor and WCPO had failed to act reasonably in attempting to discover the publications\u2019 truth or falsity. Thus, we hold that the trial court was correct in granting summary judgment for Limor, WCPO, Morford, and Fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">\n<em>XIV. There Is No Issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">{\u00b6 65} The record contains nothing that raises a genuine issue of material fact. Having determined that Fuchs and FDCA have no case against any defendant, we overrule the assignment of error and affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b739-9\">Gorman, P.J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b739-10\">Judge Rupert A.
