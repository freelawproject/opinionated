Garrard, appeals from the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, whereby the trial court convicted appellant of failure to comply with an order or signal of a police officer, a third-degree felony, pursuant to a bench trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-13\">{\u00b6 2} On October 3, 2005, appellant was indicted on one count of (1) rape, a first-degree felony, in violation of R.C. 2907.02; (2) felonious assault, a second-degree felony, in violation of R.C. 2903.11; and (3) failure to comply with an order or signal of a police officer (\u201cfleeing\u201d), in violation of R.C. 2921.331. Ordinarily, under R.C. 2921.331, fleeing is a first-degree misdemeanor; however, plaintiff<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>appellee, the state of Ohio, indicted the fleeing as a third-degree felony, pursuant to R.C. 2921.331(C)(5)(a)(ii), alleging that, in fleeing, appellant \u201ccaused a substantial risk of serious physical harm to persons or property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant pleaded not guilty to the above charges. He invoked his right to a jury trial on the rape and felonious-assault charges, but waived his right to a jury trial on the fleeing charge. Thus, the parties tried the fleeing charge before the trial court. Ultimately, the jury found appellant not guilty of rape and felonious assault, and such charges are not the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">{\u00b6 4} As for the fleeing charge, Columbus Police Detective James Shockey testified to the following on behalf of appellee. On September 12, 2005, Detective Shockey interviewed appellant about the above-noted rape and related offenses, and the officer informed appellant that charges might be filed against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">{\u00b6 5} Thereafter, on September 23, 2005, Detective Shockey sought to execute an arrest warrant on appellant and his codefendant, Christina Robinson. That day, Detective Shockey worked with Detectives William Brubaker and Timothy Elkins. The detectives were using an unmarked vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">{\u00b6 6} Initially, Detective Shockey arrested Robinson at an apartment on Brookway. While making the arrest, Detective Shockey saw the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKE\">[A] vehicle that was traveling from Livingston Avenue down towards the apartment. About midway * * * it had stopped, and unknown people from the neighborhood had stopped and were talking to the driver and were pointing down towards our direction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">After that brief conversation, the car continued this way. As it continued towards Brookway, [Robinson] told us that was [appellant] coming.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\">As the car continued, rather than stopping here in the parking lot, it continued around this bend. As it continued, Detective Elkins got into our plain car and began to exit the parking lot and went in the direction of where the car was.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">{\u00b6 7} Although Detective Shockey remained at the scene of Robinson\u2019s arrest, the detective did notice that a black male was driving the car that Detective Elkins followed. Later, Detective Elkins returned to the scene of Robinson\u2019s arrest, and he indicated that when he reached the car he was following, no one was in the car. Thus, the detectives decided to search for appellant at his mother\u2019s apartment. A police cruiser arrived to transport Robinson to police headquarters, and the detectives drove to appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">{\u00b6 8} Upon reaching appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s apartment, Detective Shockey saw that the car they had seen driving on Brookway had passed them. The detectives, with Detective Shockey driving, followed the car. Because they were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>in an unmarked car, the detectives sought assistance by stating over the police radio that they had a wanted felon in front of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">{\u00b6 9} Two police cruisers began following appellant. The cruisers\u2019 red and blue beacons were activated, and one cruiser got behind appellant\u2019s vehicle. Appellant did not stop at first, but after driving through several streets, appellant eventually stopped, and police officers apprehended him. After the apprehension, some of appellant\u2019s family members \u201cwere coming out of a northwestern corner house. * * * It was just 25, 30 feet from there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">{\u00b6 10} Columbus Police Officer Michael Bruce testified to the following on appellee\u2019s behalf. On September 23, 2005, Officer Bruce was on patrol with Officer Samuel Hazlerig. Officer Bruce was driving the cruiser, and the officer responded to the detectives\u2019 request for assistance in pursuing appellant. When Officer Bruce was on Mt. Vernon Avenue, he discovered appellant driving in his car. Officer Bruce eventually activated the cruiser\u2019s emergency lights and sirens to pursue appellant. At that point, appellant went down to Garfield Avenue, continued on Garfield to Buckingham, made a westbound turn on Buckingham, crossed over Buckingham, and then pulled to the north side of Buckingham. The officers then \u201cactually made contact with [appellant] and took him into custody.\u201d Appellant was the only person in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">{\u00b6 11} Officer Bruce also testified that it was about 8:00 p.m. when the pursuit occurred. Officer Bruce further noted that the pursuit took place in an area mixed with residences and businesses. Officer Bruce specifically noted that Buckingham was a residential street. Additionally, Officer Bruce testified that 150 seconds had lapsed between his receiving the detectives\u2019 request for assistance and appellant\u2019s apprehension.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">{\u00b6 12} On cross-examination, appellant\u2019s trial counsel asked Officer Bruce whether appellant actually knew that Officer Bruce had had his lights on. Officer Bruce stated that he could not testify as to what appellant knew. Officer Bruce also testified on cross-examination that during the initial part of his pursuing appellant, he knew that they were attempting to catch the vehicle, and he had to use a substantial amount of acceleration to catch it while he had the lights and sirens going. Officer Bruce further stated that appellant had made a rapid deceleration on Buckingham and that once they were close enough to the vehicle, appellant \u201ccurbed it, which is not what a normal person would do when they arrive at their destination.\u201d Officer Bruce then testified on cross-examination that he did not recall whether appellant had a safe place to pull over prior to the location on Buckingham where appellant did stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">{\u00b6 13} Next, Detective Elkins testified to the following on appellee\u2019s behalf. On September 23, 2005, Detective Elkins accompanied Detective Shockey during the attempts to serve warrants on appellant and Robinson. The detectives found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Robinson sitting in a vehicle in a parking lot, and she stated that appellant would be right back. Later, Robinson stated: \u201c[T]here he is right now.\u201d At that time, a car came northbound on Brookway and stopped. Appellant was driving the car and looked at the detectives when he stopped. A woman walked over to the car and started speaking to appellant, and appellant drove away on Brookway.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">{\u00b6 14} Detective Elkins attempted to follow appellant, but could not find him. Detective Elkins started looking in the parking lots around the area, and he found appellant\u2019s ear near Rand Avenue. \u201cAbout the same time [Detective Elkins] * * * saw a male black. [Detective Elkins] [did not] know if it was [appellant] * * *, but [Detective Elkins] saw a male black running southbound from that area.\u201d Detective Elkins tried to catch up to the man, but was unable to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">{\u00b6 15} Detective Elkins then returned to the other detectives, and they drove to appellant\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house to see whether they could find him. Upon arriving at appellant\u2019s grandmother\u2019s house, the detectives saw appellant drive right past them. Next:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-7\">[The detectives] called for patrol officers to assist. [Appellant] left at a high rate of speed, going down * * * Mt. Vernon. [Appellant was] just flying down Mt. Vernon. And the patrol officers happened to be in the area, and they got behind him and * * * they used their lights and sirens trying to get him to stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-8\">[Appellant] continued fleeing up some side streets over towards where the little side streets dead end.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">{\u00b6 16} Detective Elkins indicated at trial that the first time police were behind appellant with lights and sirens was on Mt. Vernon Avenue, and the street where appellant stopped may have been Buckingham. Detective Elkins also testified that eventually, they had cruisers \u201call over the place\u201d pursuing appellant. Detective Elkins then testified that appellant ultimately stopped his car, and police apprehended him. Detective Elkins reiterated that during the pursuit, appellant was driving fast and that he did not \u201cknow what the rate of speed was.\u201d He said, \u201cI\u2019m sure those streets are 25. It was probably double that. That\u2019s just a guess.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">{\u00b6 17} On cross-examination, Detective Elkins confirmed that the detectives\u2019 vehicle did not have lights and sirens. Detective Elkins also testified that due to his line of vision, he could not tell how far behind appellant the police cruisers were during the pursuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">{\u00b6 18} Next, Gregory Young testified to the following on appellee\u2019s behalf. Young and appellant had been previously incarcerated at the same time in the Franklin County jail. Young is serving a 240-month sentence on a federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>cocaine conviction. Appellant told Young about his fleeing from law enforcement. Specifically, appellant told Young that \u201c[h]e didn\u2019t have any choice. He had a couple rocks of cocaine. A person in his car had * * * crack and a pistol. And he had some alcohol in his car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">{\u00b6 19} Martin Kiggans testified to the following on appellee\u2019s behalf. Kiggans and appellant had also previously been incarcerated at the same time in the Franklin County jail. Appellant told Kiggans \u201cabout the incident when he fled in * * * a car.\u201d Kiggans has a prior theft conviction, and he is currently incarcerated on felony convictions pertaining to writing false prescriptions. However, Kiggans hopes to serve the rest of his sentence by participating in a drug-treatment program. On cross-examination, Kiggans confirmed that he was asking appellee to help get him out of prison so that he could start the drug-treatment program.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">{\u00b6 20} Subsequently, appellee rested its case, and appellant\u2019s trial counsel asked the trial court to dismiss the fleeing charge pursuant to Crim.R. 29. The trial court denied the motion and stated: \u201cI\u2019m still hovering with that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">{\u00b6 21} Officer Hazlerig testified to the following on appellee\u2019s behalf. On September 23, 2005, Officer Hazlerig was working with Officer Bruce; Officer Hazlerig was a passenger in Officer Bruce\u2019s cruiser. That day, the officers responded to the detectives\u2019 request for assistance in pursuing appellant. The officers saw appellant on Mt. Vernon Avenue, and the car turned northbound onto Garfield Avenue. The officers drove to Garfield Avenue, initiated their lights and sirens, and followed the car. Appellant proceeded northbound on Garfield to Buckingham. Once appellant got to Buckingham, he turned left and did not pull over. They continued westbound, and crossed St. Clair. Eventually, after crossing St. Clair, appellant pulled over and was apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">{\u00b6 22} Appellant rested his case. After the jury found appellant not guilty of rape and felonious assault, the trial court stated that it had not made a decision on the fleeing charge. The trial court stated: \u201cI need to review that and I\u2019ll tell you on Tuesday,\u201d May 30, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">{\u00b6 23} On Tuesday, May 30, 2006, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-10\">At this time the court, having listened to all of the evidence throughout the course of the trial, finds [appellant] guilty of failure to comply with an order or signal of a police officer, which is a felony three.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">Before rendering its verdict on the fleeing charge, the trial court had not entertained closing argument from appellant\u2019s trial counsel, and appellant\u2019s trial counsel did not object to the trial court\u2019s failure to provide an opportunity for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>closing argument on the fleeing charge. The trial court then sentenced appellant to three years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">{\u00b6 24} Appellant appeals, raising three assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">First Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">The trial court erred by failing to accord defendant-appellant his constitutional right to make closing argument by summarily rendering its verdict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">Second Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-9\">The trial court erred in entering judgment against the defendant because there was insufficient evidence to support the conviction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-10\">Third Assignment of Error</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-11\">The trial court erred by entering judgment against defendant-appellant because such judgment is contrary to the weight of the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">{\u00b6 25} We begin with appellant\u2019s second assignment of error. In his second assignment of error, appellant contends that his fleeing conviction is based on insufficient evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-13\">{\u00b6 26} Sufficiency of the evidence is a legal standard that tests whether the evidence introduced at trial is legally sufficient to support a verdict. <em>State v. Thompkins </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 380, 386, 678 N.E.2d 541. We examine the evidence in the light most favorable to the state and conclude whether any rational trier of fact could have found that the state had proved beyond a reasonable doubt the essential elements of the crime. <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus, following <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560; <em>State v. Yarbrough, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 227, 2002-Ohio-2126, 767 N.E.2d 216, at \u00b6 78. We will not disturb the verdict unless we determine that reasonable minds could not arrive at the conclusion reached by the trier of fact. <em>Jenks, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 273, 574 N.E.2d 492. In determining whether a conviction is based on sufficient evidence, we do not assess whether the evidence is to be believed, but whether, if believed, the evidence against a defendant would support a conviction. See <em>Jenks, </em>paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>Yarbrough </em>at \u00b6 79 (noting that courts do not evaluate witness credibility when reviewing a sufficiency-of-the-evidence claim); <em>State v. Lockhart </em>(Aug. 7, 2001), Franklin App. No. 00AP-1138, 2001 WL 881277.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-14\">{\u00b6 27} As noted above, appellee was charged with fleeing, pursuant to R.C. 2921.331, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-15\">(B) No person shall operate a motor vehicle so as willfully to elude or flee a police officer after receiving a visible or audible signal from a police officer to bring the person\u2019s motor vehicle to a stop.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>{\u00b6 28} In challenging his fleeing conviction, appellant first contends that the evidence failed to establish that he actually received a visible or audible signal to stop. A trier of fact may infer from the evidence whether a defendant was aware of a police officer\u2019s signal to stop. <em>State v. Hill, </em>Hamilton App. No. C-030678, 2004-Ohio-2275, 2004 WL 986426, at \u00b6 12-13. Here, Officer Bruce testified that upon responding to the detectives\u2019 request for assistance and after discovering appellant driving, he activated the red and blue beacons on his police cruiser. Officer Hazlerig was riding with Officer Bruce and confirmed Officer Bruce\u2019s use of the emergency beacons on the police cruiser. \u201cA plain reading of [R.C. 2921.331(B) ] shows that a signal from an officer need not be verbal; the blue lights and siren qualify as an applicable signal to stop.\u201d <em>State v. Wooden </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 23, 26, 619 N.E.2d 1132; see, also, <em>State v. Carter, </em>Montgomery App. No. 19833, 2004-Ohio-454, 2004 WL 225309, at \u00b6 21 (holding that \u201c[i]t is widely recognized that the use of the red and blue flashing lights on top of a police cruiser is a signal to stop, which would be properly interpreted as a command\u201d). Officers Hazlerig and Bruce also verified that Officer Bruce had activated an accompanying siren while using the red and blue beacons.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">{\u00b6 29} Although Officers Bruce and Hazlerig did not indicate how close they were to appellant\u2019s car when Officer Bruce activated the lights and siren on the police cruiser, Officer Hazlerig testified that they had followed appellant\u2019s car, and Detective Elkins testified that a police cruiser using lights and sirens got behind appellant\u2019s car. Such testimony, in combination with Officer Bruce\u2019s testimony about seeing appellant\u2019s actions during the pursuit, establish that Officers Bruce and Hazlerig were sufficiently near appellant\u2019s vehicle during the pursuit to see appellant\u2019s car; correspondingly, this evidence established that appellant could see the police cruiser with its activated lights and siren. Accordingly, we conclude that the above circumstances established that appellant had received a police officer\u2019s visible and audible signals to stop and that appellant was thus aware of the pursuit by police.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">{\u00b6 30} Next, appellant contends that the evidence failed to establish that appellant willfully eluded the police. Although \u201cwillfully\u201d as used in R.C. 2921.331(B) is not a mental state identified in R.C. 2901.22, the statute governing mental states, the term equates with the mental state of \u201cpurposely\u201d outlined in R.C. 2901.22. <em>Hill </em>at \u00b6 8. Under R.C. 2901.22:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-7\">(A) A person acts purposely when it is his specific intention to cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to accomplish thereby, it is his specific intention to engage in conduct of that nature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">{\u00b6 31} Proof of intent may be derived from circumstantial evidence, as direct evidence will seldom be available. <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>168, 555 N.E.2d 293; <em>State v. Tarver, </em>Summit App. No. 22057, 2004-Ohio-6748, 2004 WL 2893652, at \u00b6 10. Circumstantial evidence is the \u201cproof of facts by direct evidence from which the trier of fact may infer or derive by reasoning other facts in accordance with the common experience of mankind.\u201d <em>State v. Bentz </em>(1981), 2 Ohio App.3d 352, 355, 2 OBR 408, 442 N.E.2d 90, fn. 6, citing 1 Ohio Jury Instructions (1968), Section 5.10(d). Circumstantial evidence has probative value equal to direct evidence. <em>State v. Nicely </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 147, 151, 529 N.E.2d 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">{\u00b6 32} Here, the testimony established that after Officer Bruce activated the lights and siren on the cruiser and after police proceeded to follow appellant, appellant did not stop but continued to speed and prolong the police pursuit until he abruptly stopped on Buckingham. We may infer that appellant willfully eluded the police from such conduct, given that \u201c \u2018[i]t is a fundamental principle that a person is presumed to intend the natural, reasonable and probable consequences of his voluntary acts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lott, </em>51 Ohio St.3d at 168, 555 N.E.2d 293, quoting <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 35, 39, 10 O.O.3d 78, 381 N.E.2d 637. We may also infer that appellant was willfully fleeing the police, given that the police had previously informed appellant that charges might be filed against him in regards to the above-noted rape and given appellant\u2019s own admissions to Young and Kiggans.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">{\u00b6 33} Next, appellant contends that the evidence failed to establish the fleeing as a third-degree felony. As noted above, appellee indicted the fleeing as a third-degree felony, pursuant to R.C. 2921.331(C)(5)(a)(ii), alleging that, in fleeing, appellant \u201ccaused a substantial risk of serious physical harm to persons or property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">{\u00b6 34} R.C. 2901.01(A)(8) defines \u201csubstantial risk\u201d as \u201ca strong possibility, as contrasted with a remote or significant possibility, that a certain result may occur or that certain circumstances may exist.\u201d Under R.C. 2901.01(A)(6), \u201cserious physical harm to property\u201d means any physical harm to property that does either of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">(a) Results in substantial loss to the value of the property or requires a substantial amount of time, effort, or money to repair or replace;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">(b) Temporarily prevents the use or enjoyment of the property or substantially interferes with its use or enjoyment for an extended period of time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">{\u00b6 35} Under R.C. 2901.01(A)(5), \u201cserious physical harm to persons\u201d means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-11\">(a) Any mental illness or condition of such gravity as would normally require hospitalization or prolonged psychiatric treatment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-12\">(b) Any physical harm that carries a substantial risk of death;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>(c) Any physical harm that involves some permanent incapacity, whether partial or total, or that involves some temporary, substantial incapacity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">(d) Any physical harm that involves some permanent disfigurement or that involves some temporary, serious disfigurement;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">(e) Any physical harm that involves acute pain of such duration as to result in substantial suffering or that involves any degree of prolonged or intractable pain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">(\u00b6 36} In <em>State v. Walby </em>(Mar. 6, 1992), Sandusky App. No. S-91-1, 1992 WL 42939, a defendant was charged with fleeing with the \u201csubstantial risk of serious physical harm to persons or property\u201d enhancement. The officer involved in the pursuit testified that \u201che was traveling between eighty-five to ninety miles per hour but was not gaining on the [defendant\u2019s] car and briefly lost sight of it a few times.\u201d The court affirmed the conviction and concluded that \u201cthere was * * * probative evidence that [the defendant] caused a substantial risk of serious physical harm to persons or property by fleeing * * * at such a high speed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">{\u00b6 37} Here, Officer Bruce testified that after initiating his lights and siren, he had to use a substantial amount of acceleration during the pursuit. Detective Elkins also reiterated that during the pursuit, appellant was driving fast and probably double the speed limit, which Detective Elkins presumed was 25 m.p.h. Officer Bruce testified that the area of the pursuit contained residences and businesses. Detective Shockey also confirmed that Buckingham, the final location of the pursuit, contained residences, given his testimony that after police apprehended appellant, some of appellant\u2019s family members came \u201cout of a northwestern corner house\u201d that \u201cwas just 25, 30 feet\u201d from the apprehension location. Thus, as in <em>Walby, </em>appellant created a substantial risk of physical harm to persons or property by fleeing at a high rate of speed through an area mixed with residences and businesses. Indeed, we may also consider that appellant created a substantial risk of physical harm to Officers Bruce and Hazlerig, the officers involved in pursuing appellant as he sped through a mixed commercial/residential area. See <em>State v. Barnett, </em>Tuscarawas App. No. 2004 AP 03 0019, 2005-Ohio-255, 2005 WL 135897, at \u00b6 19 (examining a fleeing conviction with the \u201csubstantial risk of serious physical harm to persons or property\u201d enhancement and noting that a trier of fact may consider the substantial risk to the officers pursuing the fleeing defendant); <em>State v. Hines </em>(Dec. 11, 1998), Ashtabula App. No. 97-A-0075, 1998 WL 964544 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">{\u00b6 38} For these reasons, we conclude that sufficient evidence supported appellant\u2019s underlying conviction for fleeing under R.C. 2921.331(B) and the third-degree felony enhancement in R.C. 2921.331(C)(5)(a)(ii).

In his third assignment of error, appellant argues that his fleeing conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">{\u00b6 40} In determining whether a verdict is against the manifest of the evidence, we sit as a \u201c \u2018thirteenth juror.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541. Thus, we review the entire record, weigh the evidence and all reasonable inferences, and consider the credibility of witnesses. Id. Additionally, we determine \u201cwhether in resolving conflicts in the evidence, the [trier of fact] clearly lost its way and created such a manifest miscarriage of justice that the conviction must be reversed and a new trial ordered.\u201d Id., quoting <em>State v. Martin </em>(1983), 20 Ohio App.3d 172, 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717. We reverse a conviction on manifest-weight grounds for only the most \u201c \u2018exceptional case in which the evidence weighs heavily against the conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Thompkins, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 387, 678 N.E.2d 541, quoting <em>Martin, </em>20 Ohio App.3d at 175, 20 OBR 215, 485 N.E.2d 717. Moreover, \u201c \u2018it is inappropriate for a reviewing court to interfere with factual findings of the trier of fact * * * unless the reviewing court finds that a reasonable juror could not find the testimony of the witness to be credible.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-11, 2002-Ohio-5345, 2002 WL 31194302, at \u00b6 10, quoting <em>State v. Long </em>(Feb. 6, 1997), Franklin App. No. 96APA04-511, 1997 WL 52911.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">{\u00b6 41} First, appellant asserts that his \u201cfleeing\u201d conviction is against the manifest weight of the evidence because there \u201cwere only 150 seconds from the time of the very first call for cruisers and the actual apprehension of [appellant]\u201d and because Officer Bruce did not activate the cruiser\u2019s lights and siren \u201cuntil [appellant] was, at a maximum, 2]\u00bf blocks from where he stopped.\u201d However, such circumstances do not belie the above evidence that nonetheless demonstrated that after Officer Bruce activated the lights and siren, appellant did not stop but continued to speed. We further reject appellant\u2019s above arguments because the explicit language of R.C. 2921.331(B) does not make the fleeing dependent on duration or distance. See <em>State ex rel. Burrows v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 78, 81, 676 N.E.2d 519 (recognizing that we apply unambiguous statutes \u201caccording to the plain meaning of the words used\u201d); see, also, <em>State v. Hairston, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 308, 2004-Ohio-969, 804 N.E.2d 471, at \u00b6 12 (noting that the legislature \u201cshould be held to mean what it has plainly expressed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">{\u00b6 42} We note Officer Bruce\u2019s testimony that he had activated his lights and siren on Mt. Vernon Avenue, while Officer Hazlerig testified that Officer Bruce had activated the lights and siren on Garfield Avenue. However, we find this discrepancy immaterial because both officers unequivocally stated that after Officer Bruce activated the lights and siren, appellant did not stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>{\u00b6 43} We further note that testimony about appellant\u2019s admissions to fleeing came from witnesses with prior felony convictions and that under Evid.R. 609, such convictions impeach the witnesses\u2019 credibility. However, such circumstances do not make appellant\u2019s conviction against the manifest weight of the evidence, given the unequivocal testimony from the detectives and police officers that appellant failed to stop on order of Officer Bruce\u2019s signals to stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">{\u00b6 44} Next, appellant argues that the R.C. 2921.331(C)(5)(a)(ii) \u201csubstantial risk of serious physical harm to persons or property\u201d enhancement is against the manifest weight of the evidence because the record provides only estimates of appellant\u2019s speed. However, estimates of speed are sufficient to establish the \u201csubstantial risk of serious physical harm to persons or property\u201d enhancement. See <em>Barnett, </em>2005-Ohio-255, 2005 WL 135897, at \u00b6 18-19; <em>Hines, </em>Ashtabula App. No. 97-A-0075, 1998 WL 964544.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">{\u00b6 45} Last, appellant contends that the R.C. 2921.331(C)(5)(a)(ii) \u201csubstantial risk\u201d enhancement is against the manifest weight of the evidence because the record failed to establish any \u201cremotely close calls or particular places or incidents in which [appellant\u2019s] speed did anything more than ever-so-slightly increase the averages that apply to whether serious harm is possible.\u201d However, it is irrelevant to the enhancement whether appellant actually caused or almost caused serious physical harm to persons or property. See <em>State v. Love, </em>Summit App. No. 21654, 2004-Ohio-1422, 2004 WL 573895, at \u00b6 19 (reviewing a fleeing conviction enhanced under R.C. 2921.331(C)(5)(a)(ii) and stating that \u201c[a] jury could * * * reasonably find that the failure of [a defendant] to engage in a \u2018near collision\u2019 speaks to nothing more than [the defendant\u2019s] good luck and the careful driving on the part of other motorists on the road; such an assertion is irrelevant to our analysis because it fails to speak to the level of risk that [the defendant\u2019s] reckless driving created\u201d); see, also, <em>State v. Semenchuk </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 30, 47, 701 N.E.2d 19 (reviewing an enhanced fleeing conviction and concluding that a defendant\u2019s failure to actually cause harm is of \u201cno consequence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">{\u00b6 46} For these reasons, we conclude that appellant\u2019s conviction is not against the manifest weight of the evidence. Accordingly, we overrule appellant\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">{\u00b6 47} Finally, we address appellant\u2019s first assignment of error. In it, appellant contends that we must reverse his conviction because the trial court failed to provide appellant an opportunity for closing argument on the charge. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">{\u00b6 48} The United States Supreme Court has held that the Sixth Amendment \u201cright to the assistance of counsel has * * * been given a meaning that ensures to the defense in a criminal trial the opportunity to participate fully and fairly in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>the adversary factfinding process\u201d and that \u201cclosing argument for the defense is a basic element of the adversary factfinding process in a criminal trial. Accordingly, it has universally been held that counsel for the defense has a right to make a closing summation to the jury, no matter how strong the case for the prosecution may appear to the presiding judge.\u201d <em>Herring v. New York </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 853, 857-858, 95 S.Ct. 2550, 45 L.Ed.2d 593. Likewise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">The issue has been considered less often in the context of a so-called bench trial. But the overwhelming weight of authority, in both federal and state courts, holds that a total denial of the opportunity for final argument in a nonjury criminal trial is a denial of the basic right of the accused to make his defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Id. at 858-859, 95 S.Ct. 2550, 45 L.Ed.2d 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">{\u00b6 49} In holding as such, the United States Supreme Court recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">Some cases may appear to the trial judge to be simple \u2014 open and shut \u2014 at the close of the evidence. And surely in many such cases a closing argument will * * * be \u201clikely to leave (a) judge just where it found him.\u201d But just as surely, there will be cases where closing argument may correct a premature misjudgment and avoid an otherwise erroneous verdict. And there is no certain way for a trial judge to identify accurately which cases these will be, until the judge has heard the closing summation of counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">(Footnotes omitted.) Id. at 863, 95 S.Ct. 2550, 45 L.Ed.2d 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">{\u00b6 50} Thus, in <em>Herring, </em>the United States Supreme Court reversed a defendant\u2019s conviction because a trial court had denied the defendant the opportunity to make a closing argument pursuant to a New York statute that conferred such power upon a judge in a nonjury criminal trial. Id. at 854, 856, 864-865, 95 S.Ct. 2550, 45 L.Ed.2d 593. In reversing the conviction, the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-11\">There is no way to know whether * * * arguments in summation might have affected the ultimate judgment in this case. The credibility assessment was solely for the trier of fact. But before that determination was made, the [defendant], through counsel, had a right to be heard in summation of the evidence from the point of view most favorable to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-12\">(Footnote omitted.) Id. at 864, 95 S.Ct. 2550, 45 L.Ed.2d 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-13\">{\u00b6 51} Accordingly, we have held that unless there is a relinquishment of the right to a closing argument, the trial court\u2019s failure to allow closing argument constitutes reversible error. <em>Columbus v. Woodrick </em>(1976), 48 Ohio App.2d 274, 277-278, 2 O.O.3d 232, 357 N.E.2d 58; <em>Columbus v. Stennett </em>(1980), 70 Ohio App.2d 123, 126-127, 24 O.O.3d 163, 434 N.E.2d 1376; <em>State v. Carroll </em>(June 16, 1977), Franklin App. No. 77AP-8, 1977 WL 200232. Further, that relinquishment of the right to closing argument must be express, intentional, and voluntary. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number><em>Carroll; </em>see, also, <em>State v. Jack, </em>156 Ohio App.3d 260, 2004-Ohio-775, 805 N.E.2d 187, at \u00b6 23 (recognizing that \u201cthe Tenth and Fifth Districts have held that in order for a [relinquishment] of the right [to a closing argument] to be effective, silence is not sufficient \u2014 the record must affirmatively show that the right was intentionally relinquished\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">{\u00b6 52} Thus, in <em>Woodrick, </em>we automatically reversed a defendant\u2019s conviction because the trial court had failed to provide an opportunity for closing argument. Id. at 277-278, 2 O.O.3d 232, 357 N.E.2d 58. We noted that although \u201ccounsel did not request the right to argue at the close of trial,\u201d the record failed to establish a relinquishment of the right to make a closing argument. Id. at 277, 2 O.O.3d 232, 357 N.E.2d 58. In automatically reversing the defendant\u2019s conviction, we stated that \u201cthe <em>Herring </em>case is controlling.\u201d Id. at 277, 2 O.O.3d 232, 357 N.E.2d 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">{\u00b6 53} Structural error is a type of error that is \u201cper se cause for reversal.\u201d <em>State v. Fisher, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 127, 2003-Ohio-2761, 789 N.E.2d 222, at \u00b6 9. Such is the case because a structural error \u201c \u2018affect[s] the framework within which the trial proceeds, rather than simply [being] an error in the trial process itself.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Arizona v. Fulminante </em>(1991), 499 U.S. 279, 309, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302. Likewise, the consequences of structural error \u201care necessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate.\u201d <em>Sullivan v. Louisiana </em>(1993), 508 U.S. 275, 281-282, 113 S.Ct. 2078, 124 L.Ed.2d 182. In this regard, under the dictates of <em>Fisher, Fulminante, </em>and <em>Sullivan, </em>a trial court\u2019s failure to allow closing argument absent an express, intentional, and voluntary relinquishment constitutes structural error, given our recognition in <em>Woodrick, Stennett, </em>and <em>Carroll </em>that such a failure constitutes reversible error, and given that pursuant to <em>Herring, </em>the trial court\u2019s failure to allow closing argument has \u201cunquantifiable and indeterminate\u201d consequences.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">{\u00b6 54} Here, the trial court failed to provide appellant an opportunity for closing argument on the charge of fleeing, and although neither appellant nor his trial counsel requested closing argument, the record established no express, voluntary, and intentional relinquishment of such a closing argument. See <em>Woodrick, </em>48 Ohio App.2d at 277-278, 2 O.O.3d 232, 357 N.E.2d 58; <em>Stennett, </em>70 Ohio App.2d at 126-127, 24 O.O.3d 163, 434 N.E.2d 1376; <em>Carroll. </em>Nonetheless, appellee urges us to apply the plain-error doctrine here because appellant\u2019s trial counsel did not object to the trial court\u2019s failure to provide an opportunity for closing argument on the charge of fleeing.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">{\u00b6 55} According to the plain-error doctrine, enunciated in Crim.R. 52(B), \u201c[p]lain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the court.\u201d \u201cBy its very terms, the rule places three limitations on a reviewing court\u2019s decision to correct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>an error despite the absence of a timely objection at trial.\u201d <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240. Under the plain-error standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKp\">First, there must be an error, <em>ie., </em>a deviation from a legal rule. * * * <em>United States v.

Second, the error must be plain. To be \u201cplain\u201d within the meaning of Crim.R. 52(B), an error must be an \u201cobvious\u201d defect in the trial proceedings. * * * [S]ee, also, <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. at 1777, 123 L.Ed.2d at 519 (a plain error under Fed.R.Crim.P. 52[b] is \u201c \u2018clear\u2019 or, equivalently, \u2018obvious\u2019 \u201d under current law). Third, the error must have affected \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d We have interpreted this aspect of the rule to mean that the trial court\u2019s error must have affected the outcome of the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-5\"><em>Barnes, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">{\u00b6 56} Since <em>Herring, Woodrick, Stennett, </em>and <em>Carroll, </em>the United States Supreme Court has suggested that structural error does not preclude the application of the plain-error doctrine. See <em>Johnson v. United States </em>(1997), 520 U.S. 461, 468-470, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718. Thus, in <em>State v. Perry, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 118, 2004-Ohio-297, 802 N.E.2d 643, at \u00b6 23, the Ohio Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">[B]oth this court and the United States Supreme Court have cautioned against applying a structural-error analysis where * * * the case would be otherwise governed by Crim.R. 52(B) [the plain error doctrine] because the defendant did not raise the error in the trial court. * * * This caution is born of sound policy. For to hold that an error is structural even when the defendant does not bring the error to the attention of the trial court would be to <em>encourage </em>defendants to remain silent at trial only later to raise the error on appeal where the conviction would be automatically reversed. We believe that our holdings should foster rather than thwart judicial economy by providing incentives (and not disincentives) for the defendant to raise all errors in the trial court \u2014 where, in many cases, such errors can be easily corrected.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aue\">(Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">{\u00b6 57} Accordingly, we have held that structural error \u201cdoes not supply an automatic finding of plain error for unpreserved errors.\u201d <em>State v. Brooks, </em>Franklin App. No. 06AP-74, 2006-Ohio-5784, 2006 WL 3112113, at \u00b6 22, citing <em>State v. Rector, </em>Carroll App. No. 01 AP 758, 2003-Ohio-5438, 2003 WL 22331979 (noting that, in <em>Johnson, </em>the United States Supreme Court recognized that structural error can be subject to the plain-error doctrine).</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">{\u00b6 58} Thus, although <em>Herring, Woodrick, Stennett, </em>and <em>Carroll </em>provide that structural, and therefore reversible, error stems from a trial court\u2019s failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>to provide a defendant the opportunity for a closing argument, absent an express, voluntary, and intentional relinquishment of that right, we hold here that the subsequent cases of <em>Johnson, Perry, </em>and <em>Brooks </em>establish that such structural error is nonetheless subject to the plain-error doctrine if a defendant did not object or otherwise raise the error in the trial court. Accordingly, we apply the plain-error doctrine here because appellant did not object to the trial court\u2019s failure to provide an opportunity for closing argument on the fleeing charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">{\u00b6 59} In applying the plain-error doctrine, we first conclude that <em>Pierring, Woodrick, Stennett, </em>and <em>Carroll </em>establish that the trial court committed error in not providing appellant an opportunity for closing argument on the fleeing charge. See <em>Barnes, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">{\u00b6 60} Next, we examine whether the error was \u201cplain.\u201d See <em>Barnes, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240. As noted above, \u201c[t]o be \u2018plain\u2019 within the meaning of Crim.R. 52(B), an error must be an \u2018obvious\u2019 defect in the trial proceedings.\u201d <em>Barnes, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240, quoting <em>State v.

A lack of \u201cdefinitive pronouncement\u201d from the United States Supreme Court or a state supreme court in combination with a disagreement among \u201clower courts\u201d negates a determination that error is plain. See <em>Barnes, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 28, 759 N.E.2d 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">{\u00b6 61} Here, the United States Supreme Court in <em>Herring </em>established the precedence on the error stemming from a trial court\u2019s failure to provide a defendant an opportunity for closing argument. Id. at 858-859, 864-865, 95 S.Ct. 2550, 45 L.Ed.2d 593. However, we also recognize that \u201ccourts of appeals in Ohio have come to different conclusions\u201d on a defendant\u2019s preserving the <em>Herring </em>issue for appeal. <em>State v. Newton </em>(June 27, 1997), Lake App. No. 96-L-058, 1997 WL 401557. As noted in <em>Newton:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">On one side is the view illustrated by <em>Columbus v. Woodrick </em>(1976), 48 Ohio App.2d 274, 277-278 [2 O.O.3d 232], 357 N.E.2d 58, * * * where the court held that the failure of a court to allow defense counsel in a criminal trial to present a closing argument is reversible error, in the absence of a clear showing that there was an intentional waiver of the right. * * * Other courts of appeal have come to the same conclusion. See, <em>e.g., State v. Hoover </em>(May 11, 1992), Stark App. No. CA-8761, 1992 WL 127070 ...... *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">* * * [Conversely], [i]n <em>State v.

Other courts in Ohio have also adopted this position. See, <em>e.g., State v.

The differing opinions go to the preservation on appeal of the closing argument issue and not to the error itself established by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Herring. </em>Thus, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s failure to provide appellant an opportunity for closing argument on the fleeing charge constitutes error that is plain, given the precedence of <em>Herring </em>and its progeny.

Thus, we conclude that the error here affected appellant\u2019s \u201csubstantial rights.\u201d See <em>Barnes, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">{\u00b6 64} In short, the trial court\u2019s failure to provide appellant an opportunity for closing argument satisfies the three prongs in <em>Barnes </em>and, thus, constitutes recognizable plain error under Crim.R. 52(B). Our recognition of that plain error, however, is discretionary. See <em>Barnes, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240. For the following reasons, we decline to exercise our discretion to overturn appellant\u2019s conviction based on the trial court\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">{\u00b6 65} The Ohio Supreme Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-9\">Even if a forfeited error satisfies [the above noted] three prongs [of the plain-error doctrine], Crim.R. 52(B) does not demand that an appellate court correct it. Crim.R. 52(B) states only that a reviewing court \u201cmay\u201d notice plain forfeited errors; a court is not obliged to correct them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-10\"><em>Barnes, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240; see, also, <em>State v. Martin, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 385, 2004-Ohio-5471, 816 N.E.2d 227, at \u00b6 52 (Moyer, C.J., concurring) (recognizing that \u201c[e]ven if the defendant establishes that plain error affected his substantial rights, the appellate court need not necessarily reverse the judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>of the trial court\u201d). Thus, the Ohio Supreme Court has \u201cadmonish[ed] courts to notice plain error \u2018with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barnes, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240, quoting <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph three of the syllabus. Reversing on plain error without considering such exceptional circumstances \u201c \u2018encourages litigants to abuse the judicial process and bestirs the public to ridicule it.\u2019 \u201d See <em>Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 470, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718, quoting Traynor, The Riddle of Harmless Error (1970) 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">{\u00b6 66} Here, given the evidence supporting appellant\u2019s third-degree felony fleeing conviction, we find no \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice\u201d requiring that we notice and correct the plain error from the trial court\u2019s failure to provide appellant an opportunity for closing argument on the fleeing charge, a charge tried only before the court, not the jury. See <em>Johnson, </em>520 U.S. at 470, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (declining to reverse a conviction under the plain-error doctrine upon examining the \u201coverwhelming\u201d evidence that ultimately supported the defendant\u2019s conviction and determining that no \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d would result from a failure to recognize plain error); see <em>State v. Vaughn, </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 79948, 2002-Ohio-4074, 2002 WL 1824972, at \u00b6 32 (declining to reverse a conviction under the plain-error doctrine upon examining the \u201c[a]mple\u201d evidence that ultimately supported the defendant\u2019s conviction and determining that no \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice\u201d existed under the plain-error doctrine); <em>State v. Grogan </em>(Feb. 11, 1982), Cuyahoga App. No. 43679, 1982 WL 2348 (Markus, J., concurring) (suggesting that no \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice\u201d existed under the plain-error doctrine upon examining the \u201cadequate\u201d evidence to support a defendant\u2019s convictions).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">{\u00b6 67} Again, R.C. 2921.331, the statute prohibiting fleeing, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-7\">(B) No person shall operate a motor vehicle so as willfully to elude or flee a police officer after receiving a visible or audible signal from a police officer to bring the person\u2019s motor vehicle to a stop.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-8\">As noted above, Officers Bruce and Hazlerig unequivocally testified that after Officer Bruce activated the lights and siren, appellant did not stop, but continued to speed away. Detectives Shockey and Elkins confirmed the testimony that established appellant\u2019s underlying fleeing conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">{\u00b6 68} Next, we note that appellee indicted the fleeing as a third-degree felony, pursuant to R.C. 2921.331(C)(5)(a)(ii), alleging that in fleeing, appellant had \u201ccaused a substantial risk of serious physical harm to persons or property.\u201d As noted above, the evidence established that appellant had created a substantial risk of physical harm to persons or property by fleeing in a car at a high rate of speed through an area mixed with residences and businesses, and appellant also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>had created a substantial risk of physical harm to Officers Bruce and Hazlerig during the fleeing. See <em>Walby; Hines; Barnett, </em>2005-Ohio-255, 2005 WL 135897, at \u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">{\u00b6 69} To be sure, appellant has raised issues concerning the strength of the evidence supporting the third-degree felony fleeing charge. And as the dissent asserts, there were discrepancies among the police officers\u2019 testimonies. However, we rejected these challenges in our discussion and holding that appellant\u2019s third-degree felony conviction is based on sufficient evidence and is not against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">{\u00b6 70} In the final analysis, because we have concluded that no \u201cmanifest miscarriage of injustice\u201d exists here, we decline to exercise our discretion to recognize and correct the plain error stemming from the trial court\u2019s failure to provide appellant an opportunity for closing argument following the bench trial on the fleeing charge. See <em>Barnes, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">{\u00b6 71} In summary, although the trial court committed structural error in failing to provide appellant an opportunity to make a closing argument on the fleeing charge, the plain-error doctrine applies here because appellant\u2019s defense counsel failed to object to such error at trial. Although the trial court committed plain error in failing to provide appellant an opportunity to make a closing argument on the fleeing charge, we need not recognize that error for the reasons noted above. As such, we overrule appellant\u2019s first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">{\u00b6 72} For the foregoing reasons, we overrule appellant\u2019s first, second, and third assignments of error. Thus, we affirm the judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b547-10\">Brown, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b547-11\">McGrath, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b547-12\">McGrath, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Avx\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">{\u00b6 73} Being unable to concur on the final aspect of the majority\u2019s opinion, I am compelled to respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">{\u00b6 74} The majority\u2019s opinion thoroughly and correctly sets forth the law applicable to the present appeal and concludes that despite defense counsel\u2019s failure to object, the trial court, in failing to afford counsel an opportunity for final argument, committed structural error on the fleeing charge, and that the plain-error doctrine is applicable thereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>{\u00b6 75} The majority concludes that plain error need not be corrected except to prevent a \u201cmanifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d The majority finds no such miscarriage of justice in view of overwhelming evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">{\u00b6 76} Nevertheless, I must depart company with the majority on the question of whether the defendant\u2019s inability to have even argued his view of the evidence to the trier of fact on the critical question of whether his conduct created a \u201csubstantial risk of * * * harm to persons or property.\u201d The majority opinion at \u00b6 68 established cause for reversal. The risk-of-harm element makes the fleeing charge a felony of the third degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">{\u00b6 77} The defendant was acquitted by a jury of the greater charges of rape and felonious assault, and the trial judge, having heard additional evidence on the fleeing charge, was \u201chovering\u201d on her decision from Friday through Tuesday.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">{\u00b6 78} The error at hand is structural and a per se cause for reversal. <em>State v. Fisher, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 127, 2003-Ohio-2761, 789 N.E.2d 222. Per se prejudice exists affecting a substantial right. Arguments exist under the facts of this case concerning some discrepancies among the police officers\u2019 testimonies; only approximations as to the speed of defendant\u2019s vehicle; the length of pursuit (one officer has it at two and one-half blocks); the knowledge and time thereof of defendant as to beacons and/or sirens; whether a place existed to pull over before he did so; and the credibility of the inmate witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">{\u00b6 79} Moreover, argument may be made as to what specific evidence existed, or was lacking, detailing the action of defendant\u2019s vehicle coupled only with a general description of the neighborhood (as mixed business and residential).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">{\u00b6 80} All these factors may have been argued to the trier of fact in the hope of raising a reasonable doubt in the mind of the trial court. As stated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Herring v. New York </em>(1975), 422 U.S. 853, 864, 95 S.Ct. 2550, 45 L.Ed.2d 593:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-10\">There is no way to know whether * * * arguments in summation might have affected the ultimate judgment in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">{\u00b6 81} Whether or not the defendant would have been found guilty, I believe under the facts of this case that being denied the opportunity to argue presents a situation for the exercise of judicial discretion and I would, therefore, reverse and remand on the first assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-13\">{\u00b6 82} Having so concluded, I would hold assignments of error two and three to be moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
