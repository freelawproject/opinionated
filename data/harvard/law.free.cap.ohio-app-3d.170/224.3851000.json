Plaintiffs signed an order form to purchase personal seat licenses or Charter Ownership Agreements for club seats in Paul Brown Stadium, but then opted not to purchase their club-seat season tickets annually. When the Bengals contacted the plaintiffs several years later and notified them that they were in default of their obligation to pay for their club-seat tickets, the plaintiffs filed suit against the Bengals, alleging common-law claims for negligent misrepresentation and fraud, as well as statutory violations of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act, and requesting declaratory and injunctive relief. Plaintiffs also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to prohibit the Bengals from communicating with previous club-seat holders to collect monies for club-seat season tickets until the merits of the case had been adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-12\">{\u00b6 3} The Bengals moved to stay the class-action suit, arguing that the plaintiffs were bound by the arbitration provision in a subsequent document entitled the Club Seat License Agreement (\u201cCSLA\u201d). The trial court granted the Bengals\u2019 motion for a stay pending arbitration and stayed the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction pending the outcome of the arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>\n<em>Dunkelman I</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">{\u00b6 4} The plaintiffs appealed the trial court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On appeal, they argued that the trial court had erred in granting the Bengals\u2019 motion to stay the proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> They maintained that the contract between the Bengals and the plaintiffs was formed when they signed brochures for club-seat licenses and submitted their initial payments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Bengals argued, among other things, that the CSLA was valid because the plaintiffs\u2019 payments toward their season tickets served as separate consideration for the terms contained therein.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">{\u00b6 5} In holding that the Club Seat Brochure and Order Form was the controlling agreement between the parties, we rejected the Bengals\u2019 argument that the plaintiffs\u2019 payments following their receipt of the CSLA constituted consideration for the terms outlined in the CSLA.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As a result, we held that the arbitration provision in the CSLA was unenforceable because it appeared only in the terms of the CSLA, which the plaintiffs had not agreed to, and which did not constitute a contract between the parties.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We further stated that because the plaintiffs had never agreed to the terms of the CSLA, they never agreed to the default and acceleration provisions that also appeared in that document.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, we held that the trial court had erred in granting the Bengals\u2019 motion to stay the proceedings pending arbitration.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Consequently, we remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to lift the stay pending arbitration, to proceed with the case, and to rule on the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Trial Court Proceedings Following <em>Dunkelman I</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">{\u00b6 6} Following our remand in <em>Dunkelman I, the </em>parties joined in an agreed entry regarding the preliminary injunction. Plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint, which removed Dunkelman, now deceased, as a named class represen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>tative and added Menne, Chabut, and Wellman as additional class representatives. Also added were two new claims: one for a violation of the Ohio Deceptive Trade Act and one for fraudulent inducement.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">{\u00b6 7} Plaintiffs also moved for class certification on behalf of all club-seat license holders who had purchased their tickets with the original Club Seat Brochure but had then decided to stop purchasing tickets. The Bengals filed an answer to the amended complaint and compulsory counterclaims against Brown, Walton, and Wellman. Plaintiffs moved for dismissal of the Bengals\u2019 counterclaims and for summary judgment on their claims for declaratory and injunctive relief. The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the only binding terms between the parties were found in the rules and regulations of the Club Seat Brochure and that those terms provided that the plaintiffs and the class could discontinue purchasing club-seat season tickets, with the only penalty being forfeiture of their seat license and their payment of $150 per seat, and that the Bengals could not rightfully demand payment for six to ten years of season tickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">{\u00b6 8} The Bengals filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on their counterclaims. They argued that under the Club Seat Brochure, plaintiffs Brown, Walton, and Wellman had signed up for a lease of six, eight, or ten years and thus were obligated to purchase club-seat tickets for the term of years they had chosen. The trial court permitted the parties to engage in limited discovery with respect to the class-certification issues. Following discovery, the plaintiffs sought to certify a broader class consisting of all persons or entities who had purchased club-seat licenses through the Club Seat Brochure.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Trial Court\u2019s Order</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">{\u00b6 9} After a one-hour hearing on the motions, the trial court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motions for class certification on all their claims. The trial court\u2019s order certified a class of \u201call persons or entities who purchased club seat Charter Ownership Agreements (\u201cCOA\u201d) through the original Club Seat Brochure and/or Club Seat Order Form for Bengals football games in Paul Brown Stadium.\u201d The trial court also certified a subclass consisting of \u201call person or entities who purchased club seat COAs through the original Club Seat Brochure and/or Club Seat Order Form for Bengals football games in Paul Brown Stadium, who then discontinued or attempted to discontinue purchasing club seat season tickets.\u201d The trial court\u2019s order additionally stated that the court was certifying the class under all three subsections of Civ.R. 23(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">{\u00b6 10} In the same order, the trial court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissed the Bengals\u2019 counterclaims. The trial court held that \u201cunder the terms of the contract, class members are under no obligation to purchase club seat tickets for 6, 8, or 10 years and may discontinue the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>purchase of club seat tickets at any time with the only penalty being the forfeiture of the club seat COA and the $150 per club seat COA purchased.\u201d The trial court used the same holding to dismiss the Bengals\u2019 counterclaims. The trial court, finding no just reason for delay, certified the judgment pursuant to Civ.R. 54(B). In this appeal, the Bengals now raise three assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">Class Certification</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">{\u00b6 11} In their first assignment of error, the Bengals argue that the trial court erred in granting the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification, because the trial court failed to provide any analysis when certifying the class, the certification order failed to meet the express requirements for class certification under the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act (\u201cOCSPA\u201d), and the plaintiffs could not adequately represent the certified class.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">{\u00b6 12} In its order, the trial court certified the class with respect to all of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, including their OCSPA claim. \u201cR.C. 1345.09(B) provides that a consumer may qualify for a class-action status only when a supplier acted in the face of prior notice that its conduct was deceptive or unconscionable. The prior notice may be in the form of (1) a rule adopted by the Attorney General under R.C. 1345.05(B)(2) or (2) a court decision made available for public inspection by the Attorney General under R.C. 1345.05(A)(3).\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In <em>Johnson v. Microsoft </em>Corp.,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> this court affirmed a trial court\u2019s decision dismissing a class-action complaint for failure to plead compliance with the prerequisites of R.C. 1345.09(B).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">{\u00b6 13} In this case, the plaintiffs did not plead in their filings, nor did the trial court find, that the requirements set forth in R.C. 1345.09(B) had been met. Consequently, we hold that the trial court erred as matter of law in certifying the plaintiffs\u2019 OCSPA claim as a class action in the absence of any \u201cprior rule or court decision that would have entitled them to pursue [OjCSPA relief under R.C. 1345.09(B).\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">{\u00b6 14} With respect to the trial court\u2019s certification of the plaintiffs\u2019 four remaining claims, we note that the certification of a class action under Civ.R. 23 \u201cinvolves a sophisticated and necessary judgmental appraisal of the future course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>of [the] litigation.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Consequently, the Ohio Supreme Court has held that trial courts must \u201ccarefully apply the class action requirements and conduct a rigorous analysis into whether the prerequisites of Civ.R. 23 have been satisfied.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In <em>Robinson v. Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group, Inc., </em>this court relied on that requirement in rejecting a trial court\u2019s class-certification order that contained no analysis.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In <em>Robinson, </em>we held that the trial court\u2019s failure to articulate any rationale for certifying a class action precluded meaningful appellate review and constituted an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Consequently, we remanded the cause to the trial court \u201cso that it [could] conduct a rigorous analysis of the requirements of Civ.R. 23 in its consideration of plaintiffs\u2019 motion for class certification.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\">{\u00b6 15} Our review of the record reveals that this case presents complex issues related to class certification. The trial court\u2019s entry certifying the class, however, is devoid of any rationale, yet alone any rigorous analysis, relating to any of the prerequisites for class certification. Given the inadequacy of the record before us, we cannot properly review the trial court\u2019s entry granting class certification with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining claims under an abuse-of-discretion standard. We therefore agree with the Bengals that the trial court\u2019s ruling must also be reversed on the basis of our holding in Robinson.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Consequently, we sustain the Bengals\u2019 first assignment of error for the reasons set forth in our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The Club Seat Brochure</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">{\u00b6 16} In their second assignment of error, the Bengals argue that the trial court erred in dismissing their counterclaims. In their third assignment of error, they argue that the trial court erred in granting the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a declaratory judgment. Because both of these assignments address the contractual obligations of the plaintiffs under the Club Seat Brochure, we address them together.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>{\u00b6 17} The trial court held that \u201cunder the terms of the contract, class members are under no obligation to purchase club seat tickets for 6, 8, or 10 years and may discontinue the purchase of club seat tickets at any time with the only penalty being the forfeiture of the club seat COA and the $150 per club seat COA purchased.\u201d The same holding was used to justify the dismissal of the Bengals\u2019 counterclaims.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">{\u00b6 18} The Bengals argue that the Club Seat Brochure unambiguously obligated the plaintiffs to purchase club seats for a definite lease term. They argue that under the plain language of the order form, the plaintiffs were bound to purchase tickets for the number of years they selected. The plaintiffs argue, on the other hand, that the contract unambiguously gave them the right not to purchase tickets and to forfeit their seat licenses. We agree with the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">{\u00b6 19} The express written language of Rule 12 in the Club Seat Brochure states, \u201cOnce you have purchased your COAs and the new stadium opens, you must continue to purchase season tickets for your assigned seats on an annual basis to maintain your rights. Failure to purchase season tickets will forfeit your right to the COA.\u201d Furthermore, the plain language of the authorization states, \u201cThe undersigned has read the Rules and Regulations provided with this application, understands them, and agrees to be bound by them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">{\u00b6 20} When the plaintiffs purchased their seat licenses, they purchased the right to purchase season tickets at a discounted rate for a specified number of years. Under the unambiguous terms of the contract, they obligated themselves to make annual payments for club-seat tickets only if they wanted to maintain ownership of their club-seat licenses. Otherwise, they would forfeit their club-seat licenses to the Bengals, who would then resell them to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">{\u00b6 21} Because the contract contained clear and unambiguous language that the plaintiffs had the unilateral right to cancel their club-seat licenses by not purchasing club-seat tickets, the Bengals\u2019 argument that the \u201cLease Term\u201d section obligated the plaintiffs to pay for six to ten years of club-seat tickets is without merit. We therefore overrule the Bengals\u2019 second and third assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">{\u00b6 22} Based on the foregoing, we sustain the Bengals\u2019 first assignment of error and overrule their second and third assignments of error. Accordingly, we affirm the trial court\u2019s disposition of the declaratory-judgment claim in the plaintiffs\u2019 favor, but reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment as to the class certification. The trial court erred as a matter of law in certifying the plaintiffs\u2019 OCSPA claim as a class action under R.C. 1345.09(B). However, with respect to the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining class-action claims, we remand this cause so that the trial court can conduct a rigorous analysis of the requirements of Civ.R. 23, as well as for a determination whether the disposition of the plaintiffs\u2019 declaratory-judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>claim applies only to the named plaintiffs or to an entire class. But we emphasize that on remand, no further consideration shall be given to certifying a class for the OCSPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-4\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b272-5\">Painter, J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b272-6\">Gorman, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b267-9\">. <em>Dunkelman </em>v. <em>Cincinnati Bengals, Inc., </em>158 Ohio App.3d 604, 2004-Ohio-6425, 821 N.E.2d 198 <em>(\"Dunkelman I </em>\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b267-10\">.

The people happy with the present arrangement should not be part of the class.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">{\u00b6 24} The balance of the dissent rehashes what we have previously decided\u2014 the seat license was the contract. While the Bengals may have intended otherwise, they were bound by the language they wrote. The rules cannot be changed once the game is over.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b272-10\">Gorman, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ApA\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">I. Class Certification</p>\n<p id=\"b272-12\">{\u00b6 25} One aspect of this case is now certain: The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Marrone, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 5, 2006-Ohio-2869, 850 N.E.2d 31, sounded the death knell for the Dunkelman plaintiffs\u2019 claim under the OCSPA. Just as certain, in my opinion, is that a class should not be certified for the Dunkelman plaintiffs\u2019 four remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">{\u00b6 26} I adhere to my dissent in <em>Robinson v. Johnston Coca-Cola Bottling Group, Inc., </em>153 Ohio App.3d 764, 2003-Ohio-4417, 796 N.E.2d 1, and the reasons why the trial court\u2019s order granting class certification need not include a \u201crigorous analysis\u201d of the Civ.R. 23 class-action requirements as a prerequisite to appellate review. This case reinforces my point. The record is replete with evidence upon which a reviewing court can unequivocally determine that the trial court abused its discretion in granting class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-14\">{\u00b6 27} As a prerequisite to class certification, class representatives must \u201cfairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\u201d See Civ.R. 23(A)(4). The putative class representatives in this case cannot fairly or adequately represent the broad class of fans, exceeding 2,200 individuals, who purchased their COAs and season tickets from the Club Seat Brochure, because none are current <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>season-ticket holders. The putative class representatives \u2014 all former club-seat season-ticket holders \u2014 do not wish to be bound by the six-, eight-, or ten-year lease terms they initially selected from the Club Seat Brochure. By contrast, current club-seat season-ticket holders want the terms to be binding because the terms include season-ticket price protection. This fundamental conflict between the named representatives and the putative class members is fatal to class certification of all claims in the Dunkelman plaintiffs\u2019 complaint. See <em>In re Kroger Co. Shareholders Litigation </em>(1990), 70 Ohio App.3d 52, 590 N.E.2d 391, citing <em>United Indep. Flight Officers, Inc. v. United Air Lines, Inc. </em>(C.A.7, 1985), 756 F.2d 1274; <em>Berman v. Narragansett Racing Assn., Inc. </em>(C.A.1, 1969), 414 F.2d 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">II. Relief Granted to Unidentified Plaintiffs</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">{\u00b6 28} It is also troubling that the majority has decided to address the declaratory-relief claim without knowing whether a class even exists. None of the putative class members certified under Civ.R. 23(B)(3) have been given notice of the action, an opportunity to enter an appearance through counsel, or an opportunity to opt out as is provided by Civ.R. 23(C)(2). While I appreciate that only the Civ.R.23 (B)(2) claim, i.e., the one for declaratory and injunctive relief, was ruled on by the trial court, resolution of this claim is central to determining the merits of the remaining claims. Addressing the merits of the Dunkelman plaintiffs\u2019 claims as the majority has done before knowing whether a class exists violates the due-process rights of the Civ.R. 23(B)(3) putative class members \u2014 if this class does indeed exist. See, generally, <em>Mullane v. Cent. Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>(1950), 339 U.S. 306, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865. The effect of the majority opinion is to grant relief to unidentified plaintiffs and to bind putative class members without following proper procedural safeguards.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">III. The Club Seat Brochure</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">{\u00b6 29} While I disagree -with the majority\u2019s decision to address the merits of the declaratory-relief claim, I am nevertheless compelled to comment on what I view as inaccuracies in its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">A. The COA and the Lease Term are Two Different Things</p>\n<p id=\"b273-10\">{\u00b6 30} Permanent seat licenses are a method that several NFL franchises and government authorities have used to raise the initial capital for financing stadium construction. Typically, a permanent seat license grants the buyer ownership of a specific seat location in the stadium and a continuing right to purchase season tickets for that seat under terms agreed to by the team and the purchaser. See Reese, Nagel, and Southall, National Football League Ticket Transfer Policies: Legal and Policy Issues (2004), 14 J.Legal Aspects of Sport 163, 174-175. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>Bengals\u2019 permanent seat license at issue here, the \u201cCharter Ownership Agreement\u201d or \u201cCOA,\u201d offered its owner the right to buy tickets in a preferred location in one of three club-seat areas in Paul Brown Stadium, together with membership in the adjacent club-level restaurant and lounges not available to COA owners in general-admission locations.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">{\u00b6 31} Ground had not even been broken for Paul Brown Stadium when the Bengals started selling COAs on behalf of Hamilton County, as evidenced by Paragraph 10 of the Charter Ownership Rules and Regulations: \u201cAll COA payments will be held in an escrow account until they are deposited to the account of the County of Hamilton, Ohio. All proceeds from the sale of COA will go solely to cover costs associated with constructing the new Bengals Stadium. In the event the new stadium is not constructed, the deposit amount will be returned to the original purchaser.\u201d In other words, the COA \u2014 the location and the right to purchase tickets \u2014 existed separately from the lease-term options for the purchase of season tickets listed in the Club Seat Brochure.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">{\u00b6 32} The length of the lease-term options was set forth in the Club Seat Brochure in a section plainly entitled \u201cLease Terms.\u201d A COA owner had a right to lock in the cost of club-level seat tickets by checking one of three options on the order form, indicating a choice of a six-, eight-, or ten-year lease term. The six-year lease term included a one-year price freeze with a five-percent price cap for the remaining seasons. The eight-year lease term included a two-year price freeze with a four-percent price cap for the remaining seasons. The ten-year lease term included a three-year price freeze with a three-percent price cap for the remaining seasons. When the Dunkelman plaintiffs accepted one of these three lease-term options, they were under an obligation to buy season tickets for the term of years selected. In return, they received guaranteed price protection as determined by the length of the lease term they selected.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">B. Paragraph 12</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">{\u00b6 33} The majority\u2019s conclusion that Paragraph 12 of the Club Seat Brochure gave plaintiffs \u201cthe unilateral right to cancel their club-seat licenses by not purchasing club-seat tickets\u201d ignores the obvious distinction between the COA and the lease term. It is beyond debate that the plain language of the Club Seat Brochure provided that Paragraph 12 applied only to the terms of the COA. The purpose of Paragraph 12 was to ensure that those COA owners who breached their lease-term obligation could not retain their COAs. Without this language, a COA owner could retain the COA after a breach, and the Bengals would have had no authority to sell tickets in that location. Paragraph 12 was intended to protect the Bengals\u2019 business interests. It was not the exclusive remedy for a breach of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>the lease term and did not preclude the Bengals from attempting to enforce the terms of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">{\u00b6 34} The majority maintains that Paragraph 12 allowed subscribers the opportunity for the highest savings from the Bengals, i.e., the ten-year-lease price protection, without any corresponding obligation to perform. The argument defies all considerations of mutuality and invites the question why anyone would ever choose less than a ten-year lease term with lesser price protection if the brochure so clearly allowed the purchaser a unilateral right to rescind.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">{\u00b6 35} Three and a half seasons have now come and gone since the Dunkelman plaintiffs stopped purchasing tickets for Bengals games. Professional football in Cincinnati has moved on, and all 2006 preseason and regular-season home games have been sold out. By their own admission, the Dunkelman plaintiffs have not suffered economic damages. In fact, the Bengals offered to return their money before they filed this action. They may perceive their apparent vendetta against the Bengals as a need to satisfy some personal agenda, but their grievances serve no useful purpose for the advancement of the rule of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">{\u00b6 36} I would reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment on class certification and enter judgment in favor of the Bengals on the merits of the claim for declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
