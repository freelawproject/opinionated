Edwards interviewed, was hired, and began working as a scheduler at OICC\u2019s First Street office in Springfield on December 19, 2002. According to OICC\u2019s organizational chart, Dr. Salim Dahdah (\u201cDr. Dahdah\u201d) was OICC\u2019s president. Cindy Dahdah (\u201cDahdah\u201d) was next in line as the executive vice president. James Webster was the operations manager, who supervised all of the office managers at OICC\u2019s various locations. In December 2002, David Brandenburg was the office manager for the First Street office, and he was Edwards\u2019s immediate supervisor. In approximately February 2003, Brandenburg left OICC and Webster assumed the office manager duties for the First Street office until approximately May 2003, when Jeff Bumgardner was hired as the office manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">{\u00b6 3} In mid-March 2003, Webster began to send personal e-mails (akin to instant messages) to Edwards. In his messages, he asked Edwards whether she was married, how many children she had, whether she had ever had an affair, and the like. Edwards stated that the personal questions made her feel very uncomfortable and nervous, and she tried to figure out how to avoid the questions and not answer them.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">{\u00b6 4} Edwards informed Caskey, the Clinical Department Head of the Pacemaker Clinic, about Webster\u2019s messages. Caskey responded: \u201cIt\u2019s happened before. This is not the first time and it won\u2019t be the last.\u201d Caskey told Edwards that Webster\u2019s next move would be to invite her out for a drink. Edwards asked, \u201cWhat do I need to do?\u201d Caskey said, \u201cAt this point, I wouldn\u2019t upset him, I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d Caskey then asked Edwards, \u201cDo you want me to go to my manager in Dayton, Glenda Burns, and talk to her about it?\u201d Edwards responded, \u201cLet\u2019s give it a few days and see if he goes away.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">{\u00b6 5} Within a few days of Edwards\u2019s conversation with Caskey, Webster invited Edwards for a drink. Edwards returned to Caskey and asked for her help. Edwards suggested printing out a message and going to Cindy Dahdah. Caskey responded, \u201cNot if you want to keep your job. That\u2019s her right-hand man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">{\u00b6 6} Initially, Edwards received six to ten personal messages from Webster each day. Gradually, the messages became more personal, such as asking Edwards if she had ever performed oral sex, did she date often, and what type of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>men she preferred. In addition, whenever Webster stopped at her desk, he would touch her lower back, the top of her buttocks, and her shoulders. The frequency of the messages continued to increase. Edwards indicated that at one point, she was receiving 15 to 20 messages each day. Later, she received 20 to 30 messages.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">{\u00b6 7} Edwards indicated that she did not tell anyone other than Caskey because Caskey had stated: \u201cStay in contact with me and keep your mouth shut to everybody else about it [the situation with Webster] at this time.\u201d Edwards believed that Caskey would resolve the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">{\u00b6 8} Eventually, Edwards decided to print one e-mail and to talk with Cindy Dahdah. She printed a message from Webster that asked Edwards what color her bra and panties were that day. When Edwards went to retrieve the message from the printer, which was not near her desk, the message was gone.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">{\u00b6 9} The following day, Webster e-mailed Edwards, asking why she would print the e-mail and informing her that Dahdah had it. Caskey told Edwards that Dahdah had the e-mail and that she was \u201chot.\u201d Caskey also said that she was worried for Edwards\u2019s job. A couple of days later, Webster e-mailed Edwards and told her that Dahdah would make him fire her and that Edwards should be concerned about her job. Other employees began whispering when she walked by and rumors about a relationship between Edwards and Webster were circulating.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">{\u00b6 10} According to Edwards, after the e-mail came to light, she began to receive tardy forms. On July 7, 2003, Edwards was discharged, ostensibly for changing her clothes at the end of the day prior to the Fourth of July weekend. Edwards indicated that she was terminated by Bumgardner, her supervisor, but she believed that Dahdah made the decision to fire her. Edwards had no evidence that Webster had her employment terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">{\u00b6 11} During OICC\u2019s case-in-chief, Bumgardner testified that he made the decision to fire Edwards based on his belief that she had violated the dress code while she was on the clock, while patients were still in the building, and when such conduct violated OSHA regulations. Bumgardner indicated that he called Dahdah and informed her of his recommendation to fire Edwards. Dahdah responded: \u201cJeff, that\u2019s your office. Do you feel like this is appropriate? If you feel it\u2019s appropriate, I will support you.\u201d Bumgardner testified that he was not aware of the sexual-harassment allegations against Webster at the time of Edwards\u2019s termination, and Webster was not involved in the decision to fire her.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">{\u00b6 12} In contrast to Edwards\u2019s testimony, Caskey testified that Edwards never told her that Webster was sexually harassing her and never asked her for assistance. Webster testified that he recalled sending an e-mail regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Edwards\u2019s underwear but that Edwards was an active participant in the flirtation. Webster also denied sending other e-mails of a sexual nature. Webster also stated that he had never threatened Edwards with employment ramifications if she did not see him outside the office. Caskey, Brandenburg, and Bumgardner each testified that Edwards was not a punctual employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">{\u00b6 13} On August 3, 2004, Edwards brought suit against OICC, Dr. Dahdah, and Webster, alleging sexual harassment, retaliation, and assault and battery. On February 2, 2005, Dr. Dahdah was dismissed from the litigation, pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6). During mediation, Edwards reached a settlement with Webster, and on October 5, 2005, he was dismissed by an agreed entry. In December 2005, Edwards proceeded to trial against OICC on her sexual harassment and retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">(\u00b6 14} After hearing the evidence, the jury found in favor of Edwards on her sexual-harassment claim but found in favor of OICC on her retaliation claim. In the interrogatories, the jury concluded that Webster was Edwards\u2019s supervisor and that Edwards had been subjected to a hostile work environment. The jury awarded Edwards $200,000 in compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">{\u00b6 15} On December 21, 2005, OICC filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (\u201cJNOV\u201d) or, alternatively, for a new trial or remittitur. OICC asserted that it could not be liable due to the release of Webster from liability, that the damage award was excessive and against the manifest weight of the evidence, that the court erred in not providing a jury instruction on the affirmative defense to the sexual-harassment claim, and that Edwards\u2019s counsel made improper statements during closing argument. The trial court denied the motion on May 10, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">{\u00b6 16} OICC appeals, raising five assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">{\u00b6 17} I. \u201cThe trial court committed reversible error by making the factual determination that a tangible employment action was taken against appellee and failing to instruct the jury of OICC\u2019s affirmative defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">{\u00b6 18} In its first assignment of error, OICC claims that it was entitled to an instruction on an employer\u2019s affirmative defense to liability for sexual harassment by a supervisor. It further claims that the trial court erred in failing to give that instruction based on its erroneous conclusion that Edwards had suffered a tangible employment action as a result of the alleged sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-11\">{\u00b6 19} The Supreme Court of Ohio has recognized two types of sexual-harassment claims: (1) \u201cquid pro quo\u201d harassment, i.e., harassment that is directly linked to the grant or denial of a tangible economic benefit, and (2) \u201chostile environment\u201d harassment, i.e., harassment that while not affecting economic benefits, has the purpose or effect of creating a hostile or abusive working <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>environment. <em>Hampel v. Food Ingredients Specialties, Inc. </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 169, 176, 729 N.E.2d 726.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">{\u00b6 20} When the alleged harasser is a supervisor, the employer\u2019s liability depends on the consequences of the supervisor\u2019s harassing conduct. See <em>Harmon v. GZK, Inc. </em>(Feb. 8, 2002), Montgomery App. No. 18672, 2002 WL 191598. If the sexual harassment resulted in a tangible employment action, the employer will be strictly liable for the supervisor\u2019s sexual harassment. <em>Faragher v. Boca Raton </em>(1998), 524 U.S. 775, 807, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662; <em>Burlington Indus., Inc. v. Ellerth </em>(1998), 524 U.S. 742, 762-763, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633. A tangible employment action means \u201ca significant change in employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote, reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a decision causing a significant change in benefits.\u201d <em>Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. at 761, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633. \u201c[A]n employment action must be materially adverse for an employer to be strictly liable for sexual harassment.\u201d <em>Keeton v. Flying J, Inc. </em>(C.A.6, 2005), 429 F.3d 259, 262-263; <em>Kocsis v. Multi-Care Mgmt. Inc. </em>(C.A.6, 1996), 97 F.3d 876, 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">{\u00b6 21} If the sexual harassment by the supervisor did not result in a tangible employment action, then the employer may assert an affirmative defense. The employer may avoid liability if it can establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, (a) that it exercised reasonable care to prevent and to correct promptly any sexually-harassing behavior and (b) that the plaintiff unreasonably failed to utilize the measures the employer provided or to avoid harm otherwise. <em>Faragher, </em>524 U.S. at 807, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662; <em>Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. at 765, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">{\u00b6 22} Prior to closing argument, OICC objected to the lack of an instruction on the <em>Faragher \u00a1Ellerth </em>employer affirmative defense, which is articulated in 2 Ohio Jury Instructions (2003) Section 266.19(6). The trial court overruled the objection, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cThe Court has reviewed the Jury instructions regarding this matter and noting the case of <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>a United States Supreme Court case decided in 1998, there\u2019s a reference to the fact that an affirmative defense would be appropriate if no tangible employment action such as discharge took place. Since that is the essence of the claim of the Plaintiff in this matter, I believe that conduct has application, and the Court will not give that instruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">{\u00b6 24} In our view, the trial court has misconstrued when the affirmative defense applies. In <em>Faragher </em>and <em>Ellerth, </em>the United States Supreme Court focused on whether an employer may be held vicariously liable when a supervisor creates a hostile work environment. In both cases, the court supported holding an employer vicariously liable for a supervisor\u2019s harassing conduct by reference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>to the aided-by-agency-relation principle, as set forth in Restatement of the Law 2d, Agency (1958) 481, Section 219(2)(d). <em>Faragher, </em>524 U.S. at 802, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662; <em>Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. at 760-763, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633. The court had no difficulty holding an employer liable for the acts of a harassing supervisor when a tangible employment action had been taken by the supervisor. See <em>Ellerth, 524 </em>U.S. at 761-763, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633. \u201cTangible employment actions fall within the special province of the supervisor. The supervisor has been empowered by the company as a distinct class of agent to make economic decisions affecting other employees under his or her control.\u201d Id. at 762, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633. As stated by Justice Thomas in his <em>Ellerth </em>dissent, if a supervisor takes an adverse employment action, causing a tangible job detriment, the employer is responsible for the resulting damages \u201cbecause such actions are company acts that can be performed only by the exercise of specific authority granted by the employer, and thus the supervisor acts as the employer.\u201d Id. at 768, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">{\u00b6 25} Under <em>Faragher </em>and <em>Ellerth, </em>an employer is strictly liable for sexual harassment by the supervisor \u2014 and the affirmative defense is unavailable \u2014 when <em>that supervisor </em>has taken a tangible employment action against the aggrieved employee. A classic example is where a supervisor demotes an employee who rebuffs the supervisor\u2019s sexual advances. It is not sufficient that a tangible employment action ultimately occurs; the tangible employment action must be directly linked to the harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">{\u00b6 26} Based on the evidence presented by Edwards at trial, we agree with OICC that Edwards did not establish a tangible employment action such that OICC would be precluded from requesting the affirmative-defense instruction. Although Edwards was ultimately terminated, there is no evidence that Webster made the decision to fire her, orchestrated her termination, or participated in any way in the decision to fire her. Edwards admitted that she had no evidence that Webster had her employment terminated, and Bumgardner testified that he made the decision without input from Webster and without knowledge of the sexual-harassment charges against him. Accordingly, although Edwards\u2019s testimony provided sufficient evidence that Webster had sexually harassed her, there was no evidence that his harassment culminated in a tangible employment action. OICC was thus entitled to the affirmative-defense instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">{\u00b6 27} Edwards claims that the trial court\u2019s ruling was nevertheless correct for several reasons. First, Edwards argues, citing <em>Hampel, </em>that the Supreme Court of Ohio has not adopted the employer affirmative defense as set forth by the United States Supreme Court. Edwards acknowledges, however, that we previ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>ously adopted the federal case law regarding the employer affirmative defense. <em>Harmon, </em>Montgomery App. No. 18672, 2002 WL 191598.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">{\u00b6 28} <em>Hampel </em>is silent on the employer affirmative defense. This may be because the Supreme Court concluded that the employer was entitled to judgment notwithstanding the verdict on the sexual-harassment claim and, consequently, a discussion of the affirmative defense was unnecessary. In setting forth the elements of a hostile-environment sexual-harassment claim, however, the Supreme Court of Ohio has followed federal authority regarding Title VII. See, e.g., <em>Hampel, </em>89 Ohio St.3d at 175, 729 N.E.2d 726 (noting that federal case law regarding Title VII is generally applicable to cases involving R.C. Chapter 4112). We see no reason why the Supreme Court of Ohio would not adopt the employer affirmative defense should the issue come before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">{\u00b6 29} Second, Edwards argues that although OICC objected to the lack of an affirmative-defense instruction, it failed to object to the lack of an instruction on a tangible employment action. Edwards thus contends that OICC either conceded that a tangible employment action occurred or waived the right to assert the affirmative defense \u201cby failing to give it proper context.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">{\u00b6 30} Upon review of the record, OICC did not concede that a tangible employment action occurred, nor did it waive its objection to the lack of an affirmative-defense instruction. Although the United States Supreme Court in <em>Faragher </em>and <em>Ellerth </em>downplayed the use of the terms \u201cquid-pro-quo\u201d and \u201chostile work environment\u201d in its analysis of employer liability, those terms have generally been used to demarcate whether a tangible employment action has occurred. In general, quid pro quo claims involve tangible employment actions while hostile-work-environment claims involve severe and pervasive harassment that did not culminate in a job detriment. As stated above, the Supreme Court of Ohio has separated sexual-harassment claims into these two categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">{\u00b6 31} In general, the trial court\u2019s instructions regarding Edwards\u2019s sexual-harassment claim mirrored 2 Ohio Jury Instructions Section 266.19, which addresses hostile-work-environment sexual-harassment claims. For example, the court initially set forth the claim, stating:</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cClaim for sexual harassment. Kathy Edwards claims that she has been subjected to a hostile work environment as a result of being sexually harassed. To establish a claim of hostile work environment, Kathy Edwards must prove by the greater weight of the evidence that she was sexually harassed and the sexual harassment was so severe, pervasive or extensive that it permeated the work environment and altered the conditions of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cUnwelcome sexual harassment includes sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, sexual violence, or verbal sexual abuse. Sexual conduct is unwel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>come when it\u2019s unsolicited or uninvited by the Plaintiff. Sexual harassment can be by physical contact, work, phone or e-mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cSexual harassment means unwelcome sexual advances, unwelcome requests for sexual favors, or other unwelcome verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.\u201d See Ohio Jury Instructions Section 266.19(1) and (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">{\u00b6 35} The court instructed the jury on the factors it may consider in determining whether the alleged sexual harassment created a hostile work environment, 2 Ohio Jury Instructions Section 266.19(3), and it informed the jury of the reasonable person standard, 2 Ohio Jury Instructions Section 266.19(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">{\u00b6 36} In sum, the trial court\u2019s instructions assumed a hostile-work-environment claim in which no tangible employment action was taken. The court did not instruct the jury on sexual harassment that results in a tangible employment action, as set forth in 2 Ohio Jury Instructions Section 266.17. Although Edwards had requested an instruction on tangible employment actions, neither party objected to its exclusion by the trial court. Based on the instructions as presented by the court, in which the only apparent basis for the sexual-harassment claim was a hostile work environment, OICC reasonably objected to the lack of an instruction on the employer affirmative defense as set forth in <em>Faragher, Ellerth, </em>and Ohio Jury Instructions Section 266.19(6). If Edwards wished the court to instruct the jury on quid pro quo sexual harassment, for which OICC could be held strictly liable, Edwards should have objected to the lack of such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">{\u00b6 37} Parenthetically, we note that the instruction for an employer\u2019s liability for a supervisor\u2019s harassing conduct is stated only in Ohio Jury Instructions Section 266.17(6), which concerns sexual-harassment claims with tangible employment actions. It is not referenced in Ohio Jury Instructions Section 266.19. Ohio Jury Instructions Section 266.19 thus seems to ignore the liability of an employer for hostile-work-environment sexual harassment by a supervisor. As a result, the affirmative-defense instruction in Ohio Jury Instructions Section 266.19(6) appears disconnected to the other instructions in Section 266.19. Although the comment to Ohio Jury Instruction Sections 266.19(6) states that this defense \u201capplies only to cases in which no tangible employment action, such as discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment, occurs,\u201d it does not explicitly state that it applies to supervisors, as only supervisors can take tangible employment actions. To avoid unnecessary confusion, we suggest that this oversight be corrected.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">{\u00b6 38} Third, Edwards argues that even if the trial court erred in failing to give the affirmative-defense instruction, OICC was not prejudiced because it did not present sufficient evidence to satisfy the elements of the affirmative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>defense. Edwards argues that there was no evidence that Edwards received a copy of OICC\u2019s sexual-harassment policy and that the OICC employee handbook\u2019s definition of harassment does not include sexual harassment. Edwards further argues that OICC did not meet its burden of proving that Edwards unreasonably failed to avail herself of corrective measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cUnder the first prong of the defense, employers \u2018have an affirmative duty to prevent sexual harassment by supervisors.\u2019 * * * While the affirmative duty on the part of the employer will often include the requirement that it have some sort of sexual harassment policy in place, the duty does not end there. Prong one of the affirmative defense requires an inquiry that looks behind the face of a policy to determine whether the policy was effective in practice in reasonably preventing and correcting any harassing behavior.\u201d <em>Clark v. United Parcel Serv., Inc. </em>(C.A.6, 2005), 400 F.3d 341, 349. In other words, the employer must demonstrate \u201cthat it had installed a readily accessible and effective policy for reporting and resolving complaints of sexual harassment.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania State Police v. Suders </em>(2004), 542 U.S. 129, 134, 124 S.Ct. 2342, 159 L.Ed.2d 204.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">{\u00b6 40} Bumgardner testified that OICC had an employee handbook, which contained a sexual-harassment provision. The OICC sexual-harassment policy, dated February 2003, was admitted into evidence as Edwards\u2019s Exhibit 16 and in OICC\u2019s Exhibit B. The policy stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cSexual harassment of one employee by another employee, supervisor or third party is against practice policy and is unlawful under state and federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cWe firmly prohibit sexual harassment of any employee by another employee, supervisor or third party. Harassment of third parties by our employees is also prohibited. The purpose of this policy is not to regulate the morality of employees. It is to assure that in the workplace, no employee is subject to sexual harassment. While it is not easy to define precisely what sexual harassment is, it includes: unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors and/or verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature including, but not limited to: sexually-related drawings, pictures, jokes, teasing, uninvited touching or other sexually-related comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cAny employee who feels that (s)he is a victim of sexual harassment should immediately report such actions in accordance with the following procedure. All complaints will be promptly and thoroughly investigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">{\u00b6 44} \u201c1. Any employee who believes that (s)he is a victim of sexual harassment or retaliated against for complaining of sexual harassment, should report the act immediately to the operations manager. If you prefer not to discuss the matter with operations manager, you may contact any other member of management.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>{\u00b6 45} \u201c2. The practice will investigate every reported incident immediately. Any employee, supervisor or agent of the practice who has been found to have violated this policy may be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including immediate discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">{\u00b6 46} \u201c3. The practice will conduct all investigations in a discreet manner. The practice recognizes that every investigation requires a determination based on all the facts in the matter. We also recognize the serious impact a false accusation can have. We trust that employees will continue to act responsibly.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">{\u00b6 47} <em>\u201c4. </em>The reporting employee and any employee participating in any investigation under this policy have the practice\u2019s assurance that no reprisals will be taken as a result of a sexual harassment complaint. It is our policy to encourage discussion of the matter, to help protect others from being subjected to similar inappropriate behavior.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">{\u00b6 48} We note that the parties\u2019 appellate briefs quote OICC\u2019s general anti-harassment policy (which prohibits harassment on the basis of veteran status, race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, and physical or mental disability) rather than the sexual-harassment policy. Both are included in the employee handbook. We find the parties\u2019 reference to the general antiharassment policy unnecessary and puzzling.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">{\u00b6 49} In our view, the employee handbook\u2019s sexual-harassment policy was sufficient to create an issue of fact for the jury as to whether the policy was reasonably designed to prevent sexual harassment and to inform employees of the complaint procedures. Moreover, because there was evidence that Webster received a written reprimand for his conduct and the harassing conduct mostly ceased after Edwards spoke with Dahdah, there is evidence that OICC\u2019s sexual-harassment policy was effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">{\u00b6 50} Edwards asserts that OICC presented no evidence that she received a copy of the employee handbook. Indeed, Bumgardner testified that on June 24, 2003, there was a meeting with all OICC employees, during which \u201cone of the main topics * * * was to go over our employee handbook from cover to cover.\u201d All employees, including Edwards, signed a form acknowledging receipt of the handbook at this time. However, there was no evidence by OICC that the policy was disseminated prior to that meeting. OICC responds that the existence of a written policy is irrelevant given the Supreme Court\u2019s statement that \u201cproof that an employer had promulgated an anti-harassment policy with complaint procedure is not necessary in every instance as a matter of law,\u201d <em>Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. at 765, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633. OICC also states in a footnote that \u201c[t]he trial court had stated during in chamber discussions that he would not permit OICC\u2019s suggested jury instruction regarding its affirmative defense prior [to] OICC\u2019s case in chief, and OICC would have presented additional evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>support of its defense if the trial court would have given the proper jury instruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">{\u00b6 51} Although OICC did not present evidence that it either had disseminated a written sexual-harassment policy prior to the alleged harassment or that it informally exercised reasonable care to prevent the harassment, Edwards herself offered into evidence two versions of an OICC sexual-harassment policy \u2014 the policy contained in the employee handbook and a policy that appears to predate the February 2003 version. The prior version, which discusses sexual and other unlawful harassment, prohibits sexual harassment, informs employees to report incidents to their supervisor, to David Andrick, or to any other member of management, and assures employees that they can raise complaints without fear of reprisal and that complaints will be handled \u201cin a timely and confidential manner.\u201d The policy also states that anyone engaging in sexual or other harassment will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. In light of Edwards\u2019s evidence of OICC\u2019s sexual-harassment policies, a reasonable jury could conclude that OICC had a sexual-harassment policy during Edwards\u2019s employment, that she was aware of the policy, and that it was effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">{\u00b6 52} As to the second prong of the affirmative defense (i.e., whether Edwards unreasonably failed to utilize the measures provided by OICC), OICC presented sufficient evidence to raise a question of fact as to whether Edwards unreasonably failed to take steps to stop the harassment. Caskey denied that Edwards came to her with complaints of sexual harassment and that Edwards had asked for her assistance. Caskey also described Dahdah as \u201cthe easiest person in the world to ask for anything,\u201d thus refuting Edwards\u2019s contention that Dahdah was not approachable. Edwards acknowledged that she did, not go to Bumgardner with her complaints. Although Edwards provided evidence that she sought help from Caskey, that she was cautioned not to approach Dahdah, and that she was not warmly received by Bumgardner, OICC\u2019s evidence would have been sufficient to raise an issue of fact as to whether Edwards unreasonably failed to avail herself of corrective measures.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">{\u00b6 53} Because OICC was entitled to the jury instruction on the affirmative defense of employer liability for a supervisor\u2019s harassment and because there was sufficient evidence from which a jury could find in OICC\u2019s favor on that defense, the first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">{\u00b6 54} II. \u201cThe trial court erred in failing to grant OICC\u2019s JNOV motion based on appellee\u2019s release [of] Jim Webster.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">{\u00b6 55} In its second assignment of error, OICC argues that the trial court should have granted its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>because Edwards settled with Webster, thus extinguishing the company\u2019s liability. OICC\u2019s argument is based on basic principles of vicarious liability. Under agency law, an agent is primarily liable for wrongdoing by the agent and the employer is secondarily liable. Consequently, if the employee-agent is found not to be liable, there is no claim against the employer based on the employee\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">{\u00b6 56} The trial court denied OICC\u2019s motion, relying on the Supreme Court of Ohio\u2019s holding in <em>Genaro v. Cent. Transport, Inc. </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 293, 703 N.E.2d 782, that supervisors may be held jointly and severally liable with their employer. The trial court stated: \u201cThe Court is of the opinion that OICC cannot now simply apply the principles of vicarious liability in order to obtain a JNOV.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">{\u00b6 57} Initially, we note that this issue appears to be one of first impression in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">{\u00b6 58} OICC\u2019s argument stems from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s articulation of an employer\u2019s liability for sexual harassment by a supervisor. As stated above, the United States Supreme Court has indicated that once an employee has set forth a claim for sexual harassment, the employer is <em>vicariously liable </em>unless it can establish the two elements of an affirmative defense. Based on that authority, we have stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cWhen the alleged harasser is a supervisor, the employer may be vicariously liable for the supervisor\u2019s conduct in creating the hostile work environment. Vicarious liability is a form of indirect legal responsibility that operates to make a principal liable for the acts of its agents. However, the employer confronted with that claim may avail itself of the <em>Ellerth/Faragher </em>affirmative defense to vicarious liability for a supervisor\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>Harmon, </em>Montgomery App. No. 18672.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">{\u00b6 60} As noted by OICC, the general rule is that a principal is secondarily liable for the actions of its agent. The Supreme Court of Ohio has thus made clear that when an agent\u2019s liability has been extinguished \u2014 either through a release or by judgment \u2014 there can be no claim against the principal. <em>Comer v. Risko, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 185, 2005-Ohio-4559, 833 N.E.2d 712. The <em>Comer </em>court relied on several appellate cases to illustrate the point:</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cAn example is <em>Radcliffe v. Mercy Hosp. Anderson </em>(May 14, 1997), Hamilton App. Nos. C-960424 and 960425, 1997 WL 249436, a wrongful-death case filed against Mercy Hospital and two physicians, both independent contractors who had treated the plaintiff at Mercy. The plaintiff settled her claim against the first physician, and the court granted summary judgment in favor of the second physician. The court, in turn, granted summary judgment to the hospital on the issue of its liability for the alleged negligence of the independent-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>contractor physicians. The court concluded that once the primary liability was extinguished, either by settlement and release or by a favorable judgment, the secondary liability was necessarily extinguished also. Id., citing <em>Losito v. Kruse </em>[ (1940), 136 Ohio St. 183, 16 O.O. 185, 24 N.E.2d 705], \u2018[TJhere can be no vicarious liability imputed to a principal, if there is no liability on the part of the agent.\u2019 Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">{\u00b6 62} \u201cIn <em>Wells v. Spirit Fabricating, Ltd. </em>(1996), 113 Ohio App.3d 282, 680 N.E.2d 1046, the appellate court concluded that the plaintiffs settlement with and release of the employee/defendant also released the employer. An \u2018employer cannot be found to be liable for negligence he did not commit. The employer\u2019s liability is dependent on the negligence of the employee. Since the plaintiff released [the employee] for his negligence, there is no basis to support plaintiffs claim against Spirit [the employer].\u2019 Id. at 294, 680 N.E.2d 1046.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">{\u00b6 63} \u201cLikewise, in <em>Dickerson v. Yetsko </em>(Nov. 22, 2000), Cuyahoga App. No. 77636, 2000 WL 1739298, the plaintiff settled with and executed a release to Dr. Yetsko. The court held that the release extinguished the secondary liability of Meridia Hospital because the hospital\u2019s liability, if any, was secondary to and derived solely from the primary liability of its agent. If the liability of the primarily liable party was extinguished, the liability of the secondarily liable party was likewise extinguished. Id.\u201d <em>Comer </em>at \u00b6 21-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">{\u00b6 64} In light of this precedent, OICC\u2019s argument would, at first blush, appear to be persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-8\">{\u00b6 65} Citing <em>Genaro, </em>Edwards responds that OICC\u2019s argument disregards the fact that a supervisor may be held liable for violations of R.C. Chapter 4112 because he meets the definition of an employer. R.C. 4112.01(A)(2). As did the trial court, we agree with Edwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-9\">{\u00b6 66} We begin with a discussion of the basis for imposing vicarious liability upon employers for the acts of harassing supervisors who create a hostile work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-10\">{\u00b6 67} In <em>Ellerth </em>and <em>Faragher, </em>the United States Supreme Court focused on whether an employer may be held vicariously liable when a supervisor creates a hostile work environment. Although the court had no difficulty holding an employer liable for the acts of a supervisor when a tangible employment action had occurred, the Supreme Court found it difficult to articulate how agency principles were to be applied when a hostile work environment was created. It noted that it must \u201caccommodate the agency principles of vicarious liability for harm caused by the misuse of supervisory authority, as well as Title VII\u2019s equally basic policies of encouraging forethought by employers and saving action by objecting employees.\u201d <em>Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. at 764, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>The Supreme Court had previously noted that \u201ccommon-law principles may not be transferable in all their particulars to Title VIL\u201d <em>Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v. Vinson, </em>477 U.S. 57, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 91 L.Ed.2d 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">{\u00b6 68} Likewise, we cannot divorce the application of vicarious liability from the statutory framework of R.C. Chapter 4112. In this respect, we focus not on the basis for the company-employer\u2019s liability, but on the basis for the supervisor\u2019s liability. R.C. 4112.02 provides that \u201c[i]t shall be an unlawful discriminatory practice: (A) [f]or any employer, because of the race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, age, or ancestry of any person * * * to discriminate against that person with respect to hire, tenure, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, or any matter directly or indirectly related to employment.\u201d An \u201cemployer\u201d includes \u201cany person employing four or more persons within the state, and any person acting directly or indirectly in the interest of an employer.\u201d R.C. 4112.01(A)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">{\u00b6 69} In <em>Genaro, </em>the Supreme Court of Ohio held that the \u201cR.C. 4112.01(A)(2) definition of \u2018employer\u2019 * * * encompasses individual supervisors and managers whose conduct violates the provisions of R.C. Chapter 4112.\u201d <em>Genaro, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 296, 703 N.E.2d 782. Thus, the Supreme Court held: \u201cFor purposes of R.C. Chapter 4112, a supervisor/manager may be held jointly and/or severally liable with her/his employer for discriminatory conduct of the supervisor/manager in violation of R.C. Chapter 4112.\u201d Id. at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">{\u00b6 70} In this regard, R.C. Chapter 4112 differs from Title VII. It is well established that individuals, including supervisors, do not fall within the definition of an \u201cemployer\u201d under Title VII and, therefore, supervisors may not be held individually liable for their discriminatory conduct. E.g., <em>Wathen v. Gen. Elec. Co. </em>(C.A.6, 1997), 115 F.3d 400; <em>Mandell v. Cty. of Suffolk </em>(C.A.2, 2003) 316 F.3d 368; <em>Williams v. Banning </em>(C.A.7, 1995), 72 F.3d 552. Consequently, unlike the situation before us involving R.C. Chapter 4112, an aggrieved employee would find no occasion to settle a Title VII sexual-harassment claim against a supervisor, as the supervisor would be entitled to dismissal of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">{\u00b6 71} Under the framework of R.C. Chapter 4112, the liability of the supervisor is not based on his status as an agent of the company. Rather, a supervisor is liable because he, like the company for which he works, meets the statutory definition of an employer. This is reflected in the fact that a co-worker who engages in discriminatory conduct would not fall within the definition of an employer and, consequently, may not be held individually liable for his conduct. See, e.g., <em>Hale v. Dayton </em>(Feb. 8, 2002), Montgomery App. No. 18800, 2002 WL 191588 (firefighter, as a mere co-worker, was not individually liable under Chapter 4112); <em>Singer v. UAW Local Union 1112 </em>(Apr. 30, 2002), Trumbull App. No. 2001-T-0028, 2002 WL 818887 (co-worker could not independently violate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>R.C. Chapter 4112 \u201csince it does not address discrimination on the part of fellow employees in non-supervisory positions\u201d). R.C. 4112.02(A) expressly prohibits discriminatory conduct by employers, and R.C. 4112.99 provides a cause of action against employers who violate the chapter.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">{\u00b6 72} The state of Ohio, through R.C. Chapter 4112, has expressed a strong policy against discrimination, and the Supreme Court has construed the statute liberally to effectuate that policy. R.C. 4112.08; <em>Genaro, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 296, 703 N.E.2d 782. As stated in <em>Genaro:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">{\u00b6 73} \u201cThis court has noted in numerous cases the existence of a strong public policy against discrimination. A majority of this court have, time and time again, found there is no place in this state for any sort of discrimination no matter its size, shape, or form or in what clothes it might masquerade. This, of course, includes discrimination in the workplace. For instance, in <em>Helmick v. Cincinnati Word Processing, Inc. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 131, 133, 543 N.E.2d 1212, 1215, we stated that \u2018there appears to be little question that R.C. Chapter 4112 is comprehensive legislation designed to provide a wide variety of remedies for employment discrimination in its various forms.\u2019 * * * By holding supervisors and managers individually liable for their discriminatory actions, the antidiscrimination purposes of R.C. Chapter 4112 are facilitated, thereby furthering the public policy goals of this state regarding workplace discrimination.\u201d Id. at 296-297, 543 N.E.2d 1212.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-7\">{\u00b6 74} By recognizing that supervisors and managers fall within the definition of \u201cemployer,\u201d the Supreme Court deemed supervisors to be co-employers with the companies for whom they worked. The purpose of including supervisors and managers as employers was to expand the parties who could be held responsible for conduct that violated R.C. Chapter 4112 and to further the antidiscrimination goals of the statute \u2014 not to provide an escape clause for the employing company which, due to greater assets and resources, may be more willing to enter into and continue protracted litigation. To allow a settlement by the supervisor to release the company, both of whom are subject to liability under R.C. Chapter 4112 as co-employers, is contrary to the statutory framework and its antidiscriminatory goals.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-8\">{\u00b6 75} The Supreme Court of Ohio\u2019s holding in <em>Genaro </em>that a supervisor/manager may be held \u201cjointly and severally liable with her/his employer\u201d is consistent with this approach. When parties are jointly and severally liable, each defendant may be held liable. <em>Shoemaker v. Crawford </em>(1991), 78 Ohio App.3d 53, 66-67, 603 N.E.2d 1114. The plaintiff may obtain a judgment against any of the joint tortfeasors for the entire amount, and the tortfeasors may apportion their liability and seek contribution among themselves. Id. A settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>ment between one or more tortfeasors, with the plaintiff does not extinguish the plaintiffs claim against the remaining tortfeasors. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">{\u00b6 76} We hold that the settlement between Edwards and Webster did not extinguish Edwards\u2019s claim under R.C. Chapter 4112 against OICC.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">{\u00b6 77} The second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">{\u00b6 78} IV. \u201cThe trial court erred as a matter of law by denying OICC\u2019s motion for a new trial based on the improper statements made by appellee\u2019s counsel during closing argument.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">{\u00b6 79} In its fourth assignment of error, OICC challenges statements made by Edwards\u2019s counsel during closing argument. It claims that Edwards\u2019s counsel improperly accused OICC\u2019s witnesses of lying and OICC\u2019s trial counsel of suborning perjury.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">{\u00b6 80} Generally, trial counsel is entitled to considerable latitude in the presentation of closing argument. <em>Pang v. Minch </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 186, 559 N.E.2d 1313, paragraph two of the syllabus. The Supreme Court of Ohio has recognized, however, that abusive remarks and tactics can undermine the fairness of the trial and that the trial judge has a duty \u201cto see that counsel do not create an atmosphere which is surcharged with passion or prejudice and in which the fair and impartial administration of justice cannot be accomplished.\u201d <em>Pesek v. Univ. Neurologists Assn., Inc. </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 495, 721 N.E.2d 1011; see <em>Fehrenbach v. O\u2019Malley, </em>164 Ohio App.3d 80, 841 N.E.2d 350 (2005). \u201cWhen argument spills into disparagement not based on any evidence, it is improper.\u201d <em>Clark v. Doe </em>(1997), 119 Ohio App.3d 296, 307, 695 N.E.2d 276.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">{\u00b6 81} Ordinarily, in order to support a reversal of a judgment based on improper closing argument to the jury, it is necessary that counsel interject a proper and timely objection to the claimed improper remarks so that the court may take proper action thereon. <em>Snyder v. Stanford </em>(1968), 15 Ohio St.2d 31, 44 O.O.2d 18, 238 N.E.2d 563, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>Villella v. Waikem Motors, Inc. </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 36, 40, 543 N.E.2d 464. Thus, the determination of whether remarks made during closing argument exceeded the bounds of permissible argument is a discretionary function to be performed, in the first instance, by the trial court. <em>Pang, </em>at paragraph three of the syllabus. The trial court\u2019s determination is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">{\u00b6 82} However, \u201c \u2018[w]here gross and abusive conduct occurs, the trial court is bound, sua sponte, to correct the prejudicial effect of counsel\u2019s misconduct.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis deleted.) <em>Pesek, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 501, 721 N.E.2d 1011, quoting <em>Snyder, </em>15 Ohio St.2d at 37, 44 O.O.2d 18, 238 N.E.2d 563. If \u201c \u2018there is room for doubt, whether the verdict was rendered upon the evidence, or may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>have been influenced by improper remarks of counsel, that doubt should be resolved in favor of the defeated party.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 502, 721 N.E.2d 1011, quoting <em>Warder, Bushnell &amp; Glessner Co. v. Jacobs </em>(1898), 58 Ohio St. 77, 85, 50 N.E. 97.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">{\u00b6 83} In this case, neither counsel made any objections during the closing argument. Accordingly, to warrant reversal, the alleged improper remarks must have been sufficiently egregious to require the court to interject sua sponte. In our view, counsel\u2019s comments did not rise to that level.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">{\u00b6 84} As raised by OICC on appeal, Edwards\u2019s counsel explicitly asked the jury to consider that OICC\u2019s witnesses have \u201cnot been telling you the truth.\u201d The crux of Edwards\u2019s counsel\u2019s argument was that the witnesses for OICC\u2014 Caskey, Webster, Brandenburg, and Bumgardner \u2014 generally should not be believed and that Edwards should be believed. He emphasized that Caskey made several contradictions in her testimony and that Webster claimed not to recall whether he had asked Edwards to have sex with him. Edwards\u2019s counsel suggested that Dahdah had masterminded Edwards\u2019s termination and that she could have retrieved the e-mails if she had wanted to substantiate Edwards\u2019s harassment claims, and he asserted the OICC had fabricated the tardiness and dress-code violations to support Edwards\u2019s discharge. Edwards\u2019s counsel also emphasized that Edwards\u2019s testimony was consistent with her prior deposition. OICC\u2019s witnesses contradicted most facets of Edwards\u2019s testimony, including whether Edwards approached Caskey for assistance, whether Webster repeatedly sent sexually-harassing e-mails, whether Dahdah would fairly investigate Edwards\u2019s claim of sexual harassment, the ability to retrieve the e-mails from the computer, and Edwards\u2019s performance as an employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">{\u00b6 85} Although counsel may not make unwarranted attacks on a witness\u2019s character, it is not improper to characterize a witness as a liar or a claim as a lie if the evidence reasonably supports the characterization. See <em>State v. Baker, </em>159 Ohio App.3d 462, 467-468, 2005-Ohio-45, 824 N.E.2d 162, \u00b6 19. Here, as Edwards\u2019s counsel noted, whether Edwards\u2019s or OICC\u2019s witnesses were telling the truth was \u201cthe heart of this whole Jury trial. You can\u2019t really believe both sides * * The jury\u2019s verdict on Edwards\u2019s sexual-harassment claim was, in essence, an assessment of Edwards\u2019s credibility versus OICC\u2019s witnesses\u2019 credibility. Although Edwards\u2019s counsel made disparaging comments about OICC\u2019s witnesses and asserted that they were lying, the comments were tied to their testimony and were within the bounds of acceptable argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">{\u00b6 86} It bears noting that OICC\u2019s counsel took the same approach during its closing argument. Counsel argued that Edwards\u2019s testimony was contradicted by each of OICC\u2019s witnesses, that Edwards could have obtained proof of the harassment but did not, and that Edwards was \u201c[t]he only witness in here who had any motivation to lie to you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>{\u00b6 87} OICC further challenges Edwards\u2019s counsel\u2019s statement during his rebuttal argument that OICC\u2019s counsel \u201cshould have known that [people lie under oath for money] because he put witnesses on there to lie, but he didn\u2019t ask them that.\u201d Edwards\u2019s counsel later stated that OICC\u2019s witness \u201cweren\u2019t skillful at lying.\u201d We agree that Edwards\u2019s counsel skirted the line between acceptable closing argument and disparagement of opposing counsel. However, reading the closing argument as a whole, we do not conclude that Edwards\u2019s argument went beyond acceptable closing argument and warrants reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">{\u00b6 88} The fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">{\u00b6 89} III. \u201cThe verdict returned by the jury should be overturned because the amount of damages awarded to appellee was against the manifest weight of the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-7\">{\u00b6 90} V. \u201cThe trial court erred in denying OICC\u2019s motion for remitter [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-8\">{\u00b6 91} In its third assignment of error, OICC claims that the evidence presented at trial was insufficient to support an award of compensatory damages in the amount of $200,000. It argues that the jury\u2019s award \u201cwas gross and a shock to any sense of justice and fairness.\u201d In its fifth assignment of error, OICC contends that the trial court should have granted its motion for a remittitur because the damages were excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-9\">{\u00b6 92} Edwards testified that beginning in March 2003, Webster sent unwanted e-mails asking personal questions and involving sexual content. Ultimately, Webster was sending approximately 20 to 30 messages per day. Edwards indicated that the harassment made her \u201cfeel like a piece of meat\u201d and \u201cdegraded.\u201d She stated that her stress level went \u201cthrough the roof,\u201d she was a \u201cnervous wreck,\u201d and she worried about where Webster was going to go next and how she was going to stop it. Edwards stated that she could not sleep or eat, she developed stomach problems and her blood pressure became elevated (160 over 122). Edwards was provided medication for her stomach, and her doctor had recommended blood pressure medication. Edwards stated that she lost 25 pounds from the time the sexual harassment began until she was terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-10\">{\u00b6 93} In our view, the award of $200,000, while generous, was neither excessive nor against the manifest weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-11\">{\u00b6 94} The third and fifth assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-12\">{\u00b6 95} In light of our disposition of the first assignment of error, the judgment of the trial court is reversed and the matter is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-13\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b680-14\">Fain and Donovan, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
