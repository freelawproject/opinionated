Seven Hills Women\u2019s Health Centers, and Seven Hills Obstetrics and Gynecology Associates, Inc. (\u201cSeven Hills\u201d) for an initial pregnancy appointment. Strasel, who was obese, had a history of irregular menstrual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>cycles, and the date of her last cycle was undetermined. Strasel was the mother of two children, the oldest of which had been born with a birth defect.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">{\u00b6 2} The Seven Hills midwife scheduled Strasel for a sonogram on December 27, 2001, to confirm her due date. The sonogram showed a sac in Strasel\u2019s uterus, but the sonographer could not detect a heart beat or a fetal pole. The sonographer\u2019s report stated that she suspected a blighted ovum, a condition in which an empty placental sac develops in the uterus without a fetus. The report also stated that because of Strasel\u2019s obesity, the sonographer\u2019s ability to see was \u201climited.\u201d The sonographer stated in her report, \u201cI think a follow-up sonogram should be done.\u201d Seven Hills\u2019s midwife told Strasel that it appeared that she did not have a viable pregnancy. Strasel was told to go home and that she would be contacted later.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">{\u00b6 3} Defendant-appellant and cross-appellee Dr. Xavier G. Ortiz was given Strasel\u2019s medical file, including the sonographer\u2019s report and still photographs of the sonogram, to review. Dr. Ortiz saw an irregular tear-shaped gestational sac that apparently was without a fetal pole or a heartbeat. Dr. Ortiz diagnosed Strasel with a blighted ovum. Dr. Ortiz knew that Strasel was obese and that Strasel\u2019s body size had resulted in the sonographer\u2019s \u201climited ability to see.\u201d Dr. Ortiz knew that the sonographer had recommended a second sonogram. He also knew that there was a \u201cgreat disparity\u201d regarding the gestational age of Strasel\u2019s baby and that she had a history of irregular menstrual cycles. Dr. Ortiz did not examine Strasel.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">{\u00b6 4} Dr. Ortiz had the Seven Hills surgery scheduler reserve a time for Strasel to undergo a dilatation and curettage (\u201cD &amp; C\u201d) procedure the following morning. In a D &amp; C procedure, the cervix is opened, a suction device is placed in the uterus, and the contents of the uterus are suctioned out. Any tissue adhering to the uterine wall is \u201ccombed out,\u201d and the uterus is aspirated to remove any remaining contents. A D &amp; C procedure is essentially the same as an abortion procedure. Dr. Ortiz did not order a follow-up sonogram or blood tests to confirm whether Strasel was pregnant.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">{\u00b6 5} Strasel was contacted by the Seven Hills midwife, who told Strasel that she was not pregnant and that Dr. Ortiz wanted to talk to her about a D &amp; C. Before Dr. Ortiz spoke to Strasel, she was contacted by an anesthesiologist from Mercy Hospital Anderson to discuss the surgery, which had been scheduled for the next day. Later that day, Strasel and her husband, plaintiff Daniel Strasel, met with Dr. Ortiz to discuss the D &amp; C procedure. Strasel stated that when she questioned Dr. Ortiz about his diagnosis of a blighted ovum, he stated that he was certain of her condition. Dr. Ortiz never informed Strasel that the sonographer had recommended another sonogram or that other blood tests could confirm her pregnancy. Strasel stated that Dr. Ortiz told her it was difficult to schedule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>surgeries and that waiting could endanger her health. Strasel consented to a D &amp; C, which Dr. Ortiz performed the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">{\u00b6 6} For weeks after her surgery, Strasel experienced bleeding, discomfort, pain, cramping, and nausea. Strasel also began to suffer emotionally. Seven weeks after her surgery, Strasel still believed that she was pregnant, and she made an appointment at Seven Hills. After a positive blood test, Strasel was scheduled for a sonogram. The sonographer told Strasel that the sonogram revealed a 13-week-old fetus. Subsequently, Dr. Ortiz told Strasel that he had misdiagnosed her viable pregnancy as a blighted ovum. Strasel was told that the problems and complications that her baby might suffer as a result of the D &amp; C procedure were unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">{\u00b6 7} Strasel transferred her prenatal care to Dr. Patrick Marmion. Strasel consulted with a perinatologist to determine what problems her baby might have due to the D &amp; C. Strasel underwent a series of 11 additional sonograms to monitor her baby\u2019s progress. Strasel learned that the D &amp; C posed a serious risk of injury to her baby, and that it was impossible to determine what loss of limb or neurological problems the D &amp; C might have caused until after the baby was born.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">{\u00b6 8} Throughout the balance of her pregnancy, Strasel suffered from panic attacks related to her unrelenting fear of the harm that the D &amp; C might have caused to her baby. She had nightmares, and she was unable to function on a day-to-day basis. Strasel withdrew from her children, and she was unable to care for them as she had in the past. Strasel worried constantly about the condition of her unborn child. Strasel and her husband separated. She sought psychological treatment from a Dr. Reed and a Dr. Thompson.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">{\u00b6 9} Strasel delivered a healthy baby girl. But her fears for the baby\u2019s health did not subside. Strasel worried constantly about whether the baby would develop neurological problems. She had panic attacks. Strasel\u2019s anxiety caused her to fear that her baby might develop cystic fibrosis, and she continually licked the child\u2019s face to determine whether her skin was salty, because Strasel understood that salty skin was a symptom of cystic fibrosis.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-9\">{\u00b6 10} Psychologist Dr. Paul Deardorff examined and tested Strasel. Dr. Deardorff opined that Strasel suffered from major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, both of which had resulted from the D &amp; C procedure and the uncertainty about how it would affect her child. Dr. Deardorff stated at trial that Strasel required six to nine months of additional psychological treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">{\u00b6 11} Strasel and her husband filed suit for malpractice and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Strasel also requested punitive damages. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>case was referred to arbitration, where Strasel was awarded $210,000. Dr. Ortiz and Seven Hills appealed the arbitration award. The trial court directed a verdict in favor of Dr. Ortiz and Seven Hills on Strasel\u2019s claim for punitive damages. Following a trial, the jury returned a verdict of $372,000 in Strasel\u2019s favor. The jury found against Strasel\u2019s husband on his claims. Dr. Ortiz and Seven Hills filed motions for a new trial, for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, in the alternative, for remittitur, which the trial court denied. Strasel filed a motion for prejudgment interest, which the trial court denied after a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">{\u00b6 12} Dr. Ortiz and Seven Hills have appealed under case number C-050341 from the entry of judgment on the jury\u2019s verdict and from the trial court\u2019s judgment denying their post-trial motions. Strasel has filed a cross-appeal under case number C-050364 from the trial court\u2019s rulings denying her prejudgment interest and punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">{\u00b6 13} For their first assignment of error, Dr. Ortiz and Seven Hills allege that the trial court erred in allowing Strasel to file a claim for, present evidence of, and recover damages for psychological harm and emotional injuries that arose from the fear of a \u201cnon-existent peril.\u201d Dr. Ortiz and Seven Hills argue that because Strasel delivered a healthy baby, she could not recover for major depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder based upon her fear for the baby\u2019s well-being.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">{\u00b6 14} In <em>Heiner v. Moretuzzo,</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held that a plaintiff may not recover for negligent infliction of emotional distress \u201cwhere the defendant\u2019s negligence produced no actual threat of physical harm to the plaintiff or any other person.\u201d Heiner had been incorrectly told by health professionals that she had tested positive for HIV. After learning that she was HIV-negative, Heiner sued her physician for the emotional distress she had suffered as a result of the incorrect diagnosis. The Ohio Supreme Court held that Heiner could not recover on her claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress because she was not HIV-positive, and, therefore, her distress had been caused by a nonexistent peril.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">{\u00b6 15} This court followed <em>Heiner </em>in <em>Vogelsang v. Hwa-Shain </em>Yeh,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> holding that the plaintiff could not recover for negligent infliction of emotional distress where there was no showing that a bone graft the plaintiff had received was contaminated by the AIDS virus. All of Vogelsang\u2019s blood tests were negative, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>and there was no evidence to indicate that she had been exposed to the AIDS virus.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>Williams v. Warren Gen. Hosp.,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the plaintiff was denied recovery for negligent infliction of emotional distress where the initial diagnosis of cancer proved to be incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">{\u00b6 17} The Ohio Supreme Court held in <em>Dobran v. Franciscan Med. Ctr.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that the unfounded fear of metastasis of cancer cannot be the basis of a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress. Dobran\u2019s sentinel lymph nodes had consistently tested negative for metastasis. One portion of the lymph nodes had thawed before it reached its intended destination for more testing. The court pointed out that Dobran had not contracted cancer as a result of the defendant\u2019s negligence in allowing the sample to thaw and that if his cancer returned, it would not be because the defendant had placed Dobran in any physical harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">{\u00b6 18} We point out that none of the plaintiffs in any of the foregoing cases cited by Ortiz and Seven Hills were placed in any real danger by the alleged negligence of the defendants. Further, the alleged negligence of the defendants did not place any other person in real or impending physical danger. In this case, Strasel\u2019s baby was placed in actual physical peril by Ortiz\u2019s misdiagnosis and performance of the D &amp; C.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">{\u00b6 19} In <em>Paugh v. Hanks,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Ohio Supreme Court held that a mother had an actionable claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress where she was subjected to severe psychological harm due to three separate incidents in which a car had crashed into her house or yard, causing her to fear for the lives of her children. <em>Paugh </em>stated, \u201c[A] cause of action for the negligent infliction of serious emotional distress may be stated where the plaintiff-bystander reasonably appreciated the peril which took place, whether or not the victim suffered actual physical harm, and, that as a result of this cognizance or fear of peril, the plaintiff suffered severe emotional distress.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">{\u00b6 20} A father who feared that his daughter might have contracted AIDS when she stepped on a needle contaminated with blood from an unknown person and was told to return for a series of blood tests to determine whether she had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>been exposed to HIV fell \u201csquarely into the class of persons discussed by the <em>Paugh </em>court,\u201d because he was a bystander to his daughter\u2019s injury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">{\u00b6 21} A wife and daughter who tested positive for tuberculosis and who had been exposed to tuberculosis through the decedent, who had contracted the disease in his employment, stated a cause of action against the decedent\u2019s employer for negligent infliction of emotional distress even though they had not developed an active form of the disease, because a reasonable jury could have concluded that the employer had negligently inflicted emotional distress on the plaintiffs by causing them to fear the development of active tuberculosis. The wife and daughter had been exposed to a real danger even though the disease had not become active.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">{\u00b6 22} In this case, Strasel was clearly present when the D &amp; C was performed. It is uncontroverted that her baby was subjected to a real physical peril by the D &amp; C, regardless of whether the peril led to an actual injury. Strasel\u2019s emotional distress resulted from the very real risk of injury to a seven-week-old fetus subjected to what was the equivalent of an abortion procedure. The fact that the baby was born without any apparent physical injury did not alter the fact that the D &amp; C had subjected the baby to a very real danger. Strasel clearly appreciated the risk to her baby, and as a result of her recognition of the peril, she suffered psychological injuries that were compensable under <em>Paugh. </em>The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">{\u00b6 23} The second assignment of error, which alleges that the trial court erred in allowing Strasel\u2019s expert psychologist, Dr. Deardorff, to give unqualified testimony about the presence of birth defects in Strasel\u2019s child, is overruled. Dr. Deardorff testified exclusively about Strasel\u2019s psychological injuries. The references to the health of the child and the numerous trips to the emergency room were clearly elicited to show how Strasel\u2019s psychological problems manifested themselves. The testimony was not offered to show that the baby might experience any problem in the future. No claims were made for any future damages on behalf of the baby, and no such damages were awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">{\u00b6 24} The third assignment of error alleges that the trial court erred in allowing Dr. Deardorff to give \u201cnew undisclosed opinions at trial.\u201d Dr. Ortiz and Seven Hills argue that Dr. Deardorff s testimony about the many times Strasel had taken her baby to the emergency room and her fear that the child might develop cystic fibrosis constituted new undisclosed opinions. We disagree. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>we pointed out under the second assignment of error, Dr. Deardorffs testimony was elicited to show how Strasel\u2019s psychological problems manifested themselves. Dr. Deardorffs opinions regarding Strasel\u2019s psychological problems, the cause of those problems, and her need for future treatment were entirely consistent with his deposition testimony. Dr. Deardorff stated that his examination of Strasel in October 2004 confirmed his prior opinions about Strasel\u2019s emotional distress. His testimony did not inject a new theory into the case. The subject matter of Dr. Deardorffs opinions never changed, and Dr. Ortiz and Seven Hills could not have been surprised by the substance of his testimony.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\"> {\u00b6 25} The fourth assignment of error alleges that the trial court erred in admitting the expert testimony of Dr. Marmion, Strasel\u2019s treating physician, because Strasel did not establish that Dr. Marmion had devoted at least one half of his professional time to a qualifying activity pursuant to Evid.R. 601(D). Evid. R. 601(D) requires that an expert witness in a medical malpractice case devote \u201cat least one-half of his or her professional time to the active clinical practice in his or her professional field of licensure, or to its instruction in an accredited school.\u201d The purpose of the rule is to preclude testimony from physicians who are \u201cprofessional witnesses.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s decision regarding the competency of an expert witness will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">{\u00b6 26} The record reveals that Dr. Marmion was board certified in obstetrics and gynecology, as well as in preventative medicine; he was licensed to practice medicine in Ohio, California, and Washington; he was currently employed by the state of Washington at the Southwest Washington Medical Center as a consultant in obstetrics and gynecology for the Healthy Steps Prenatal Clinic; he had an appointment with the University of Washington Family Medicine Residency program; he previously had been engaged in private practice for 15 years in Cincinnati and Batavia; he had held clinical appointments at various hospitals in Cincinnati, including Good Samaritan, Christ, Jewish, Mercy Anderson, Mercy Fairfield, and Clermont Mercy; he had been Strasel\u2019s treating physician; from 1993 through 2003, he had been the administrator and clinician for Healthy Beginnings, Inc., a private nonprofit organization; and he had been an obstetrics and gynecology instructor at Good Samaritan and Bethesda hospitals. These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>facts supported the trial court\u2019s finding that Dr. Marmion was sufficiently involved in active clinical practice and/or teaching within the meaning of Evid.R. 601(D).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting Dr. Marmion\u2019s testimony. The fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">{\u00b6 27} For their fifth assignment of error, Dr. Ortiz and Seven Hills essentially allege that the trial court erred in overruling their motion for a new trial because the jury\u2019s verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence and because the damages awarded were excessive and/or were awarded under the influence of passion and prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">{\u00b6 28} Following a review of the record, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling the motion for a new trial on the basis that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence, because the verdict was supported by substantial competent, credible evidence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\"> {\u00b6 29} Dr. Ortiz and Seven Hills also argue that the trial court abused its discretion in overruling the motion for a new trial based upon the jury\u2019s award of excessive damages that were influenced by passion and prejudice. Damages are an issue within the province of the jury.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In this case, the trial court was in the best position to determine whether the award was so excessive that it must have been the result of passion and prejudice.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The burden was on Dr. Ortiz and Seven Hills to demonstrate that passion and prejudice played a role in the jury\u2019s determination.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> To support a finding of passion and prejudice, it must be demonstrated that the jury\u2019s assessment of damages was so overwhelmingly disproportionate as to shock reasonable sensibilities.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">{\u00b6 30} We find no indication in the record that the jury was influenced by passion and prejudice. The record contains substantial evidence to support the jury\u2019s damage award. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in overruling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>the motion for a new trial based on excessive damages. The fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">{\u00b6 31} In her cross-appeal, Strasel raises two assignments of error for our review. Strasel\u2019s first assignment of error alleges that the trial court erred in denying her motion for prejudgment interest because Dr. Ortiz and Seven Hills had not made a good-faith effort to settle the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">{\u00b6 32} R.C. 1343.03(C)(1) provides, \u201cIf, upon motion of any party to a civil action that is based on tortious conduct, that has not been settled by agreement of the parties, and in which the court has rendered a judgment, decree, or order for the payment of money, the court determines at a hearing held subsequent to the verdict or decision in the action that the party required to pay the money failed to make a good faith effort to settle the case and that the party to whom the money is to be paid did not fail to make a good faith effort to settle the case, interest on the judgment, decree, or order shall be computed[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cA party has not \u2018failed to make a good faith effort to settle\u2019 under R.C. 1343.03(C) if he has (1) fully cooperated in discovery proceedings, (2) rationally evaluated his risks and potential liability, (3) not attempted to unnecessarily delay any of the proceedings, and (4) made a good faith monetary settlement offer or responded in good faith to an offer from the other party. If a party has a good faith, objectively reasonable belief that he has no liability, he need not make a monetary settlement offer.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Whether a party has a good-faith objective belief that he has no liability must be strictly construed so as to carry out the purposes of R.C. 1343.03(C), which are to \u201cpromote settlement efforts, to prevent parties who have engaged in tortious conduct from frivolously delaying the ultimate resolution of cases, and to encourage good faith efforts to settle controversies outside a trial setting.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">{\u00b6 34} Under R.C. 1343.03(C), the phrase \u201cfailed to make a good faith effort to settle\u201d does not mean \u201cbad faith.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> A party may have failed to make a good-faith effort to settle even though he or she did not act in bad faith.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Wdiether a good-faith effort to settle a case has been made depends on whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>the amount of the settlement offer was based on an objectively reasonable belief about the party\u2019s liability and a rational evaluation of the risk of exposure.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">{\u00b6 35} One factor demonstrating whether a party has made a good-faith effort to settle is the disparity between the settlement offer and the amount of the jury verdict.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The insurance representative handling the claim for Dr. Ortiz and Seven Hills testified that the highest settlement offer made was $10,000. He also testified that it was his understanding that Strasel was \u201cnot interested\u201d in settling for \u201cless than six figures.\u201d Strasel had been awarded $210,000 in the arbitration. In response to the $10,000 offer, Strasel stated that she would be willing to accept $205,000, and that she would be willing to consider any offer made in good faith. The $210,000 arbitration award should have apprised Dr. Ortiz and Seven Hills that a verdict for Strasel was possible, if not probable.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The jury ultimately returned a $372,000 verdict in favor of Strasel.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">{\u00b6 36} An award of prejudgment interest is proper when \u201ca defendant \u2018just says no\u2019 despite a plaintiffs presentation of credible, medical evidence that the defendant physician fell short of the standard of professional care required of him, when it is clear that the plaintiff has suffered injuries, and when the causation of those injuries is arguably attributable to the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">{\u00b6 37} The record shows that Dr. Ortiz and Seven Hills failed to rationally evaluate and assess the risks of potential liability. We hold, as a matter of law, that the trial court should have awarded Strasel prejudgment interest and that the court\u2019s failure to award prejudgment interest was an abuse of discretion. Strasel\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained. This cause must be remanded for a determination of the amount of prejudgment interest to be awarded to Strasel.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">{\u00b6 38} Strasel\u2019s second assignment of error alleges that the trial court erred in granting the motion of Dr. Ortiz and Seven Hills for a directed verdict with respect to Strasel\u2019s claim for punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">{\u00b6 39} When ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court must construe the evidence most strongly in favor of the nonmoving party.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>recover punitive damages, Strasel had to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Dr. Ortiz\u2019s actions demonstrated malice.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Malice is defined as behavior characterized by hatred, ill will, or a spirit of revenge, or a conscious disregard for the rights and safety of other persons that has a great probability of causing substantial harm.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> We hold that Dr. Ortiz\u2019s conduct in this case did not rise to the level of malice required for an award of punitive damages. Strasel\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">{\u00b6 40} The judgment of the trial court denying Strasel\u2019s motion for prejudgment interest is reversed, and the cause is remanded for a determination of the amount of prejudgment interest to be awarded to Strasel. The trial court\u2019s judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b151-6\">Sundermann and Hendon, JJ.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b151-7\">Judge Rupert A.
