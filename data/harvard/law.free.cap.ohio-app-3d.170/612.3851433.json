Beginning in 1995, Beckler helped the elderly Knuckles with various tasks around his house, including yard work and home repairs. In April 2002, Knuckles was hospitalized. He was discharged after a short stay. Knuckles did not want to go into a nursing home; he preferred to stay in his home. From May 2002 through September 2002, Beckler spent nights at Knuckles\u2019s home and took care of all his personal needs. Beckler bathed and shaved Knuckles, brushed his teeth, cut his hair and nails, assisted him in the bathroom, emptied his bedpan, washed Knuckles\u2019s dishes and laundry, made his bed, prepared and served his meals, gave Knuckles his medicine, took him to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>doctor, watered his plants, and took out his garbage. Beckler also did Knuckles\u2019s banking and grocery shopping and continued to do Knuckles\u2019s home repairs and yard work.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">{\u00b62} In September 2002, Beckler told Knuckles that he could no longer continue to care for him because of the time that Knuckles\u2019s care was taking away from Beckler\u2019s family and work. Beckler stated that Knuckles had offered him \u201ceverything he owned\u201d if Beckler would continue to care for him. Beckler stated that Knuckles had shown him a bank statement for an account with a balance of approximately $120,000 and had promised Beckler that the arrangements for his payment would be made \u201cthrough paperwork.\u201d According to Beckler, Knuckles did not specifically state that the \u201carrangements for payment\u201d would be made in his will. Beckler agreed to continue to care for Knuckles and did so until Knuckles\u2019s death on January 16, 2004. At the request of one of Knuckles\u2019s relatives, Beckler mowed the lawn at Knuckles\u2019s home until August 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">{\u00b6 3} Knuckles\u2019s sister, Myrtle Hampton, was appointed administrator of his estate. Beckler submitted a claim against Knuckles\u2019s estate on January 17, 2005. The administrator rejected the claim. On April 14, 2005, Beckler filed a complaint in the common pleas court for payment of the claim. Beckler subsequently filed an amended complaint, alleging that the reasonable value of his services for Knuckles\u2019s \u201cpersonal care\u201d was $84,000, and that the reasonable value of his services for maintaining Knuckles\u2019s home was $24,550. The administrator filed a counterclaim, which is not the subject of this appeal. Myrtle Hampton died and her son, George \u201cSkip\u201d Bacon, was substituted as administrator of Knuckles\u2019s estate. The administrator filed a motion for summary judgment on the basis that Beckler\u2019s complaint had not been timely filed pursuant to R.C. 2117.12. The administrator\u2019s motion also essentially alleged that Beckler had not set forth any sustainable claim against the estate. The trial court granted the motion for summary judgment, but did not give any reasons for its ruling. Beckler has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-7\">{\u00b6 4} Beckler\u2019s sole assignment of error alleges that the trial court erred in granting the administrator\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">{\u00b6 5} Summary judgment is proper pursuant to Civ.R. 56(C) when (1) no genuine issue of material fact remains to be litigated, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) it appears from the evidence that reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and with the evidence viewed most strongly in favor of the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made, that conclusion is adverse to that party.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>{\u00b6 6} The party seeking summary judgment has the burden to show that no genuine issue of fact exists for trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Doubts must be resolved in favor of the nonmoving party.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellate review of the trial court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment is de novo.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">{\u00b6 7} Beckler first argues that there are genuine issues of material fact as to whether he timely filed his complaint under R.C. 2117.12. R.C. 2117.12 requires an action on a rejected claim to be filed within two months after the rejection. The purpose of requiring suit on rejected claims to be filed within two months of the rejection is to \u201cfacilitate the administration of estates and to permit them to be settled and disposed of without delay.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">{\u00b6 8} George Bacon stated in an affidavit that he had hand-delivered a copy of Myrtle Hampton\u2019s rejection letter to the Beckler residence and had stuck it in the front door on February 11, 2005. Bacon further stated that he had hand-delivered a second copy to the Beckler home on February 12, 2005, again sticking the letter in the front door. Beckler\u2019s complaint was filed on April 14, 2005. If Beckler had received the rejection letter on February 11 or February 12, 2005, his complaint would have been filed outside the two-month period following the rejection, and it would have been time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">{\u00b6 9} Beckler\u2019s wife, Pam, testified in her deposition, and the exhibits show, that she had signed for certified mail delivery of a copy of the rejection letter on February 15, 2005. Pam Beckler also testified that she had found a hand-delivered copy of the rejection letter in her door on President\u2019s Day of 2005. She specifically remembered that the letter had been hand-delivered on President\u2019s Day, because her daughter had been off from school. Pam Beckler was very clear in her testimony that she had found the hand-delivered copy of the rejection letter in her front door on President\u2019s Day. When she was asked by the administrator\u2019s counsel whether the rejection letter had been received on February 11, she stated that it had not. She further stated that the envelope containing the letter had had the words \u201chand delivered\u201d and the date written on it. She testified that no other copy of the letter had been left in her door. Toward the end of her deposition, the administrator\u2019s counsel, questioning Pam Beckler about the certified letter from Myrtle Hampton, asked, \u201cAnd was that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>letter received, that certified mail letter received, after this had been stuck in the door?\u201d Pam Beckler answered, \u201cYes.\u201d Beckler testified in his deposition that he did not remember when he had received the rejection letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">{\u00b6 10} Pam Beckler subsequently filed an affidavit in which she stated that President\u2019s Day in 2005 had fallen on Monday, February 21. Attached to the affidavit was a copy of the envelope in which the hand-delivered rejection letter had arrived. The front of the envelope read \u201cHand Delivered 2/21/05.\u201d Pam Beckler also stated in her affidavit that she had mistakenly said in her deposition that she had received the hand-delivered letter before she had received the certified letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">{\u00b6 11} Construing the evidence most strongly in favor of Beckler, we hold that genuine issues of material fact remain as to the date of delivery and receipt of the hand-delivered rejection letter. Bacon stated in his affidavit that he had hand-delivered copies of the rejection letter to Beckler\u2019s home on February 11 and February 12, 2005. It is undisputed that a certified-mail copy of the rejection letter was delivered to Beckler\u2019s home on February 15, 2005. A complete reading of Pam Beckler\u2019s deposition reveals that she was very clear in her testimony that she had received the hand-delivered copy of the rejection letter on February 21, 2005. If Beckler received a certified-mail copy of the rejection letter on February 15, 2005, and a hand-delivered copy of the rejection letter on February 21, 2005, then his April 14, 2005, complaint was timely filed. Therefore, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the administrator on the ground that Beckler\u2019s complaint was time-barred, because genuine issues of material fact remain as to the date of delivery and receipt of the hand-delivered rejection letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">{\u00b6 12} Further, because Beckler adequately pleaded and supported a claim for quantum meruit, we hold that the trial court erred in granting the administrator\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that Beckler had not set forth a viable claim against the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">{\u00b6 13} In <em>Brose v. Bartlemay</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>we stated, \u201cQuantum meruit is an equitable doctrine resting on the principle that an individual should not be permitted to unjustly enrich himself or herself at another\u2019s expense without making compensation or restitution for the benefits received.\u201d \u201cQuantum meruit is generally awarded when one party confers some benefit upon another without receiving just compensation for the reasonable value of services rendered.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Quantum meruit implies a promise to pay the reasonable value of services rendered or materials supplied by one person for another when the services or materials are knowingly and voluntarily accepted by the recipient.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The law presumes that the services or materials were given and received in the expectation of payment and implies a promise to pay what they are worth.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">{\u00b6 14} A plaintiff may recover in quantum meruit for the value of services rendered for the benefit of a decedent during his lifetime.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If the services are rendered under circumstances implying that they are not gratuitous, there is no fixed amount to be paid, and the recipient orally indicates that he will leave a legacy in his will in order to compensate the provider but fails to do so, the provider may recover for payment for the services in an action in quantum meruit.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The question of whether the services were provided gratuitously is a question of fact. In the absence of a family relationship between the decedent and the provider of the services, the presumption is that the person who performed the services is to be paid.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">{\u00b6 15} Beckler\u2019s complaint sets forth a demand for equitable relief and an amount for the value of his services. The claim is supported by his deposition and that of his wife. We hold that there exist genuine issues of material fact as to whether Beckler is entitled to recover in quantum meruit.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>{\u00b6 16} The assignment of error is sustained. The judgment of the trial court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings consistent with law and this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b659-6\">Sundermann, P.J., and Cunningham, J., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b659-7\">Ralph Winkler, retired, of the First Appellate District, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b655-9\">.
