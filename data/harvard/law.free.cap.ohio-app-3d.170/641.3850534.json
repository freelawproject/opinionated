R.P. McMurphy\u2019s Irish Pub.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">THE BUILDING PERMIT AND THE ZBA DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">{\u00b6 2} Pupeo owns R.P. McMurphy\u2019s Irish Pub in the Oakley neighborhood of Cincinnati. In 2005, Pupeo sought to expand the business by constructing a deck with an awning, columns, and a service driveway. The application for the permit listed the proposed use for the addition as a \u201ctavern.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">{\u00b63} The city\u2019s department of buddings and inspections approved Pupco\u2019s application. But after residents of the surrounding neighborhood voiced their opposition to the expansion, the ZBA vacated the permit. The ZBA held that the addition was an outdoor eating area that did not comply with the provisions of Cincinnati Municipal Code 1419-21, governing outdoor dining for \u201climited or full service restaurants.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL: RESTAURANT OR TAVERN?</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">{\u00b6 4} Pupeo appealed the ZBA\u2019s decision to the trial court under R.C. Chapter 2506. During the proceedings before the trial court, Pupeo vacillated between arguing that the proposed use for the addition was a restaurant that complied with Cincinnati Municipal Code 1419-21 and asserting that it was a drinking area that was not subject to that provision of the code.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">{\u00b6 5} The city argued that under the terms of the application, the proposed addition was to be used for serving alcoholic beverages. The city further argued that because the addition would be an outdoor addition, it could not be used for the sale and consumption of alcohol on the property, as the property was zoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">{\u00b6 6} The trial court overturned the ZBA\u2019s decision. The court held that R.P. McMurphy\u2019s was a limited-service restaurant and that the proposed expansion complied with Cincinnati Municipal Code 1419-21. The trial court accordingly reinstated the permit that the department of buildings and inspections had issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">THE INSTANT APPEAL: INDOOR OR OUTDOOR?</p>\n<p id=\"b682-13\">{\u00b6 7} In a single assignment of error, the city now argues that the trial court erred in reversing the decision of the ZBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-14\">{\u00b6 8} Under R.C. 2506.04, the common pleas courts and the courts of appeals apply different standards of review for administrative appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>{\u00b6 9} The common pleas court must determine if the order or decision of the administrative board or agency is \u201cunconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence on the whole record.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With respect to the assessment of the evidence, only when the record lacks a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence to support the agency\u2019s decision may the common pleas court reverse, vacate, modify, or remand.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">{\u00b6 10} In contrast, the standard of review for the court of appeals is limited to questions of law and \u201cdoes not include the same extensive power to weigh \u2018the preponderance of substantial, reliable and probative evidence,\u2019 as is granted to the common pleas court.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> When assessing the evidence, an appellate court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the common pleas court, except within its limited statutory scope of review, and is to determine only if the common pleas court abused its discretion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The term \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d means more than an error of law or judgment; it means that the trial court\u2019s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">{\u00b6 11} In this case, we hold that the trial court\u2019s decision was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">{\u00b6 12} One point of contention before the trial court was whether Pupeo intended to use the addition as a restaurant or a bar. Cincinnati Municipal Code 1419-21(d) provides that for an outdoor area to be considered part of a \u201climited or full service restaurant,\u201d \u201c[t]he provision of alcoholic beverages must be secondary and accessory to the provision of food.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">{\u00b6 13} Here, R.P. McMurphy\u2019s derived virtually all of its revenue from the sale of alcoholic beverages, and it offered only enough food to maintain its liquor license.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">{\u00b6 14} Although Pupeo at various times in the trial court proceedings announced plans to begin serving food at R.P. McMurphy\u2019s, those undefined plans did not transform the bar into a restaurant. The application for the addition listed the proposed use as \u201ctavern,\u201d and the record did not support a finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>it would be used as a \u201climited or full service restaurant\u201d under Cincinnati Municipal Code 1419-21. In light of these inconsistencies, Pupeo has apparently abandoned the argument that the addition would be used as a restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">{\u00b6 15} And Pupeo does not dispute that the operation of a tavern in an outdoor area is prohibited on its property. Accordingly, the only issue that remains is whether the proposed addition would be an indoor or outdoor area.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">{\u00b6 16} Our review of the plans and the photographs of the partially completed addition convinces us that it would be an outdoor area. The plans submitted with the permit application reflect that the only covering for the area would be an awning and not a permanent roof. Except for the exterior wall of the main building, the area would be completely without walls, permanent or otherwise, with only fiberglass columns supporting the awning. The only enclosure on three sides of the seating area would be a wrought-iron fence or raffing.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">{\u00b6 17} So, except for the awning, the addition would be almost completely open to the elements. It would therefore provide none of the barriers between the drinking area and the surrounding neighborhood that would protect residents from the potential noise and other disturbances that could arise from the operation of a tavern.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">{\u00b6 18} Under any reasonable definition of the term \u201coutdoor,\u201d the proposed addition would be an outdoor drinking area that would violate the municipal code. Accordingly, we sustain the assignment of error and hereby enter judgment denying Pupco\u2019s application for the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b684-9\">Hendon, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b684-10\">Painter, P.J., concurs separately.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b684-11\">Painter, P.J., concurring separately.</judges>\n<p id=\"b684-12\">{\u00b6 19} It has become the duty of this august court to decide whether something is indoors or outdoors.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-13\">{\u00b6 20} The city first approved the plans calling the deck indoors, and then took back the approval, calling it outdoors. Then the trial court reversed the takeback, holding that it didn\u2019t need doors, because it was a restaurant. Now we reverse the reversal of the reversal, because the place is clearly a bar; and a bar, we learn, can\u2019t be outdoors, at least where this one is.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-14\">{\u00b6 21} The city code section defining \u201cOutdoor Eating and/or Drinking Area\u201d would seem the place to look, and the pub here seems to fit this definition: \u201cA porch, patio, deck or other area used for consumption of food and/or beverages by the public which is not completely enclosed within the exterior building walls, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>windows and doors of a limited restaurant, full service restaurant or a drinking establishment and which may or may not have a solid roof cover.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> And everyone concedes that this use is not permitted on the subject property, hence the attempt to make outdoors in.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">{\u00b6 22} So this case is about attempting to avoid this definition by the lawyerly application of language to make one thing into another.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">\u201cWhen <em>I </em>use a word,\u201d Humpty Dumpty said, in a rather scornful tone, \u201cit means just what I choose it to mean, neither more nor less.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">\u201cThe question is,\u201d said Alice, \u201cwhether you <em>cm </em>make words mean so many different things.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\">\u201cThe question is,\u201d said Humpty Dumpty, \u201cwhich is to be master \u2014 that\u2019s all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGX\">Alice was too much puzzled to say anything; so after a minute Humpty Dumpty began again. \u201cThey\u2019ve a temper, some of them \u2014 particularly verbs: they\u2019re the proudest \u2014 adjectives you can do anything with, but not verbs\u2014 however, <em>I </em>can manage the whole lot of them! Impenetrability! That\u2019s what <em>I </em>say!\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-9\">\u201cWould you tell me, please,\u201d said Alice, \u201cwhat that means?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-10\">\u201cNow you talk like a reasonable child,\u201d said Humpty Dumpty, looking very much pleased. \u201cI meant by \u2018impenetrability\u2019 that we\u2019ve had enough of that subject, and it would be just as well if you\u2019d mention what you mean to do next, as I suppose you don\u2019t mean to stop here all the rest of your life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-11\">\u201cThat\u2019s a great deal to make one word mean,\u201d Alice said in a thoughtful tone. \u201cWhen I make a word do a lot of work like that,\u201d said Humpty Dumpty, \u201cI always pay it extra.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">{\u00b6 23} The question is this: Is someone drinking a beer on a deck covered by a roof (the awning) with only one side wall (the building) indoors or outdoors? The simplest resolution might be that, since there is no door at all, it would be impossible to be outdoors. But that would raise the question of whether installing a free-standing door would suffice. I fear not. Surely you have to go <em>out </em>a door somewhere to get to this deck \u2014 so does that make it outdoors? Maybe the problem is that you don\u2019t go <em>in </em>a door, so you can\u2019t be indoors on the deck.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-13\">{\u00b6 24} But where to draw the line? Surely glass walls would do, if they were on all sides (necessitating a door to go in or out of). But how about half- or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>three-quarter-walls. What if they open? Windows open, but just looking out a window doesn\u2019t make you outdoors.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">{\u00b6 25} The Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary defines \u201cindoor\u201d as \u201c1: of or relating to the interior of a building. 2: living, located, or carried on within a building.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That definition talks about buildings, so we jump there and find \u201ca usually roofed and walled structure built for permanent use (as for a dwelling).\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> So we could glean that the word \u201cindoors\u201d implies being in a building, and a building (usually) has walls and a roof.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">{\u00b6 26} The structure in question here arguably has a roof. A \u201croof\u2019 is \u201cthe cover of a building.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (I think a canvas roof is OK \u2014 though is someone who is in a tent indoors? They are surely not outdoors, whether or not the tent has a door.) But the deck doesn\u2019t have \u201cwalls\u201d \u2014 it just has one. So under the definition of \u201cindoor,\u201d it seems not to qualify.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">{\u00b6 27} But \u201coutdoor\u201d is \u201c1: of or relating to the outdoors. 2 a: performed outdoors <em>&lt;outdoor </em>sports&gt;, b: outdoorsy &lt;an <em>outdoor </em>couple&gt;. 3: not enclosed: having no roof &lt;an <em>outdoor </em>restaurant&gt;.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> So if not having a roof is the key, then the deck could be said to be indoors. But it\u2019s not the only key.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">{\u00b6 28} The city code actually does define \u201cbuilding\u201d (but not \u201cindoors\u201d or \u201coutdoors\u201d). It reads: \u201c \u2018Building\u2019 means a structure enclosed within exterior walls, built, erected and framed of a combination of materials, having a roof to form a structure for the shelter of persons, animals, or property of any kind and excluding any structure designed as a house-trailer or other type trailer.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> So it must have a roof and exterior walls and be \u201cof a combination of materials.\u201d Why a combination? So an igloo would not be a building, if it were only of ice. And what is the difference between \u201cbuilt,\u201d \u201cerected,\u201d and \u201cframed\u201d?</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">{\u00b6 29} But a roof and exterior walls make a building and there must be more than one wall. Just a roof does not make outdoors in. So I concur that the deck is \u201coutdoors,\u201d at least in its present state.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-10\">.
