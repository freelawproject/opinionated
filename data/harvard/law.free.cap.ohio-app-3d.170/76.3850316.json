The same day, the juvenile court held a shelter-care hearing and awarded CCDJFS predispositional temporary custody of the children. On November 30, 2003, the juvenile court adjudicated the children dependent and awarded temporary custody to CCDJFS. In addition, a case plan was implemented to reunify both appellant and the children\u2019s father, Rick N., with their children. Under the case plan, appellant was required to refrain from abusing drugs and alcohol, complete parent education, maintain stable employment, and maintain a stable residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">{\u00b6 3} On October 11, 2004, CCDJFS filed a motion to extend temporary custody. On October 14, 2004, the juvenile court found that appellant had made progress in her case plan for reunification with her children and extended the temporary-custody award to CCDJFS until March 10, 2005. On January 2, 2005, appellant substantially completed her case plan, and the juvenile court terminated the temporary-custody award and returned custody of the children to appellant, subject to protective supervision. On March 10, 2005, the juvenile court dismissed protective supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">{\u00b6 4} However, on August 5, 2005, CCDJFS again filed a motion for predispositional temporary custody after appellant was in an automobile accident and tested positive for marijuana and methamphetamine. The same day, the juvenile court held a shelter-care hearing and awarded CCDJFS predispositional temporary custody of the children. On October 6, 2005, CCDJFS filed a motion seeking permanent custody of the children. On November 2, 2005, appellant filed a motion requesting a rehearing on CCDJFS\u2019s August 5, 2005 motion requesting predispositional temporary custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">{\u00b6 5} On December 9, 2005, a magistrate held a hearing on CCDJFS\u2019s motion for permanent custody and appellant\u2019s motion for a rehearing. On March 14, 2006, the magistrate issued his decision with findings of fact and conclusions of law, in which he found that the children have been in the custody of one or more public children services agencies or private child placing agencies for 12 or more months of a consecutive 22-month period and that it is in the best interest of the children to permanently terminate parental rights and grant permanent custody <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>to CCDJFS. Appellant filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision, and the juvenile court affirmed the magistrate\u2019s decision in its entirety. Appellant appeals the juvenile court\u2019s decision, raising three assignments of error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">{\u00b6 6} In appellant\u2019s first assignment of error, she argues that the magistrate\u2019s decision does not satisfy her motion requesting findings of fact and conclusions of law after he denied her motion for a rehearing on CCDJFS\u2019s August 5, 2005 motion requesting predispositional temporary custody. Further, appellant maintains that the magistrate\u2019s decision on March 14, 2006 does not comply with Civ.R. 52 and 53. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">{\u00b6 7} Civ.R. 52 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">(\u00b6 8} \u201cWhen questions of fact are tried by the court without a jury, judgment may be general for the prevailing party unless one of the parties in writing requests otherwise before the entry of judgment pursuant to Civ.R. 58, or <em>not later than seven days after the party filing the request has been given notice of the court\u2019s announcement of its decision, </em>whichever is later, in which case, the court shall state in writing the conclusions of fact found separately from the conclusions of law.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">{\u00b6 9} Similarly, Civ.R. 53(D)(3)(a)(ii) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-9\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cSubject to the terms of the relevant reference, a magistrate\u2019s decision may be general unless findings of fact and conclusions of law are timely requested by a party or otherwise required by law. A request for findings of fact and conclusions of law shall be made before the entry of a magistrate\u2019s decision or <em>within seven days after the filing of a magistrate\u2019s decision. </em>If a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law is timely made, the magistrate may require any or all of the parties to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">{\u00b6 11} While appellant argues that she timely filed a motion requesting findings of fact and conclusions of law following the magistrate\u2019s decision denying her motion for a rehearing, the record does not support her contention. The record indicates that the magistrate denied appellant\u2019s motion for a rehearing from the bench on December 9, 2005. According to Civ.R. 52 and 53, appellant then had seven days to file a motion requesting findings of fact and conclusions of law. While appellant did file such a motion, she did not do so until December 30, 2005, which is beyond the deadline provided by the rule. Because appellant\u2019s motion was not timely filed, it is inconsequential that the magistrate\u2019s decision on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>March 14, 2006, did not include findings of fact and conclusions of law to support his previous decision on December 9, 2005. Accordingly, appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">{\u00b6 12} In appellant\u2019s second assignment of error, she argues that the juvenile court improperly awarded CCDJFS predispositional temporary custody at the August 5, 2005 shelter-care hearing. Appellant maintains that the juvenile court\u2019s ruling does not comply with Juv.R. 7 and argues that the court\u2019s ruling is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">{\u00b6 13} When a juvenile court makes an initial award of temporary custody during a shelter care hearing, it is guided by Juv.R. 7, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cA child taken into custody shall not be placed in detention or shelter care prior to final disposition unless any of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-8\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(1) Detention or shelter care is required:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-9\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(a) to protect the child from immediate or threatened physical or emotional harm; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-10\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c(b) to protect the person or property of others from immediate or threatened physical or emotional harm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-11\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(2) The child may abscond or be removed from the jurisdiction of the court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-12\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(3) The child has no parent, guardian, custodian or other person able to provide supervision and care for the child and return the child to the court when required;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-13\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(4) An order for placement of the child in detention or shelter care has been made by the court;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-14\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(5) Confinement is authorized by statute.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-15\">{\u00b6 22} Generally, the purpose of a shelter-care hearing is directed toward the prompt resolution of emergency custody issues, and the juvenile court\u2019s primary concern is for the immediate safety and protection of children. <em>In re Careuthers </em>(May 2, 2001), Summit App. No. 20272, 2001 WL 458681. A shelter-care decree \u201cis in no sense dispositive; it is interlocutory in nature, limited in scope and purpose, and temporary in duration. It responds to an emergency \u2014 the immediate physical needs of the child \u2014 until the court can fully inquire into the facts and decide what is best for the child. A shelter care order is no more than this.\u201d <em>In re Moloney </em>(1986), 24 Ohio St.3d 22, 25, 24 OBR 18, 492 N.E.2d 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-16\">{\u00b6 23} Appellant\u2019s argument is essentially that the juvenile court\u2019s decision granting CCDJFS predispositional temporary custody on August 5, 2005, was against the manifest weight of the evidence. When reviewing the weight of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>the evidence, an appellate court applies the same test in civil cases as it does in criminal cases. <em>Tewarson v. Simon </em>(2001), 141 Ohio App.3d 103, 115, 750 N.E.2d 176. A trial court\u2019s judgment is not against the manifest weight of the evidence if its judgment is supported by some competent, credible evidence going to all the essential elements of the case. <em>C.E. Morris Co. v. Foley Constr. Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 279, 8 O.O.3d 261, 376 N.E.2d 578, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">{\u00b6 24} Evaluating and assessing evidence are the primary functions of the trier of fact, not an appellate court. <em>Yuhasz v. Mrdenovich </em>(1992), 82 Ohio App.3d 490, 492, 612 N.E.2d 763. The trier of fact has the best opportunity to view witnesses, observe their demeanor, gestures, and voice inflections, and, ultimately, determines their credibility. <em>Seasons Coal Inc., v. Cleveland </em>(1984), 10 Ohio St.3d 77, 80, 10 OBR 408, 461 N.E.2d 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">(\u00b6 25} Appellant maintains that at the time of the shelter-care hearing, the children were safely in the custody of her husband, Donald Malicote, and that there was no justification for their removal from his custody under Juv.R. 7. According to the record, appellant had tested positive for marijuana and methamphetamine, and Donald had left the children with Rick N. in violation of the juvenile court\u2019s order that he have no unsupervised visitation with the children. Considering the nature of shelter-care hearings, when the primary emphasis is to ensure the safety of the children, we cannot say that the juvenile court\u2019s decision is against the manifest weight of the evidence. Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">{\u00b6 26} In appellant\u2019s third assignment of error, she argues that the juvenile court erred in granting CCDJFS\u2019s motion for permanent custody. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">{\u00b6 27} Before a natural parent\u2019s constitutionally protected liberty interest in the care and custody of her child may be terminated, the state is required to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the statutory standards for permanent custody have been met. <em>Santosky v. Kramer </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 745, 759, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599. An appellate court\u2019s review of a juvenile court\u2019s decision finding clear and convincing evidence is limited to whether sufficient credible evidence exists to support the juvenile court\u2019s determination. <em>In re Starkey, </em>150 Ohio App.3d 612, 2002-Ohio-6892, 782 N.E.2d 665, \u00b6 16. A reviewing court will reverse a finding by the juvenile court that the evidence was clear and convincing only if there is a sufficient conflict in the evidence presented. <em>In re Rodgers </em>(2000), 138 Ohio App.3d 510, 520, 741 N.E.2d 901.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">{\u00b6 28} R.C. 2151.414(B) requires the juvenile court to apply a two-part test when terminating parental rights and awarding permanent custody to a children services agency. Specifically, the trial court must find that (1) the grant of permanent custody to the agency is in the best interest of the children, utilizing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>in part, the factors of R.C. 2151.414(D); and, (2) any of the following apply: the child cannot be placed with either parent within a reasonable time or should not be placed with either parent; the child is abandoned; the child is orphaned; or the child has been in the temporary custody of the agency for at least 12 months of a consecutive 22-month period. R.C. 2151.414(B)(1)(a), (b), (c) and (d); <em>In re Ebenschweiger, </em>Butler App. No. CA2003-04-080, 2003-Ohio-5990, 2003 WL 22533124, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">{\u00b6 29} Under R.C. 2151.414(B)(1), when a child has been in temporary custody for at least 12 months of a consecutive 22-month period, a juvenile court is required to find by only clear and convincing evidence that permanent custody is in the child\u2019s best interest. <em>In re L.D., </em>Clinton App. No. CA2004-03-007, 2004-Ohio-4000, 2004 WL 1717680, \u00b6 14-15. The juvenile court found, and appellant does not dispute, that the children had been in the temporary custody of CCDJFS for more than 12 months of a consecutive 22-month period.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">{\u00b6 30} Accordingly, we must determine whether there was clear and convincing evidence that granting the motion for permanent custody was in the children\u2019s best interest. R.C. 2151.414(D) provides that in considering the best interest of a child in a permanent custody hearing, \u201cthe court shall consider all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">{\u00b6 31} \u201c(1) The interaction and interrelationship of the child with the child\u2019s parents, siblings, relatives, foster caregivers and out-of-home providers, and any other person who may significantly affect the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c(2) The wishes of the child, as expressed directly by the child or through the child\u2019s guardian ad litem, with due regard for the maturity of the child;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c(3) The custodial history of the child, including whether the child has been in the temporary custody of one or more public children services agencies or private child placing agencies for twelve or more months of a consecutive twenty-two month period ending on or after March 18,1999;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-10\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c(4) The child\u2019s need for a legally secure permanent placement and whether that type of placement can be achieved without a grant of permanent custody to the agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-11\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c(5) Whether any of the factors in divisions (E)(7) to (11) of this section apply in relation to the parents and child.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">{\u00b6 36} After reviewing the record, we find that the juvenile court erred in granting CCDJFS\u2019s motion for permanent custody. While a juvenile court is not required to enumerate and discuss every statutory factor listed in R.C. 2151.414(D) when making a best-interest determination, there must be some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>indication in the record that the court at least considered all of the required factors. The juvenile court\u2019s decision granting CCDJFS\u2019s motion for permanent custody is a loosely organized discussion of its findings without a single citation of a statutory factor. Because the juvenile court\u2019s decision is devoid of any reference to the applicable statutes, we must attempt to infer from the court\u2019s findings which factors, if any, it considered in granting CCDJFS\u2019s motion for permanent custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">{\u00b6 37} The juvenile court\u2019s decision does indicate that it considered the children\u2019s relationship with their mother and their foster caregivers, as required by R.C. 2151.414(D)(1). Specifically, the court found that \u201c[t]he strong bond between [appellant] and her children was verified by nearly every witness at trial.\u201d Later in its decision, the court found that \u201c[t]he children\u2019s [foster] care givers do not want to adopt them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">{\u00b6 38} However, there is no indication that the trial court considered the wishes of the children, either expressed by them directly or by their guardian ad litem (\u201cGAL\u201d) as required by R.C. 2151.414(D)(2). Although the GAL filed a report, there is no indication in the juvenile court\u2019s decision that the court considered the GAL\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">{\u00b6 39} The juvenile court properly considered the children\u2019s custodial history pursuant to R.C. 2151.414(D)(3). The court found that \u201c[the children] were originally removed from their home on November 12, 2003 * * *. They were adjudicated dependent on November 20, 2003 and temporarily committed to the custody of [CCDJFS]. [CCDJFS] placed them on leave with the mother on November 24, 2004. Custody was returned to [appellant] subject to protective supervision on January 6, 2005. Protective supervision was terminated on March 10, 2005. * * * The children were again removed from [appellant\u2019s] custody on August 5, 2005 pursuant to [CCDJFS\u2019s] motion. [The children] were placed in the custody of [CCDJFS] by Entry filed on August 5, 2005. * * *. The Motion for Permanent Custody was filed on October 6, 2005.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">{\u00b6 40} Also, it appears that the juvenile court considered R.C. 2151.414(D)(4) in finding that \u201c[t]he children need the kind of legally secure permanent placement that can be achieved by a grant of permanent custody to [CCDJFS].\u201d However, the court\u2019s finding does not properly address this statutory factor. The statute does not require a juvenile court to consider whether an agency can provide the type of legally secure permanent placement the children need. Rather, the statute requires a juvenile court to consider whether the children\u2019s need for legally secure permanent placement <em>can be achieved without a grant of </em>permanent custody to the agency. The difference is that the statute does not require the court to consider whether an agency can provide the necessary legally secure permanent placement, but instead requires the court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>consider whether granting permanent custody is the only way the children\u2019s need for such placement can be achieved. Accordingly, the juvenile court\u2019s finding with respect to R.C. 2151.414(D)(4) is in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">{\u00b6 41} Further, we are unable to discern whether the juvenile court considered R.C. 2151.414(D)(5), which requires the court to consider whether any of the factors in R.C. 2151.414(E)(7) to (11) apply in relation to the parent and children. The court made several findings related to appellant\u2019s continued drug-abuse problems, which could indicate that the court considered R.C. 2151.414(E)(9). The factor listed in R.C. 2151.414(E)(9) is whether \u201c[t]he parent has placed the child at substantial risk of harm two or more times due to alcohol or drug abuse and has rejected treatment two or more times or refused to participate in further treatment two or more times * * However, the record indicates that appellant has not refused drug-abuse treatment, but in fact successfully completed drug-abuse treatment pursuant to her case plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">{\u00b6 42} As we have discussed, the juvenile court\u2019s decision is not sufficiently detailed for this court to determine whether the juvenile court properly considered the statutory factors required to find that granting permanent custody to CCDJFS is in the children\u2019s best interest. Accordingly, we reverse the juvenile court\u2019s decision granting permanent custody to CCDJFS and remand this cause to the juvenile court to properly consider the requisite statutory factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">{\u00b6 43} In doing so, we remind the juvenile court that \u201ca parent\u2019s right to the custody of his or her child has been deemed \u2018paramount.\u2019 <em>In re Perales </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 89, 97, 6 O.O.3d 293, 369 N.E.2d 1047. Permanent termination of parental rights has been described as \u2018the family law equivalent of the death penalty in a criminal case.\u2019 * * * Therefore, parents \u2018must be afforded every procedural and substantive protection the law allows.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Hayes </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 46, 48, 679 N.E.2d 680, quoting <em>In re Smith </em>(1991), 77 Ohio App.3d 1, 16, 601 N.E.2d 45. Given the magnitude of a decision to permanently terminate parental rights, a decision granting permanent custody must indicate which statutes apply and which factors it has considered and should reflect the court\u2019s careful and thorough analysis in reaching such a decision. Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b125-9\">Powell, P.J., and Walsh, J., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-11\">. The children\u2019s father, Rick N., did not complete his case plan, attend the permanent custody hearing or otherwise respond to CCDJFS\u2019s motion for permanent custody, file objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision, or appeal the juvenile court's decision granting the motion for permanent custody.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
