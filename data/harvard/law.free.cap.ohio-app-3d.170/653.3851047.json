This court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b695-14\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>The instant matter presents a convoluted procedural history. On October 17, 2002, Evanich filed a complaint to quiet title in the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas. The complaint alleged that Evanich had gained title to a portion of Bridge\u2019s property by adverse possession. On July 27, 2004, a bench trial was held, and on September 14, 2004, the trial court issued its decision finding that Evanich had established the elements of adverse possession, and the court entered judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-15\">{\u00b6 3} On September 17, 2004, Bridge appealed the judgment of the trial court. This court reversed and remanded the matter because it was not clear from the judgment entry \u201cwhat evidentiary burden the trial court applied to the facts and evidence presented at trial and upon which it based its final decision.\u201d <em>Evanich v. Bridge (\u201cEvanich I\u201d), </em>9th Dist. No. 04CA008566, 2005-Ohio-2140, 2005 WL 1026966, at \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-16\">{\u00b6 4} On remand, the trial court conducted an additional hearing, at which Evanich presented the testimony of Christopher Hirzel, a registered surveyor. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>On September 30, 2005, the trial court determined that Evanich had established the elements of adverse possession by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">{\u00b6 5} Bridge has timely appealed asserting three assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">The trial court erred as a matter of law when it determined that the appellees had gained title by adverse possession to a portion of the appellants\u2019 land.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-10\">{\u00b6 6} Bridge has first argued that the trial court incorrectly determined that Evanich had established the elements of adverse possession. Specifically, Bridge has argued that the trial court failed to apply the necessary element of \u201cintent to claim title\u201d when determining that Evanich\u2019s possession of Bridge\u2019s property was adverse. This court disagrees with Bridge\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">{\u00b6 7} When this court reviews a trial court\u2019s determination that the elements of adverse possession have been met, it \u201c \u2018will not reverse the judgment of the trial court as being against the manifest weight of the evidence if the judgment is based upon some competent, credible evidence that speaks to all of the material elements of the case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Galehouse v. Geiser, </em>9th Dist. No. 05CA0037, 2006-Ohio-766, 2006 WL 401276, at \u00b6 10, quoting <em>Morris v. Andros, </em>158 Ohio App.3d 396, 2004-Ohio-4446, 815 N.E.2d 1147, at \u00b6 18.

Koch </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 577, 579, 692 N.E.2d 1009. Adverse possession must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. Id. Clear and convincing evidence is that proof which establishes in the minds of the trier of fact a firm conviction as to the allegations sought to be proved. <em>Cross v. Ledford </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 469, 477, 53 O.O. 361, 120 N.E.2d 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">{\u00b6 9} This court finds that the trial court\u2019s judgment was supported by competent and credible evidence speaking to all of the material elements of adverse possession. The record indicates that Evanich first made use of the disputed property in 1967. This use continued exclusively for 35 years until 2002, when Bridge conducted a survey and discovered the encroachment. Evanich\u2019s use was open and notorious, as \u201cthe use of the disputed property [was] without attempted concealment\u201d and was \u201cso patent that the true owner of the property could not be deceived as to the property\u2019s use.\u201d <em>Hindall v. Martinez </em>(1990), 69 Ohio App.3d 580, 583, 591 N.E.2d 308. See, also, <em>Hudkins v. Stratos, </em>9th Dist. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>No. 22188, 2005-Ohio-2155, 2005 WL 1026537, at \u00b6 8, citing <em>Hindall. </em>It is clear from the record that Evanich did not conceal the use of the property, and the use was readily apparent to Bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">{\u00b6 10} Further, Evanich\u2019s use was adverse. Bridge has argued against this conclusion, but the arguments are unpersuasive. This court has held that \u201c[ajdverse or hostile use is any use inconsistent with the rights of the title owner.\u201d <em>Vanasdal v. Brinker </em>(1985), 27 Ohio App.3d 298, 27 OBR 343, 500 N.E.2d 876, citing <em>Kimball v. Anderson </em>(1932), 125 Ohio St. 241, 181 N.E. 17. According to the record, Evanich erected a split-rail fence, installed raised planting beds composed of treated railroad ties, planted bushes, flowers, and at least one tree, installed large sandstone blocks, and eventually replaced the split-rail fencing with wrought iron fencing. Making significant aesthetic and structural improvements to the land was certainly inconsistent with Bridge\u2019s rights. Moreover, contrary to Bridge\u2019s assertions, the type of landscaping at issue in this matter is sufficient to satisfy the adversity requirement of adverse possession. That is, Evanich\u2019s use was \u201csuch use as would be made of that land by the owner.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">{\u00b6 11} While concededly there are cases supporting the contention that \u201cminor landscaping\u201d is insufficient to satisfy adverse use, the cases cited by Bridge generally involved activities such as mowing the lawn, pulling weeds, or minor landscaping, such as planting shrubs or flowers. However, in the present case, Evanich\u2019s use involved more than simply planting some flower beds or mowing the lawn. It entailed erecting fencing, installing treated railroad ties as flower beds, and imbedding large sandstone blocks in the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">{\u00b6 12} Bridge has also argued that Evanich did not have the necessary intent to claim title as required by <em>Grace, </em>81 Ohio St.3d 577, 692 N.E.2d 1009. In support of his argument, Bridge has pointed to Evanich\u2019s testimony in which he explicitly stated that he never intended to encroach on Bridge\u2019s property. On appeal, Evanich has argued that he did not form the requisite intent because he was under the mistaken impression that the property belonged to him, not to Bridge. It is undisputed that both parties believed that the land in question belonged to Evanich.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">{\u00b6 13} In making this argument, Bridge has essentially contended that the trial court failed to properly apply the law in the case, i.e., that the trial court failed to apply intent as a requisite element of adversity. This is a challenge to the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions and accordingly, this court will review it de novo. <em>N. Ridgeville v. Hummel, </em>9th Dist. No. 04CA008513, 2005-Ohio-595, 2005 WL 356791, at \u00b6 16. While <em>Grace </em>does appear to require a form of specific intent with regard to adverse use, it is important to note that <em>Grace </em>did not deal with a case of mutual mistake, as presented in the matter before this court. Furthermore, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>the cases from this appellate district in which <em>Grace\u2019s </em>intent requirement was used, neither involved mutual mistake. See <em>Morris, </em>158 Ohio App.3d 396, 2004-Ohio-4446, 815 N.E.2d 1147; <em>Bohaty v. Centerpointe Plaza Assoc. Ltd. Partnership </em>(Feb. 20, 2002), 9th Dist. No. 3143-M, 2002 WL 242113.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">{\u00b6 14} This court has previously held that the doctrine of adverse possession protects the adverse possessor in the case of mutual mistake. See <em>Vanasdal, </em>27 Ohio App.3d at 299, 27 OBR 343, 500 N.E.2d 876. \u201cThe doctrine of adverse possession protects one who has honestly entered and held possession in the belief that the land was his own, as well as one who knowingly appropriates the land of others <em>for the purpose of acquiring title.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Id. This view has been espoused by numerous districts, even in the wake of <em>Grace. </em>See, e.g., <em>Patton v. Ditmyer, </em>4th Dist. Nos. 05CA12, 05CA21, 05CA22, 2006-Ohio-7107, 2006 WL 3896780, at \u00b6 48; <em>Franck v. Young\u2019s Suburban Estates, </em>Inc., 6th Dist. No. OT-02-040, 2004-Ohio-1650, 2004 WL 628979, at \u00b6 19; <em>Beener v. Spahr </em>(Dec. 15, 2000), 2d Dist. No. 2000-CA-40, 2000 WL 1840066.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">{\u00b6 15} As <em>Grace </em>did not deal with a case of mutual mistake, this court cannot say that its holding abrogated the longstanding principle that adverse possession protects an adverse possessor who in good faith believes that he is utilizing his own property. Accordingly, this court finds that Evanich used the disputed property exclusively, openly, notoriously, continuously, and adversely for a period of 21 years. Therefore, Evanich satisfied all of the elements of adverse possession by clear and convincing evidence, and the trial court did not err in granting judgment to Evanich.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">{\u00b6 16} Bridge\u2019s first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR II</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">The trial court erred as a matter of law when it exceeded the scope of the</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">appellate court\u2019s mandate on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-11\">{\u00b6 17} In the second assignment of error, Bridge has argued that the trial court exceeded this court\u2019s mandate on remand by conducting a hearing at which it took evidence from a new surveyor hired by Evanich and accepted into evidence a new survey map of the encroachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-12\">{\u00b6 18} It is well established that \u201c \u2018[a] trial court must follow the mandate of the appellate court.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Pendergrass, </em>9th Dist. No. 04CA008437, 2004-Ohio-5688, 2004 WL 2390092, at \u00b6 9, quoting <em>Pingue v. Hyslop, </em>10th Dist. No. 01AP-1000, 2002-Ohio-2879, 2002 WL 1222616, \u00b6 22. This court has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-13\">When this Court, as is its customary practice, remands a case for further proceedings, this does not necessarily mean that we order some sort of hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>to be held upon remand. Rather, this language simply designates that the case is to return to the trial court to \u201ctake further action in accordance with applicable law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Id. at \u00b6 10, quoting <em>Chapman v. Ohio State Dental Bd. </em>(1986), 33 Ohio App.3d 324, 328, 515 N.E.2d 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">{\u00b6 19} Further, an appellate court may or may not specify the nature of the further proceedings, and in fact, should not do so if the trial court has the discretion as to the nature of the remand proceedings. Id., citing <em>State v. Chinn </em>(Aug. 21, 1998), 2d Dist. No. 16764, 2000 WL 1458784 (Grady, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">{\u00b6 20} In <em>Evanich I, </em>this court determined that the trial court\u2019s judgment entry granting adverse possession to Evanich failed to adequately describe the property and remanded for proceedings consistent with the opinion. This court did not specify the nature of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-10\">{\u00b6 21} Bridge has argued that a hearing was unnecessary under <em>Pendergrass. </em>However, this court notes that <em>Pendergrass </em>states that a remand for further proceedings \u201cdoes not necessarily mean\u201d that a hearing need be held. However, <em>Pendergrass </em>does not preclude the trial court from conducting a hearing in the absence of specific instructions from the appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-11\">{\u00b6 22} Bridge has also argued that this court cited <em>Oeltjen v. Akron Associated Invest. Co. </em>(1958), 106 Ohio App. 128, 6 O.O.2d 399, 153 N.E.2d 715, for an appropriate way to correct the error on remand. This argument misconstrues our mandate. This court cited <em>Oeltjen </em>for the proposition that a legal description of the encroachment should be incorporated into the trial court\u2019s judgment entry quieting title to the adverse possessor. In fact, in <em>Oeltjen, </em>this court simply directed counsel for the adverse possessor to procure a survey to be incorporated into the judgment entry. In the instant matter, the record indicates that Evanich did just that: procured a survey to be incorporated into the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-12\">{\u00b6 23} Ultimately, this court did not direct the trial court to incorporate a specific survey, nor did it direct the trial court to simply incorporate a survey without holding a hearing. Under our mandate in <em>Evanich I, </em>the trial court was given the discretion to proceed in accordance with our opinion and the applicable law. This court cannot find that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing a new survey of the encroachment to be presented on remand. Further, this court cannot say that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing the surveyor to testify as to the survey where Bridge had ample opportunity to cross-examine.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-13\">{\u00b6 24} Bridge\u2019s second assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR III</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b700-5\">The trial court erred as a matter of law in not determining that public policy interests precluded application of the adverse possession doctrine to statutorily platted residential subdivisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">{\u00b6 25} In the third assignment of error, Bridge has argued that the trial court erred in not determining that public policy considerations precluded application of the adverse-possession doctrine to statutorily platted residential subdivisions. This court finds that Bridge\u2019s argument is barred by the doctrine of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">{\u00b6 26} Under the doctrine of res judicata, any \u201c \u2018issue that could have been raised on direct appeal and was not is res judicata and not subject to review in subsequent proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re S.J., </em>9th Dist. No. 23199, 2006-Ohio-6381, 2006 WL 3498599, at \u00b6 14, quoting <em>State v. Saxon, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 176, 2006-Ohio-1245, 846 N.E.2d 824, at \u00b6 16. See, also, Grava <em>v. Parkman Twp. </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 379, 653 N.E.2d 226, at syllabus. Moreover, \u201c \u2018[w]here an argument could have been raised on an initial appeal, res judicata dictates that it is inappropriate to consider that same argument on a second appeal following remand.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re S.J., </em>2006-Ohio-6381, 2006 WL 3498599, at \u00b6 14, quoting <em>State v. D\u2019Ambrosio </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 141, 143, 652 N.E.2d 710. See, also, <em>State v. Gillard </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 548, 549, 679 N.E.2d 276 (on appeal after remand, \u201cnew issues\u201d are barred by the doctrine of res judicata). \u201cRes judicata promotes the principle of finality of judgments by requiring plaintiffs to present every possible ground for relief in the first action.\u201d <em>Kirkhart v. Keiper, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 377, 2004-Ohio-1496, 805 N.E.2d 1089, at \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">{\u00b6 27} In the case sub judice, Bridge could have raised the argument proposed in this assignment of error on the initial appeal, but did not. Bridge has argued in the current appeal that this public policy argument was presented at trial and that the trial court erred in dismissing it. Yet Bridge chose not to raise the public policy issue on the initial appeal. Therefore, Bridge is barred from raising this argument on appeal, after remand, by the doctrine of res judicata.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">{\u00b6 28} Bridge\u2019s third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b700-13\">{\u00b6 29} Bridge\u2019s three assignments of error are overruled. The judgment of the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-14\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Moore, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b701-5\">Slaby, P.J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b701-6\">Slaby, Presiding Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ANRh\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">{\u00b6 30} I respectfully dissent from the majority because I would find that the adversity element for adverse possession requires a specific intent to use another\u2019s property as one\u2019s own and adverse to the true owner\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">{\u00b6 31} Initially, I would address the issue of the applicable standard of review. Normally, when this court reviews a trial court\u2019s determination that the elements of adverse possession have been met, it \u201cwill not reverse the judgment of the trial court as being against the manifest weight of the evidence if the judgment is based upon some competent, credible evidence that speaks to all of the material elements of the case.\u201d <em>Galehouse v. Geiser, </em>9th Dist. No. 05CA0037, 2006-Ohio-766, 2006 WL 401276, at \u00b6 10, quoting <em>Morris v. Andros, </em>158 Ohio App.3d 396, 2004-Ohio-4446, 815 N.E.2d 1147, at \u00b6 18. See, also, <em>Heiney v. Godwin, </em>9th Dist. No. 22552, 2005-Ohio-5659, 2005 WL 2758487, at \u00b6 13. However, when an appellant challenges a trial court\u2019s legal conclusions, this court affords them no deference and reviews them de novo. <em>Morris </em>at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">{\u00b6 32} Specifically, Bridge has made the argument that intent to claim title is an essential element of adversity pursuant to <em>Grace v. Koch </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 577, 692 N.E.2d 1009, and that the trial court erred as a matter of law when it found that Evanich adversely used his property despite evidence that Evanich had absolutely no intent to claim title to the disputed tract. Essentially, Bridge\u2019s argument is that the trial court failed to correctly apply the law, to wit, the intent test for adversity; and such an argument clearly falls within the realm of a legal challenge. Accordingly, I would apply the de novo standard of review. <em>Morris, </em>158 Ohio App.3d 396, 2004-Ohio-4446, 815 N.E.2d 1147, at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cTo acquire title by adverse possession, the party claiming title must show exclusive possession and open, notorious, continuous, and adverse use for a period of twenty-one years.\u201d <em>Grace, </em>81 Ohio St.3d at 579, 692 N.E.2d 1009. In <em>Grace, </em>the Supreme Court added that for possession to be adverse \u201c \u2018there must have been an intention on the part of the person in possession to <em>claim title, so manifested </em>by his declarations or his acts, that a failure of the owner to prosecute within the time limited, raises a presumption of an extinguishment or a surrender of his claim.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Grace, </em>81 Ohio St.3d at 581, 692 N.E.2d 1009, quoting <em>Lane v. Kennedy </em>(1861), 13 Ohio St. 42, 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">{\u00b6 34} Adverse possession is a disfavored doctrine in Ohio. See <em>Grace, </em>81 Ohio St.3d at 580, 692 N.E.2d 1009; <em>Morris, </em>158 Ohio App.3d 396, 2004-Ohio-4446, 815 N.E.2d 1147, at \u00b6 12. As such, the doctrine\u2019s elements are stringent. Id. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Therefore, I would opt to interpret Grace\u2019s intent requirement strictly and conclude that in order for possession to be adverse, the party in possession must have the knowing intent to use another\u2019s property as his own, adverse to the true owner\u2019s rights. Anything short of such intent is insufficient to establish the adversity required to justify \u201ca legal title holder forfeiting ownership to an adverse holder without compensation.\u201d Id., citing <em>Grace, </em>81 Ohio St.3d at 580, 692 N.E.2d 1009.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">{\u00b6 35} The record in the present matter indicates a lack of any intent at all on the part of Evanich. In his deposition, Evanich testified that he erected the planter and planted the foliage on what he believed was his own property. Additionally, Evanich testified that he actively attempted to remain on his own lot by running a string from an iron survey pin to what he thought was another lot survey marker. Further, Evanich testified that had he known he was utilizing his neighbor\u2019s property, he would not have proceeded without asking permission. Finally, Evanich testified that he would not have intentionally crossed a property line to place the plantings. At the trial, Evanich confirmed his deposition testimony, stating that he never would have planted on the property if he had known it did not belong to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">{\u00b6 36} As the majority points out, this case presents a case of mutual mistake. That is, each party believed that the disputed property was owned by Evanich. I am also aware of the litany of cases affording the protection of the adverse possession doctrine to \u201cone who has honestly entered and held possession in the belief that the land was his own.\u201d <em>Vanasdal v. Brinker </em>(1985), 27 Ohio App.3d 298, 299, 27 OBR 343, 500 N.E.2d 876. However, \u201cthere are no equities in favor of a person seeking to acquire property of another by adverse holding.\u201d See <em>Grace, </em>81 Ohio St.3d at 580, 692 N.E.2d 1009, citing 10 Thompson on Real Property (Thomas Ed.1994) 108, Section 87.05. I see no reason why in the case of mutual mistake, this court should put the rights of the adverse possessor ahead of those of the true owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">{\u00b6 37} Based on the foregoing, I would hold that the trial court erred as a matter of law in that it failed to consider the impact of Evanich\u2019s lack of intent on the adversity of the use. This failure is evinced by the fact that the trial court found that Evanich adversely used Bridge\u2019s property despite undisputed evidence that he did not intend to do so but only sought to beautify what he thought was his own property. Accordingly, I would reverse the lower court\u2019s judgment, and therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
