For the reasons that follow, we reverse the judgment and remand the cause for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">{\u00b6 2} Appellant is Connie B., mother of 16-year-old Sean B., 14-year-old Kayla B., 13-year-old Eric P., and 12-year-old Derrick P. Although they are parties in the proceedings below, the children\u2019s fathers do not appeal the result. Appellee is the Lucas County Children Services Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">{\u00b6 3} Appellee\u2019s involvement with this family apparently began in mid-2003, on reports that appellant and Sean\u2019s father were employing excessive physical discipline. There are also allusions in the record to a sexual-abuse incident involving Kayla and a friend of the family two years earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">{\u00b6 4} On February 5, 2004, according to appellee\u2019s complaint, an 18-year-old male, whom we believe to be the same person later identified as Charles T. or \u201cUncle Charlie,\u201d was in appellant\u2019s home \u201cwrestling\u201d with Kayla. Over Kayla\u2019s protests, Charlie continued this behavior and indeed began kissing the then 11-year old. Appellee\u2019s complaint alleges that appellant was present and directed Charlie to stop, \u201cbut she did not see the incident as serious.\u201d The complaint continues, alleging that two days later, Charlie was \u201cwrestling\u201d with appellant when Sean mistook this for his mother being in danger. Sean attacked Charlie with a hammer, and Charlie retaliated by choking Sean. The complaint asserts that appellant did not intercede and, again, \u201cminimalized the incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">{\u00b6 5} Appellee removed all four children from the home and petitioned the court for an adjudication that they were abused, neglected, and dependent. On March 17, 2004, appellant consented to an adjudication that Sean was abused, neglected, and dependent and that the remaining children were neglected and dependent. Temporary custody went to appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">{\u00b6 6} Following the removal of the children and their placement in foster care, appellee produced an amended case plan that directed appellant to participate in interactive-parenting classes, to be assessed for and engage in treatment for depression and stress, and to submit to random drug screens. At a September 21, 2004 progress hearing, it was reported that appellant had completed her diagnostic assessment, had completed Project Genesis, had completed alcohol and drug assessment, and had produced no positive drug screens.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>{\u00b6 7} On December 21, 2004, appellee moved to return legal custody to appellant while retaining protective services for six months. A January 21, 2005 administrative review reported that appellant had been \u201ccomplying [with] case plan services.\u201d The report notes a recommendation that the children be returned home over a period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">{\u00b6 8} On February 2, 2005, however, appellee dismissed its motion to reunify. On March 25, 2005, appellee moved to terminate appellant\u2019s parental rights and award appellee permanent custody of Kayla, Eric, and Derrick. Appellee sought legal custody of Sean for purposes of a planned permanent living arrangement. As it relates to appellant, appellee\u2019s motion alleged:</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe mother has been involved with counseling at Family Services, but does not demonstrate the ability to protect her children even after attending counseling. She was referred to interactive parenting, but failed to successfully complete the program. She has also completed Project Genesis, but still demonstrates the inability to provide a safe environment for her children. The mother continues to allow a sexual predator access to her children. She continues to permit her family members to come over to her house and let them eat all of her food, then her children go without.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">{\u00b6 10} The matter proceeded to a December 2005 hearing on the motion. Prior to the hearing, however, the judge conducted an in-camera interview with the children, all of whom voiced their love for their mother and their desire to be reunited with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">{\u00b6 11} At trial, appellee called four present and former therapists for Kayla and the two youngest boys. Each testified that the focus of treatment was issues of \u201closs and separation\u201d as the result of having been taken away from their mother. Kayla\u2019s therapist added that Kayla was very angry \u201cat CSB\u201d for taking her away from her mother. Both of Kayla\u2019s therapists testified that it would be \u201cdetrimental\u201d and \u201cextremely * * * traumatizing\u201d to Kayla if she was not reunited with her mother. All of the therapists testified that their clients wished to be reunited with their mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">{\u00b6 12} Next, appellee called Joyce Ransom, parent educator for the agency. Ransom testified that appellant had completed a 12-week interactive-parenting program, but \u201cnot successfully.\u201d According to Ransom, appellant failed the course because she failed to exhibit \u201cgood judgment.\u201d As an example, Ransom reported that at a swimming pool birthday party that appellant organized for the children at a public pool, Uncle Charlie was present. Ransom also recounted an episode when during visitation Sean was seen to be \u201cbench walking\u201d \u2014 that is, walking along the top of a park bench \u2014 with appellant watching, and appellant said nothing. Sean was 15 years old at the time and there is no evidence that would suggest that this behavior posed an immediate danger to himself or others.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>{\u00b6 13} As another specific example of appellant\u2019s lack of \u201cgood judgment\u201d and as a basis for a recommendation to terminate parental rights, Ransom refers to a visitation at the East Toledo Family Center when appellant was with her two younger children on the second floor and her two older children were on the first floor of the facility, apparently in violation of visitation protocol. The two older children were 13 and 15 years old. There was no evidence that these teenage children were either misbehaving or could not be located. In fact, Ransom testified that the children followed her up to the second floor visitation area.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">{\u00b6 14} Ransom also opined that parental rights should be terminated because of her conclusion that appellant had \u201cvery few positive people\u201d in her life and at family outings, there were \u201ca number of people and [Ransom] had no idea who they were.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">{\u00b6 15} Ransom further testified that her agency will look at \u201call the people who can provide support to the parents. If \u2014 and part of that, the reason that we do that is because without the support of positive people in your life, you can\u2019t raise children.\u201d With this underlying assumption, Ransom concluded that \u201cConnie had no one in her family and she had no friends that I knew of that was supportive of she and her children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">{\u00b6 16} Appellee\u2019s caseworker for this family testified that the reason the agency sought permanent custody in this matter was appellant\u2019s failure to shield the children from \u201cperpetrators.\u201d According to a caseworker, when appellant was confronted about the pool incident, she denied guilt and then \u201cshut down,\u201d refusing to speak further.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">{\u00b6 17} On cross-examination, the caseworker conceded that appellant had successfully completed \u201cProject Genesis,\u201d a course on coping with domestic violence, and that the agency had no concerns about drug or alcohol abuse since appellant had completed \u201cFresh Attitude.\u201d The caseworker also testified that reports from appellant\u2019s therapist indicated that she was making good progress. With this, appellee rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">{\u00b6 18} After the trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion to dismiss, appellant called her individual therapist from Family Services of Northwest Ohio, who testified that it took a while for appellant to deal with the removal of her children from her care. After that, however, the therapist testified that appellant became fully engaged in developing her own assertiveness to set limits and protect the children. In this effort, according to the therapist, appellant had made and continues to make progress and continues to improve.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-10\">{\u00b6 19} The therapist also addressed two areas that had been of concern to appellee\u2019s caseworker: appellant\u2019s lack of independent housing and her failure to explain herself when confronted with evidence of improper conduct with \u201cperpe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>trators.\u201d According to the therapist, appellant requested housing assistance from family services six months before the hearing, but because of personnel changes in that agency, the matter was neglected as appellant was shuffled from one worker to another.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">{\u00b6 20} Concerning appellant\u2019s failure to explain herself, the therapist testified that appellant \u201cshut down\u201d as a defense mechanism. According to the therapist, when appellant is confronted by an authoritative figure or a person she believes is powerful, \u201cshe becomes overwhelmed and sort of withdraws from it. Just pulls into herself and goes quiet.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">{\u00b6 21} Appellant then testified on her own behalf, reporting that she has rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease, and lupus, and lives on $579 monthly disability from supplemental Social Security income. Appellant testified that she loves her children and wishes them returned to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">{\u00b6 22} Addressing appellee\u2019s concerns, appellant testified that there were perhaps 100 people at the pool the day of the party and that she did not know that Uncle Charlie was among them until several days after the event. She also stated that she had already spoken to other members of her family about not disciplining her children and that they had agreed to cooperate. According to appellant, she did not know it was inappropriate to have other family members discipline one\u2019s children, because she had grown up in a family in which this was the norm. Appellant testified that although she loves her family, if contact with them is to be an issue, she is prepared to make certain the children are not near them.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">{\u00b6 23} Appellant stated that she recognized that she needed independent housing and had an appointment for housing assistance. She denied any other contact with Uncle Charlie. She also indicated that during Sean\u2019s \u201cbench walking,\u201d she did respond with a gesture that he get down, and he did. Appellant rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">{\u00b6 24} On rebuttal, appellee recalled appellant\u2019s caseworker, who testified that Kayla had reported two other contacts with Uncle Charlie: once at a family Christmas gathering and again at a gas station. At the Christmas party, appellant had taken the children and gone when Charlie arrived. At the gas station, however, appellant gave Charlie a ride to a relative\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">{\u00b6 25} Prior to the final hearing in this matter, the court-appointed guardian ad litem had recommended that legal custody of Sean and Kayla be awarded to appellee and that appellant\u2019s parental rights to Eric and Derrick be terminated and permanent custody go to appellee. Following the trial, however, the guardian ad litem amended her report, recommending that custody of all the children be returned to appellant with protective supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>{\u00b6 26} On January 13, 2006, the court entered a judgment, granting legal custody of Sean and Kayla to appellee, terminating appellant\u2019s parental rights to Eric and Derrick, and granting permanent custody to appellee. From this judgment, appellant now brings this appeal. Appellant sets forth a single assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cThe trial court erred when it found by clear and convincing evidence that permanent custody of Eric P. and Derrick P. should be awarded to Lucas County Children Services Board and legal custody to Lucas County Children Services for the purposes of a permanent plan living arrangement for Sean B. and Kayla B.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">{\u00b6 28} The parent/child relationship possesses a unique sanctity in our culture and in our law. <em>In re Stacey S. </em>(1999), 136 Ohio App.3d 503, 511, 737 N.E.2d 92. A parent\u2019s right to raise his or her children has been characterized as an \u201cessential * * * basic civil right.\u201d <em>Stanley v. Illinois </em>(1972), 405 U.S. 645, 651, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551. A parent\u2019s right to the custody of his or her child has been deemed \u201cparamount.\u201d <em>In re Hayes </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 46, 48, 679 N.E.2d 680, citing <em>In re Perales </em>(1977), 52 Ohio St.2d 89, 97, 6 O.O.3d 293, 369 N.E.2d 1047. \u201cPermanent termination of parental rights has been described as \u2018the family law equivalent of the death penalty in a criminal case.\u2019 <em>In re Smitk </em>(1991), 77 Ohio App.3d 1, 16, 601 N.E.2d 45, 54. Therefore, parents \u2018must be afforded every procedural and substantive protection the law allows.\u2019 Id.\u201d Id. at 48, 679 N.E.2d 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">{\u00b6 29} The right of a family to remain intact has obtained constitutional protection. <em>Stanley v. Illinois </em>at 651, 92 S.Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551. Therefore, on review, judicial decisions to terminate parental rights receive careful scrutiny and the permanent removal of a child from his or her family may be condoned \u201c[o]nly where there is demonstrated an incapacity on the part of the parent to provide adequate parental care,\u201d not because parental care can be provided by foster parents or adoptive parents. <em>In re Lay </em>(1987), 43 Ohio App.3d 78, 82, 539 N.E.2d 664; see, also, <em>In re William S. </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 95, 97, 661 N.E.2d 738; R.C. 2151.01(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">{\u00b6 30} Before any court may consider whether a child\u2019s best interests may be served by permanent removal from his or her family, there first must be a demonstration that the parents are \u201cunfit.\u201d <em>Quilloin v. Walcott </em>(1978), 434 U.S. 246, 255, 98 S.Ct. 549, 54 L.Ed.2d 511; see, also, <em>In re Schoeppner </em>(1976), 46 Ohio St.2d 21, 24, 75 O.O.2d 12, 345 N.E.2d 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">{\u00b6 31} When a child is not abandoned or orphaned, the Ohio equivalent of parental unfitness is a statutory determination that he or she \u201ccannot be placed with either parent within a reasonable period of time or should not be placed with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>the parents.\u201d R.C. 2151.414(E). The statute directs that this threshold conclusion may be entered only if, following a hearing, the court concludes that there is clear and convincing evidence that one of the predicate conditions enumerated in R.C. 2151.414(E)(1) through (16) exists. See <em>In re William S., </em>75 Ohio St.3d 95, 661 N.E.2d 738, syllabus. Once this finding is properly entered, the court must then determine whether terminating a parent\u2019s parental rights is in the child\u2019s best interests. R.C. 2151.414(D). Clear and convincing evidence is that evidence sufficient for the trier of fact to form a firm conviction or belief that the essential statutory elements for a termination of parental rights have been established. <em>In re Tashayla S., </em>6th Dist. No. L-03-1253, 2004-Ohio-896, 2004 WL 368148, \u00b6 14; <em>Cross v. Ledford </em>(1954), 161 Ohio St. 469, 53 O.O. 361, 120 N.E.2d 118, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Unsuitability Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">{\u00b6 32} In this matter, the trial court found that appellee had presented proof by clear and convincing evidence that R.C. 2151.414(E)(1), (4), (14), and (16) were satisfied. These statutory provisions provide that the court shall find that a child cannot or should not be placed with his or her parent if:</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c(1) Following the placement of the child outside the child\u2019s home and notwithstanding reasonable case planning and diligent efforts by the agency to assist the parents to remedy the problems that initially caused the child to be placed outside the home, the parent has failed continuously and repeatedly to substantially remedy the conditions causing the child to be placed outside the child\u2019s home. In determining whether the parents have substantially remedied those conditions, the court shall consider parental utilization of medical, psychiatric, psychological, and other social and rehabilitative services and material resources that were made available to the parents for the purpose of changing parental conduct to allow them to resume and maintain parental duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c(4) The parent has demonstrated a lack of commitment toward the child by failing to regularly support, visit, or communicate with the child when able to do so, or by other actions showing an unwillingness to provide an adequate permanent home for the child;</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c(14) The parent for any reason is unwilling to provide food, clothing, shelter, and other basic necessities for the child or to prevent the child from suffering physical, emotional, or sexual abuse or physical, emotional, or mental neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>{\u00b6 39} \u201c(16) Any other factor the court considers relevant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">{\u00b6 40} R.C. 2151.414(E)(16) is the \u201ccatchall\u201d portion of section (E), which permits a finding that the child cannot or should not be reunited with his or her parents for \u201cany other factor.\u201d \u201cWe have repeatedly held that for a finding under this provision to pass scrutiny, the trial court must \u2018 * * * explain with specificity what the other factor the court deems comparable to one of those enumerated in sections (E)(1) through (15) of R.C. 2151.414.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Delfino L. M., </em>6th Dist. Nos. L-04-1010 and L-04-1009, 2005-Ohio-320, 2005 WL 195488, \u00b6 23, quoting <em>In re Tashayla S., </em>2004-Ohio-896, 2004 WL 368148, \u00b6 24; <em>In re Alyssa Nicole, </em>153 Ohio App.3d 10, 2003-Ohio-2673, 790 N.E.2d 803, \u00b6 31; <em>In re Kaylee, </em>6th Dist. No. L-03-1320, 2004-Ohio-2227, 2004 WL 941779, \u00b6 18; <em>In re Crystal C., </em>6th Dist. No. L-01-1336, 2002-Ohio-855, 2002 WL 313337. No such discussion appears in the judgment at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">{\u00b6 41} The findings under R.C. 2151.414(E)(4) and (14) are simply unsupported by the record. The testimony was unrefuted that appellant regularly visited with her children and that the only reason she had not acquired independent housing was because of the negligence of the agency assisting her. Specifically, the testimony establishes that the agency to which appellant was referred for housing had been \u201cup and down\u201d and had experienced personnel changes that involved transitional community workers, each of whom had to be \u201creconnected\u201d with appellant\u2019s case. This gap in service resulted in at least a six-month delay in attention to her application. Neither is there any evidence of record that appellant is unwilling to provide clothing, food, or other necessities for the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">{\u00b6 42} The remainder of R.C. 2151.414(E)(14) relates to a parent\u2019s willingness to shield a child from physical or sexual abuse or neglect. This ties to the (E)(1) finding because, as the complaint in this matter reveals, the only allegations related to appellant are (1) that she permits \u201cpeople who are not appropriate to be around the children,\u201d (2) the \u201cwrestling\u201d with an 18-year-old now identified as Charlie T., (3) poor housekeeping, and (4) excessive use of physical discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">{\u00b6 43} Again, the unrefuted testimony from appellant\u2019s caseworkers and therapists is that she has been taking parenting classes and domestic-violence classes and participating in counseling and therapy well beyond that required of her case plan. She was actively involved in and engaged in these services and successfully completed, or was in the process of completing, all but one. The unsuccessful course was the interactive-parenting program. Even though appellant completed the entire course, she was deemed to have been unsuccessful in the course because of a disputed number of casual contacts with Uncle Charlie.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>{\u00b6 44} Concerning appellant\u2019s support system, while the support of positive people can no doubt be helpful in raising children, the lack of, abundance of, or inability of a parent to \u201cfind\u201d positive people should have no role in the termination of parental rights, and the substantial emphasis on this factor in the determination of the best interest of the children in this case is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">{\u00b6 45} We assume that the use of the word \u201cwrestling\u201d in the complaint was intended as some sort of euphemism. The use of euphemisms in a complaint is inadvisable, because we look to the complaint for the reason the children were removed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Given its most liberal meaning, we take the term \u201cwrestling\u201d to mean some sort of vaguely sexual activity between Uncle Charlie and Kayla and Uncle Charlie and appellant as a trigger to Sean\u2019s violence. This is surely a good reason for appellant to remain clear of Uncle Charlie. But it appears from the unrefuted testimony at the termination hearing that this is what appellant did. There is absolutely no evidence that appellant ever again permitted Uncle Charlie to come into physical contact with herself, Kayla, or any of the other children. Indeed, there is testimony from appellee\u2019s witness that when Charlie arrived at a family Christmas party, appellant took the children and left. The guardian ad litem found that \u201c[t]his shows insight and improvement on Mother\u2019s part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">{\u00b6 46} On this, we cannot say that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that appellant failed to substantially remedy the conditions that caused the children to be removed, nor can we find evidence that appellant is unwilling to protect the children from physical or sexual abuse or neglect. Thus, the trial court\u2019s findings relative to R.C. 2151.414(E) are without support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">12 of 22</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">{\u00b6 47} We have concluded that the evidence before the trial court supported none of the court\u2019s R.C. 2151.414(E) findings. Thus, the traditional statutorily defined characteristics of parental unfitness have not been demonstrated. In 1999, however, the Ohio legislature amended R.C. 2151.414, inserting a provision that-bypasses the requirement of a finding of parental fitness. Am.Sub.H.B. No. 484 (effective March 18, 1999) added the \u201c12 of 22\u201d provision of R.C. 2151.413(D)(1) and 2151.414(B)(1)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">{\u00b6 48} R.C. 2151.413(D)(1) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cExcept as provided in division (D)(3) of this section, if a child has been in the temporary custody of one or more public children services agencies or private child placing agencies for twelve or more months of a consecutive twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>two month period pending on or after March 18, 1999, the agency with custody shall file a motion requesting permanent custody of the child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">{\u00b6 50} R.C. 2151.414 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c(B)(1) Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, the court may grant permanent custody of a child to a movant if the court determines * * *, by clear and convincing evidence, that it is in the best interest of the child to grant permanent custody of the child to the agency that filed the motion for permanent custody and that any of the following apply:</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">{\u00b6 52} \u201c(a) The child is not abandoned or orphaned or has not been in the temporary custody of one or more public children services agencies or private child placing agencies for twelve or more months of a consecutive twenty-two month period ending on or after March 18, 1999, and the child cannot be placed with either of the child\u2019s parents within a reasonable time or should not be placed with the child\u2019s parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">{\u00b6 53} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">{\u00b6 54} \u201c(d) The child has been in the temporary custody of one or more public children services agencies or private child placing agencies for twelve or more months of a consecutive twenty-two month period ending on or after March 18, 1999.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">{\u00b6 55} In this matter, a 12 of 22 finding was entered with respect to these children.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">{\u00b6 56} Given the strong language from the United States Supreme Court and the Supreme Court of Ohio concerning an antecedent finding of parental unfitness for a termination of parental rights, we have constitutional concerns about these provisions. The question has never been directly presented to this court, nor, it appears, to the Ohio Supreme Court. Those appellate courts that have addressed 12 of 22 have found it constitutional. <em>In re Unger Children, </em>5th Dist. No. 04 CA 6, 2005-Ohio-2414, 2005 WL 1163915, \u00b6 67; <em>In re Stillman, </em>155 Ohio App.3d 333, 2003-Ohio-6228, 801 N.E.2d 475, \u00b6 56; <em>In re Brooks, </em>10th Dist. No. 04AP-164, 2004-Ohio-3887, 2004 WL 1631760, \u00b6 32; <em>In re Workman, </em>4th Dist. No. 02CA574, 2003-Ohio-2220, 2003 WL 2012574, \u00b6 40; <em>In re Gomer, </em>3d Dist. No. 16-03-19, 2004-Ohio-1723, 2004 WL 722978, \u00b6 32. Moreover, the constitutionality of these statutes has not been raised in the present matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-12\">{\u00b6 57} Assuming the propriety of the 12 of 22 finding, we must then review the trial court\u2019s determination that permanent custody and legal custody are in the best interests of the children. This must be shown by clear and convincing evidence. R.C. 2151.414(B)(1). R.C. 2151.414(D) provides guidance in making this determination:</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>{\u00b6 58} \u201c(D) In determining the best interest of a child at a hearing held pursuant to division (A) of this section * * * the court shall consider all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">{\u00b6 59} \u201c(1) The interaction and interrelationship of the child with the child\u2019s parents, siblings, relatives, foster caregivers and out-of-home providers, and any other person who may significantly affect the child;</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">{\u00b6 60} \u201c(2) The wishes of the child, as expressed directly by the child or through the child\u2019s guardian ad litem, with due regard for the maturity of the child;</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">{\u00b6 61} \u201c(3) The custodial history of the child, including whether the child has been in the temporary custody of one or more public children services agencies or private child placing agencies for twelve or more months of a consecutive twenty-two month period ending on or after March 18,1999;</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">{\u00b6 62} \u201c(4) The child\u2019s need for a legally secure permanent placement and whether that type of placement can be achieved without a grant of permanent custody to the agency;</p>\n<p id=\"b608-9\">{\u00b6 63} \u201c(5) Whether any of the factors in divisions (E)(7) to (11) of this section apply in relation to the parents and child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">{\u00b6 64} There is no question that Sean and Kayla are challenging adolescents and that the relationship with appellant\u2019s family has in the past been less than ideal. On the other hand, the testimony of appellant and her caseworkers and therapists suggests that she may have the skills to protect the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">{\u00b6 65} The children, all adolescents, agree that they love their mother and want to be reunited with her. The court-appointed guardian ad litem concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-12\">{\u00b6 66} The children were out of their mother\u2019s custody for 12 months when the motion for permanent custody was filed. Appellee\u2019s motion to terminate temporary custody came three months earlier. The guardian ad litem was convinced that the children could be placed with their mother with appellee providing protective services.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-13\">{\u00b6 67} No R.C. 2151.414(E)(7) through (11) factors apply to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-14\">{\u00b6 68} We are aware of no other compelling reasons why the family should not be reunited.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-15\">{\u00b6 69} If, as it appears, the legislature intended to substitute a mere amount of time as sufficient reason to terminate a parent\u2019s rights, see <em>In re Miqueal M., </em>6th Dist. No. L-02-1020, 2002-Ohio-3417, 2002 WL 1438664, \u00b6 17, it is incumbent on the judiciary at all levels to examine with exacting scrutiny decisions flowing from this policy. Here, if anything, it was shown by clear and convincing evidence that these children should be reunited with their mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>{\u00b6 70} Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">{\u00b6 71} On consideration whereof, the judgment of the Lucas County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, is reversed. This matter is remanded to that court for further proceedings consistent with this decision. Appellee is ordered to pay the costs of this appeal pursuant to App.R. 24. Judgment for the clerk\u2019s expense incurred in preparation of the record, fees allowed by law, and the fee for filing the appeal are awarded to Lucas County.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b609-6\">Handwork and Osowik, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-12\">. We note that appellee also uses the words \"perpetrator\u201d and \"sexual predator\u201d loosely.
