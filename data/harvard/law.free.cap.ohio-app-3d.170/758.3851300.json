For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-12\">{\u00b62} On February 10, 2003, appellee Eric Davis filed the complaint in this matter, claiming that on February 9, 2002, he was injured when appellant\u2019s insured appellee Matthew Border struck him while holding a drinking glass. Davis alleged that Border\u2019s conduct was \u201cintentional, willful, reckless and/or negligent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-13\">{\u00b6 3} Appellant had issued a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy to Border, which was in effect on the date of the incident. The policy provides liability coverage for the negligent acts of its insured, but not for intentional acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-14\">{\u00b6 4} Border was served with the complaint on February 18, 2003, and Allstate retained counsel for him. The parties exchanged written discovery and completed depositions. The court scheduled the final pretrial on April 29, 2004 and jury trial on May 10, 2004. On April 26, 2004, appellant filed a motion to intervene with a complaint and cross-claim for declaratory judgment attached. Davis filed a brief in opposition. On May 4, 2004, the court denied the motion as untimely. On May 7, 2004, appellant appealed the denial under case No. 2004-T-0051 and moved the trial court to stay the proceedings. On May 10, 2004, the court denied appellant\u2019s motion to stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-15\">{\u00b6 5} Appellant never filed a motion to stay the trial in this court. As a result, the trial proceeded as scheduled. The case was tried to a jury beginning on May 12, 2004. After Davis presented his case-in-chief, the court granted Border\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"761\">*761</page-number>motion for directed verdict regarding the intentional-, willful-, and reckless-conduct allegations. The case proceeded on only Davis\u2019s allegation that Border\u2019s conduct was negligent. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Davis. Judgment was entered on the verdict on May 20, 2004. On June 1, 2004, appellant appealed the court\u2019s judgment on the verdict under case No. 2004-T-0060. On November 8, 2004, appellant amended its appeal to include the denial of its May 7, 2004 motion to stay. The appeals were subsequently consolidated. This matter was recently assigned to this writer.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">{\u00b6 6} Appellant submits three assignments of error. For the sake of clarity, they will be considered out of order. For its second assignment of error, appellant asserts:</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cAllstate\u2019s appeal from the denial of its motion to intervene divested the trial court of jurisdiction to proceed to trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">{\u00b6 8} Allstate argues that its May 7, 2004 notice of appeal divested the trial court of jurisdiction and thus all subsequent rulings and the court\u2019s judgment on the verdict are void.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">{\u00b6 9} The resolution of this issue depends on whether the court\u2019s judgment denying appellant\u2019s motion to intervene was a final and appealable order as of May 7, 2004, the date appellant filed its notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">{\u00b6 10} Appellate jurisdiction is limited to the review of final orders and judgments that are appealable. <em>Klein v. Bendix-Westinghouse Automotive Air Brake Co. </em>(1968), 13 Ohio St.2d 85, 86, 42 O.O.2d 283, 234 N.E.2d 587. The court of appeals does not have jurisdiction over appeals taken from orders that are not final and appealable. <em>Barker v. Barker </em>(1997), 118 Ohio App.3d 706, 713, 693 N.E.2d 1164.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">{\u00b6 11} To be final and appealable, an order must comply with R.C. 2505.02 and Civ.R. 54(B), if applicable. R.C. 2505.02(B) provides: \u201cAn order is a final order * * * when it is one of the following: (1) An order that affects a substantial right in an action that in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment; (2) An order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding * *</p>\n<p id=\"b801-11\">{\u00b6 12} Civ.R. 54(B) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cWhen more than one claim for relief is presented in an action whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, or third-party claim, and whether arising out of the same or separate transactions, or when multiple parties are involved, the court may enter final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for delay. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>{\u00b6 14} The trial court\u2019s entry denying appellant\u2019s motion to intervene provided: \u201cThis cause is before the Court on Motion of Allstate Insurance Company to intervene. The Court finds the motion not timely and not well-taken and is denied. CASE TO PROCEED.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">(\u00b6 15} The court\u2019s entry did not include a finding that there is no just reason for delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>Williams v. Winston </em>(Oct. 11, 1995), 1st Dist. No. C-940746, 1995 WL 596073, the appellant appealed the denial of a motion to intervene. The court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cAn order is final and appealable only if it meets the requirements of R.C. 2505.02 and Civ.R. 54(B), if applicable. Civ.R. 54(B) requires that the court make an express determination that there is no just reason to delay an appeal before it can enter final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all the claims or parties to an action. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe trial court\u2019s decision overruling appellant\u2019s motion to intervene resolved only appellant\u2019s rights and liabilities, not those of the other parties. Therefore, Civ.R. 54(B) applies. However, the order overruling appellant\u2019s motion did not contain the \u2018no just reason for delay\u2019 determination. * * * [T]his court is without jurisdiction to hear the case since the trial court\u2019s order does not expressly state that there is no just reason for delay. Therefore, we dismiss the appeal.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b802-9\">{\u00b6 19} The First Appellate District recently reaffirmed its decision in <em>Williams </em>in <em>Queen City Lodge No. 69, Fraternal Order of Police v. State Emp. Relations Board, </em>1st Dist. No. C-060530, 2007-Ohio-170, 2007 WL 121740. In that case, the Fraternal Order of Police (\u201cFOP\u201d) filed an unfair-labor-practice charge against the city with the State Employment Relations Board (\u201cSERB\u201d). SERB denied the charge. The FOP filed an administrative appeal in the trial court, but did not name the city as a party. The trial court denied the city\u2019s motion to intervene. The court held that the order denying the city\u2019s motion was a final order because it affected a substantial right and in effect determined the action and prevented a judgment for the city. However, the judgment left unadjudicated the pending claims of the parties. The court held that without the Civ.R. 54(B) finding, the order was not appealable. Id. at \u00b6 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-10\">{\u00b6 20} The Ninth Appellate District also follows the foregoing rule. In <em>Gehm v. Timberline Post &amp; Frame, </em>9th Dist. No. 22479, 2005-Ohio-5222, 2005 WL 2401906, Gehm filed a complaint against Timberline seeking damages related to the construction of a building. Westfield, Timberline\u2019s insurer, filed a motion to intervene to participate in discovery and submit jury interrogatories. The court denied the motion and proceeded to trial without Westfield as a party. Westfield <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>appealed the denial. The court held that the order denying the motion was neither final nor appealable. The court held that Westfield\u2019s motion and the court\u2019s denial preserved Westfield\u2019s ability to litigate its claims in a separate suit, since collateral estoppel applies only to a party who could have intervened in the proceeding. The court\u2019s judgment was thus not final pursuant to R.C. 2505.02, because it did not determine the action and prevent a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">{\u00b6 21} In addition, the court in <em>Gehm </em>held that because the order left Gehm\u2019s claim pending, the order needed the Civ.R. 54(B) finding of \u201cno just reason for delay\u201d to be final and appealable. As a result, the court dismissed the appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">{\u00b6 22} Moreover, in <em>Wilson v. United Fellowship Club of Barberton, </em>9th Dist. No. 22792, 2006-Ohio-1047, 2006 WL 551356, the plaintiff sued the club for gender discrimination. The club\u2019s insurer moved to intervene for the sole purpose of submitting interrogatories to the jury. The court denied the insurer\u2019s motion, and the insurer appealed. The court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cIn addition to satisfying the requirements of R.C. 2505.02 to be ripe for review, an order must also comply with Civ.R. 54(B). When determining if a judgment is final, an appellate court must engage in the following two-step analysis: (1) \u2018it must determine if the order is final with [in] the requirements of R.C. 2505.02\u2019 and (2) \u2018if the court finds that the order complies with R.C. 2505.02 and is in fact final, then the court must take a second step to decide if Civ.R. 54(B) language is required.\u2019 <em>Gen. Accident Ins. Co. v. Ins. Co. of N. America </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 17, 21 [540 N.E.2d 266]. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c * * * It is clear from the order that the trial court did not include * * * the required Civ.R. 54(B) language in its denial of Appellant\u2019s motion to intervene. We find that the trial court\u2019s denial of Appellant\u2019s motion to intervene adjudicated the procedural rights of Appellant, but left the substantive claims of the Plaintiffs/Appellees pending in the trial court. Therefore, the order is not a final, appealable order under Civ.R. 54(B).\u201d Id. at \u00b6 6-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">{\u00b6 26} These cases are consistent with a recent decision of this court, which involved structurally similar circumstances. In <em>Meeker R &amp; D, Inc. v. Evenflo Co., Inc., </em>11th Dist. No. 2006-P-0019, 2006-Ohio-3885, 2006 WL 2105496, we held that when multiple claims or parties are involved in an action and a judgment therein concerns fewer than all the claims or parties, the Civ.R. 54(B) finding is required to make any final order final and appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>{\u00b6 27} In <em>Meeker, </em>the plaintiff asserted claims for breach of contract, an accounting, and a declaratory judgment. The court granted the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment on its declaratory-judgment claim only. In addressing the finality of the court\u2019s judgment, we adopted the two-part test of <em>Gen. Acc. Ins. Co., </em>i.e., the order must meet the requirements of R.C. 2505.02(B)(1) or (2) and include the Civ.R. 54(B) finding, if applicable. An order is final under R.C. 2505.02 if (1) it affects a substantial right in an action that in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment or (2) it affects a substantial right in a special proceeding. We noted that while a declaratory judgment action is generally a special proceeding, if it is asserted in an \u201cordinary\u201d civil action, such as the case sub judice, the underlying action determines whether it is final under R.C. 2505.02(B)(1) or (2). Because the order in <em>Meeker </em>did not satisfy the <em>Gen. Acc. Ins. Co. </em>test, we dismissed the appeal. We find <em>Meeker </em>to be binding authority here.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">{\u00b6 28} Alternatively, the Eighth Appellate District has drawn a different conclusion. In <em>Filippi v. Ahmed, </em>8th Dist. No. 86927, 2006-Ohio-4368, 2006 WL 2441753, the court held that an order denying a motion to intervene does not require the Civ.R. 54(B) finding because that rule applies to parties, and <em>\u201ca </em>motion to intervene presupposes that the entity seeking to intervene is not a party.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">{\u00b6 29} It bears noting that the strict reading of the language of the rule animating the Eighth District\u2019s viewpoint was considered and found wanting by the Appellate Court of Illinois, Second District, in <em>Long Grove v. Austin Bank of Chicago </em>(1992), 234 Ill.App.3d 376, 175 Ill.Dec. 589, 600 N.E.2d 520, which addressed this argument, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">{\u00b6 30} \u201cWhile petitioners were never technically parties, the order denying them intervention is similar to other types of orders which have been held nonfinal pursuant to the rule. For example, an order dismissing a third-party complaint which does not include the requisite language is not immediately appealable. We note also that an order dismissing one of multiple plaintiffs or defendants from a cause is similarly not appealable absent a Rule 304(a) finding.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. at 379, 175 Ill.Dec. 589, 600 N.E.2d 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">{\u00b6 31} The foregoing analogy is sound and supported by Ohio case law. See <em>United Tel. Co. of Ohio v. Tel. Answering Sew. of Lima, Inc. </em>(Nov. 22, 1982), 3rd Dist. No. 1-81-13, 1982 WL 621911, *2 (holding that an order that dismisses a third-party complaint while other claims are pending in the action is not a final, appealable order without an express determination of no just reason for delay). See, also, <em>State ex rel. Jacobs v. Mun. Court of Franklin Cty. </em>(1972), 30 Ohio St.2d 239, 243-244, 59 O.O.2d 298, 284 N.E.2d 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>{\u00b6 32} Furthermore, it is worth pointing out that both parties and proposed intervenors have standing to appeal a trial court decision. <em>In re Rundio </em>(Sept. 8, 1993), 4th Dist. No. 92 CA 35, 1993 WL 879512, *3. As a result, an order denying a motion to intervene must also comply with the requirements of R.C. 2505.02 and Civ.R. 54(B) to be final and appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">{\u00b6 33} We adopt the rule set forth by the First and Ninth District Courts of Appeals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We therefore hold that at the time appellant filed its appeal from the May 4, 2004 order denying its motion to intervene, i.e., on May 7, 2004, the order required the Civ.R. 54(B) finding to be final and appealable because Davis\u2019s claims were still pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">{\u00b6 34} Because the trial court\u2019s entry denying the motion to intervene did not include the required Civ.R. 54(B) language and Davis\u2019s claims were still pending as of the date of the entry, the court\u2019s order was not final and appealable at that time. That order became final and appealable following the court\u2019s judgment on the verdict on May 20, 2004, and immediately thereafter we acquired jurisdiction of this matter. App.R. 4(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">{\u00b6 35} When we ruled on Davis\u2019s May 10, 2004 motion to dismiss, i.e., on August 26, 2004, the order denying appellant\u2019s motion to intervene became final and appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">{\u00b6 36} Appellant\u2019s initial appeal did not vest this court with jurisdiction, and the trial court was not divested of its jurisdiction to try this case. Our order of August 26, 2004, is hereby revised to reflect this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">{\u00b6 37} Finally, it does not escape our attention that appellant made conflicting representations to the trial court in its motion to intervene concerning its participation in the action. While appellant attached a complaint for declaratory relief to its motion, it stated in its brief that its participation could be \u201climited to the submission of interrogatories to the jury.\u201d Its stated purpose for the intervention was to present to the jury the question of whether Border\u2019s conduct was intentional or negligent so it would not be \u201cobligated to pay the judgment on his behalf even if the jury finds that he acted intentionally.\u201d That purpose was accomplished when the trial court directed a verdict on Davis\u2019s intentional-, willful-, and reckless-conduct allegations. As a result of that ruling, the jury\u2019s verdict could have been based only on Border\u2019s negligence, which was covered by his insurance policy. This circumstance further distinguishes this case from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number><em>Gehm </em>and <em>Tomcany, </em>since the directed verdict rendered appellant\u2019s motion for intervention moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">{\u00b6 38} If appellant\u2019s participation had been limited to the submission of interrogatories, the denial of its motion would not have \u201cin effect determined the action and prevented a judgment\u201d in its favor, because there would be no claim or defense to litigate. As a result, the court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion to intervene may not have been a final order. Because our holding today is based on the lack of a finding under Civ.R. 54(B) and this specific issue is before the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Gehm, </em>we decline to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">{\u00b6 39} Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">{\u00b6 40} Appellant asserts in its first assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in denying Allstate Insurance Company\u2019s motion to intervene.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\"> {\u00b6 42} The standard of review concerning the timeliness of a motion to intervene is abuse of discretion. <em>State ex rel. First New Shiloh Baptist Church v. Meagher </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 501, 503, 696 N.E.2d 1058. An abuse of discretion connotes more than an error of law or judgment; it implies an attitude on the part of the trial court that is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Blake-more v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-9\">{\u00b6 43} Intervention is provided for in the Rules of Civil Procedure. Civ.R. 24(A) outlines the requirements for intervention as of right, and provides that the motion must be \u201ctimely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">{\u00b6 44} In <em>Nunn v. Lockformer Co. </em>(Nov. 19, 1998), 8th Dist. No. 73505, 1998 WL 811352, the insurer moved to intervene to present a declaratory-judgment action with the plaintiffs product-liability claim. In affirming the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion, the court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b806-11\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cRelevant factors in deciding the timeliness of a motion to intervene include the delay that intervention will have on the disposition of the pending case, the point to which the action has progressed, the length of time the [appellant] knew or should have known about the pending suit, and the reason for the delay in attempting to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-12\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cWhen the motion was filed, the existing parties had completed discovery * * *, filed their dispositive motions * * *, and filed replies to the dispositive motions * * *. The motion to intervene was filed just two days before a scheduled settlement conference * * *, and just two months before the set trial date * * *. If the motion to intervene was granted, the trial court would have had to allow additional discovery, which would inevitably have delayed the trial date.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. at *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>{\u00b6 47} Further, in <em>Nunn </em>the insurer gave no reason for its delay in seeking intervention and did not dispute that it had knowledge of the plaintiffs claims for some three years before it filed its motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">{\u00b6 48} In <em>First New Shiloh Baptist Church, </em>the Supreme Court listed the following factors as also being relevant in determining whether a motion to intervene is timely: (1) \u201c \u2018the prejudice to the original parties due to the proposed intervenor\u2019s failure after he knew or reasonably should have known of his interest in the case to apply promptly for intervention\u2019 \u201d and (2) \u201c \u2018the existence of unusual circumstances militating against or in favor of intervention.\u2019 \u201d Id., 82 Ohio St.3d at 503, 696 N.E.2d 1058, quoting <em>Triax Co. v. TRW, Inc. </em>(C.A.6, 1984), 724 F.2d 1224, 1228. The timeliness of a motion to intervene depends on the individual facts of the case. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">{\u00b6 49} In <em>Krancevic v. McPherson, </em>8th Dist. No. 84511, 2004-Ohio-6915, 2004 WL 2931012, the plaintiff teacher was assaulted by a student. The plaintiff sued the parent, and Allstate, which had issued a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy to the child\u2019s parent, moved the court to intervene. Allstate argued that it had a right to intervene, claiming it had an interest in the subject of the suit because it might become obligated to pay a judgment rendered against its insured. It also argued that it would be bound by a judgment on the question of whether its insured acted intentionally. The court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cAlthough Allstate knew of its interest in this litigation from the time the action was filed on May 5, 2003, * * * Allstate did not file its motion to intervene until ten months after the complaint was filed, * * * and only seven weeks before the trial was scheduled to begin. * * * [T]he inconvenience and delay which would have been occasioned if Allstate\u2019s motion had been granted would have been extensive. Allstate did not merely seek leave to participate in a limited manner to protect its interests in the action between the plaintiff and its insured, for example, by submitting proposed jury interrogatories. * * * Rather, it proposed to file an intervening complaint and cross-claim for a declaratory judgment concerning its duties to defend * * * and to pay any judgment entered against its insureds. This pleading would have interjected a number of new issues as to which discovery and motion practice would have caused considerable delay in the proceedings between the existing parties. Therefore, we find the common pleas court did not abuse its discretion by denying Allstate\u2019s motion to intervene as untimely.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">{\u00b6 51} The holdings in these cases apply with greater force here. Appellant was on notice of this case from the time its insured was served with the complaint, i.e., from February 18, 2003. Appellant provided defense counsel for him at that time. It conceded in its motion to intervene that the \u201ccoverage issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>[were] obvious on the face of the Plaintiffs complaint.\u201d However, it waited over 14 months before it filed its motion to intervene. Prior to filing the motion, the parties had completed discovery, including the taking of depositions. A motion for summary judgment had been filed. Appellant filed its motion only three days before the final pretrial and only 14 days before the scheduled trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">{\u00b6 52} Further, appellant proposed to file a complaint and cross-claim for declaratory judgment. While it stated in its motion that it \u201cbelieves this case [could] go to trial with Allstate\u2019s participation being limited to the submission of interrogatories to the jury,\u201d that belief is contradicted by its proposed pleading and its stated intent to litigate the coverage issues. We also note that Civ.R. 24 provides: \u201cThe motion * * * shall be accompanied by a pleading, as defined in Civ.R. 7(A), setting forth the claim or defense for which intervention is sought.\u201d The word \u201cshall\u201d connotes a mandatory requirement. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th Ed.1979) 1233. The Supreme Court has held that a motion to intervene under Civ.R. 24 must be denied if it is not accompanied by a pleading setting forth the claim or defense for which intervention is sought. <em>Tatman v. Fairfield Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 425, 426-427, 2004-Ohio-3701, 811 N.E.2d 1130. The Civil Rules do not provide for the type of limited intervention to which appellant refers.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">{\u00b6 53} If appellant\u2019s motion to intervene were granted, it would have necessarily interfered with the trial date. Even if its motion had been granted on the same date it was filed, the parties\u2019 answer date would have been 14 days after the scheduled trial date. Appellant also stated in its motion that it would not request a continuance of the trial. However, this statement is disingenuous because if a continuance was not granted, the existing parties would have been prejudiced by the denial of the right to engage in discovery on the new issues raised in appellant\u2019s pleading. Such proceedings would necessarily have delayed the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">{\u00b6 54} Perhaps most significantly, appellant provided no reason for its delay of over one year and two months in filing the motion. By any reasonable standard, appellant\u2019s motion to intervene 14 months after the complaint was filed and two weeks before the trial date was untimely. If this court were to rule otherwise, an insurer could wait until a case had progressed to the point of trial before it decided it was in its best interests to intervene, and thereby force the trial court to change its schedule to comply with the insurer\u2019s tactical decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">{\u00b6 55} We do not agree with appellant\u2019s argument that our decision in <em>Tomcany </em>is controlling here. In that case, the insurer filed its motion to intervene two and one-half months before trial; did not propose to file its own pleading; and the parties did not object to the intervention. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">{\u00b6 56} Appellant states for its third assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>{\u00b6 57} \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in denying Allstate\u2019s motion to stay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">{\u00b6 58} Our disposition of appellant\u2019s second assignment of error renders this assignment of error moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">{\u00b6 59} For the reasons stated in this opinion, the first and second assignments of error are without merit. Appellant\u2019s third assignment of error is moot. The stay previously granted in this matter is hereby dissolved. It is the judgment and order of this court that the judgment of the Trumbull County Court of Common Pleas is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b809-8\">O\u2019Toole, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b809-9\">O\u2019Neill, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b803-11\">. <em>Gehm </em>is currently before the Ohio Supreme Court, 108 Ohio St.3d 1434, 2006-Ohio-421, 842 N.E.2d 61, on the following limited issue: \"Whether the denial of a motion for leave to intervene on behalf of an insurer for purposes of participating in discovery and submitting jury interrogatories is a final appealable order pursuant to R.C. 2505.02.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b805-10\">.

O\u2019Neill, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AHz\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-11\">{\u00b6 60} I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion regarding Allstate\u2019s second assignment of error. The majority holds that the trial court\u2019s judgment entry denying Allstate\u2019s motion to intervene was not a final, appealable order, because it lacked Civ.R. 54(B) language. On August 26, 2004, this court issued a judgment entry concluding that the trial court\u2019s denial of Allstate\u2019s motion to intervene was a final, appealable order. This court cited <em>Fairview Gen. Hosp. v. Fletcher </em>in support of its conclusion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Further, this court specifically concluded that the absence of Civ.R. 54(B) language did not affect the finality of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-12\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cThe law of the case is a longstanding doctrine in Ohio jurisprudence. \u2018(T)he doctrine provides that the decision of a reviewing court in a case remains the law of that case on the legal questions involved for all subsequent proceedings in the case at both the trial and reviewing levels.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-13\">{\u00b6 62} This court has already concluded that the denial of Allstate\u2019s motion to intervene was a final, appealable order. That conclusion should not be disturbed at this time pursuant to the law of the case doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-14\">{\u00b6 68} Additionally, several cases have cited <em>Fairview v. Gen. Hosp. v. Fletcher </em>for the proposition that a denial of a motion to intervene is a final, appealable order.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We note that the Eighth and Tenth Appellate Districts have generally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>held that a judgment entry denying a motion to intervene is a final, appealable order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">{\u00b6 64} In this court\u2019s August 26, 2004 judgment entry, this court concluded that the (A)(2) prong of Civ.R. 24 was met, because neither of the other parties adequately represented Allstate\u2019s interest. Thus, pursuant to the law-of-the case doctrine, Allstate sought intervention as of right.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">{\u00b6 65} Further, in two substantially similar cases, this court and the Eighth District held that the insurance companies sought intervention of right, due to the fact that neither of the underlying parties adequately represented their interests.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The \u201c[d]enial of a motion to intervene as of right pursuant to Civ.R. 24(A)(2) affects a substantial right and is, therefore, a final appealable order.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Since the denial of Allstate\u2019s motion to intervene as of right pursuant to Civ.R. 24(A) affected a substantial right, the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to intervene was a final, appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">{\u00b6 66} The majority cites cases from the First and Ninth Appellate Districts in support of its conclusion that Civ.R. 54(B) language is required in a judgment entry denying a motion to intervene to make it final and appealable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Alternatively, the Eighth District has held that Civ.R. 54(B) language is not required when an entity files a notice of appeal from a judgment entry denying a motion to intervene.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Since there is competing case law from other districts on this issue, I believe it is inappropriate for the majority to effectively reverse this court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>prior ruling in this matter, where this court held there was \u201cno need for Civ.R. 54(B) language.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">{\u00b6 67} In <em>Queen City Lodge No. 69, Fraternal Order of Police v. State Emp. Relations Bd., </em>the First District held that a judgment entry denying a motion to intervene is not a final, appealable order with the lack of Civ.R. 54(B) language.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Interestingly, the First District also held that the entity whose motion to intervene was denied could not appeal the final judgment on the merits, because such entity was not a \u201cparty.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Recognizing the potential dilemma, the First District concluded that the only remedy for the entity whose motion to intervene was denied was to attempt to intervene at the appellate level into an appeal filed by another party.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In this matter, neither of the other parties appealed the trial court\u2019s decision on the merits. Therefore, if the First District\u2019s holding were strictly followed, Allstate could never seek appellate review of the trial court\u2019s judgment entry denying its motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">{\u00b6 68} R.C. 2505.02, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">{\u00b6 69} \u201c(B) An order is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial, when it is one of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">{\u00b6 70} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">{\u00b6 71} \u201c(4) An order that grants or denies a provisional remedy and to which both of the following apply:</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">{\u00b6 72} \u201c(a) The order in effect determines the action with respect to the provisional remedy and prevents a judgment in the action in favor of the appealing party with respect to the provisional remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">{\u00b6 73} \u201c(b) The appealing party would not be afforded a meaningful or effective remedy by an appeal following final judgment as to all proceedings, issues, claims, and parties-in the action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-12\">{\u00b6 74} In regard to this section, the Supreme Court of Ohio has held:</p>\n<p id=\"b811-13\">{\u00b6 75} \u201cThis division of the final order statute recognizes that, in spite of courts\u2019 interest in avoiding piecemeal litigation, occasions may arise in which a party seeking to appeal from an interlocutory order would have no adequate remedy from the effects of that order on appeal from final judgment. In some instances, \u2018[t]he proverbial bell cannot be unrung and an appeal after final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>judgment on the merits will not rectify the damage\u2019 suffered by the appealing party.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">{\u00b6 76} The words of the Supreme Court of Ohio are especially applicable in light of the majority\u2019s decision to follow <em>Queen City Lodge No. 69, Fraternal Order of Police v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>Not only would Allstate not have an adequate remedy, it would have <em>no </em>remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">{\u00b6 77} The trial court\u2019s judgment entry denying Allstate\u2019s motion to intervene was a final, appealable order that did not require Civ.R. 54(B) language. Following Allstate\u2019s filing of a timely appeal of that order, the trial court was divested of jurisdiction. As the Supreme Court of Ohio has stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">{\u00b6 78} \u201cAn appeal is perfected upon the filing of a written notice of appeal. R.C. 2505.04. Once a case has been appealed, the trial court loses jurisdiction except to take action in aid of the appeal. <em>State ex rel. Special Prosecutors v. Judges, Court of Common Pleas </em>(1978), 55 Ohio St.2d 94, 97 [9 O.O.3d 88, 378 N.E.2d 162]. The trial court retains jurisdiction over issues not inconsistent with the appellate court\u2019s jurisdiction to reverse, modify, or affirm the judgment appealed from. Id.; <em>Yee v. Erie Cty. Sheriff's Dept. </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 43, 44 [553 N.E.2d 1354].\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">{\u00b6 79} In this matter, the act of conducting a jury trial was inconsistent with this court\u2019s ability to review whether Allstate should have been allowed to participate in that same jury trial. Since the trial court\u2019s actions were inconsistent with this court\u2019s review of Allstate\u2019s appeal of the denial of its motion to intervene, the trial court did not have jurisdiction to conduct the jury trial.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Therefore, as the trial court did not have jurisdiction, the trial court\u2019s judgment entry following the jury trial is void.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">{\u00b6 80} Further, I disagree with the majority\u2019s holding regarding the trial court\u2019s decision on Allstate\u2019s motion to intervene. Allstate sought to intervene as of right pursuant to Civ.R. 24(A). \u201cCiv.R. 24 should be liberally construed in favor of intervention.\u201d <footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>{\u00b6 81} Allstate sought to intervene because a determination of Border\u2019s mental state would be binding upon Allstate in a subsequent action to determine insurance coverage. As stated by the Supreme Court of Ohio:</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">{\u00b6 82} \u201cWhere a determination is made in an initial action against a tortfeasor relative to his culpable mental state, collateral estoppel precludes relitigation of the determination in a subsequent proceeding brought against the tortfeasor\u2019s insurer pursuant to R.C. 8929.06.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">{\u00b6 83} In interpreting the Supreme Court of Ohio\u2019s holding in <em>Howell v. Richardson </em>and applying it to a case similar to the case at bar, the Eighth Appellate District held:</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">{\u00b6 84} \u201cWhen the liability insurer of a defendant in a tort action disputes coverage, the insurer has an interest in the outcome of the tort action independent of its insured\u2019s interests. The insurer will be bound by the results of the tort action in any subsequent proceeding to determine insurance coverage. <em>Howell v. Richardson </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 365 [544 N.E.2d 878]. Thus, as a practical matter, determination of the tort action may impair the insurer\u2019s ability to protect its own interests in a coverage dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">{\u00b6 85} \u201cNeither party to the tort action adequately represents the insurer\u2019s interests. Although the insurer and the insured share an interest in contesting liability, if liability is established, the insured has an interest in maximizing the portion of the claim which is covered by insurance, while the insurer would seek to minimize the covered portion of the claim. See, e.g., <em>Alhamid v. Great Am. Ins. Cos., </em>[7th Dist.] No. 02-CA-114, 2003-Ohio-4740 [2003 WL 22071544], at \u00b6 17. Furthermore, the plaintiff and the insured defendant have a common interest in obtaining a general verdict, untested by interrogatories, to preclude the insurer from denying coverage if the jury finds liability. <em>Tomcany v. Range Constr., </em>[11th Dist.] No. 2003-L-071, 2004-Ohio-5314 [2004 WL 2801671], at \u00b6 33.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-9\">{\u00b6 86} Allstate had an interest in this case, in that if it was determined that Border acted intentionally, coverage would be precluded under the policy. Additionally, as previously noted, neither of the other parties to the action adequately represented Allstate\u2019s interests. Thus, Allstate had grounds to intervene pursuant to Civ.R. 24(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">{\u00b6 87} However, Civ.R. 24(A) also requires the motion to intervene be made in a timely fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>{\u00b6 88} \u201cThe following factors are considered in determining timeliness: \u2018(1) the point to which the suit had progressed; (2) the purpose for which intervention is sought; (3) the length of time preceding the application during which the proposed intervenor knew or reasonably should have known of his interest in the case; (4) the prejudice to the original parties due to the proposed intervenor\u2019s failure after he knew or reasonably should have known of his interest in the case to apply promptly for intervention; and (5) the existence of unusual circumstances militating against or in favor of intervention.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">{\u00b6 89} The first factor to consider is the point to which the action had progressed. The case had been pending for more that one year and the motion was filed only two weeks prior to the scheduled trial date. These facts, standing alone, weigh against a finding that Allstate\u2019s motion to intervene was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">{\u00b6 90} The second factor for consideration is the purpose of the intervention. In its motion to intervene, Allstate stated that its participation could be \u201climited to the submission of interrogatories to the jury on factual issues relevant to coverage.\u201d When a party seeks to intervene solely to submit jury interrogatories to the jury, intervention should generally be permitted.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">{\u00b6 91} The third factor is the length of time Allstate knew of its interest. In its motion to intervene, Allstate claimed that the issue of whether Border acted intentionally or negligently was set forth in the original complaint. Davis argues that Allstate, therefore, should have known about its interest in the case upon the filing of the complaint. However, discovery was not completed until approximately the same time Allstate\u2019s motion to intervene was filed. Specifically, the depositions of Davis and Border were filed on April 26, 2004, the same day Allstate filed its motion to intervene. It is important to note the content of the depositions. In his deposition, Border stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">{\u00b6 92} \u201cDavis was staring right at me, and I just caught his eye right away because he was staring me down, obviously, and as soon as I looked at him he just came at me at a very quick pace with his arms like this. He had something in his right hand; I couldn\u2019t tell what it was. It was something silver \u2014 I don\u2019t know. He started walking at me very forcefully, and he got within striking distance of me. I just swung at him with my right hand. I had my drink in my hand and I hit him on the side of the face.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">{\u00b6 93} Davis said the following in his deposition:</p>\n<p id=\"b815-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>{\u00b6 94} \u201cAnd they were saying something and the kid that [Border] was with went through the door and he was still looking at me saying something, so I assumed that he wanted to talk to me because I couldn\u2019t understand what he was saying. And I walked \u2014 got up, walked over to [Border] and I was hit with a glass.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">{\u00b6 95} Taken together, these depositions reveal that Border\u2019s striking of Davis with a cocktail glass may have been intentional. There is nothing in the record indicating that the specific details of this event were revealed to Allstate until the depositions were filed. Further, prior to the depositions being filed, there was nothing in the record, such as answers to interrogatories or other discovery, that gave either of the underlying parties\u2019 accounts of what specifically occurred on the night in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">{\u00b6 96} While it was generally asserted in the initial complaint that Border had struck Davis in the face with a glass \u201cwhile swinging his arm,\u201d the details of the event were not included in the record until the depositions were filed. Allstate\u2019s interest in this case was dependent upon Border\u2019s mental state when he struck Davis. Until Allstate was aware of the details of the event, from which Border\u2019s mental state could be inferred, Allstate could not reasonably determine its interest in the underlying case.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">{\u00b6 97} The fourth factor is the prejudice to Davis and Border by granting Allstate\u2019s motion to intervene.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">{\u00b6 98} \u201cWhere intervention of right is at issue, greater consideration may be given to the possible prejudice to the intervenor as against the delay or prejudice to the original parties in adjudicating their rights and liabilities.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> This is because a different standard applies regarding the timeliness inquiry depending on whether the intervenor was seeking permissive intervention or intervention of right.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Thus, \u201c[w]here an intervenor has a right to intervene, the scales tip in favor of allowing intervention despite the existence of conditions that might otherwise militate against intervention, including timeliness.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">{\u00b6 99} In its motion to intervene, Allstate specifically stated that it would not seek a continuance of the already scheduled trial date. Allstate sought to accommodate the court\u2019s schedule. In its motion to intervene, Allstate asserted that its participation could be limited to the submission of jury interrogatories. As such, the only additional issues for the jury to consider would be related to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>Border\u2019s mental state when he struck Davis. Appellee argues that the trial date would have had to be continued due to Allstate\u2019s proposed filing of an intervening complaint and cross-claim regarding a declaration on certain coverage issues. However, \u201cthe trial court could have easily limited appellant\u2019s intervention to submission of jury interrogatories and conditioned appellant\u2019s intervention upon no continuances in its favor. The existing parties would thus not be prejudiced by the granting of appellant\u2019s motion.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">{\u00b6 100} In weighing the potential prejudice to the parties against Allstate\u2019s right to intervene, Allstate should have been permitted to intervene. Allstate\u2019s interest in the matter affected a substantial right, in that it would be bound by the jury\u2019s verdict in the underlying action.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Conversely, the prejudice to the remaining parties would be relatively minimal, as the only new issues would relate to Border\u2019s mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">{\u00b6 101} Finally, the jury trial was held when the trial court was divested of jurisdiction. Therefore, the results of the jury trial are void.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Since the trial court should be required to set this matter for a new jury trial, the prejudice to the other parties by allowing Allstate to intervene would be nonexistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">{\u00b6 102} The final factor is whether there are any unusual circumstances relevant to the issue of intervention. As the Eighth District noted, an insurance company is in a unique position in a case like this.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> While it has a duty to defend its insured, this is typically done by providing independent counsel to represent the insured. Obviously, the insurance company would prefer a verdict in favor of its insured.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Alternatively, however, if liability is to be assigned to the insured, the insurance company would prefer a finding that the insured acted intentionally, thereby precluding coverage under the insurance policy.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">{\u00b6 103} Accordingly, an insurance company may initially provide an independent attorney to represent its insured. If, as the case develops, it appears that the insurance company\u2019s interests are the same as those of its insured, it may not be necessary for the insurance company to intervene as a separate party. If, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>however, as occurred in this matter, it becomes evident that the interests of the insurance company and those of the insured may be in conflict, the insurance company may seek to intervene in the case to protect its interests. As stated by this court:</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">{\u00b6 104} \u201cWhile [the insurance company] could have sought intervention at an earlier stage in the proceedings, intervention would presumably have been unnecessary if, for instance, a settlement was reached * * *. Further, the earlier stages of litigation, including pleading practice, motion practice, discovery, and court appearances, did not impede appellant\u2019s interests. Appellant\u2019s intervention from day one * * * would have accomplished nothing but increasing appellant\u2019s attorney fees and costs.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">{\u00b6 105} In conclusion, Allstate sought intervention as of right pursuant to Civ.R. 24(A). While this was done only two weeks prior to the scheduled trial date, the record reveals that Allstate may not have become aware of its interest until that time; the other parties, at most, would have been minimally prejudiced; Allstate sought to limit its participation to submitting interrogatories; Allstate had a unique position in this matter; and the fact that Allstate would be bound by a determination of Border\u2019s mental state in the jury trial all weigh in favor of finding that Allstate\u2019s motion to intervene was timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">{\u00b6 106} The judgment of the trial court should be reversed, and this matter should be remanded for the trial court to reset this matter for a new jury trial, where Allstate is permitted to participate.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b809-15\">. <em>Fairview Gen.
