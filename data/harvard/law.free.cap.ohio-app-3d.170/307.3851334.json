This court reverses.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b349-14\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>Anthony DeJesus (\u201cfather\u201d) and Margaret DeJesus (\u201cmother\u201d) were divorced on December 9, 2003. Pursuant to the trial court\u2019s judgment entry for divorce, the parties entered into a Shared Parenting Plan (\u201cSPP\u201d) with regard to their two minor children. The SPP designates the father as the residential parent and affords the mother a standard order of visitation. With regard to financial support, the SPP provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-15\">The parties hereto agree that there shall be no child support order owing from the Mother to the Father due to the Mother\u2019s current unemployment situation, subject to further order of the court. Therefore, the Mother is to notify the Father immediately when she is employed and the parties shall cooperate with the Child Support Enforcement Agency to establish an equitable child support order at that time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-16\">With regard to health insurance, the SPP states that \u201c[wjhichever party first obtains the coverage shall be considered the primary parent.\u201d Attached thereto is an exhibit entitled \u201cHealth Insurance Exhibit.\u201d In this exhibit, the obligor is responsible for providing health insurance coverage for the children, notwithstanding the language contained in paragraph nine, page 11, regarding health insurance. The health insurance exhibit states that child support must be paid through the Child Support Enforcement Agency (\u201cCSEA\u201d) and that direct payment of support will be considered a gift unless a payment is made to discharge an obligation other than support. The exhibit further provides that CSEA must administer child support payments on a monthly basis. The child support computation worksheet is attached to the SPP. The worksheet demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>strates that, but for the deviation, the mother\u2019s monthly support obligation would total $210.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">{\u00b6 3} The following is a summary of CSEA\u2019s recitation of the remaining facts.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In November 2004, the father contacted CSEA with regard to a cash child support order. On January 27, 2005, the father signed a form requesting that CSEA review the issue of the mother\u2019s child support obligation. Accordingly, CSEA began the review process. CSEA sent forms to both parents requesting income information. While the father and his employer submitted this information to CSEA, the mother failed to provide any information. The forms submitted by the father\u2019s employer demonstrated that the father was employed full time and was providing health-care coverage for both children.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">{\u00b6 4} As a result of the information the father provided, CSEA sent letters to the mother\u2019s employer requesting income information. The income information submitted regarding the mother revealed that she had been employed during the fourth quarter of 2003 and during the first two quarters of 2004. After receiving this information, CSEA reviewed the order. CSEA determined that, pursuant to the Ohio child support guidelines, effective June 1, 2005, the mother should pay the father $140.77 per month per child. CSEA also recommended that the father continue to provide health care for the children. CSEA believed it had authority to administratively modify the order based on the language contained in the original entry for divorce and Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1 \u2014 30\u201440.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">{\u00b6 5} CSEA sent copies of the administrative modification recommendation to both parties. The materials also contained a notice stating that each party had 14 days to request a mistake-of-fact hearing at the agency if that party disagreed with CSEA\u2019s recommendations. Neither party requested a mistake-of-fact hearing. On November 5, 2005, the modification proposal was sent to the Lorain County Domestic Relations Court for adoption. On April 18, 2006, the trial court issued an order stating that based upon this court\u2019s decision in <em>Rieger v. Rieger, </em>9th Dist. No. 02CA008035, 2002-Ohio-6991, 2002 WL 31828741, \u201cno child support order exists in this matter\u201d and that \u201c[therefore, CSEA is without jurisdiction to review or modify\u201d the original order. CSEA timely appealed from the trial court\u2019s order, raising three assignments of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR I</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">The trial court erred when it determined that the holding of <em>Rieger v. Rieger </em>applies to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>{\u00b6 6} In CSEA\u2019s first assignment of error, it contends that the trial court erred when it determined that this court\u2019s decision in <em>Rieger </em>applies to this matter. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">{\u00b6 7} We review matters involving child support under the abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Booth v. Booth </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 142, 144, 541 N.E.2d 1028. An abuse of discretion is more than an error of judgment; it means that the trial court was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable in its ruling. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 450 N.E.2d 1140. When applying the abuse-of-discretion standard, this court may not substitute its judgment for that of the trial court. <em>Pons v. Ohio State Med. Bd. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 619, 621, 614 N.E.2d 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">{\u00b6 8} The trial court, relying on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Rieger, </em>determined that no child support order existed in this matter. The court found that because no child support order existed, CSEA lacked jurisdiction to review or modify support.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">{\u00b6 9} Under Ohio law, \u201cchild support order\u201d is defined as \u201cany order issued by a court for the support of a child.\u201d R.C. 3119.01(C)(2). \u201cA child support enforcement agency has the authority to review a court child support order, recalculate an obligor\u2019s child support obligation, and recommend to the trial court that the existing child support order be modified accordingly.\u201d <em>Fields v. Fields, </em>9th Dist. No. 04CA0018-M, 2005-Ohio-471, 2005 WL 293609, at \u00b6 9, citing R.C. 3119.60 to 3119.63. R.C. 3119.76 specifies that the director of job and family services shall adopt rules pursuant to R.C. Chapter 119 establishing a procedure to determine when an existing child support order should be reviewed. The purpose of review is to determine whether it is necessary and in the best interest of the children who are the subject of the child support order to change the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">{\u00b6 10} Under Ohio Adm.Code 5101:1-30-40.3, CSEA shall generally initiate a review of the child support order every 36 months. Section C(5)(a) further provides that a party to the order may initiate an administrative review sooner than 36 months if the existing order established a minimum amount of support based on the Ohio child support guidelines as a result of the unemployment or underemployment of one of the parties if that party is no longer unemployed or underemployed.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">{\u00b6 11} Pursuant to Ohio law, CSEA has authority to review an <em>existing </em>child support order, recalculate child support, and recommend that the trial court adopt its findings. Accordingly, we must determine whether there was an existing child support order in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>{\u00b6 12} At issue in the instant case is the distinction between the absence of a child support order, commonly referred to as \u201cno\u201d child support order, and a \u201czero\u201d child support order. We find guidance from our previous examinations of this issue. In <em>Rodriguez v. Rodriguez </em>(May 2, 2001), 9th Dist. No. 00CA007699, 2001 WL 458674, this court explained that \u201c[pjursuant to former R.C. 3113.216, \u2018the CSEA is authorized to conduct reviews of existing child support orders.\u2019 \u201d Id. at *4, quoting <em>Treadway v. Ballew </em>(Oct. 7, 1998), 9th Dist. No. 18984, 1998 WL 696888, at *3. We held that a child support order which required zero payment of child support constituted an \u201cexisting child support order\u201d subject to review by the CSEA. <em>Rodriguez </em>at *4.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">{\u00b6 13} We further examined this issue in <em>Fields. </em>The appellant in <em>Fields </em>argued that no child support order existed and that, therefore, CSEA lacked jurisdiction to modify what it considered a zero child support order. The order at issue in <em>Fields </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">It is further ordered, adjudged and decreed [that] neither party shall pay to the other any amount of child support. The parties agree and acknowledge that the arrangement may deviate from the amounts called for in the child support guidelines, but state that it is in the best interests of the minor children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">2005-Ohio-471, 2005 WL 293609, at \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">{\u00b6 14} We held that this order constituted a \u201czero child support order,\u201d thus vesting the CSEA with jurisdiction to review and recommend modification of that order. Id. at \u00b6 14. In reaching this conclusion, we relied on evidence that a separation agreement and shared-parenting plan were incorporated into the trial court\u2019s judgment entry of divorce. Id. at \u00b6 13. We also relied on the fact that a child support computation worksheet was referenced in the shared-parenting plan and was also attached to the judgment entry of divorce. Id. We found that the parties clearly \u201ccontemplated child support, calculated child support, and voluntarily deviated from the amount of child support reflected on the child support calculation worksheet.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">{\u00b6 15} In <em>Rieger, </em>the mother appealed the decision of the trial court denying her motion to vacate the trial court\u2019s adoption of an administrative child support order establishing a child support obligation against her. The divorce decree at issue in <em>Rieger </em>ordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-10\">[T]here shall be no order for the payment of child support from one party to the other provided, however, that the child\u2019s school tuition fees and reasonable extracurricular fees and charges be divided equally between the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-11\"><em>Rieger </em>at \u00b6 2. After issuing this decree, the father requested that CSEA initiate child support proceedings. CSEA complied and determined that the mother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>should pay child support in the amount of $406.34 per month. The mother appealed and a hearing was held. The trial court denied the mother\u2019s objections to CSEA\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">{\u00b6 16} Upon review, we found that CSEA did not have authority to administratively create a child support order where no order previously existed. Id. at \u00b6 12. We distinguished <em>Rieger </em>from <em>Rodriguez, </em>noting that unlike the court in <em>Rodriguez, </em>the <em>Rieger </em>\u201ccourt did not journalize an order stating that appellee and/or appellant were <em>to pay </em>no child support. Rather, it specifically ordered that <em>no child support order would exist </em>between the parties.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Rieger </em>at \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">{\u00b6 17} We find the within matter distinguishable from <em>Rieger. </em>Unlike <em>Rieger, </em>the parties in this matter contemplated child support. While the SPP states that \u201cthere shall be no child support order owing from the Mother to the Father due to the Mother\u2019s current unemployment situation,\u201d the SPP expressly retained jurisdiction to modify the support obligation, stating that the obligation is \u201csubject to further order of the court.\u201d The SPP further provided that the mother must \u201cnotify the Father immediately when she is employed and the parties shall cooperate with the Child Support Enforcement Agency to establish an equitable child support order at that time.\u201d The references to child support and CSEA in the health insurance exhibit provide further evidence of the parties\u2019 intent to reexamine the child support issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">{\u00b6 18} Our case mirrors <em>Fields. </em>Here, the trial court\u2019s judgment entry of divorce included a SPP. The child support computation worksheet was attached to the SPP. As in <em>Fields, </em>the trial court calculated child support and voluntarily deviated from the amount of support reflected on the child support calculation worksheet, issuing a zero support order. Upon its review, CSEA determined that the mother\u2019s employment situation changed and she could fulfill her obligation. Because a zero child support order existed, CSEA was vested with jurisdiction pursuant to R.C. 3119.60 to 3119.63 to review and recommend modification of that order. See <em>Fields </em>at \u00b6 14. Consequently, we find that the trial court abused its discretion in relying on <em>Rieger. </em>CSEA\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR II</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">The trial court erred as a matter of law by not adopting the modified child support order pursuant to R.C. 3119.65.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">{\u00b6 19} In its second assignment of error, CSEA contends that the trial court erred as a matter of law by not adopting the modified child support order pursuant to R.C. 3119.65. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>{\u00b6 20} CSEA\u2019s argument relies upon the interpretation and application of R.C. 3119.65. It is well settled that this court\u2019s standard of review concerning questions of law is de novo. <em>Nationwide Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Guman Bros. Farm </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 107, 108, 652 N.E.2d 684; <em>Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. v. Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 521, 523, 668 N.E.2d 889. \u201c \u2018[I]t is appropriate for an appellate court to substitute its judgment for that of the trial court where matters of law are involved.\u2019 Indeed, where an appellate court determines that the trial court erred as a matter of law, it may reverse and render judgment.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Petro v. N. Coast Villas Ltd. </em>(2000), 136 Ohio App.3d 93, 96, 735 N.E.2d 985, quoting <em>State v. Today\u2019s Bookstore, Inc. </em>(1993), 86 Ohio App.3d 810, 823, 621 N.E.2d 1283.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">{\u00b6 21} R.C. 3119.63 provides the procedure CSEA must follow when reviewing a court child support order. R.C. 3119.63 provides that CSEA must</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">(B) Give the obligor and obligee notice of the revised amount of child support, of their right to request an administrative hearing on the revised amount, of the procedures and time deadlines for requesting the hearing, and that the revised amount of child support will be submitted to the court for inclusion in a revised court child support order unless the obligor or obligee requests an administrative hearing on the proposed change within fourteen days after receipt of the notice under this division;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">(C) Give the obligor and obligee notice that if the court child support order contains a deviation granted under section 3119.23 or 3119.24 of the Revised Code or if the obligor or obligee intends to request a deviation from the child support amount to be paid under the court child support order, the obligor and obligee have a right to request a court hearing on the revised amount of child support without first requesting an administrative hearing and that the obligor or obligee, in order to exercise this right, must make the request for a court hearing no later than fourteen days after receipt of the notice;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">(D) If neither the obligor nor the obligee timely requests, pursuant to division (C) of this section, an administrative or court hearing on the revised amount of child support, submit the revised amount of child support to the court for inclusion in a revised court child support order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">Pursuant to subsection B, a party to the order has 14 days to request a hearing after receiving notice of the revised amount of support. Under subsection D, if neither party requests this hearing, CSEA must submit the revised amount of child support to the trial court for inclusion in a revised court child support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">{\u00b6 22} In CSEA\u2019s brief, it contends that it sent both parents copies of the administrative modification recommendation and notice that each party had 14 days to request a hearing if that party disagreed with CSEA\u2019s recommendations. CSEA further alleges that the mother received these documents on October 5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>2005. There is no evidence in the docket that either party requested a hearing on the revised amount of child support. On November 5, 2005, CSEA\u2019s modification proposal was sent to the Lorain County Domestic Relations Court for adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">{\u00b6 23} R.C. 3119.65 vests the trial court with authority to issue a modified child support order where neither party requests a hearing on the revised amount. R.C. 3119.65 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">If neither the obligor nor the obligee requests a court hearing on a revised amount of child support to be paid under a court child support order in accordance with section 3119.63 of the Revised Code, the court <em>shall </em>issue a revised court child support order to require the obligor to pay the revised amount of child support calculated by the child support enforcement agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">(Emphasis added.) There is no evidence in the record that either party requested a court hearing. Yet, upon submission of the revised amount of child support to the trial court, the court denied the administrative recommendation pursuant to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Rieger.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">{\u00b6 24} Under R.C. 1.42, words and phrases utilized in Ohio statutes are to be construed \u201caccording to the rules of grammar and common usage.\u201d R.C. 1.42. Plain and unambiguous language may not be ignored, regardless of the policy implications. <em>State v. Rowe </em>(1997), 118 Ohio App.3d 121, 125-126, 691 N.E.2d 1140, citing <em>Pike-Delta-York Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Fulton Cty. Budget Comm. </em>(1975), 41 Ohio St.2d 147, 156, 70 O.O.2d 300, 324 N.E.2d 566. \u201cThe general rule of statutory construction provides that * * * the word \u2018shall\u2019 should be construed as \u2018mandatory.\u2019 \u201d <em>Manning v. Manning </em>(Mar. 6, 2002), 9th Dist. No. 01CA0063, 2002 WL 347316, at *2, quoting <em>Dorrian v. Scioto Conservancy Dist. </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 102, 107, 56 O.O.2d 58, 271 N.E.2d 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">{\u00b6 25} The statute includes mandatory language, stating that the court <em>\u201cshall </em>issue a revised court child support order\u201d if neither party requests a court hearing on the revised amount of child support. (Emphasis added.) R.C. 3119.65. The record reflects that neither party requested a court hearing. See <em>Manning </em>at *2 (finding that because neither party requested a court hearing pursuant to R.C. 3119.65, the trial court was required to issue a revised court child support order to require the appellee to pay the revised amount of child support calculated by CSEA). Accordingly, we find that, pursuant to R.C. 3119.65, the trial court was required to issue a revised court child support order requiring the mother to pay the revised amount of child support calculated by CSEA. CSEA\u2019s second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>ASSIGNMENT OF ERROR III</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The trial court\u2019s actions militate against public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">{\u00b6 26} In CSEA\u2019s third assignment of error, it contends that the trial court\u2019s actions violated public policy. In light of our disposition of CSEA\u2019s first two assignments of error, we decline to address this contention.
