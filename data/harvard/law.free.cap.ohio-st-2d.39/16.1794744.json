Squire, Sanders \u00e9 Dempsey, Mr. Alan P. Buchmann </em>and <em>Mr. James 11. Woodring, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b36-7\"><em>Mr. William J. Brown, </em>attorney general, <em>Mr. Keith F. Henly </em>and <em>Mrs. Cheryl H. Keith, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b36-8\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AC\">Appellant\u2019s primary contention is that the commission erred in basing its order of dismissal upon a <em>sua sponte </em>evaluation of the record of a prior proceeding, viz., case No. 72-399-B. The commission replies that appellant is improperly seeking to collaterally attack a past, final order, and that appellant\u2019s complaint is, therefore, tantamount to an untimely application for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-9\">It is the judgment of this court that the commission erred in dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint, but our rationale differs fro-m that suggested by either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">B. C. 4905.26, on its face, permits \u201cany person, firm, or corporation\u201d to file a complaint with the commission charging that the operation of a public utility is \u201cin any respect unjust, unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory, unjustly preferential, or in violation of law <em>* * </em>This language is extremely broad, and would permit what might be strictly viewed as a \u201ccollateral attack\u201d in many instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">Upon receipt of a complaint pursuant to B. C. 4905.26, the commission is charged as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b36-12\"><em>\u201c* * </em># if it appears that reasonable grounds for complaint are stated, the commission shall fix a time for hearing and shall notify complainants and the public utility thereof, and shall publish notice thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in each county in which complaint has arisen. Such notice shall be served and publication made not less than fifteen days nor more than thirty days before hearing and shall state the matters complained of. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>commission may adjourn such hearing from time to time.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">\u201cThe parties to the complaint shall be entitled to be heard, represented by counsel, and to have process to enforce the attendance of witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">The above-quoted procedural requirements in R. C. 4905.26 are clear, but were not observed by the commission in this case. After receiving appellant\u2019s complaint, the commission, by journal entry, found that \u201cthere <em>may be </em>reasonable grounds for the complaint * # (Emphasis added.) Such a <em>tentative </em>finding by the commission is Avithout legal authority. In addition, the commission found that R. C. 4905.26 requires that it retain jurisdiction of appellant\u2019s complaint \u201cfor all proper purposes.\u201d In our Anew these purposes are clear, and include the serving of notice and conducting a hearing pursuant to R. C. 4905.26.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">We do not mean to derogate the procedure established by the commission pursuant to Sections 1.08 and 1.09 of its Code of Rules and Regulations, although Ave do have serious misgivings about the commission\u2019s proclivity to rely upon matters not of record in making its decisions. See <em>Bell Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1937), 301 U. S. 292; <em>Forest Hills Utility Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1974), 39 Ohio St. 2d 1; <em>Motor Service Co. </em>v. <em>Pub. Util. Comm. </em>(1974), 39 Ohio St. 2d 5. Because of the basis for our decision here, we intimate no view on the proposition of law urged by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">This case involves matters of substantial importance in the area of public transportation. These matters are best heard, in the first instance, as required by law, by the Public Utilities Commission. The order of the commission, dismissing appellant\u2019s complaint, is reversed, and the cause remanded Avith instructions to proceed to hearing in accordance Avith law.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">\n<em>Order reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b37-9\">O\u2019Neill, C.
