Brown, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Az6\">The certified question presented in this case is whether an order of a trial court, pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>to Civ. R. 23 (C) (1), determining that an action may not be maintained as a class action is a final, appealable order. In holding the order of dismissal is not appealable, the Conrt of Appeals concluded that it did not affect the rights of plaintiff \u201cor any other known complaining party\u201d or prevent a judgment in his favor and therefore was not a final order under R. C. 2505.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The court in <em>Miles </em>v. <em>N. J. Motors, supra </em>(32 Ohio App. 2d 350), the decision in conflict with the decision of the Court of Appeals in the instant ease, found a similar order dismissing a class action to be a final, appealable order, relying upon the \u201cdeath knell\u201d theory<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> enunciated in <em>Eisen </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>I.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>(Eisen </em>v. <em>Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin </em>[1966], 370 P. 2d 119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">In this state, appealable orders are defined in R. 0. 2505.02, which provides, in part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">\u201cAn order affecting a substantial right in an action which in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment, an order affecting a substantial right made in a special proceeding or upon a summary application in an action after judgment * * * is a final order which may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">\"We believe that the characteristics of an order striking the allegation of a class action are wholly consistent with the requirements of R. C. 2505.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">Such order clearly affects \u201ca substantial right\u201d of <em>the class </em>which \u201cin effect determines the action and prevents a judgment\u201d adverse or favorable to <em>the class. </em>Rights and judgments do not attach in the abstract, but rather to persons. Civ R. 23 contemplates an action between a class and \u201cthe party opposing the class.\u201d In this action, a member of the class, acting as the nominal, representative plaintiff, brought suit on behalf of his class. The class action was dismissed, thus foreclosing a judgment for or against the class, determining the class action to be at an end, and denying the class the right, pursuant to Civ. R. 23, to maintain the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">In <em>Daar </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab </em>Co.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (1967), 67 Cal. 2d 695, 433 P. 2d 732, the California Supreme Court concluded that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>class action termination order was in legal effect a final judgment from which an appeal lies. The court reasoned, at page 699, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">\u201c* * * We must assay the total substance of the order. It determines the legal insufficiency of the complaint as a class suit and preserves for the plaintiff alone his cause of action for damages. In \u2018its legal effect\u2019 * * * the order is tantamount to a dismissal of the action as to all members of the class other than plaintiff. * * * It has virtually demolished the action as a class action. If the propriety of such disposition could not now be reviewed, it can never be reviewed.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">In our opinion, the underlying purpose of R. C. 2505.02 is to limit the absolute number of appeals taken.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> If a trial court determines that a class of plaintiffs is not permitted to function as such in a lawsuit, the number of actions filed will approach the magnitude of the number of class members, and possible appeals from those actions would far exceed any number of \u201cpiecemeal\u201d appeals arising from a unified class action. Judicial economy would be sacrificed at both the trial and appellate level.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">The termination of a class action is of critical import <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>in that the rights of a class, <em>sui </em>juris, are either denied or affirmed at that stage. The finality requirement would be insurmountable if the class was not permitted an immediate appeal from an order which carries with it such compelling significance. To hold otherwise would effectively place the existence of class actions in the unreviewable discretion of trial courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause is remanded to that court for an appeal upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b142-7\">O\u2019Neill, C.

S. Code) is expressed in <em>Eisen </em>I, <em>infra </em>(370 F. 2d) at 120, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">\u201c* * * We can safely assume that no lawyer of competence is going to undertake this complex and costly case to recover $70 for Mr. Eisen. * * * If the appeal is dismissed, not only will Mr. Eisen\u2019s claims never be adjudicated, but no appellate court will be given the chance to decide if this class action was proper under the newly amended Rule 23.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">Accordingly, the court established a criterion for appellate review of orders denying class action status, to be applied on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis, that \u201cwhere the effect of a district court\u2019s order, if not reviewed, is the death knell of the action, review should be allowed.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at page 121.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">The Arizona Supreme Court, in <em>Reader </em>v. <em>Magma-Superior Copper Co. </em>(1972), 108 Ariz. 186, 494 P. 2d 708, adopted the \u201cdeath knell\u201d theory, but other courts have recognized that the \u201cdeath knell\u201d theory is merely an <em>exception </em>to the finality requirement of Section 1291, <em>supra, </em>and that review will be denied where plaintiff fails to show that an adverse class determination order will effectively terminate the action. <em>Caceres </em>v. <em>International Air Transport </em>Assn.

A. 3, 1972), 455 F. 2d 618, certiorari denied, 407 U. S. 925, and our recognition that factual issues would have to be resolved by courts of appeal preliminary to granting review, we see no reason to adopt or reject the \u201cdeath knell\u201d theory, but will confine our inquiry to whether an order terminating a class action is a final, appealable order pursuant to R.

In a recent United States Supreme Court decision, U. S. , 42 L. W. 4804, <em>Eisen </em>III was vacated and remanded.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ApS\">concurring. The opinion of the Court of Appeals misconstrues the nature of a class action, ignores the plain wording of R. C. 2505.02, rejects without reason the relevent non-Ohio cases, and renders unappealable a trial court order that a class action lawsuit is not maintainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">The cornerstone of the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion is the declaration that \u201chere, the order of the Court of Common Pleas does not affect the rights of Roemisch or any other known complaining party. Nor does the order determine the action and prevent a judgment in favor of Mr. Roemisch.\u201d The position of the Court of Appeals indicates that a class action complaint institutes not one law suit, but two, and that a trial court can segregate the named plaintiff\u2019s action from the unnamed plaintiffs\u2019 action. Such treatment of a class action complaint flouts not only the spirit of Rule 23 of the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure, but also the express language of the rule. Rule 23(A) specifies that if the requirements of a class action are present, \u201cone or more members of a class may sue or be sued as representative parties on behalf of all * * V\u2019 A class action complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>does not commence two distinct lawsuits; instead, the pleading initiates a unitary lawsuit. See <em>American Pipe and Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Utah </em>(1974), U. S. , 38 L. Ed. 2d 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Viewing a class action complaint in its proper perspective leads inexorably to a holding that an order of a trial court that a class action is not maintainable is a final and, hence, appealable order. R. C. 2505.02 defines a final order as \u201can order affecting a substantial right in an action which in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment * # It is beyond argument that an order that a class action is not so maintainable determines the class action and totally prevents a judgment thereon. Since the class action is terminated by such an order, the labeling of the order as \u201cinterlocutory\u201d is simply incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">The Supreme Courts of Arizona and California have considered the precise question decided by this court today, and both have reached the same conclusion \u2014 an order that a class action is not maintainable as such is a final order. <em>Reader </em>v. <em>Magma-Superior Copper Co. </em>(1972), 108 Ariz. 186, 494 P. 2d 708; <em>Daar </em>v. <em>Yellow Cob Co. </em>(1967), 67 Cal. 2d 695, 433 P. 2d 732. Although these cases are not binding on this court, they are persuasive authority containing reasoning directly applicable to the instant case. These cases rely upon statutes which are similar to R. C. 2505.02.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">The reasoning underlying the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion has the legal effect of rendering unappealable a trial court\u2019s order that a class action is not maintainable. If, as the appellate court implies, a class action complaint is to be considered as two lawsuits \u2014 one involving the named plaintiff, the other involving the unnamed plaintiffs \u2014 the trial court\u2019s order denying the maintainability of the class action will not merge with a judgment on the merits of the named plaintiff\u2019s claim. Therefore, the named plaintiff can not appeal the class action aspect -of the case. Conversely, if a person who believes he is a member of the class attempts to intervene for the purpose of appealing the trial court\u2019s rejection of the original class action, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>will become a named plaintiff and, hence, severable from thAclass of unnamed plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">The decision of the Court of Appeals in this case would lessen both the efficiency and effectiveness of the judiciary .in this state. The unappealability of the class action aspect .of-a lawsuit would force each member of the alleged class to- pursue his remedy separately, thereby increasing the \u2022number of cases on both the trial and appellate level. The .quality of justice would decline in some cases, for, as has .been remarked by a federal appellate judge, \u201cit is inconceivable that either the lawyers or the court will give a $9.00 suit the same consideration and attention due a class action * *.\" <em>Hackett </em>v. <em>General Host Corp., </em>(C. A. 3, 1972), 455 F. 2d 618, 626, 628 (Rosenn, J., dissenting). And in what would be the most serious consequence of the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision, the utility of the class action lawsuit to the less affluent in our state would be weakened. Class actions have been termed \u201cone of the few legal remedies the small claimant has against those who command the status quo.\u201d <em>Eisen </em>v. <em>Carlisle &amp; Jacquelin </em>(1974), U. S. , , 42 L. W. 4804, 4811, 4813 (Douglas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). It is quite likely \u2022that a group of small claimants whose lawsuit has been \u25a0denied class action status by a trial court would, if that denial is not reviewable, thereby be left without an effective remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The decision of the Court of Appeals should be reversed, and this cause remanded to that court for a review of the- trial court\u2019s order that appellant\u2019s lawsuit was not maintainable as a class action.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b144-9\">Corrigan, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AJo\">dissenting. Firstly, I dissent from the syllabus and judgment for the reasons expressed in the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-10\">\u2022 Secondly, it may be added that the particular issue presented in this appeal is whether the order of the trial court determining the \u201cclass action aspect\u201d of this cause is a final, appealable order. In holding the order of dismis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>sal not to be appealable, the Court of Appeals concluded\u2019 that it did not affect the rights of plaintiff \u201cor any other-\u2019 known complaining party\u201d or prevent a judgment in his fa-' vor and therefore was not a final order under R. C. 2505.-02.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">R. C. 2505.02, which defines appealable orders, reads,in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\u201cAn order affecting a substantial right in an' action-which in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment, an order affecting a substantial right made in a spec--' ial proceeding or upon a summary application in an action' after judgment * * * is a final order which may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial.\u2019-\u2019'</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">This court\u2019s interpretation of R. C. 2505.02 was summarized in <em>Humphrys </em>v. <em>Putnam </em>(1961), 172 Ohio St. 456, 457, wherein it was stated: .::'</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">\u201cIt is a basic principle of our system of appellate'pro*; \u25a0 cedure that only judgments and final orders are subject to review. There must be a final determination in the lower i court before a reviewing court has jurisdiction to consider the matter. See, for example, <em>City of Cincinnati </em>v. <em>Cormany, </em>96 Ohio St., 596, 118 N. E., 1082.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\"><em>u* </em>* *</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">\u201c\u2019Thus, under the statute TR. C. 2505.02], an order to be final must affect a substantial right and have the effect of determining the action and preventing final judgment. * * * 5 ?</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">The trial court\u2019s order in the instant appeal is interlocutory inasmuch as it does not determine the action or prevent final judgment in plaintiff\u2019s individual action. Although, as noted by the majority, the \u201corder is tantamount to a dismissal of the action as to all members of the class other than plaintiff\u201d <em>(Daar </em>v. <em>Yellow Cab Co. </em>[1967], 67 Cal. 2d 695, 699), any judgment in plaintiff\u2019s case will not foreclose members of the class from proceeding individually against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">The finality requirements expressed in R. C. 2505.02 and the basic principle of our appellate procedure \u201cthat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>only judgments and final orders are subject to review\u201d have resulted in consistent refusal on the part of this court to entertain appeals from interlocutory orders. See, <em>e. g., Klein </em>v. <em>Bendix-Westinghouse Co. </em>(1968), 13 Ohio St. 2d 85, and <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Chalfin </em>(1974), 38 Ohio St. 2d 85. See, also, <em>In re Coastal States Petroleum </em>(1972), 32 Ohio St. 2d 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">In my opinion, the allowance of an appeal from the dismissal of the class action in the instant case will circumvent the underlying purpose of the provisions of E. C. 2505.02, as interpreted by this court. I am not persuaded that the rationale expressed by the majority for holding such orders to be appealable is appropriate for inclusion in the appellate procedure of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">I, therefore, would hold that an order of a trial court dismissing a class action which does not prevent the plaintiff from proceeding in the action in his individual capacity is not a final, appealable order.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b146-7\">P.
