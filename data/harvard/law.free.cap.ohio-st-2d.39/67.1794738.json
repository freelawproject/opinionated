Con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>struction of the road was started in the spring of 1972, whereupon the plaintiffs commenced this action for injunction, declaring that, since more than seven years had elapsed from the adoption of Resolution No. 698-64 to the spring of 1972, the commissioners were barred from constructing the road, pursuant to Revised Code 5553.10.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">The Court of Appeals rejected that contention of appellants. We agree with the Court of Appeals. We hold that under the facts in this case the seven-year period contemplated by R. C. 5553.10 began to run on February 14, 1969, when Resolution No. 211-69 was adopted by the board of county commissioners reaffirming Resolution No. 698-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b88-8\">O\u2019Neill, C.
