Under a mandate of May 14, 1974, that court vacated our judgment and remanded the cause to this court for further consideration in light of <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>New Orleans </em>(1974), U. S. , 39 L. Ed. 2d 214, which was decided subsequent to the publication of our first opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-12\">The next to last paragraph of the majority opinion in <em>Lewis </em>states:</p>\n<p id=\"b126-13\">\u201cIn sum * * * [the New Orleans ordinance under consideration] punishes only spoken words. It can therefore withstand appellant\u2019s attack upon its facial constitutionality only if, as authoritatively construed by the Louisiana Supreme Court, it is not susceptible of application to speech, although vulgar or offensive, that is protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. * * <em>* </em>Since * * * [the ordinance], <em>as construed by the Louisiana Supreme Court, </em>is susceptible of application to protected speech, the section is constitutionally overbroad and therefore is facially invalid.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b126-14\">As we read <em>Lewis, </em>and the eases cited therein, the apparent deficiency found in our first opinion in <em>Karlan </em>centers around a reliance in that case upon the construction of Cincinnati Ordinance 901-d4, which is contained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number><em>Cincinnati </em>v. <em>Hoffman </em>(1972), 31 Ohio St. 2d 163, 285 N. E. 2d 714, certiorari denied, 410 U. S. 920. Since <em>Hoffman </em>involved only conduct, and <em>Karlan </em>only speech, the conclusion from <em>Lewis </em>and the remand now before us is that an authoritative statutory construction pertaining to conduct may not be relied upon in a case involving speech, even though it be obvious that the particular speech under consideration is not constitutionally protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Cincinnati Ordinance 901-d4 reads, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">\u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to wilfully conduct himself or herself in a noisy, boisterous, rude, insulting or other disorderly manner, with the intent to abuse or annoy any person or the citizens of the city or any portion thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Viewed in light of <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>New Orleans, supra, </em>it is clear that this ordinance does not punish \u201conly spoken words. \u2019 \u2019 However, it is just as apparent that it is capable of punishing spoken words and, in that respect, must be authoritatively narrowed or be held constitutionally over-broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">A considerable line of United States Supreme Court cases has consistently, and insistently, held that the uttering of words which are \u201crude\u201d or \u201cinsulting\u201d may not be prohibited, \u201calthough vulgar or offensive.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at page 219. However, as noted in the syllabus of our original <em>Karlan, </em>when the words of rudeness or insult reach a point where they become \u201cfighting words\u201d they may be regulated by criminal statute and their utterance may be constitutionally punished.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">As has been made abundantly clear by the United States Supreme Court, a criminal statute capable of punishing spoken words cannot stand constitutional muster unless \u201cauthoritatively construed\u201d by state courts to be inapplicable to speech which is protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. <em>Lewis, supra, </em>and eases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-10\">The principal pull and haul between state courts and the high court has centered around a definition of \u201cprotected speech.\u201d However, there appears to be no room left for argument today. A majority of the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Supreme Court has said that no matter how rude, abusive, offensive, derisive, vulgar, insulting, crude, profane or opprobrious spoken words may seem to be, their utterance may not be made a crime unless they are fighting words,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as defined by that tribunal. Furthermore, the court has stated that those descriptive words in and of themselves are constitutionally overbroad and must .be rendered unsusceptible of application to protected speech by appropriate judicial decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">Therefore, persons may not be punished under Section' 901-d4, Code of Ordinances of Cincinnati, for speaking boisterous, rude or insulting words, even with the intent to annoy another, unless the words by their very utterance inflict injury or are likely to provoke the average person to an immediate retaliatory breach of the peace. <em>Cantwell </em>v. <em>Connecticut </em>(1940), 310 U. S. 296; <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire </em>(1942), 315 U. S. 568; <em>Terminiello </em>v. <em>Chicago </em>(1949), 337 U. S. 1; <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>California </em>(1971), 403 U. S. 15; <em>Gooding </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1972), 405 U. S. 518; <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>New Orleans, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Insofar as appellant Harlan is concerned, we adhere to our former judgment. For, where epithets, used in a public place and wilfully directed at those who can hear them, are likely to provoke the average person to an immediate retaliatory breach of the peace, they are fighting words and the utterance thereof may be punished as a criminal act. <em>Cincinnati </em>v. <em>Karlan, supra </em>(35 Ohio St. 2d 34.)</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">\n<em>Judgment reaffirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b128-8\">Corrigan, Celebrezze and P. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b128-9\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Stern and W. Brown, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b128-11\">We are not here dealing with another troublesome word, \u201cobscene.\u201d Suffice it to say, however, it would appear that the high court has concluded to date that no spoken words are obscene unless they serve to erotically stimulate. <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>California </em>(1971), 403 U. S. 15, 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b128-10\">O\u2019Neill, G. J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A2q\">dissenting. The ordinance in question here, Cincinnati Ordinance 901-d4, neither mentions nor is concerned with spoken words. Yet the majority adheres <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>to the former judgment of this court on the ground that defendant\u2019s utterances are fighting words which are punishable as a criminal act.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">As noted in <em>Gooding </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1972), 405 U. S. 518, 523, the decisions of the United States Supreme Court \u201csince <em>Chaplinsky [Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire </em>(1942), 315 U. S. 568] have continued to recognize state power constitutionally to punish \u2018fighting\u2019 words under carefully drawn statutes not also susceptible of application to protected expression <em>* *</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">In my opinion, Cincinnati Ordinance 901-d4 is not a \u201ccarefully drawn\u201d proscription of unprotected speech and is \u201csusceptible of application to protected expression.\u201d Therefore, it is \u201cconstitutionally overbroad and * * * is facially invalid.\u201d <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>New Orleans </em>(1974), U. S. , 39 L. Ed. 2d 214, 220.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b129-6\">W. Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ac-\">concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b129-7\">Stern, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AYg\">dissenting in part. Although I agree with the first two paragraphs of the syllabus in this case, I am constrained to dissent from the majority\u2019s judgment because I believe that appellant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">What Justice Herbert has ably accomplished by his opinion is to limit the application of Cincinnati Ordinance 901-d4 to speech not protected by the United States Constitution. This was necessary because the ordinance was overly broad, and therefore susceptible of being' struck down as facially unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">Appellant was, however, convicted of violating the constitutionally suspect Ordinance 901-d4. In my view, that fact entitles him to have the criminality of his language specifically determined under the standards announced by the majority, and by a panel of jurors in whom we should repose the initial responsibility for judging the \u201cfighting\u201d nature of appellant\u2019s words.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"A_N\">The \u201charmless error\u201d standard <em>ot Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967), 386 U. S. 18, has no application where the error complained of goes to the essential nature of the crime charged.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
