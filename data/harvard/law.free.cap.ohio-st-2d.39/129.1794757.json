The cause is now before this court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">The complaint alleges that James E. Hughel resigned his office as a member of the State Personnel Board of Review in July 1972, but has continued to serve as a member of such board. Appellant seeks a writ of mandamus to compel the appellee to give effect to the alleged resignation.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-15\">Appellant cites no authority which would impose a mandatory duty upon the appellee to perform the requested act. This court has held that a writ of mandamus will not issue to command the performance of an act which is not specially enjoined by law to be performed. <em>State, ex rel. Welsh, </em>v. <em>State Medical Board </em>(1945), 145 Ohio St. 74; <em>State, ex rel. Stanley, </em>v. <em>Cook </em>(1946), 146 Ohio St. 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-16\">A writ of mandamus may issue only to enforce an act which the law enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, and no such duty emerges from this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-17\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-18\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b147-19\">O\u2019Neill, C. J., Herbert, Corrigan, Stern, Celebbezze, W. Brown and P\u201e Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
