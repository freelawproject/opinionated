Transactions which, prima facie, appear to be wholly foreign to the business for which a corporation was formed, may yet come within its implied incidental powers if they are auxiliary to any legitimate purpose of the company, and reasonably adapted to attain the same.

In defense they say they had no power to make the contract. The court decided against them, and whether correctly is the question in this case. Literally their power is only to do work upon glass, but no doubt it extended to buying glass to work upon, and to selling glass they had worked upon, and as incidental to that, they might in good faith take contracts to supply ornamental glass, and to facilitate the business of obtaining such contracts, agree to furnish plain glass with the ornamental.</p> <p id=\"b647-6\" pgmap=\"647\">Whether in a particular instance the plain glass part of the contract was incidental to, or for the purpose of, obtaining the ornamental part, or the latter was a subterfuge to cover a transaction foreign to their powers, is a question of fact.</p> <p id=\"b647-7\" pgmap=\"647\">The reasoning in Chicago Bldg. Soc\u2019y v. Crowell, 65 Ill. 453, and Lyndeborough Co. v. Mass. Glass Co., 111 Mass. 315, may be referred to without repetition as authority for the decision below, and it is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b647-8\" pgmap=\"647\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
