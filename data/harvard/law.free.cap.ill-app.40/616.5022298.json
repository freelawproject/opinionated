Because it\" is a bill for discovery asking for incidental relief.</p><p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-11\" pgmap=\"616\">2. Because it is a bill for an accounting upon a matter concerning which the defendants covenanted to account, and concerning which they stood in a fiduciary relation to complainant; i. e., upon the faith of the covenant to account, the defendants were made the sole depository of the information necessary to an accounting.</p><p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b616-12\" pgmap=\"616(54) 617(29)\">Upon the first proposition we have to say that a bill for discovery is proper, either when the complainant therein has no other proof than that which he expects to elicit by its-means from the defendants, or when he needs the matter thus disclosed to supplement and aid other evidence which he furnishes. Story\u2019s Eq. Jur., Vol. 2, Sec. 690, 13th Ed.; Marsh v. Davidson, 9 Paige, 580; Seymour v. Seymour, 4 Johnson\u2019s Chancery, 409; Cannon v. McNabb, 48 Ala. 99.</p><p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-5\" pgmap=\"617\">Equity having obtained jurisdiction for purposes of discovery will grant relief that is purely legal. The court having acquired cognizance of the suit for the purpose of discovery will entertain it for the purpose of relief in most cases of fraud, account, accident and mistake. 13th Ed., Story\u2019s Eq. Jur., Vol. 1, Secs. 64 k and 71; Sanborn v. Kittridge, 20 Vt. 632; Holmes v. Holmes, 36 Vt. 535; Russell v. Clark, 7 Cranch. 69, see page 89.</p><p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-6\" pgmap=\"617\">In the last case the court say that \u201cif certain facts essential to a claim purely legal be exclusively within the knowledge of the party against whom the claim is asserted, he may be required in a court of chancery to disclose those facts, and the court being thus rightfully in possession of the cause will proceed to determine the whole matter in controversy. To the same effect are Story\u2019s Eq. Jur., 13th Ed., Sec. 64 k, and 456; Cannon v. McNabb, 48 Ala. page 99.</p><p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-7\" pgmap=\"617\">The rule is well stated by Fonblanque, 1 Eq., Bk. 1, Chap. 1, Sec. 3, note F: \u201c The concurrence of jurisdiction may, in the greater number of cases in which it is exercised, be justified by the propriety of preventing a multiplicity of suits; for as the mode of proceeding in courts of law requires the plaintiff to establish his case without enabling him to draw the necessary evidence from the examination of the defendant, justice could never be attained at law in those cases where the principal facts to be proved by one party are confined to knowledge of the other party. In such cases, therefore, it becomes necessary for the party wanting such evidence to resort to the extraordinary powers of a court of equity, which will compel the necessary discovery; and the court, having acquired cognizance of the suit for the purpose of discovery, will entertain it for the purpose of relief, in most cases of fraud, account, accident and mistake.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-9\" pgmap=\"617\">This language is quoted with approval by Hr. Story in the 1st Vol. of his Eq. Jur., Sec. 64 k, 13th Ed.</p><p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b617-10\" pgmap=\"617(11) 618(13)\">The rule is recognized by our own Supreme Court in the case of Martin v. Dryden, 1 Gilman, 187, old Ed., see page 210.</p><p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b618-6\" pgmap=\"618\">It will be claimed by the other side that since the enactment of the statutes in this State, providing for the examination of defendants and the production of books and papers in suits at law, that we have an adequate remedy at law, and therefore no right to file a bill for discovery.</p><p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b618-7\" pgmap=\"618\">We claim the statutes are simply enactments enlarging the methods of proceeding at law, and do not attempt in any way to affect remedies which were before of equitable cognizance. The very question applied to bills of discovery, both in England, where similar .statutes have been passed, and in this country, has been decided in accordance with our theory in the following cases: Cannon v. McNabb, 48 Ala. 99; Millsaps v. Pfeiffer, 44 Miss. 805; Shortwell v. Smith, 20 N. J. Eq. 79.</p><p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b618-8\" pgmap=\"618\">The same principle applied to another state of facts, and which, if there were no other authority, it seems to us, is conclusive to the question in this case, is laid down in McNabb v. Heald, 41 Ill. 326, page 330, where the court say: \u201cThe rule is well recognized that where equity has jurisdiction and an act of the Legislature confers like jurisdiction on a court of law, it then becomes concurrent in the two courts. * * * Unless there are prohibitory or restrictive words applied, the uniform interpretation is that they confer concurrent and not exclusive remedial authority.\u201d</p><attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b618-10\" pgmap=\"618\">Messrs. George W. Crawford and Cross &amp; Collins, for appellees.</attorneys><p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b618-11\" pgmap=\"618(97) 619(18)\">At the present time a court of equity will not take cognizance of every action for discovery and account. In Bispham\u2019s Principles of Equity (4th Ed.), Sec. 566, is the following : At common law no power existed in the courts to compel the production of deeds, books and writings, which were in the custody or control of one of the parties to a cause, and which were material to the right, title, or defense of the other. Application was consequently made to the court of chancery, and the jurisdiction of the chancellor was irequently exercised for the purpose of rectifying the defect in the common law and of compelling such production.</p><p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-5\" pgmap=\"619\">\u201c This equitable remedy is, however, of scarcely any importance at the present day, as both in England and this country statutes, have been passed by which the authority to compel the production of documents is conferred upon the common law courts.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-6\" pgmap=\"619\">That equity will not interfere where complainant has a full, adequate and complete remedy at law, is a principle which has been enunciated and settled in the following cases in this State: Coughran v. Smith, 18 Ill. 414; City, etc., v. Kidder, 26 Ill. 352; Felsenthal v. Johnson, 104 Ill. 21; Moore v. Hoisington, 31 Ill. 243; Stewart v. Mumford, 80 Ill. 192.</p><p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-8\" pgmap=\"619\">Prior to the enactment of the statutes hereinbefore set forth, compelling an adverse party to testify, and providing for the production of his books in a court at law, the jurisdiction of equity in this class of cases was undoubted; but by the creating of such statutes the reason for the exercise of the extraordinary jurisdiction of equity was done away with, and the chancery court may now, in the exercise of a sound discretion, relegate suitors to the common law courts. In Wait\u2019s Act. &amp; Def., Vol. 3, page 181, the rule as to bills of discovery at the present time, is laid down as follows :</p><p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1u\" pgmap=\"619\">\u201cThe mode of redress by bill of discovery was of very great importance so long as no power to elicit testimony from a party to an action existed at common law. But since, by statutes in most of the States, parties to actions have been made competent and compellable to testify, and the production of books and papers may now be enforced in proceedings at law; the common law tribunals have been rendered to a great extent ind\u00e9pendent of the auxiliary jurisdiction of equity in this regard.\u201d</p><p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b619-10\" pgmap=\"619\">The cases cited by appellant are none of them in point The text as laid down by Story and cited by counsel was undoubtedly true at the time it was written, but since that time common law courts have been invested with such ample powers in reference to the production of books, papers and documents, that the reasons for the exercise of equitable jurisdiction have ceased to exist.</p><p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b620-4\" pgmap=\"620\">Bills of discovery are addressed to the discretion of the chancellor. If, in the exercise of discretionary powers, he determines that a law court is the proper forum for the litigant, an Appellate Court will not reverse, because had ilie decision been to the contrary, the act of the chancellor would not have .been beyond his jurisdiction.</p><p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b620-5\" pgmap=\"620\">\u201cA court of equity is not always bound to act, though its decree in a given case might not be void for want of jurisdiction.\u201d Wait\u2019s Act. &amp; Def., Vol. 3, p. 158; Scott v. Whitlow, 20 Ill. 310.</p> <opinion data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b620-6\" pgmap=\"620\">Moran, P. J.</author> <p id=\"AZ6W\" pgmap=\"620\">The demurrer admits the contract set out in the bill and the dealings alleged in pursuance of said contract, that complainant is ignorant of the names of parties for whom refrigerators have been constructed by defendants, and of the number, dimensions and location of such refrigerators constructed under complainant\u2019s system, and the contract contains an agreement that defendants shall furnish such information to complainant. Defendants then, by contract, undertook to account, and without such account it can not be ascertained how much defendants are indebted.</p> <p id=\"b620-7\" pgmap=\"620\">Such circumstances entitle complainant to an account from the defendants and a disclosure or discovery of the matters which, by their contract, they agreed to inform complainant of. McKenzie v. Johnson, 4 Madd. 198; Pope v. Owsley, 27 Fed. R. 100.</p> <p id=\"b620-8\" pgmap=\"620\">\u201cIt is one of the usual grounds of equity jurisdiction to discover and compel an account of funds wrongfully concealed and withheld from the real owner.\u201d Russell v. Madden, 95 Ill. 485.</p> <p id=\"b620-9\" pgmap=\"620\">Where a duty rests upon the defendant to render an account and where the matters for which an. accounting is sought are peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant and discovery is sought, equity will assume jurisdiction to compel the discovery, and after a disclosure will retain the bill to grant complete relief. Story\u2019s Eq., Vol. 1, Secs. 456 to 459; Russell v. Clark\u2019s Ex\u2019rs, 7 Cranch, 66; Halsted v. Robb, 8 Porter (Ala.), 63.</p> <p id=\"b621-3\" pgmap=\"621\">It is not seriously contended, that equity would not have this jurisdiction before the passage of our statute giving the right to compel an adverse party to any civil action to testify as a witness on the trial, and giving the courts power in actions pending before them to compel the production of books and papers containing evidence pertinent to the issue.</p> <p id=\"b621-4\" pgmap=\"621\">Such legislation does not deprive equity of jurisdiction to compel discovery where such jurisdiction would be exercised before the statute, particularly where there is another ground of jurisdiction, to wit, account, as there is in this bill, A strict bill of discovery to obtain evidence to be used in an action at law, may be abrogated by implication, but even that is doubtful.</p> <p id=\"b621-5\" pgmap=\"621\">The jurisdiction in equity was established at a time when parties were incompetent as witnesses. Statutes rendering parties competent do not necessarily abrogate such jurisdiction.</p> <p id=\"b621-6\" pgmap=\"621\">It is said by the Supreme Court that the rule is well recognized that where equity has jurisdiction and an act of the Legislature confers like jurisdiction on a court of law, it becomes concurrent in the two courts. * * * Unless there are prohibitory or restrictive words applied, the uniform interpretation is that they confer concurrent and not exclusive remedial authority.\u201d McNabb v. Heald, 41 Ill. 326.</p> <p id=\"b621-7\" pgmap=\"621\">It is expressly held in West Virginia, that a statute allowing a court of law to compel a discovery upon oath in answer to interrogatories filed wherever it would be compelled upon a bill of discovery, did not abolish bills of discovery or deprive courts of equity of that ancient jurisdiction. Russell v. Deckeschied, 24 W. Va. 61; See also Elliston v. Hughes, 1 Head (Tenn.), 225; Cannon, v. McNabb, 48 Ala. 99; Millsaps v. Pfeiffer, 44 Miss. 805; Shortwell v. Smith, 20 N. J. Eq. 79.</p> <p id=\"b621-8\" pgmap=\"621\">The court erred in sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the bill, and the decree will be reversed and the case remanded for further proceedings.</p> <p id=\"b621-9\" pgmap=\"621\">Reversed and remanded.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
