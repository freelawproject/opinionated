Colby was operating his automobile insured by Liberty Mutual Insurance Company when it was involved in a collision with an automobile operated by Angela Colasanti. Michael Colby was killed in the accident. Colasanti was insured by a policy issued by Commerce Insurance Company providing bodily injury liability limits of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident. Neither Liberty Mutual Insurance Company nor Commerce Insurance Company is a party to this action. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>plaintiff, John N. Colby, Jr., was Michael\u2019s father and the named insured in an automobile policy issued by the defendant, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company (Metropolitan). The policy provided underinsured motorist coverage with limits of $100,000 per person and $300,000 per accident. Metropolitan rejected the plaintiff\u2019s claim for payment, pursuant to his underinsured motorist coverage, of his consortium-like damages due to the loss of his son. See G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2 (1992 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">As a result, the plaintiff brought this action against Metropolitan. The complaint was entitled \u201cComplaint for Declaratory Judgment\u201d and demanded a judgment declaring, among other things, that the \u201c[p]laintiff is entitled to Underinsured Motorist Coverage for his individual claims and damages arising from the death of Michael L. Colby in the accident caused by Angela Colasanti.\u201d Although, coincidentally, the plaintiff was the administrator of the estate of his son, Michael, it is clear that he did not bring this action as administrator either on behalf of Michael\u2019s estate or pursuant to G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, but brought it on his own behalf in his individual capacity. As he states in his reply brief, the action \u201cis fundamentally an action in contract for indemnification .... The controversy is ... a contractual issue between a policy holder [John N. Colby, Jr.,] and an insurer.\u201d Thus, this case is significantly different from <em>Smart </em>v. <em>Safety Ins. Co., </em>419 Mass. 144 (1994), which focuses on the rights of the estate of an individual who, like Michael L. Colby, was insured under his own automobile policy and was killed in a collision. As the plaintiff states in his reply brief, \u201cthe <em>Smart </em>decision . . . simply establish [es] the proposition, with which the plaintiff in this case has no quarrel, that because Michael Colby had his own policy, the claims of Michael Colby and of the Estate of Michael Colby, (as distinguished from the claims of John N. Colby, Jr.), would not be compensable under John N. Colby, Jr.\u2019s policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">In this case, both parties moved for summary judgment. A judge decided the motions on a stipulation of facts, the standard Massachusetts automobile insurance policy with 1991 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>Massachusetts mandatory endorsement, and the coverage selections page in Michael Colby\u2019s automobile policy. The judge allowed Metropolitan\u2019s motion, denied that of the plaintiff, and issued a judgment declaring that \u201cthe plaintiff is not entitled to recover underinsured motorist benefits under the [policy] issued to him by the defendant, Metropolitan Property &amp; Casualty Insurance Company, because he did not sustain \u2018bodily injury\u2019 in the accident upon which he bases his claim. It is further ordered and adjudged that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover underinsured motorist benefits under the policy issued to him by the defendant because the plaintiff\u2019s decedent had a policy of his own in effect at the time of the accident and he would, therefore, not have been entitled to recover such benefits under the Metropolitan policy had he survived the accident. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment is hereby allowed and the plaintiffs cross-motion for summary judgment is denied.\u201d The plaintiff appealed, and we allowed his application for direct appellate review. We affirm the judgment entered in the Superior Court insofar as it declares that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover underinsured motorist benefits under the policy issued to him by Metropolitan.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">The plaintiffs insurance policy with Metropolitan provides in \u201cPart 12. Bodily Injury Caused by an Underinsured Auto,\u201d including the 1991 Massachusetts mandatory endorsement, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b819-5\">\u201cSometimes an owner or operator of an auto legally responsible for an accident is underinsured. Under this Part, we will pay damages for bodily injury to people injured or killed as a result of certain accidents caused by someone who does not have enough insurance. We will only pay if the injured person is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of the underinsured auto. An auto is underinsured when the limits for automobile bodily injury liability insurance covering the owner and operator of the auto are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>\u201c1. Less than the limits shown for this Part on your Coverage Selections Page; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-5\">\u201c2. Not sufficient to pay for the damages sustained by the injured person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">The tortfeasor\u2019s (Colasanti\u2019s) automobile liability insurance limits of $25,000 per person and $50,000 per accident were less than the $100,000/$300,000 underinsured motorist coverage of the plaintiffs Metropolitan policy, and we shall assume, favorably to the plaintiff, that Colasanti\u2019s liability coverage would not be sufficient to pay for the damages sustained by the plaintiff. See G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 2, incorporating by reference G. L. c. 229, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">The policy goes on to provide in relevant part the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-8\">\u201cWe will pay damages to or for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-9\">\u201c1. You, while occupying your auto, while occupying an auto you do not own, or if injured as a pedestrian.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-10\">\u201c2. Any household member, while occupying your auto, while occupying an auto not owned by you, or if injured as a pedestrian. If there are two or more policies which provide coverage at the same limits, we will only pay our proportionate share. We will not pay damages to or for any household member who has a Massachusetts auto policy of his or her own or who is covered by a Massachusetts auto policy of another household member providing similar coverage with higher limits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b820-11\">\u201c3. Anyone else while occupying your auto. We will not pay damages to or for anyone else who has a Massachusetts auto policy of his or her own or who is covered by a Massachusetts auto policy of any household member providing similar coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>\u201c4. Anyone else for damages he or she is entitled to recover because of injury to a person covered under this Part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-4\">\u201cIf you are injured while occupying your auto and you have two or more autos insured with us with different limits, we will only pay up to the limits shown on your Coverage Selections Page for the auto you are occupying when injured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-5\">\u201cIf you are injured as a pedestrian or while occupying an auto you do not own and you have two or more Massachusetts auto policies which provide coverage at different limits, the policy with the higher limits will pay. If there are two or more policies which provide coverage at the same limits, we will only pay our proportionate share.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-8\">\u201cIf only one person sustains bodily injury, we will pay any unpaid damages up to the difference between the total amount collected from the automobile bodily injury liability insurance covering the owner and operator of the responsible auto and the \u2018per person\u2019 limit shown for this Part on your Coverage Selections Page. This is the most we will pay for injuries to one or more persons as the result of bodily injury to any one person in any one accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-9\">\u201cIf two or more people sustain bodily injury and are entitled to coverage under this Part, we will pay any unpaid damages up to the difference between the automobile bodily injury liability insurance \u2018per accident\u2019 limit covering the owner and operator of the responsible auto and the \u2018per accident\u2019 limit shown for this Part on your Coverage Selections Page. This is the most we will pay for injuries to two or more people as the result of bodily injury to two or more people in any one accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>It is clear that the plaintiff, who was the named insured in the Metropolitan policy, is not within any of the four classifications of persons the insurer agreed it would \u201cpay damages to or for.\u201d The first classification, \u201cYou, while occupying your auto, while occupying an auto you do not own, or if injured as a pedestrian,\u201d refers to the plaintiff as the named insured (you) under conditions which were not met since the plaintiff\u2019s injuries or losses were not. incurred while he was the occupant of his or another person\u2019s automobile nor were they incurred while he was a pedestrian. The second and third classifications of persons that Metropolitan agreed to \u201cpay damages to or for\u201d were persons other than the plaintiff named insured (you) such as members of the insured\u2019s household and \u201c[a]nyone else\u201d in specified circumstances. The plaintiff, therefore, does not fall into any of those categories of persons described as beneficiaries of the underinsurance provisions of the policy. A reading of \u201cPart 12. Bodily Injury Caused by an Underinsured Auto\u201d as a whole makes clear that classifications 1, 2, and 3 protect only persons who themselves have suffered bodily injury in an accident involving a motor vehicle. Classification 4, on the other hand, refers to individuals who are legally entitled to recover consortium or consortium-like damages resulting, however, solely from bodily injuries sustained by persons insured under the policy, that is, by members of classifications 1, 2, or 3 (\u201c4. Anyone else for damages he or she is entitled to recover <em>because of injury to a person covered under this Part\" </em>[emphasis added]). See <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Am. Ins. Cos., </em>397 Mass. 38, 41 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s argument does not focus on the language of the Metropolitan policy as demonstrating his entitlement to underinsured motorist benefits in this case. Instead, invoking the principle enunciated in <em>Cardin </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., </em>394 Mass. 450, 453-454 (1985), that a standard automobile policy cannot prevail over contrary statutory language or legislative policy, the plaintiff argues that G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L (1) and (2), requires that his policy provide him with the benefits he seeks even though no person covered by the policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>suffered bodily injury or death. It is enough, the plaintiff contends, that the plaintiff sustained injury in the form or likeness of loss of consortium as a consequence of the bodily injury and death of his son who was not insured under the plaintiff\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 113L, provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-5\">\u201c(1) No policy shall be issued or delivered in the commonwealth with respect to a motor vehicle . . . registered in this state unless such policy provides coverage in amounts or limits prescribed for bodily injury or death for a liability policy under this chapter, under provisions approved by the insurance commissioner, for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles . . . because of bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death resulting therefrom ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b823-6\">\u201c(2) For the purpose of said coverage, if the policyholder . . . elects to purchase the coverage described in this paragraph, the term \u2018uninsured motor vehicle\u2019 shall also include protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of insured motor vehicles ... to which a bodily injury liability bond or policy applies at the time of the accident and its bodily injury liability bond amount or policy limit is less than the policy limit for uninsured motor vehicle coverage and is insufficient to satisfy the damages of persons insured thereunder and only to the extent that the uninsured motor vehicle coverage limits exceed said limits of bodily injury liability subject to the term of the policy. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">The plaintiff argues that \u00a7 113L, governing uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage, mandates that a standard Massachusetts automobile insurance policy provide protection to persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages \u201cbecause of bodily injury.\u201d Then the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>tiff asserts that he meets those criteria because he is a person insured under the policy in question and he is entitled to recover damages \u201cbecause of bodily injury\u201d and death sustained by Michael.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">The plaintiff is correct in asserting that, being a standard Massachusetts automobile insurance policy, the policy in question must conform to statute. It is also true, however, that within the limits set by statute, the Commissioner of Insurance (commissioner) decides what the terms of a standard policy will be, <em>LeCuyer </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Liab. Ins. Co., </em>401 Mass. 709, 712 (1988), <em>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>395 Mass. 765, 771-774 (1985), and the commissioner\u2019s interpretation of the relevant statutes, although not controlling, is entitled to deference. <em>Massachusetts Medical Soc\u2019y </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>402 Mass. 44, 55 (1988). <em>American Family Life Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Ins., </em>388 Mass. 468, 474-475, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 850 (1983). By approving the policy in issue here, the commissioner made clear that, in the commissioner\u2019s opinion, G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, does not require that the underinsured motorist provision of a standard automobile policy protect the named insured when the underlying bodily injury or death was sustained by a person not insured by the policy. In our view, the commissioner acted within his discretion in deciding, in effect, that the words \u201cbecause of bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death resulting therefrom,\u201d appearing in G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, refer to bodily injury, sickness, disease, or death sustained by an insured under the relevant policy. The result is that the policy language need not be enlarged to meet statutory requirements. We affirm the judgment entered in the Superior Court insofar as it declares that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover underinsured motorist benefits under the policy issued to him by the defendant, Metropolitan Property and Casualty Insurance Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
