Early, divorced her husband, Gerald J. Early, in 1991. The judgment of divorce included a qualified domestic relations order (QDRO), pursuant to G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34 (1994 ed.), dividing the two major marital assets \u2014 the marital home and the husband\u2019s public employee pension rights accrued until the date of the divorce judgment \u2014 according to a sixty-forty ratio in favor of the plaintiff. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>dividing the pension benefits, the QDRO indicated that the State Board of Retirement (board) was to establish a separate account for the plaintiff, who was not a public employee, within the State employee retirement system (system). The account was to be independent of the former husband\u2019s existing account and was to consist of the then present value of 31.56 per cent of the former husband\u2019s accrued benefits. The plaintiffs eligibility for the benefits allocated to her independent account was not tied to her former husband\u2019s eligibility to collect his remaining pension benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">The former husband appealed the divorce judgment to the Appeals Court, on the ground, inter alia, that the trial judge lacked authority to include his accrued public employee pension rights in the division of marital property under the last paragraph of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 19 (1994 ed.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We accepted the case for direct appellate review. See <em>Early </em>v. <em>Early, </em>413 Mass. 720 (1992). We held that the award of 31.56 per cent of the husband\u2019s interest in the pension account \u201cfairly comes within the language of the last paragraph of \u00a7 19, because it sets aside a portion of the husband\u2019s pension interest to satisfy an obligation of marital support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 725. See also G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 34.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We also stated that \u201c[i]t was clearly within the judge\u2019s discretion to include the present value of the husband\u2019s public pension interest in the marital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>estate which was subject to the division <em>unless that action was precluded by </em>law\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Early, supra </em>at 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Before our decision in <em>Early, supra, </em>the plaintiffs counsel forwarded the trial judge\u2019s QDRO to the board with a request that the board implement the trial judge\u2019s order to create a separate account for the plaintiff consisting of 31.56 per cent of the former husband\u2019s accrued benefits. The board refused to implement the QDRO on the grounds that it lacked authority, under G. L. c. 32 (1994 ed.), to establish a separate account for the plaintiff and that the dollar value of the former husband\u2019s pension benefits was not determinable until the date of his retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">The plaintiff then filed a complaint seeking declaratory relief against the executive director of the board. The board filed an answer restating its position that (1) G. L. c. 32 did not authorize establishment of a separate account for individuals not members of the system; (2) G. L. c. 32 permitted payment to nonmembers with derivative rights to a State employee\u2019s benefits only when the member State employee is entitled to the benefits under G. L. c. 32; and (3) the plaintiff is not a member of the system. Gerald Early was joined as a necessary party. The trial judge then allowed the parties\u2019 joint motion to reserve and report the case, pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 111 (1994 ed.), and Mass. R. Civ. P. 64, 365 Mass. 831 (1974). We allowed the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">I. <em>Validity of court-ordered nonmember account. </em>In <em>Early, supra, </em>we established that the pension benefits of the former husband, who is a public employee, were properly included as marital property divisible under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq. (1994 ed.). See <em>Contributory Retirement Bd. of Arlington </em>v. <em>Mangiacotti, </em>406 Mass. 184 (1989). The issue raised on appeal by the board is whether it can be compelled to implement the assignment of a portion of those benefits as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>instructed in the QDRO.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The board contends that in order to implement the QDRO it would have to make the plaintiff, who is not a public employee, a member of the system with an independent account, an action which is beyond the scope of its statutory authority. We agree. Because implementation of the QDRO would require the board to establish an account in the system for a nonmember, we hold that the board cannot implement the QDRO as originally issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">The ability of the board to create accounts or award benefits within the system is limited to statutory authorization. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 1 et seq. See also <em>Boston Retirement Bd. </em>v. <em>McCormick, </em>345 Mass. 692, 695-697 (1963) (interpreting certain sections of G. L. c. 32 to prohibit payment of benefits by the board to members of retirement systems absent express statutory authorization). General Laws c. 32 defines a \u201cmember.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The crux of the definition is that a member is an <em>employee </em>of any one of a number of public bodies and included in various retirement systems. The plaintiff is not and never was a public employee. The board can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>not by administrative fiat, nor pursuant to a judicial order, expand the provision in G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1, defining a member. See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Marr Scaffolding Co., </em>414 Mass. 489, 493 (1993) (\u201cAn administrative agency has no inherent or common law authority to do anything. An administrative board may act only to the extent that it has express or implied statutory authority to do so\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">However, the board\u2019s authority to award benefits is not limited to members. The board is authorized to award benefits to beneficiaries. General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 1, defines \u201cbeneficiary\u201d as one \u201centitled to [a] present or potential benefit on account of membership of a person other than [herself].\u201d Under G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 3 (1) (b), \u201c[a] beneficiary shall not be deemed to be a member of the system . . . .\u201d Just as the board cannot make a nonemployee a member for the purposes of establishing an account absent statutory authorization, it cannot distribute benefits to a nonmember, except as authorized by statute. See <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>v. <em>Marr Scaffolding Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 19, specifically authorizes assignment of a member\u2019s interests in the retirement system in the division of marital property under G. L. c. 208. The board contends that the creation of an independent account for the plaintiff in the amount of 31.56 per cent of the former husband\u2019s accumulated benefits, as ordered by the Probate Court judge, is not an assignment of the former husband\u2019s interest, but rather the creation of a new interest. The plaintiff concedes as much, explaining that the \u201c \u2018account\u2019 which is sought on behalf of the plaintiff, Barbara Early, is actually a separate interest in the benefit due Gerald Early upon his retirement, rather than a share of his accumulated employee contributions which are maintained in a separate account for him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">In order to assign or otherwise share pension benefits with a nonmember, a member of the system can elect certain options at the time he becomes eligible to begin receiving benefits. G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 12. Because the plaintiff is not a member of the system, and because the separate account which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>plaintiff seeks to have implemented pursuant to the QDRO is not an \u201cassignment\u201d of pension benefits of the former husband, but rather requires the creation of a new interest, the QDRO requires the board to take action outside its statutory authority and to that extent is not enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">II. <em>Implementation. </em>The system is a contributory defined benefit system. Members of the system make periodic contributions into an annuity account during the course of their employment with the State. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 22 (1). The individual account of each contributing member is a record of the amount of the individual member\u2019s contributions to the system. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 22 (6) <em>(b). </em>In the event a member terminates employment with the State prior to becoming eligible to receive retirement benefits, he can seek a refund of the amount of contributions plus interest. However, if an employee maintains employment until becoming eligible to collect retirement benefits, the amount of benefits is not tied to the dollar value of his account, but rather is dependent on a number of variables not determinable until the date of eligibility, see G. L. c. 32, \u00a7\u00a7 5-7 (1994 ed.), as well as the options he elects on retirement, see G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">The board contends that it cannot presently implement the QDRO not only because the plaintiff is a nonmember ineligible for an account in the system, but also because the dollar value of 31.56 per cent of the present value of Gerald Early\u2019s pension benefits accrued until the date of the divorce decree cannot be calculated until Gerald Early becomes eligible to begin receiving his pension benefits. In the board\u2019s view, under G. L. c. 32, any benefits accrued by one spouse in the system, allocated by a court under G. L. c. 208 to a nonmember spouse, must be pursuant to an \u201cif and when received\u201d order,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because valuation of the member spouse\u2019s benefits is determinable only when he is himself eligible to begin receiving benefits. Thus, the board argues that pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>ently it cannot create an account in a fixed dollar amount for the plaintiff, regardless of her nonmember status. According to the plaintiff, the Probate Court judge\u2019s intent that she benefit from the husband\u2019s retirement benefits accrued during their marriage should not be contingent, as they would be in an \u201cif and when received\u201d order, on death or remarriage of the employee spouse, or her own remarriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">While the method of implementing the division of marital property determined by the original Probate Court judge is first for the court on remand, we note that \u00a7 12 of c. 32 was amended subsequent to the 1991 divorce proceedings. The amendments allow a former spouse, such as the plaintiff, to receive an irrevocable survivor beneficiary interest in the pension benefits of her former spouse, who is a member of the State employee retirement system. See G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 12, as amended through St. 1993, c. 442, effective April, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Although the QDRO as originally ordered by the Probate Court judge cannot fully be implemented by the board within the authority granted it under G. L. c. 32, the intent of the Probate Court judge (to ensure that the plaintiff would benefit from the retirement accrued by her former husband during their marriage) in dividing the marital assets under G. L. c. 208 should be effectuated to the extent permissible under c. 32, including consideration of the amendments to G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 12. This matter is remanded to the Plymouth Probate and Family Court for entry of a declaratory judgment consistent with this opinion. The Probate Court also should vacate the order of the Probate Court judge requiring the establishment of an independent account in the system and determine the method of implementation of the division of marital assets in accordance with this opinion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b855-5\">The last paragraph of G.
