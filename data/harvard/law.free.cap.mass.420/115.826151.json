L. c. 21E (1992 ed.) constitute a \u201cclaim\u201d subject to discharge under the United States Bankruptcy Code. The plaintiff, Reynolds Brothers, Inc. (Reynolds), is the beneficial owner of a parcel of land located at 91-99 Jackson Street in Canton (site). The site had been previously owned or occupied by the defendants, Texaco, Inc. (Texaco), and Prevett Oil Co., Inc. (Prevett). Following the discovery of oil contamination at the site, the plaintiff commenced this action pursuant to G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 5 <em>(a) </em>(1) and (5), seeking damages and a declaration of liability for future costs from the defendants whom the plaintiff alleges contributed to the contamination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The plaintiff moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of liability, and the defendants each filed cross motions for summary judgment. The judge denied the plaintiffs and Prevett\u2019s motions,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but granted Texaco\u2019s motian on the basis that the plaintiffs claims were discharged in bankruptcy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-28\">We begin by setting out the relevant facts. The site at issue has a long history of use as an oil storage facility. In the 1930s, a previous owner, Deane Coal Company, Inc. (Deane Coal), installed four oil storage tanks on the site. During the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>1940s, Deane Coal merged with Reynolds Brothers Fuel Corporation, which operated the site from 1947 until 1962. In 1962, William P. Reynolds purchased the site and leased it to White Fuel Corporation (White Fuel) for use as a petroleum terminal. White Fuel purchased the property in 1972, and merged into Texaco in 1979. Later that year, Texaco sold the site to Wren Realty Trust, a real estate trust in which the plaintiff holds a beneficial interest. In June, 1980, the plaintiff leased the site to Prevett for use as an oil terminal.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In August, 1982, the Canton board of health discovered oil contamination in a drainage ditch located near the site. On November 9, 1982, after investigations by the Canton board of health and the Department of Environmental Quality Engineering (DEQE),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the DEQE issued a Notice of Responsibility to the plaintiff regarding the oil contamination at the site. In that notice, the DEQE ordered the plaintiff, among other things, to (1) engage a licensed contractor to clean the site; (2) remove all oil, contaminated soil and materials in the drainage ditch, impoundment area, and drainage system; and (3) remove all free floating oil and contaminated trap rock beneath the fuel oil storage tanks. Despite the clear directives of the DEQE, the plaintiff refused to comply. In January, 1983, the DEQE cited the plaintiff for noncompliance with cleanup and containment requirements.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">In 1985, the plaintiff retained Gale Engineering Company (Gale) to evaluate the site. Following its investigation, Gale recommended that the plaintiff either remove and dispose of all contaminated soils, or contain the area. Gale also noted in its report that soil contamination had increased significantly since 1982, and attributed this condition to the site\u2019s \u201ccontin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>ued neglect and lack of adequate diking beneath [the] storage tanks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">In June, 1987, the plaintiff retained Costello Dismantling Company to clean, remove, and dispose of two of the site\u2019s oil tanks. Approximately one year later, the remaining two tanks were removed. According to the plaintiff, between September and November, 1988, it removed 440 tons of contaminated soil, incurring over $94,500 in cleanup costs. In additian, the plaintiff alleges that it will continue to incur significant response costs in connection with the remediation of the contaminated site.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-14\">On April 12, 1987, Texaco filed a Chapter 11 petition for bankruptcy protection in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. The court set a March 15, 1988, deadline for the filing of claims against Texaco (bar date). Texaco notified potential claimants of this bar date by publication in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times newspapers. On March 23, 1988, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed Texaco\u2019s plan of reorganization, and discharged all prepetition claims.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Neither the plaintiff nor Prevett filed a proof of claim in accordance with the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s bar order. Despite the plaintiff\u2019s knowledge of the site\u2019s oil contamination as early as August, 1982, the plaintiff failed to notify Texaco of its potential liability until October 17, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-28\">1. <em>\"Claims\u201d under the Bankruptcy Code. </em>The plaintiff argues that its cause of action for environmental cleanup costs under c. 21E did not constitute a \u201cclaim\u201d within the meaning of the Bankruptcy Code at the time of Texaco\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings. The Bankruptcy Code broadly defines a \u201cclaim\u201d as a \u201cright to payment, whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured or unsecured.\u201d 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 (5) (1988). Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor filing for reor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>ganization must submit a plan for reorganization to the Bankruptcy Court. Upon creditor approval and court confirmation of the plan, all prepetition debts not provided for in the plan will be discharged. See 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1126 (a) - (g), \u00a7 1123 (a) (4), \u00a7 1141 (1988). A creditor who has a \u201cclaim\u201d must file a proof of the claim with the Bankruptcy Court prior to the date fixed by the court, else the claim will be discharged upon judicial confirmation of the reorganization plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">Although we have not before been faced with the issue of when a c. 21E cause of action constitutes a \u201cclaim\u201d under the Bankruptcy Code, other courts have confronted a similar issue involving claims under CERCLA,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the parallel Federal statute. In cases involving CERCLA, courts have applied various standards in order to determine when environmental liability arising from the debtor\u2019s prepetition conduct becomes a claim for bankruptcy purposes. See Note, When Policies Collide: The Conflict Between the Bankruptcy Code and CERCLA, 24 Mem. St. U.L. Rev. 739, 762 (1994). At least three approaches have been used to determine when such a claim arises: (1) the claim arises upon the establishment of a certain relationship between the debtor and the creditor (relationship test), see <em>In re Chateaugay Corp., </em>944 F.2d 997, 1005 (2d Cir. 1991); (2) the claim arises at the time the claim could have been fairly contemplated or was reasonably foreseeable by the creditor (fair contemplation-foreseeability test), see <em>In re Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pac. R.R., </em>974 F.2d 775, 787 (7th Cir. 1992); <em>In re Nat\u2019l Gypsum Co., </em>139 B.R. 397, 409 (Bankr. N.D. Tex. 1992); (3) the claim arises when the creditor actually incurs the response costs (right to payment approach), see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Union Scrap Iron &amp; Metal, </em>123 B.R. 831, 838-839 (Bankr. D. Minn. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>We prefer the fair contemplation-foreseeability approach as the means to determine when a cause of action under c. 21E becomes a claim for purposes of the Bankruptcy Code. Several courts throughout the country have adopted this approach, see, e.g., <em>In re Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pac. R.R., </em>3 F.3d 200, 205 (7th Cir. 1993); <em>In re Jensen, </em>995 F.2d 925, 930-931 (9th Cir. 1993); <em>In re Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pac. R.R., </em>974 F.2d at 787; <em>In re Nat\u2019l Gypsum Co., supra; AM Int\u2019l, Inc. </em>v. <em>Datacard Corp., </em>146 B.R. 391, 393-394 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. 1992); <em>NCL Corp. </em>v. <em>Lone Star Bldg. Ctrs. (E.) Inc., </em>144 B.R. 170, 177 (Bankr. S.D. Fla. 1992), and at least one court in this circuit has expressed its approval. See, e.g., <em>Mesiti </em>v. <em>Microdot, Inc., </em>156 B.R. 113, 117 (Bankr. D.N.H. 1993) (\u201cThe preferred means of [deciding whether postbankruptcy CERCLA claims are discharged] involves judicial application of a \u2018foreseeability\u2019 test\u201d). See also Note, Discharging CERCLA Liability in Bankruptcy: When Does a Claim Arise?, 76 Minn. L. Rev. 327 (1991) (advocating for the adoption of a foreseeability standard to determine when CERCLA claims are discharge-able in bankruptcy).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The \u201cfair contemplation\u201d test provides that \u201call future response and natural resource damages cost based on prepetition conduct that can be fairly contemplated by the parties at the time of [d]ebtors\u2019 bankruptcy are claims under the [Bankruptcy] Code.\u201d <em>In re Jensen, supra </em>at 930, quoting <em>In re Nat\u2019l Gypsum Co., supra </em>at 409. Factors relevant to whether the claims are fairly contemplated include: \u201cknowledge by the parties of a site in which a PRP [potentially responsible party] may be liable, NPL [National Priorities List] listing, notification by EPA [the Environmental Protection Agency] of PRP liability, commencement of investigation and cleanup activities, and incurrence of response costs.\u201d <em>In re Nat\u2019l Gypsum Co., supra </em>at 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit employed a similar approach in <em>In re Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pac. R.R., supra </em>at 787. In that case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>nounced a possible formulation of when a contingent claim for recovery of environmental cleanup costs arises: \u201c[W]hen a potential CERCLA claimant can tie the bankruptcy debtor to a known release of a hazardous substance which this potential claimant knows will lead to CERCLA response costs, and when this potential claimant has, in fact, conducted tests with regard to this contamination problem, then this potential claimant has, at least, a contingent CERCLA claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 786.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">The record clearly establishes that the plaintiff \u201cfairly contemplated\u201d its claim under c. 21E prior to Texaco\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings. Texaco filed for bankruptcy protection in April, 1987. The plaintiff, however, was aware of Texaco\u2019s potential liability for the environmental cleanup of the oil tank facility long before that date. As early as November 9, 1982, the DEQE issued a Notice of Responsibility to the plaintiff regarding the oil contamination at the site. On January 19, 1983, the DEQE cited the plaintiff for noncompliance with cleanup and containment requirements. During 1982 through 1984, the Canton board of health repeatedly informed the plaintiff and its lessee, Prevett, of the need to clean the contaminated site. In 1985, the plaintiff retained an engineering firm which confirmed the soil contamination and identified the oil storage tanks as the source of contamination. In its report to the plaintiff, the engineering firm recommended either removal and disposal of the contaminated soil, or containment of the area. In addition, the report stated that \u201csoil contamination had increased significantly since the initial [DEQE] investigation in August and September 1982.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Finally, the plaintiff was aware that Texaco was a previous owner of the site, and had used the site as an oil storage facility. The record, thus, clearly supports Texaco\u2019s contention that the plaintiff had sufficient knowledge of Tex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>aco\u2019s potential liability to give rise to a contingent claim dis-chargeable in bankruptcy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> See <em>In re Jensen, supra </em>at 930-931 (State had sufficient knowledge of debtor\u2019s potential liability to give rise to a contingent claim for cleanup costs before debtor filed bankruptcy petition).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">To support its argument that its c. 21E claim is not a \u201cclaim\u201d for purposes of bankruptcy, the plaintiff relies on the right to payment approach adopted in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Union Scrap Iron &amp; Metal, </em>123 B.R. 831 (Bankr. D. Minn. 1990). In <em>Union Scrap, </em>the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sought to recover CERCLA response costs from Taracorp Industries, Inc. (Taracorp). <em>Id. </em>at 832. Taracorp moved to dismiss the suit claiming that its Chapter 11 reorganization barred the EPA\u2019s claims. <em>Id. </em>Taracorp argued that the release or threatened release of any hazardous substance which occurred prior to the filing of its bankruptcy petition was sufficient to create a legal obligation constituting a claim in bankruptcy. <em>Id. </em>at 835-836. The court rejected this approach, holding instead that the EPA did not have a CERCLA claim for purposes of bankruptcy until it actually incurred the response costs. <em>Id. </em>at 838. The court based its decision, not only on the fact that the EPA had not yet incurred response costs, but also on the fact that the EPA had no actual or presumed knowledge that Taracorp had any connection with the contaminated site until four years after the close of Taracorp\u2019s bankruptcy.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id: </em>at 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number><em>Union Scrap </em>is readily distinguishable from the present case because, unlike the EPA in <em>Union </em>Scrap, the plaintiff in this case had actual knowledge of its potential claims against Texaco long before Texaco filed its bankruptcy petition. We further note that the so-called \u201cright to payment\u201d approach set out in <em>Union Scrap </em>has been widely criticized as being inconsistent with the broad statutory definition of \u201cclaim,\u201d and with the overriding goal of the Bankruptcy Code to provide a \u201cfresh start\u201d for the debtor. See <em>In re Jensen, supra </em>at 928. It has also been criticized as encouraging creditors to delay cleanup efforts until the close of bankruptcy proceedings. <em>In re Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul &amp; Pac. R.R., supra </em>at 786 (\u201csuch stall tactics [may] not only frustrate the [Bankruptcy [C]ourt\u2019s interest in having all claims before it and the debtor\u2019s interest in a fresh start, but [also] frustrate CERCLA\u2019s interest in a speedy cleanup of hazardous sites\u201d). In addition, the significance of this opinion is questionable in light of a subsequent opinion in which the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota shifted its focus from whether the creditor incurred response costs to whether the creditor knew of its claim prior to the close of the bankruptcy proceedings. See <em>Sylvester Bros. Dev. Co. </em>v. <em>Burlington N.R.R., </em>133 B.R. 648, 653 (Bankr. D. Minn. 1991) (where governmental agency had no actual knowledge of potential CERCLA claim prior to the close of debtor\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings, claim is not discharged). Because <em>Union Scrap </em>has no application in this case, we decline to follow it.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>2. <em>Claims preserved under Texaco\u2019s reorganization plan. </em>The plaintiff next argues that its environmental claims were preserved under Texaco\u2019s reorganization plan because its claims are derivative of the claims of a governmental entity. We disagree. Texaco\u2019s reorganization plan exempted environmental claims of governmental entities from Texaco\u2019s bankruptcy protection.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The plan did not, however, similarly preserve environmental claims of private parties. Thus, under the plain terms of the reorganization plan, the plaintiff\u2019s claims are not preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">3. <em>Waiver. </em>We further reject the plaintiff\u2019s argument that Texaco waived the affirmative defense of discharge in bankruptcy by failing to include this defense in its original answer. The plaintiff initially named Texaco Overseas Holdings, Inc., as defendant in this case. After discovering that the plaintiff sued the wrong party, the parties agreed to substitute Texaco, Inc., as the proper defendant, and entered into a stipulation of substitution which anticipated the possibility that Texaco would raise additional affirmative de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>fenses. The stipulation provided: \u201cTo the extent that Texaco, Inc. wishes to amend its answer . . . Texaco, Inc. shall have twenty (20) days to file such amendment.\u201d In accordance with the stipulation, Texaco amended its answer in a timely fashion, and included the affirmative defense of discharge in bankruptcy.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">4. <em>Continuing releases. </em>The plaintiff further contends that Texaco\u2019s reorganization plan does not bar its claims because there are continuing releases<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> for which Texaco is responsible. The plaintiff has pointed to no evidence in the record, and we have not found any, to support its contention that continuing releases attributable to Texaco have occurred postpetition. We further note that if the plaintiff had responded in a timely manner to the DEP\u2019s cleanup directives, further contamination of the premises would have been avoided. The plaintiff should not be able to delay its cleanup efforts in order to preserve its claims against debtors seeking bankruptcy protection.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the summary judgment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b134-31\">The plaintiff also asserted claims of negligence, nuisance, and trespass.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b134-32\">The denial of the plaintiff\u2019s motion is not the subject of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b134-33\">The judge also granted Texaco\u2019s summary judgment against Prevett on its cross claim for contribution on the same basis.

The record clearly establishes that the DEQE, DEP\u2019s predecessor, imposed obligations on the plaintiff as early as 1982. Further, G. L. c. 21E, \u00a7 4 (1992 ed.), provides a private right of action in favor of any person who undertakes the removal of oil or hazardous materials, and who seeks to recover its response costs from the person liable for the contamination. <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>414 Mass. 824, 826 (1993).

Rather Union Scrap owned the site, and processed used batteries for Taracorp.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b141-4\">The relationship test set out <em>In re Chateaugay Corp., </em>944 F.2d 997, 1005 (2d Cir. 1991), and relied on by the motion judge below, also compels the conclusion that the plaintiff had a claim dischargeable in bankruptcy. Under this approach, unincurred response costs are \u201cclaims\u201d dis-chargeable in bankruptcy, so long as a release or threatened release of hazardous wastes occurs prepetition, and the relationship between the parties provides sufficient contemplation\u201d of the \u201cultimately maturing payment obligations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The <em>Chateaugay </em>court found that the regulatory relationship between the debtor and the EPA was sufficient to bring into contemplation the nature of response costs that would be incurred, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>warrant discharging claims based on prepetition releases. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b142-23\">Under the relationship test, the plaintiff clearly had a \u201cclaim\u201d dis-chargeable in bankruptcy. Texaco and its predecessor, White Fuel, owned or operated the site from 1962 to 1979. Texaco did not file for bankruptcy until April, 1987. Thus, any contamination attributable to Texaco occurred prepetition. Further, like the regulatory agency relationship in <em>Chateaugay, </em>the relationship between the plaintiff and Texaco was such that the plaintiff was aware of Texaco\u2019s potential liability prior to the bankruptcy proceedings. The plaintiff knew of the contamination at the site, knew that Texaco had been a previous owner, and knew that Texaco had used the site as an oil storage facility.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b142-33\">The reorganization plan provided: \u201cThe Claims of the [Department of Energy] and any Environmental Claims that are not Allowed Claims will not be discharged, will survive the Reorganization Cases, will be resolved in the judicial or administrative tribunals in which such Claims would have been determined as if the Reorganization Cases had not been commenced, and the amount of such Claims and the respective holder\u2019s rights related thereto will be determined as if the Reorganization Cases had not been commenced, whether or not a proof of claim in respect thereto is filed.\u201d The plan defined \u201cEnvironmental Claims\u201d as \u201cany Claims which have been or may be asserted by any governmental unit arising under varipus federal or similar statutes regarding environmental protection and related legislation, rules and regulations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b143-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s argument that Texaco is estopped from raising the defense of discharge in bankruptcy because of its conduct throughout the litigation is also without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b143-9\">General Laws c. 21E, \u00a7 2 (1992 ed.), defines a \u201crelease\u201d as \u201cany spilling, leaking, pumping, pouring, emitting, emptying, discharging, injecting, escaping, leaching, dumping or disposing into the environment . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b143-10\">The plaintiff argues for the first time on appeal that its claims could not have been discharged because it did not receive proper notice of Texaco\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings.
