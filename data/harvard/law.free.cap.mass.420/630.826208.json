L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1992 ed.),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> after a jury-waived trial, the defendant appealed. The sole issue is whether the evidence presented by the Commonwealth was sufficient to submit the case to the finder of fact. The Appeals Court affirmed the conviction in an unpublished decision. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>O\u2019Connor, </em>37 Mass. App. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>Ct. 1110 (1994). We allowed the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review. We also affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">\u201cIn reviewing the denial of motions for directed verdicts in criminal cases, we have frequently said that \u2018we must consider and determine whether the evidence, in its light most favorable to the Commonwealth, notwithstanding the contrary evidence presented by the defendant, is sufficient . . . to permit the jury to infer the existence of the essential elements of the crime charged ....\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-677 (1979), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sandler, </em>368 Mass. 729, 740 (1975). There are three elements to the crime of operating while under the influence under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24: (1) operation of a vehicle, (2) on a public way, (3) while under the influence of alcohol. See note 1, <em>supra. </em>The defendant maintains that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence on the first element, operation, was insufficient to support a guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Around midnight on May 14, 1993, there was a two-car collision on Memorial Drive in Cambridge. When State Trooper Robert Ahern arrived at the scene, he observed approximately six people attending to an injured person near two significantly damaged cars. When Ahern asked the group who had been driving either of the two cars, the defendant identified himself as one of the operators. Ahern asked for the defendant\u2019s license and registration. In answer to a question put by the police officer as to what happened in the accident, the defendant said that the other operator had \u201crun a red light.\u201d Noting that the defendant\u2019s eyes were glassy and red, Ahern asked the defendant if he had been drinking; the defendant responded affirmatively. Ahern administered several field sobriety tests, which the defendant did not perform well. Ahern then arrested the defendant for operating under the influence, At the police station, a breathalyzer test indicated the defendant had a blood alcohol content of .15.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>Relying on our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>401 Mass. 470 (1988) (where only evidence that defendant was operator of a vehicle was his admission at the scene to police that he was the driver, court reversed conviction on ground that evidence was insufficient to warrant submission of case to jury), the defendant argues that the above-stated facts are insufficient to establish that the defendant was the operator of one of the vehicles involved in the accident on Memorial Drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">The Appeals Court concluded in its unpublished decision that there was sufficient evidence to \u201ccompel the inference that the defendant did operate the motor vehicle, thus providing corroboration of the defendant\u2019s statement that he was operating the motor vehicle.\u201d We agree. The officer confirmed the defendant\u2019s version of the accident with other witnesses. The finder of fact could infer operation from the facts and circumstances surrounding the accident and from the defendant\u2019s cooperation with the field sobriety tests. Thus, there was no error in the judge\u2019s conclusion that he could infer operation based on the facts or that the defendant\u2019s admission was corroborated.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-15\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (a) (1) (1992 ed.), provided, in relevant part: \u201cWhoever, upon any way or in any place to which the public has a right of access . . . operates a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor . . . shall be punished by a fine of not less than one hundred nor more than one thousand dollars, or by imprisonment for not more than two years, or both.\u201d Section 24 (1) <em>(a) </em>(1) has since been amended by St. 1994, c. 25, \u00a7\u00a7 3-6, effective May, 1994.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b649-7\">General Laws c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) <em>(e) </em>(1992 ed.), provides, in relevant part, if evidence of a blood alcohol test \u201cis that such percentage was five one-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>hundredths or less, there shall be a presumption that such defendant was not under the influence of intoxicating liquor . . . ; if such evidence is that such percentage was more than five one-hundredths but less than ten one-hundredths, there shall be a presumption that such defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor.\u201d The statute has since been amended by St. 1994, c. 60, \u00a7\u00a7 102-109, effective May, 1994.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\">During the hearing, the judge said something about corroboration \u201cnot only [by] the details of the accident.\u201d The judge\u2019s full statement was inaudible.
