L. c. 231A (1992 ed.), challenges the consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>tutionality of \u00a7 12-20 of the Somerville Code of Ordinances (ordinance).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a judge in the Superior Court denied the plaintiffs request for a preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of the ordinance, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. The judge allowed the city of Somerville\u2019s (defendant\u2019s) motion for summary judgment, and the plaintiff appealed. A single justice of the Appeals Court, pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118 (1992 ed.), enjoined the defendant from enforcing the ordinance pending appeal. We granted the plaintiffs application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">The plaintiff contends that the ordinance is invalid under \u00a7 6 of art. 89 of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution (Home Rule Amendment), because it is inconsistent with G. L. c. 164 (1992 ed.), the State\u2019s regulatory scheme for public utilities.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree. Municipalities may not adopt by-laws or ordinances that are inconsistent with State laws. See <em>American Motorcyclist Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Park Comm\u2019n of Brockton, </em>412 Mass. 753, 756 (1992) (invalidating local regulation banning use of motorcycles because regulation inconsistent with statute giving person right to operate motor vehicle); <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>369 Mass. 831, 834-835 (1976) (invalidating ordinance requiring registered land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>surveyors and professional engineers contrary to statute exempting engineers subject to Department of Public Utilities regulations from registration requirements); <em>Del Duca </em>v. <em>Town Adm\u2019r of Methuen, </em>368 Mass. 1, 9 (1975) (holding ordinance facially inconsistent with statute and therefore void). See also art. 89, \u00a7 6; G. L. c. 43B, \u00a7 13 (1992 ed.). To determine whether a local ordinance is inconsistent with a statute, this court has looked to see whether there was either an express legislative intent to forbid local activity on the same subject or whether the local regulation would somehow frustrate the purpose of the statute so as to warrant an inference that the Legislature intended to preempt the subject. <em>Bloom </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>363 Mass. 136, 155-156 (1973). Moreover, in some circumstances we can infer that the Legislature intended to preempt the field because legislation on the subject is so comprehensive that any local enactment would frustrate the statute\u2019s purpose. <em>Wendell </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., </em>394 Mass. 518, 527-528 (1985). See also <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Lowell, supra </em>(intent to preempt inferred from comprehensive legislative scheme).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">The manufacture and sale of gas and electricity by public utilities is governed by G. L. c. 164. Given the comprehensive nature of this statute, we conclude that the Legislature intended to preempt local entities from enacting legislation in this area. See <em>Boston Edison Co. </em>v. <em>Boston, </em>390 Mass. 772, 774 (1984) (recognizing comprehensiveness of G. L. c. 164). Furthermore, the ordinance is inconsistent with particular provisions of the statute and the regulations of the Department of Public Utilities (department).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">When the plaintiff excavates a street to work on its underground gas distribution facilities or to provide gas service to the general public, the department mandates that the plaintiff utilize a \u201cleast-cost\u201d strategy to repair the excavation site including the use of competitive bidding procedures. See D.P.U. 93-60 at 232-233 (1993). See also D.P.U. 92-210 at 196 (1993). However, because of the ordinance the plaintiff must hire a \u201ccity contract representative,\u201d selected by the defendant, to provide patching, paving, and repair services at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>specified rates which, the plaintiff contends, exceed the rates it previously obtained with competitive bidding.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The ordinance also requires the plaintiff to use certain materials and paving techniques, such as infrared paving methods.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, under the ordinance, the plaintiff\u2019s responsibility for the excavation site continues for three years beyond the final infrared treatment, even though G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 70, does not require the pl\u00e1intiff to maintain the street after the excavation site has been repaired.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> General Laws c. 164, \u00a7 70, on the other hand, only requires the plaintiff to return an excavation site back to its original condition. See <em>Wendell </em>v. <em>Attorney Gen., supra </em>at 528 (holding by-law inconsistent because imposed conditions beyond those established by statute and exceeded town board of health authority). Because the ordinance conflicts with the statutory scheme for regulating public utilities, we conclude that it is inconsistent with c. 164 and therefore invalid. See <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Lowell, supra </em>at 834 (discussing desirability of uniform utility regulation).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Finally, although the defendant argues that G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 75,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> gives it the authority to regulate in this area, we con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>elude that the defendant cannot use its limited authority to enact an ordinance which has the practical effect of frustrating the fundamental State policy of ensuring uniform and efficient utility services to the public. See <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Lowell, supra </em>at 833, 835 (holding ordinance invalid despite city\u2019s statutory authority to establish reasonable regulations for welfare of citizens).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">The judgment of the Superior Court is vacated. The case is remanded for the entry of a judgment declaring that \u00a7 12-20 of the Somerville Code of Ordinances is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b721-5\">This ordinance is entitled \u201cAsphalt street and sidewalk openings\u201d and governs all aspects of street excavations in Somerville including: (1) the applicable fees, deposits, performance bonds, and fines required for each street opening permit granted; (2) the required highway department notification procedures; (3) the required procedures for excavating, backfilling, patching, paving, and barricading of excavation sites; and (4) the financial responsibilities and billing procedures required for permittees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The Home Rule Amendment states \u201c[a]ny city or town may, by the adoption, amendment, or repeal of local ordinances or by-laws, exercise any power or function which the general court has power to confer upon it, <em>which is not inconsistent with the constitution or laws enacted by the general court. . </em>.\u201d (emphasis added). Art. 89, \u00a7 6, of the Amendments to the Massachusetts Constitution. The plaintiff also contends that this ordinance violates \u00a7 7 of the Home Rule Amendment because it imposes a tax on the plaintiff. However, this contention was not raised below and may not be raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Guardianship of Doe, </em>411 Mass. 512, 513 n.2, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Gross, </em>503 U.S. 950 (1992). Moreover, because we conclude the ordinance to be invalid for other reasons, we need not address this argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b723-6\">It appears that, at the present time, only one paving contractor has the \u201cqualifications\u201d necessary to provide paving services under the ordinance. It is also noteworthy that this same contractor was involved in drafting the ordinance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b723-7\">Regardless, \u00a7 8 of the ordinance states that, \u201c[a]fter a proper settling period, the excavating shall be infra-red heat treated by the contract representative of the city. This work shall be the financial obligation of the permittee.\u201d Moreover, \u00a7 10 of the ordinance provides that \u201c[a] 11 street excavations shall be made permanent by the infra-red heat process and will be the financial responsibility of the permittee.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b723-8\">General Laws c. 164, \u00a7 70, provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a] gas company may, with the written consent of the aldermen or the selectmen, dig up and open the ground in any of the streets, lanes and highways of a town. ... It shall put all such streets, lanes and highways in as good repair as they were in when opened.\u201d However, \u00a7 11 of the ordinance provides that \u201c[t]he installation of permanent patch does not alleviate the permittee from the responsibility for trench settlement for a period of three (3) years from the date of the final infra-red permanent repair . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b723-9\">General Laws c. 164, \u00a7 75, provides: \u201cThe aldermen or selectmen may regulate, restrict and control all acts and doings of a corporation subject to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>this chapter which may in any manner affect the health, safety, convenience or property of the inhabitants of their towns.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
