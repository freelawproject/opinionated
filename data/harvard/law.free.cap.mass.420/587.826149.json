The plaintiff, Ronald C. McNeill, arrived at the accident scene and witnessed his daughter\u2019s injured state. His daughter died from her injuries two days later. As a result, the plaintiff suffered emotional distress which exacer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>bated his diabetic condition and led to his developing an ulcer.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The plaintiff, as administrator of his daughter\u2019s estate, brought a wrongful death action against Desjardins. He also brought an action against Desjardins on his own behalf for negligent infliction of emotional distress. At the time of the accident, Desjardins was insured under a policy issued by the defendant. The policy provides optional bodily injury liability coverage in the amount of $100,000 \u201cper person\u201d and $300,000 \u201cper accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The policy is a standard personal automobile insurance policy. It provides: \u201cThe most we will pay for injuries to one or more persons as a result of bodily injury to any one person in any one accident is shown on the Coverage Selections Page as the \u2018per person\u2019 limit. Subject to this limit, the most we will pay for injuries to two or more people as the result of bodily injury to two or more people in any one accident is shown on the Coverage Selections Page as the \u2018per accident\u2019 limit.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">The wrongful death claim was settled for the policy\u2019s $100,000 \u201cper person\u201d limit. The defendant contended that both claims were subject to a single \u201cper person\u201d limit of $100,000. The plaintiff filed a complaint for declaratory judgment seeking a declaration that his claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress triggered a second \u201cper person\u201d limit, entitling him to seek another $100,000. The parties each filed motions for summary judgment. The judge denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion and allowed the defendant\u2019s motion, declaring that the plaintiff\u2019s claims are subject to a single \u201cper person\u201d limit of $100,000. The plaintiff appealed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>We granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We affirm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">\u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when there are no material facts in dispute and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974).\u201d <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. </em>v. <em>Allianz Ins. Co., </em>413 Mass. 473, 476 (1992). See <em>Garweth Corp. </em>v. <em>Boston Edison Co., </em>415 Mass. 303, 304 (1993). \u201cHere, there are no material facts in dispute. The only dispute is about the proper interpretation of the relevant insurance polic[y], and therefore raises only a question of law.\u201d <em>Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., supra </em>at 476. See <em>Jet Line Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>American Employers Ins. Co., </em>404 Mass. 706, 710 n.5 (1989); <em>Jefferson Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Holyoke, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 472, 475 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">\u201cBecause the language of the standard [personal automobile insurance] policy is prescribed by statute and controlled by the Division of Insurance rather than the individual insurer, the rule of construction resolving ambiguities in a policy against the insurer is inapplicable.\u201d <em>Bilodeau </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co., </em>392 Mass. 537, 541 (1984), and cases cited. \u201cInstead, we must ascertain \u2018the fair meaning of the language used, as applied to the subject matter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Save-Mor Supermarkets, Inc. </em>v. <em>Skelly Detective Serv., Inc., </em>359 Mass. 221, 226 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">The \u201cper person\u201d limit limits to $100,000 the policy\u2019s coverage for \u201cinjuries to one or more persons as a result of bodily injury to any one person in any one accident.\u201d \u201cThis language is clear and unambiguous.\u201d <em>Santos </em>v. <em>Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co., </em>408 Mass. 70, 79 (1990). It applies the \u201cper person\u201d limit to injuries to more than one person where the injuries result from bodily injuries to the same person in the same accident. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>The wrongful death claim sought recovery for an injury (i.e., the plaintiffs daughter\u2019s death) resulting from bodily injury to the plaintiffs daughter in the accident. While the emotional distress claim seeks recovery for a different injury (i.e., the plaintiff\u2019s emotional distress), this injury also was the result of the daughter\u2019s bodily injury in the accident. It is his daughter\u2019s injuries, and her resulting death which caused the plaintiff the emotional distress for which he seeks relief. As the motion judge noted, the plaintiff\u2019s emotional distress claim \u201cis a by-product of and entirely dependent upon the bodily injury to his daughter.\u201d The claims thus are subject to the same \u201cper person\u201d limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s physical ailments do not warrant a separate \u201cper person\u201d limit. While they may constitute \u201cbodily injury,\u201d they are the result of the plaintiff\u2019s emotional distress, not its cause. The plaintiff\u2019s argument that his emotional distress was a bodily injury received in the accident is flawed because emotional distress is not a bodily injury. <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Diamant, </em>401 Mass. 654, 656 (1988) (\u201c \u2018Bodily injury\u2019 . . . encompasses only physical injuries to the body and the consequences thereof\u2019). See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Boston Gas Co., </em>414 Mass. 129, 138 n.9 (1993), citing <em>Allstate Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Diamant, supra </em>(\u201cWe have . . . construed the words \u2018bodily injury\u2019 in an insurance policy to exclude the coverage of mental pain . . .\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">The plaintiff argues that, because the emotional distress claim is independent of the wrongful death claim and seeks recovery for injuries to a different person than the wrongful death claim, it should not be subject to the same \u201cper person\u201d limit as the wrongful death claim. The policy limits coverage for all claims resulting from bodily injury to one per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>son in one accident. Here, all claims result from the plaintiff\u2019s daughter\u2019s injury in the single accident, and thus they are subject to the $100,000 \u201cper person\u201d limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Our decision is bolstered by the fact that the policy language at issue was created to prevent the type of interpretation urged by the plaintiff\". In <em>Bilodeau, supra </em>at 538, 543, we held that under the then standard automobile insurance policy, a claim for loss of consortium was entitled to a separate \u201cper person\u201d limit from the underlying claim for bodily injuries in the accident. The \u201cper person\u201d limit limited the amount paid \u201cfor injuries to any one person as a result of any one accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540. To eliminate the effect of this decision, the commissioner changed the \u201cper person\u201d limit in the standard policy to the language at issue in the present case. <em>Santos, supra </em>at 79. In <em>Santos, </em>we held that, under this new language, consortium-like claims are subject to the same \u201cper person\u201d limits as the bodily injury claims, as they result from the same bodily injury in the accident. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-8\">The defendant accepts the plaintiffs assertion that these physical conditions were causally related to the emotional distress he suffered as a result of the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b606-9\">The policy defines the word \u201cwe\u201d as \u201cthe company issuing th[e] policy,\u201d namely, the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b607-8\">The only issue on appeal is whether both claims are subject to the same \u201cper person\u201d limit. It is not disputed that the plaintiffs emotional distress claim is covered by the policy and that this claim is independent of the wrongful death claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b608-6\">The fact that an essential element of a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress is \u201cphysical harm manifested by objective symptomatology,\u201d <em>Payton </em>v. <em>Abbott Labs, </em>386 Mass. 540, 557 (1982), does not make such emotional distress a bodily injury. This requirement exists for evidentiary purposes and is not related to the classification of injuries as bodily injuries for insurance purposes. See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Boston Gas Co., </em>414 Mass. 129, 138 n.9 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
