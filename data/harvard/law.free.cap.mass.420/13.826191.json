Violation of the policy could result in \u201cappropriate disciplinary action up to and including termination.\u201d The policy provided that \u201c[a]ll disciplinary actions will be taken in accordance with the provisions of applicable law or collective bargaining agreements.\u201d Despite this policy, the department waited approximately one year before terminating Arsenault.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After his termination, Arsenault filed a grievance with the defendant union which, pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement with the department, brought the grievance to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">At the arbitration hearing, Arsenault claimed that he found the gun at work and put it in his toolbox while awaiting advice from a friend, a police officer, on what to do. The arbitrator ruled that, while Arsenault knew that his possession of the gun was wrong and must accept some responsibility for his actions, there was not just cause for his termination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The arbitrator reversed the department\u2019s discharge of Arsenault and ordered his reinstatement without back pay. As a result of his termination and subsequent reinstatement, Arsenault suffered a suspension without pay for seven months and ten days.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">On February 23, 1993, the department sought to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award on the ground that it \u201cviolates the Commonwealth\u2019s explicit, well-defined, and dominant public policy against the unauthorized possession of handguns\u201d and that under G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 <em>(a) </em>(3) (1992 ed.), \u201cthe arbitrator exceeded his power in rendering an award that is contrary to public safety policy.\u201d The Superior Court judge concluded that the department failed to establish any basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>vacating the arbitrator\u2019s decision. He denied the department\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings and entered judgment confirming the arbitrator\u2019s decision. The department appealed. We transferred the case here on our own motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u201cCourts inquire into an arbitration award only to determine if the arbitrator has exceeded the scope of his authority, or decided the matter based on \u2018fraud, arbitrary conduct, or procedural irregularity in the hearings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>J. Farmer &amp; Co., </em>407 Mass. 1006, 1007 (1990), quoting <em>Marino </em>v. <em>Tagaris, </em>395 Mass. 397, 400 (1985). Vacation of arbitration awards is limited to the grounds set forth in G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Concerned Minority Educators of Worcester </em>v. <em>School Comm. of Worcester, </em>392 Mass. 184, 187 (1984); <em>School Comm. of W. Springfield </em>v. <em>Korbut, </em>373 Mass. 788, 792 (1977). \u201cWe do not, and cannot, pass on an arbitrator\u2019s alleged errors of law and, absent fraud, we have no business overruling an arbitrator because we give a contract a different interpretation.\u201d <em>Concerned Minority Educators of Worcester, supra </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>187. \u201cTh[is] policy of limited judicial review is reflective of the strong public policy favoring arbitration.\u201d <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist., supra </em>at 1007.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">\u201cArbitration, it is clear, may not \u2018award relief of a nature which offends public policy <em>or </em>which directs or requires a result contrary to express statutory provision\u2019 \u201d (emphasis added). <em>Plymouth-Carver Regional Sch. Dist., supra </em>at 1007, quoting <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Falgarano, </em>380 Mass. 18, 28 (1980).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Such an award is beyond the arbitrator\u2019s powers and is therefore subject to vacation under G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 (a) (3). See <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 220, 227 (1979). The Massachusetts cases vacating an arbitrator\u2019s award on public policy grounds have addressed awards which directly conflicted with a statutory limit on, or delegation of power. See <em>Watertown Firefighters, Local 1347 </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>376 Mass. 706, 713-714 (1978); <em>School Comm. of Hanover </em>v. <em>Curry, </em>369 Mass. 683, 685 (1976); <em>Boston Police Patrolmen\u2019s Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 226. Our cases have not addressed the type of public policy at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">We turn to decisions of other courts to determine the breadth of the public policy exception. To be vindicated, public policy \u201cmust be well defined and dominant, and is to be ascertained \u2018by reference to the laws and legal precedents and not from general considerations of supposed public interests.\u2019 \u201d <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Local Union 759, Int\u2019l Union of United Rubber, Cork, Linoleum &amp; Plastic Workers, </em>461 U.S. 757, 766 (1983), quoting <em>Muchany </em>v. <em>United States, </em>324 U.S. 49, 66 (1945). See, e.g., <em>United Paperworkers Int\u2019l Union </em>v. <em>Misco, Inc., </em>484 U.S. 29, 43 (1987); <em>Department of Cent. Management Servs. </em>v. <em>American Fed\u2019n of State, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number><em>County &amp; Mun. Employees, </em>245 Ill. App. 3d 87, 94 (1993); <em>Social Servs. Union/AFN, SEIU Local 535 </em>v. <em>Alameda County Training &amp; Employment Bd., </em>207 Cal. App. 3d 1458, 1465 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">In a case somewhat analogous to the present case, the Supreme Court upheld an arbitrator\u2019s award reinstating an employee who was fired for having traces of marihuana in his automobile parked at the workplace. <em>United Paperworkers Int\u2019l Union </em>v. <em>Misco, Inc., supra </em>at 44. The Supreme Court rejected the argument that the public policy against operating dangerous machinery under the influence of drugs required termination. <em>Id. </em>It stated that, \u201c[although certainly such a judgment is firmly rooted in common sense, ... a formulation of public policy based only on \u2018general considerations of supposed public interests\u2019 is not the sort that permits a court to set aside an arbitration award that was entered in accordance with a valid collective bargaining agreement.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b35-6\">The public policy exception does not address \u201cdisfavored conduct, in the abstract, but [only] disfavored conduct which is <em>integral to the performance of employment </em>duties\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Delta Air Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>Air Line Pilots Ass\u2019n, Int\u2019l, </em>861 F.2d 665, 671 (11th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 871 (1989). \u201cWhere the person performs his employment duties and, <em>in doing so, </em>violates standards, restraints and restrictions on conduct, clearly and explicitly established by the people in their laws, a requirement that the employer suffer that malperformance and not discharge the offender does itself violate . . . public policy\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Id. </em>at 674. Arbitration awards reinstating discharged employees are thus not upheld if the public policy relates to the worker\u2019s employment and the \u201coffense [goes] to the heart of the worker\u2019s responsibilities.\u201d <em>United States Postal Serv. </em>v. <em>American Postal Workers Union, </em>736 F.2d 822, 823, 825 (1st Cir. 1984) (employee embezzled money from the post office in violation of statutes specifically forbidding such conduct by postal employees and the public trust in the post office). In such cases, \u201cit is the employee <em>qua </em>employee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>who is the wrongdoer. It is [the employee\u2019s] employment which made his [conduct] violate law and public policy. [He] could not correct his offensive conduct without altering the performance of his employment duties. He could not continue his offensive conduct and yet perform his employment duties legally. Furthermore, [the employer] could not permit [him] to continue to perform his employment duties while his offensive conduct continued, without being an accessory to the wrongdoing.\u201d <em>Delta Air Lines, supra </em>at 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Arbitration awards reinstating discharged employees also are vacated if the award violates a public policy which relates to the employee\u2019s job and which exists because the job itself makes the employee\u2019s conduct an immediate threat to the general public. See, e.g., <em>Exxon Shipping Co. </em>v. <em>Exxon Seamen\u2019s Union, </em>993 F.2d 357, 367 (3d Cir. 1993) (helmsman of oil tanker tested positive for drugs after ship ran aground; \u201cwe emphasize ... the potentially disastrous effects of a major oil spill on the environment. . . . The magnitude of possible harm to the public distinguishes this case from those upholding arbitration awards\u201d [footnote omitted]); <em>Gulf Coast Indus. Workers Union </em>v. <em>Exxon Co., U.S.A., </em>991 F.2d 244, 252 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 965 (1993) (technician at petro-chemical refinery tested positive for drugs; \u201cpetro-chemical refineries are dangerous places; there is no margin for error. . . . Such assignments [as the employee\u2019s] have the capacity to place thousands of people, as well as the surrounding environment, at risk\u201d); <em>Delta Air Lines, supra </em>at 668 (air line pilot flew while intoxicated); <em>Iowa Elec. Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Local Union 204 of the Int\u2019l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, </em>834 F.2d 1424, 1427. n.2 (8th Cir. 1987) (nuclear power plant worker violated safety regulations: \u201cIn contrast to [ ] safety rules . . . designed to protect employees inside the . . . plant \u2014 are the safety rules . . . designed to protect not only employees, but also the general public\u201d); <em>Amalgamated Meat Cutters &amp; Butcher Workmen, Local Union 540 </em>v. <em>Great W. Food Co., </em>712 F.2d 122, 124 (5th Cir. 1983) (policies against drunk driving \u201cbecome even more compelling when the driver is regularly em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>ployed to course the highways in a massive tractor-trailer rig\u201d). Arbitration awards that reward or encourage illegal conduct are also vacated. See <em>Trustees of Community College Dist. No. 508 </em>v. <em>Cook County College Teachers Union, Local 1600, </em>74 Ill. 2d 412, 425-426 (1979) (vacating an arbitrator\u2019s award favoring employees who participated in an illegal strike over those who did not).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">Contrary to the foregoing cases, arbitration awards reinstating employees are upheld if the employees\u2019 conduct, even though harmful, was not related to their job activities and did not pose a special risk to the public due to their job. See <em>United Paperworkers Int\u2019l Union, supra </em>at 44 (possessing marihuana at work); <em>United States Postal Serv. </em>v. <em>National Ass\u2019n of Letter Carriers, </em>839 F.2d 146 (3d Cir. 1988) (postal employee, while off duty, fired gun shots at postmaster\u2019s automobile); <em>Florida Power Corp. </em>v. <em>International Bhd. of Elec. Workers, Local 433, </em>847 F.2d 680, 681 (11th Cir. 1988) (employee arrested for drug use while off duty); <em>Local 453, Int\u2019l Union of Elec., Radio &amp; Mach. Workers </em>v. <em>Otis Elevator Co., </em>314 F.2d 25, 26 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 373 U.S. 949 (1963) (gambling at work).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">If an award is permissible, even if not optimal for the furtherance of public policy goals, it must be upheld. Arbitration awards reinstating employees are therefore upheld if the public policy, while disfavoring the employees\u2019 conduct, does not require dismissal. See, e.g., <em>National Ass\u2019n of Letter Carriers, supra </em>at 149-150 (\u201ca policy in favor of protecting co-workers and customers from [the employee\u2019s] violent conduct [assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that such a policy is properly ascertained] does not require his discharge for its fulfillment\u201d); <em>Lansing Community College </em>v. <em>Lansing Community College Chapter of the Michigan Ass\u2019n for Higher Educ., </em>161 Mich. App. 321, 333 (1987), vacated and remanded, 429 Mich. 895, reaffirmed without decision, 171 Mich. App. 172 (1988) (award reinstating professor who smoked marihuana with students did not violate public policy; \u201cneither the agreement, as so interpreted, nor the award violates the well-defined public policy against the use of illegal narcotics. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>arbitrator merely interpreted the agreement as providing violators such as [the professor] a second chance at employment following the imposition of a form of punishment less severe than permanent discharge\u201d); <em>Amalgamated Transit Union, Div. 1300 </em>v. <em>Mass. Transit Admin., </em>305 Md. 380, 390 (1986) (\u201cpublic policy against drunk driving is not so extreme\u201d as to require firing bus driver who drove with alcohol on breath instead of suspending him without pay for over eight and one-half months).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">In the present case, the arbitration award does not violate a well-defined and dominant public policy, ascertained from laws and legal precedents. The department\u2019s written policy against possessing weapons at work did not mandate that the employee be discharged. See <em>supra </em>at 14. The policy allowed for the imposition of a penalty less severe than permanent discharge, and said that disciplinary actions would be taken in accordance with applicable collective bargaining agreements. The applicable collective bargaining agreement gave the arbitrator the authority to impose a less severe sanction than termination. The department could have had a policy requiring discharge of employees who possess guns at work. It did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">While Arsenault may have violated criminal statutes, such as G. L. c. 269, \u00a7\u00a7 10 &amp; 11C (1992 ed.),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the policies the statutes embody, the arbitration award reinstating him did not. The criminal laws do not dictate that an employee who is found to possess an illegal firearm must be terminated. The policies embodied in the criminal laws do not relate to Arsenault\u2019s employment. Arsenault\u2019s conduct was wrong in itself; his employment did not make it any more so. His possession of the gun at work did not go to the heart of his employment duties. See <em>American Postal Workers Union, supra </em>at 825. The policy against the possession of unlicensed and otherwise illegal handguns was meant to be vindicated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>and may be vindicated, through the criminal justice system. See <em>Otis Elevator Co., supra </em>at 29. This policy does not dictate that a violator also lose his job.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">The arbitration award also did not violate the policy in favor of safety in the workplace. See <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Rodgers, </em>408 Mass. 614, 619 (1990) (employer has duty to provide safe work environment); <em>Longever </em>v. <em>Revere Copper &amp; Brass, Inc., </em>381 Mass. 221, 223 (1980) (\u201cAmong the common law duties placed on an employer was the responsibility to provide a safe place to work\u201d). As a result of the time lag between firing and reinstatement, the arbitration award had the effect of an unpaid suspension for seven months and ten days. The arbitrator, as final judge of the proper means of discipline, concluded that this, in addition to a record of wrongful conduct, was sufficient disciplinary action.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> While Arsenault\u2019s conduct \u201cwould have provided sufficient grounds for an arbitrator to find \u2018just cause\u2019 for discharge, we recognize that the parties bargained for the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the contract and that even our strong disagreement with the result does not provide sufficient grounds for vacating the arbitrator\u2019s award.\u201d <em>State Auditor </em>v. <em>Minnesota Ass\u2019n of Professional Employees, </em>504 N.W.2d 751, 757-758 (Minn. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b32-7\">The search of the premises was authorized by the department. Arsenault opened the toolbox at the request of the police.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b32-8\">His termination also was based on his alleged possession of marihuana. That charge, and an arbitrator\u2019s dismissal of it, are not at issue here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b32-9\">The department correctly does not argue that the arbitrator did not .use the proper burden of proof. Arbitration awards may not be vacated for errors of law. See <em>infra </em>at 15 &amp; note 4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b33-6\">This section provides, in pertinent part: \u201cUpon application of a party, the superior court shall vacate an award if:</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">\u201c(1) the award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means;</p>\n<p id=\"b33-8\">\u201c(2) there was evident partiality by an arbitrator appointed as a neutral, or corruption in any of the arbitrators, or misconduct prejudicing <em>the </em>rights of any party;</p>\n<p id=\"b33-9\">\u201c(3) the arbitrators exceeded their powers or rendered an award requiring a person to commit an act or engage in conduct prohibited by state or federal law;</p>\n<p id=\"b33-10\">\u201c(4) the arbitrators refused to postpone the hearing upon a sufficient cause being shown therefor or refused to hear evidence material to the controversy or otherwise so conducted the hearing, contrary to the provisions of section five as to prejudice substantially the rights of a party;</p>\n<p id=\"b33-11\">\u201c(5) there was no arbitration agreement and the issue was not adversely determined in proceedings under section two and the party did not participate in the arbitration hearing without raising the objection; but the fact that the award orders reinstatement of an employee with or without back pay or grants relief such that it could not grant or would not be granted by a court of law or equity shall not be ground for vacating or refusing to confirm the award.\u201d G. L. c. 150C, \u00a7 11 <em>(a) </em>(1992 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The defendant argues that the department waived the issue of public policy by not raising it at arbitration. That argument is misplaced. \u201c[T]he question of public policy is ultimately one for resolution by the courts.\u201d <em>W.R. Grace &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Local Union 759, Int\u2019l Union of United Rubber, Cork, Linoleum &amp; Plastic Workers, </em>461 U.S. 757, 766 (1983). If the arbitration award violates public policy, \u201cwe are obliged to refrain from enforcing it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b38-7\">Arsenault was charged with possession of a handgun with an obliterated serial number, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 11C (1992 ed.), and unlicensed possession of a handgun, G. L. c. 269, \u00a7 10 (1992 ed.). The former charge was continued without a finding and the latter charge was dropped.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b39-7\">Criminal charges and termination of employment are unrelated. Each furthers different policies and imposes different penalties. The parties are different, as are the rules of evidence and burden of proof. An employer need not await the outcome of a criminal trial before terminating an employee who violates clear workplace rules. Termination need not be contingent on the outcome of criminal litigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b39-13\">In determining that the safety of the work environment was not sufficiently threatened by Arsenault\u2019s behavior to require permanent discharge, the arbitrator could consider the fact that the department waited nearly one year after the gun was discovered before firing Arsenault or bringing lesser disciplinary action such as suspension.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
