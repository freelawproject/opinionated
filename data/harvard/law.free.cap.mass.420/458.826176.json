The sole issue on appeal is whether the judge erred in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the victim\u2019s pretrial identification after concluding that the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive. We granted the defendant\u2019s application for direct appellate review. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">We recite the facts found by the judge. On April 7, 1992, Leopoldino Goncalves<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was working at a parking lot on the corner of Traveler Street and Washington Street in Boston. After he finished work, at approximately 10:50 p.m., Goncalves walked across the street to use a public telephone that was located on Washington Street. Street lights provided the only illumination.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">When Goncalves finished using the telephone, a white female with a limp approached him and asked him for a dollar. Goncalves told the woman that he did not have any money. A black male armed with a machete then approached. The man grabbed Goncalves\u2019s wallet and at the same time the woman snatched money from Goncalves\u2019s front pocket. The assailants discarded the wallet after removing the money. They left the area together in an automobile. Goncalves pursued them in his own automobile, but he lost sight of them in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>a public housing project. The entire incident described lasted only a few minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Approximately forty-five minutes later, Goncalves went to the Area D-4 police station and reported the robbery. He described the male assailant as a twenty-seven to thirty year old black male, six feet tall with a medium build, weighing 170 pounds, and wearing a black cap, blue jeans, and a brown sweatshirt. Goncalves was shown about six books containing photographs of suspects, but was unable to identify his assailants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Goncalves then accompanied a police officer to view a group of potential suspects. Once again, Goncalves did not make an identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">The day following the incident, four police officers arrived at Goncalves\u2019s place of employment at approximately 5 p.m. They told Goncalves that they wanted him to view two suspects. Goncalves accompanied the officers. When they arrived at the location where the suspects were being held, Goncalves saw a group of six to eight people. Only one adult black male, the defendant, was present and a female with a limp was the only adult white female present. The two suspects were being \u201cdetained\u201d by police officers but they were not handcuffed. The defendant and the woman were brought forward a few steps by the officers. Goncalves then identified the pair as his assailants. Goncalves based his identification in part on the fact that the clothing worn by the suspects was the same as that worn by his assailants.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">The defendant possessed several characteristics that did not match Goncalves\u2019s initial description of the male assailant. A booking photograph taken of the defendant at the time of his arrest, the day after the incident, shows that the defendant had a moustache. Yet Goncalves had never mentioned that the male assailant had a moustache. The booking sheet indicates that the defendant is thirty-seven years old and weighs 220 pounds, whereas Goncalves had described a man of approximately twenty-seven years in age, weighing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>170 pounds, with a medium build. Finally, at the time of the hearing on the motion to suppress the defendant was missing several front teeth. When describing his assailants to the police, Goncalves did not tell them that the male assailant had missing teeth.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">The judge ruled that Goncalves\u2019s identification of the defendant was tainted because it was made at an unnecessarily suggestive showup. The evidence presented at the motion hearing supports this conclusion. Although one-on-one confrontations are not per se excludable, they are disfavored because of their inherently suggestive nature. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Howell, 394 Mass. 654, 660 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnett, </em>371 Mass. 87, 92 (1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1049 (1977). Showups have been permitted when conducted in the immediate aftermath of a crime and in exigent circumstances. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnett, supra </em>at 92. See <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno, </em>388 U.S. 293, 301-302 (1967). The showup employed by the police in this case was conducted eighteen hours after the crime. It took place in the area of the housing project where Goncalves had seen his assailants drive the previous night; the defendant was brought forward from the group before Goncalves positively identified him; and the defendant was wearing clothes similar to those worn by the male assailant. Based on these facts, the judge was warranted in concluding that the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Although the judge found the identification procedure unnecessarily suggestive, he found that the identification was admissible because it was reliable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In so doing, the judge relied on Appeals Court decisions which have adopted the \u201creliability test,\u201d set forth in <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98 (1977), regarding the admissibility of identifications <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>obtained through unnecessarily suggestive procedures.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>17 Mass. App. Ct. 574 (1984). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 550, 553-554 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Laaman, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 354, 362, cert. denied, 488 U.S. 834 (1988); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>25 Mass. App. Ct. 55, 60 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Key, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 234 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 230 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Although the Appeals Court has applied the due process analysis set forth in the <em>Brathwaite </em>case, this court has never accepted the reasoning in <em>Brathwaite </em>as an accurate interpretation of the due process requirements of art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Whether we should embrace <em>Brathwaite, </em>as have the majority of other States, is a question we have left open. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melvin, </em>399 Mass. 201, 205 (1987). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Correia, </em>381 Mass. 65, 81 (1980). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Venios, </em>378 Mass. 24, 26-28 (1979). In cases involving an unnecessarily suggestive identification, we have adhered to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>the stricter rule of per se exclusion previously followed by the Supreme Court and first set forth in the <em>Wade-GilbertStovall </em>trilogy<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of cases. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Botelho, </em>369 Mass. 860, 865-869 (1976). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dinkins, </em>415 Mass. 715, 720-721 (1993); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>414 Mass. 437, 442-443 (1992); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thornley, </em>406 Mass. 96, 98-99 (1989); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Melvin, supra </em>at 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The rule of per se exclusion, set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Botelho, supra</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>states that the defendant bears the burden of demonstrating, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the \u201cwitness was subjected by the State to a confrontation that was unnecessarily suggestive and thus offensive to due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 866. If this is established, then the prosecution is barred from introducing that particular confrontation in evidence at trial. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As for other identifications the witness may have made of the defendant, \u201cthe prosecution is limited to introducing at trial only such identifications by the witness as are shown at the suppression hearing not to be the product of the suggestive confrontation \u2014 the later identifications, to be usable, must have an independent source.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The prosecution must demonstrate the existence of an independent source by \u201cclear and convincing evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">\u201cIn deciding whether a particular confrontation was unnecessarily suggestive, the judge is to consider \u2018the totality of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>the circumstances surrounding it\u2019 <em>(Stovall, </em>388 U.S. at 302).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Botelho, supra </em>at 867. Additionally, in determining whether a separate identification has a source independent of the unnecessarily suggestive identification, the judge considers the following factors: \u201c(1) The extent of the witness\u2019 opportunity to observe the defendant at the time of the crime; prior errors, if any, (2) in description, (3) in identifying another person or (4) in failing to identify the defendant; (5) the receipt of other suggestions, and (6) the lapse of time between the crime and the identification.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 869, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>361 Mass. 665, 671 n.2 (1972), judgment vacated on other grounds, 410 U.S. 901, aff'd on remand, 363 Mass. 665, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1080 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">The Commonwealth now urges us to abandon the per se rule of exclusion and, like the Appeals Court, follow the reliability test of <em>Brathwaite. </em>Under the \u201creliability\u201d test, if a defendant demonstrates that an identification was unnecessarily suggestive, evidence of that identification is not per se excluded. <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 199 (1972). Instead, the court must determine whether the identification was, under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances,\u201d nevertheless reliable. <em>Id. </em>at 198-199. In determining whether an identification was reliable, and thus there was no \u201csubstantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification,\u201d the court must examine several factors. <em>Id. </em>at 199, 201. <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, supra </em>at 106. These factors are (1) the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, (2) the witness\u2019s degree of attention, (3) the accuracy of the witness\u2019s prior description of the criminal, (4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation, and (5) the length of time between the crime and the confrontation. <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Biggers, supra </em>at 199-200. <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, supra </em>at 114. \u201cAgainst these factors is to be weighed the corrupting effect of the suggestive identification itself.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">The case at bar presents us with the opportunity to establish our position with regard to the <em>Brathwaite </em>decision. We have carefully considered the matter and, for the reasons set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>forth, we conclude that we cannot accept <em>Brathwaite </em>as satisfying the requirements of art. 12. We conclude that art. 12 requires the application of the stricter per se approach described in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Botelho, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Our past resistance to the so-called reliability test reflects this court\u2019s concern that the dangers present whenever eyewitness evidence is introduced against an accused require the utmost protection against mistaken identifications. There is no question that the danger of mistaken identification by a victim or a witness poses a real threat to the truth-finding process of criminal trials. Indeed, mistaken identification is believed widely to be the primary cause of erroneous convictions. See Gross, Loss of Innocence: Eyewitness Identification and Proof of Guilt, 16 J. Legal Stud. 395, 396 (1987); Note, Twenty-Years of Diminishing Protection: A Proposal to Return to the <em>Wade </em>Trilogy\u2019s Standards, 15 Hofstra L. Rev. 583, 605-606 (1987); Grossman, Suggestive Identifications: The Supreme Court\u2019s Due Process Test Fails to Meet its Own Criteria, 11 U. Balt. L. Rev. 53, 65 (1981). See also <em>Wright </em>v. <em>United States, </em>404 F.2d 1256, 1262 (D.C. Cir. 1968) (Bazelon, J., dissenting) (\u201cSince mistaken identifications are probably the greatest cause of erroneous convictions, we must require the fairest identification procedures available under the circumstances. With the stakes so high, due process does not permit second best\u201d [footnote omitted]). Compounding this problem is the tendency of juries to be unduly receptive to eyewitness evidence. <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, supra </em>at 120 (Marshall, J., dissenting). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Long, </em>721 P.2d 483, 490-491 (Utah 1986); Grossman, <em>supra </em>at 65. We have stated that \u201c[t]he law has not taken the position that a jury can be relied on to discount the value of an identification by a proper appraisal of the unsatisfactory circumstances in which it may have been made. On the contrary, this court, like others, has read the Constitution to require that where the conditions are shown to have been highly and unnecessarily suggestive, the identification should not be brought to the attention of the jury.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marini, </em>375 Mass. 510, 519 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>These concerns were at the heart of the <em>Wade </em>trilogy of cases. The <em>Wade </em>Court acknowledged that \u201cthe vagaries of eyewitness identification are well-known; the annals of criminal law are rife with instances of mistaken identification.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U.S. 218, 228 (1967). In declaring that the accused has a right to counsel at a postindictment lineup, the Court recognized that the presence of counsel was necessary because \u201c[t]he trial which might determine the accused\u2019s fate may well not be that in the courtroom but that at the pretrial confrontation, with the State aligned against the accused, the witness the sole jury, and the accused unprotected against the overreaching, intentional or unintentional, and with little or no effective appeal from the judgment there rendered by the witness \u2014 \u2018that\u2019s the man.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235-236. The \u201creliability test\u201d is unacceptable because it provides little or no protection from unnecessarily suggestive identification procedures, from mistaken identifications and, ultimately, from wrongful convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">The <em>Brathwaite </em>Court examined three primary \u201cinterests\u201d before holding that the per se rule should be abandoned in favor of the less protective \u201creliability\u201d test. The first of these was the concern regarding the dangers presented by eyewitness evidence. <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, supra </em>at 112. The Court acknowledged that a witness\u2019s recollection \u201ccan be distorted easily by the circumstances or by later actions of the police.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While the per se approach addresses this concern, the Court stated, it \u201cgoes too far since its application automatically and peremptorily, and without consideration of alleviating factors, keeps evidence from the jury that is reliable and relevant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">We believe that Justice Marshall, dissenting in <em>Brathwaite, </em>had a more realistic view of the trial process when he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">\u201cthis conclusion totally ignores the lessons of <em>Wade. </em>The dangers of mistaken identification are, as <em>Stovall </em>held, simply too great to permit unnecessarily suggestive identifications. Neither <em>Biggers </em>nor the Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>opinion today points to any contrary empirical evidence. Studies since <em>Wade </em>have only reinforced the validity of its assessment of the dangers of identification testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125 (Marshall, J., dissenting).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Indeed, studies conducted by psychologists and legal researchers since <em>Brathwaite </em>have confirmed that eyewitness testimony is often hopelessly unreliable.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Permitting the admission of an identification obtained through unnecessarily suggestive procedures can only serve to exacerbate this problem. Furthermore, contrary to the <em>Brathwaite </em>Court\u2019s unsubstantiated claim, the per se approach does not keep relevant and reliable identification evidence from the jury. Subsequent identifications shown to come from a source independent of the suggestive identification remain admissible under the per se approach. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Botelho, </em>369 Mass. 860, 866 (1976). See <em>People </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>53 N.Y.2d 241, 251 (1981). The per se approach excludes only the unnecessarily suggestive identification and subsequent tainted identifications. <em>Id. </em>As stated earlier, the court examines five factors in determining whether there was an independent source for subsequent identifications by the witness of the defendant. If, for example, the prosecution is able to demonstrate that the witness got a good look at his assailant and his initial description matches a description of the defendant, the court may conclude that there was an independent source and may admit evidence of any identification subsequent to the unnecessarily suggestive one.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The <em>Brathwaite </em>Court also discussed the public interest in deterring police from using identification procedures which are unnecessarily suggestive. The Court acknowledged that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>the per se rule is superior in promoting that interest because it provides greater deterrence against police misconduct. The Court nevertheless concluded: \u201cThe police will guard against unnecessarily suggestive procedures under the totality rule, as well as the per se one, for fear that their actions will lead to the exclusion of identifications as unreliable.\u201d <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, supra </em>at 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">To the contrary, it appears clear to us that the reliability test does little or nothing to discourage police from using suggestive identification procedures. One commentator has noted that \u201cunder <em>Brathwaite, </em>the showup has flourished, because the totality approach has failed to discourage this practice. As a deterrent to suggestive police practices, the Federal standard is quite weak. Almost any suggestive lineup will still meet reliability standards.\u201d Note, Twenty-Years of Diminishing Protection, 15 Hofstra L. Rev. 583, 606 (1987). Indeed, an example of this result is seen in the instant case: the suggestion inherent in the showup procedure that was used to identify the defendant is plain. Furthermore, the showup was unnecessarily suggestive in that it was not conducted immediately after the crime or in exigent circumstances. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barnett, </em>371 Mass. 87, 92 (1976). Yet the motion judge permitted the introduction of the identification based on his opinion that the identification was reliable. Rather than deterring unreliable identification procedures, the effect of the <em>Biggers-Brathwaite </em>reliability test has been, and would be in this Commonwealth, a message to police that, absent extremely aggravating circumstances, suggestive showups will not result in suppression. Whether or not to use a more fair and accurate identification procedure is, under that test, left to the officer\u2019s discretion. See Grossman, <em>supra </em>at 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Finally, the <em>Brathwaite </em>Court considered the impact of the two tests on the administration of justice. It was here that the Court found what it considered to be the most serious drawbacks of the per se approach. However, it is also here, in our view, that the Court erred most. The Court opined: \u201cSince it denies the trier reliable evidence, [the per se ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>proach] may result, on occasion, in the guilty going free.\u201d <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, supra </em>at 112. The inverse of this is probably more accurate: the admission of unnecessarily suggestive identification procedures under the reliability test would likely result in the innocent being jailed while the guilty remain free. See <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, supra </em>at 127 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (\u201c[I]f the police and the public erroneously conclude, on the basis of an unnecessarily suggestive confrontation, that the right man has been caught and convicted, the real outlaw must still remain at large\u201d). The <em>Braithwaite </em>Court disregards the wisdom of Justice Harlan when he wrote: \u201cit is far worse to convict an innocent man than to let a guilty man go free.\u201d <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 372 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Justice Grimes of the New Hampshire Supreme Court expressed this concern accurately when he wrote: \u201cThe dangers of misidentification are well known and documented. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U.S. 288 (1967); <em>Gilbert </em>v. <em>California, </em>388 U.S. 263 (1967); <em>Stovall </em>v. <em>Demo, </em>388 U.S. 293 (1967). In these cases the court recognized \u2018[a] major factor . . . [in] the high incidence of miscarriage of justice from mistaken identification has been the degree of suggestion inherent in the manner in which the prosecution presents the suspect to witnesses for pretrial identification.\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Wade, </em>388 U.S. at 288. . . . Considering the complexity of the human mind and the subtle effects of suggestive procedures upon it, a determination that an identification was unaffected by such procedures must itself be open to serious question. All things considered, the consequences of misidentification are so great and the risks so high that it is questionable if a totality-of-circumstances test provides either a sufficient deterrence against the unnecessary use of one-man showups or a sufficient protection against misidentifications which may result therefrom.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Leclair, </em>118 N.H. 214, 217-218 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">We note that there are essential policy differences between other aspects of an exclusionary rule and the rule supporting the per se exclusion of suggestive identifications and tainted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>trial identifications. The New York Court of Appeals summed up these differences in <em>People </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>53 N.Y.2d 241, 250-251 (1981), when it stated: \u201cThe rule excluding improper showups and evidence derived therefrom is different in both purpose and effect from the exclusionary rule applicable to confessions and the fruits of searches and seizures. In the latter cases generally reliable evidence of guilt is suppressed because it was obtained illegally. Although this serves to deter future violations, it is collateral and essentially at variance with the truthfinding process (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>McGrath, </em>46 N.Y.2d 12 [1978], cert. denied, 440 U.S. 972 [1979]). But the rule excluding improper pretrial identifications bears directly on guilt or innocence. It is designed to reduce the risk that the wrong person will be convicted as a result of suggestive identification procedures employed by the police.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The Court of Appeals continued: \u201cA reliable determination of guilt or innocence is the essence of a criminal trial. A defendant\u2019s right to due process would be only theoretical if it did not encompass the need to establish rules to accomplish that end. Permitting the prosecutor to introduce evidence of a suggestive pretrial identification can only increase the risks of convicting the innocent in cases where it has the desired effect of contributing to a conviction. In most instances, where the witness is able to make an untainted identification in court, proof of the suggestive showup only serves to bolster the People\u2019s case. However, if the jury finds the in-court identification not entirely convincing it should not be permitted to resolve its doubts by relying on the fact that the witness had identified the defendant on a prior occasion if that identification was made under inherently suggestive circumstances. Similarly, if the witness is unable to identify the defendant at trial the defendant\u2019s conviction should not rest solely upon evidence of a pretrial identification made under circumstances which were likely to produce an unreliable result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Thus, the Court of Appeals concluded: \u201cExcluding evidence of a suggestive showup does not deprive the prosecutor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>of reliable evidence of guilt. The witness would still be permitted to identify the defendant in court if that identification is based on an independent source.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The reliability approach has the further effect of expanding a reviewing court\u2019s powers because it allows the court to examine subjectively the circumstances surrounding the original crime on a case-by-case basis, instead of objectively examining the identification procedures employed by the police. Sherwood, The Erosion of Constitutional Safeguards in the Area of Eyewitness Identification, 30 How. L.J. 439, 457 (1987). See Note, Twenty-Years of Diminishing Protection, 15 Hofstra L.Rev. 583, 592 (1987). \u201cBy relying on the probable accuracy of a challenged identification, instead of the necessity for its use, the Court seems to be ascertaining whether the defendant was probably guilty.\u201d <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, supra </em>at 128 (Marshall, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The reliability test has been widely criticized by commentators,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> primarily because the test eliminates the protection essential to a fair trial. The reliability test hinders, rather than aids, the fair and just administration of justice by permitting largely unreliable evidence to be admitted directly on the issue of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">This case presents an example of why we should not abandon the per se rule of exclusion and replace it with the reliability test. There is absolutely no evidence that the in-court identification of the defendant was the result of anything independent of the unnecessarily suggestive showup. For example, Goncalves\u2019s description of his assailant, given to police just after the incident, did not match the defendant\u2019s appearance, in part because the defendant possessed the unique feature of several missing teeth.

For approximately twenty years this court has left open the question whether to follow the <em>Brathwaite </em>reliability test. See <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Venios, </em>378 Mass. 24, 27 (1979). At long last, the court has reached the question, only to reject the reliability test, in favor of the per se rule of exclusion. Massachusetts, today, becomes one of only two States to adopt this rule.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Virtually every other State which has considered the issue has adopted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>the reliability test.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We should join the overwhelming majority of States, as well as the Supreme Court of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>States, in adopting the reliability test for purposes of determining the admissibility of out-of-court identifications obtained through unnecessarily suggestive procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The court concludes, erroneously in my view, that art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution requires exclusion of out-of-court identification evidence, without regard to reliability, whenever it has been obtained through unnecessarily suggestive confrontation procedures. <em>Ante </em>at 464-465. Nothing in the Massachusetts Constitution purports to protect a criminal defendant from the admission of reliable identification testimony. Due process is not violated merely because the State employs suggestive identification procedures. Due process is only violated when suggestive procedures create a substantial likelihood of misidentification. See <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188, 198 (1972) (\u201cIt is the likelihood of misidentification which violates a defendant\u2019s right to due process\u201d). Thus, even if obtained through unnecessarily suggestive procedures, identification evidence possessing a sufficient indicia of reliability should not be excluded. \u201cUnlike a warrantless search, a suggestive preindictment identification procedure does not in itself intrude upon a constitutionally protected interest. Thus, considerations urging the exclusion of evidence deriving from a constitutional violation do not bear on the instant problem.\u201d Man<em>son </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, supra </em>at 113 n.13.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The court further concludes that \u201cthe \u2018reliability test\u2019 is unacceptable because it provides little or no protection from unnecessarily suggestive identification procedures, from mistaken identifications, and, ultimately, from wrongful convictions.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 466. However, under the reliability test, only those identifications possessing a sufficient indicia of reliability will be admitted. Further, imposing a framework of shifting burdens as the Supreme Court of Maine did in <em>State </em>v. Cefalo, 396 A.2d 233, 238-239 (Me. 1979), will ensure that only those identifications which have a basis independent of the suggestive procedures will be put before the jury. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Cefalo, </em>the Supreme Court of Maine formulated a framework of shifting burdens of proof for the suppression of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>identification testimony. Under that formulation, the defendant must first establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the identification procedure was suggestive. <em>Id. </em>If the defendant meets that burden, then the burden shifts to the State to show by clear and convincing evidence that, in the totality of the circumstances, the reliability of the identification outweighs the suggestiveness of the procedure used. <em>Id. </em>We have in the past expressed approval of this approach, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Venios, supra </em>at 28, and, in my view, it provides adequate protection against the evils associated with the admission of suggestive identification evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">This procedural framework of shifting burdens will also enhance the reliability test\u2019s deterrent effect by placing the burden on the State to prove by clear and convincing evidence that an unnecessarily suggestive identification is sufficiently reliable. As the <em>Cefalo </em>court stated, \u201cif the police ignore the frequent warnings of this court and continue to use defective confrontation procedures, the State will run the risk of being unable to establish independently the reliability of the identification. This [burden shifting] approach assures that reliable and probative identifications will be admissible, while deterring the police from employing unfair procedures that violate norms of governmental fair play and create the risk of misidentification.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Implicit in the court\u2019s opinion is a distrust of the ability of jurors to discount the value of an identification obtained through suggestive procedures. However, jurors are faced with arguably untrustworthy evidence at many junctures during a trial. Just as they are capable of sifting through a myriad of issues, they are capable of determining the proper weight to be accorded an identification. In fact, after hearing all the evidence pertaining to pretrial identifications, including any evidence of possible suggestiveness, jurors may be better equipped to evaluate the accuracy of a witness\u2019s identification. It seems unduly artificial to me to allow jurors to consider in-court identifications without acquainting them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>with the origins of those identifications.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, through effective cross-examination and argument, counsel can alert the jury to any factors which raise doubts as to the accuracy of the witness\u2019s identification.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Finally, it defies logic to exclude a suggestive out-of-court identification without considering its reliability while at the same time allowing an in-court identification which has a source independent of the tainted procedures. The reliability test serves the same purpose as the independent source test, that is, to determine whether the identification is based on something other than the suggestive procedures.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>People </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>53 N.Y.2d 241, 252 (1981) (Cooke, J., concurring) (stating that, under the reliability test, \u201ca suggestive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>out-of-court identification is admissible so long as it is not unreliable \u2014 i.e., if there was an independent source for the out-of-court identification, it is not constitutionally infirm\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">In conclusion, for essentially the reasons stated by the trial judge, I believe that the reliability of the identification outweighed any corruptive effect of the suggestive confrontation. Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-9\">Only New York has adopted the per se exclusionary rule.

I agree with much of what Justice Nolan has said, <em>ante </em>at 472, but find it necessary to add a few separate comments. The fact that art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights does not specifically address the issue is not important. This court has the obligation to construe art. 12, in accordance with accepted principles of constitutional interpretation, to decide due process issues in light of evolving needs and concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">What is important to me is the fact that forty-seven States have adopted the reliability test to govern the admissibility of identification evidence. The weight of this body of outside law should not be lightly disregarded. The highest court of each of these States was aware of its right to fashion a different test under its State Constitution, but, significantly, each chose not to do so, opting instead for the reliability test. Underlying the choice made by the forty-seven States is tacit recognition of at least the following principles:</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">First, a criminal trial is meant to be a search for the truth in which the people (as represented by the prosecution) have the right to present reliable evidence tending to prove a defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">Second, since reliability is the linchpin governing the admission of all evidence, identification evidence which is found reliable by a judge, after a careful pretrial inquiry, should not be withheld from the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">Third, the jury are capable of sorting out issues of suggestiveness and reliability. It is not logical to deprive them of the antecedents of an in-court identification and to allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>speculation on how a victim or identifying witness came to make his or her in-court identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">I conclude that the reliability test sufficiently protects a defendant\u2019s rights under art. 12, and allows the prosecution, in the protection of society\u2019s interests, to present its case on a level playing field.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
