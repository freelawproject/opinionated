L. c. 208, \u00a7 37 (1992 ed.). The parties were divorced on November 5, 1990. The judgment of divorce nisi required the plaintiff to pay the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>ant $500 a week in alimony and $300 a week in child support.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The judgment did not address whether alimony would terminate on the defendant\u2019s remarriage, nor was there any surviving agreement between the parties that addressed this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">On May 17, 1992, the defendant remarried. One month later, the plaintiff filed a complaint for modification seeking to terminate his alimony obligation because the defendant\u2019s remarriage constituted a material change of circumstances. An evidentiary hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s complaint was held in the Probate and Family Court on December 29, 1993. On February 15, 1994, the judge issued a judgment denying the plaintiff relief by dismissing his complaint. The plaintiff filed a timely appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We granted his application for direct appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\"><em>Facts. </em>We recite the relevant facts found by the probate judge, as well as certain additional facts found by the judge who granted the judgment of divorce; these earlier findings were incorporated into the probate judge\u2019s findings of fact. The parties were married for twenty-six years prior to their divorce. During the marriage, the defendant stayed at home to raise their children. The plaintiff was a successful bank executive whose income in 1990, at the time of the divorce, was $158,327.12. In contrast, the defendant, who had com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>pleted only two years of college prior to the marriage, had limited employability and was qualified for only unskilled, entry level positions at minimum wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">After the divorce, the defendant found part-time employment as a medical assistant, with earnings of $90 a week. At the time of the modification hearing, her present spouse earned $28,000 per year, $7,800 of which he paid to a former wife as child support. The defendant\u2019s present spouse had a net take-home pay of $184.43 a week. He contributed $300 a month to the defendant\u2019s income tax expenses. The defendant had expenses of $588.81 per week, excluding income tax expenses on alimony payments received from the plaintiff. At the time of the modification hearing, the plaintiffs income had increased to more than $180,000. The value of his assets had increased substantially. He had weekly expenses of $1,527, including the $500 weekly alimony obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The judge found that the defendant was still in need of support and that the plaintiff was still able to pay support. Further, the judge concluded that the defendant\u2019s remarriage did not amount to a sufficient change in her economic circumstances as would warrant a modification of the divorce judgment. Accordingly, the judge dismissed the plaintiffs complaint for modification. On appeal, the principal issues raised by the plaintiff are whether this court should adopt a rule automatically terminating alimony on the remarriage of the recipient spouse (in the absence of an agreement to the contrary), and whether the probate judge\u2019s finding that the defendant\u2019s remarriage and other factors did not constitute a material change of circumstances is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\"><em>Discussion. </em>General Laws c. 208, \u00a7 37, provides for modification of alimony awards, but does not specifically address whether remarriage requires the termination of alimony payments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although the statute does not make clear provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>for the termination of the obligation to pay alimony on the recipient spouse\u2019s remarriage, this court has held that remarriage is prima facie evidence of a material change of circumstance which would warrant termination. See <em>Southworth </em>v. <em>Treadwell, </em>168 Mass. 511, 513 (1897) (absent proof that support by new spouse was not adequate to all wife\u2019s needs, court could reduce alimony to nominal sum, effectively eliminating it).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We decide today whether, where not otherwise provided in the judgment of divorce or in an agreement between the parties, the obligation to pay alimony should terminate automatically on the recipient spouse\u2019s remarriage.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">Many jurisdictions have legislation addressing the effect of a recipient spouse\u2019s remarriage on his or her right to alimony. The majority of States have statutes providing that alimony payments automatically terminate on the recipient spouse\u2019s remarriage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In those States that do not have stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>utes that specifically address whether alimony payments should terminate on remarriage of the recipient spouse, statutes generally allow for modification of alimony obligations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>when changed circumstances warrant.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> A small number of States have statutes that, like G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 37, merely allow for modification and leave to the courts the determination as to when modification is appropriate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">In States where legislation does not specifically address the issue, the courts have had to determine by judicial decision whether the recipient spouse\u2019s remarriage should terminate the payor spouse\u2019s obligation to pay alimony. The majority of those courts have held that the recipient spouse\u2019s remarriage does not automatically terminate alimony, but that it creates a strong presumption or a prima facie case that alimony will cease in the absence of extraordinary circumstances.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>few States, the courts have adopted an automatic termination rule.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">We believe the preferable rule is that, where not otherwise provided in the judgment of divorce or in an agreement between the parties, a recipient spouse\u2019s remarriage does not of itself automatically terminate alimony. Instead, the recipient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>spouse\u2019s remarriage makes a prima facie case which requires the court to end alimony, absent proof of some extraordinary circumstances, established by the recipient spouse, warranting its continuation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This approach affirms the general principle that alimony should terminate on the recipient spouse\u2019s remarriage, but also allows courts to override this principle on evidence produced showing certain rare and exceptional circumstances. Under this prima facie approach, alimony would survive remarriage only in those rare situations which involve an on-going and legitimate need for continuation of alimony payments.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> For example, if a remarried recipient spouse becomes a public charge, a judge may order the former spouse to continue making alimony payments. See <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>O\u2019Brien, </em>416 Mass. 477, 480 (1993) (court may override separation agreement providing for termination of alimony \u201conly to the extent necessary to prevent a former spouse from becoming a public charge\u201d). Although this may burden the payor spouse, we believe that he or she should not be relieved of the obligation to pay alimony if the result would be to burden the taxpayers of this Commonwealth with support of the remarried recipient spouse.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>In so holding, we recognize that, except in extraordinary circumstances, it is \u201cillogical and unreasonable\u201d that a spouse should receive support from a current spouse and a former spouse at the same time. See <em>Marquardt </em>v. <em>Marquardt, </em>396 N.W.2d 753, 754 (S.D. 1986); <em>Marriage of Shima, </em>360 N.W.2d 827, 828 (Iowa 1985); <em>Bubar </em>v. <em>Plant, </em>141 Me. 407, 410 (1945), quoting <em>Cary </em>v. <em>Cary, </em>112 Conn. 256, 261 (1930). See also <em>Glazer </em>v. <em>Silverman, </em>354 Mass. 177, 180 (1968) (court deemed it inequitable to allow wife to receive support from two former husbands). The new spouse does, after all, assume a duty to support on marriage. See <em>Bushnell </em>v. <em>Bushnell, </em>393 Mass. 462, 467 (1984) (\u201cduty of support arises out of the existence of a valid marriage\u201d). See also <em>French </em>v. <em>McAnarney, </em>290 Mass. 544, 546 (1935). We believe that \u201cthe remarriage should serve as an election between the support provided by the alimony award and the legal obligation of support embodied in the new marital relationship.\u201d Voy<em>les </em>v. <em>Voyles, </em>664 P.2d 847, 849 (Alaska 1982). Absent extraordinary circumstances, the former spouse should not be required to pay alimony when another person has assumed the support obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">We generally defer to the probate judge\u2019s sound discretion in determining whether modification of an alimony judgment is appropriate. <em>Bush </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>402 Mass. 406, 411 (1988). In this case, the judge found that the defendant\u2019s remarriage was not \u201ca sufficient change in her economic circumstances to warrant a modification of the divorce judgment.\u201d How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>ever, it is not apparent from the record that the defendant satisfied her burden of showing that extraordinary circumstances warranted requiring her former husband to continue paying alimony. The mere fact that, without alimony, the defendant would not able to live with her second husband in the way in which she lived prior to her marriage to him is not a valid reason to continue alimony. Because we hold that a recipient spouse\u2019s remarriage makes a prima facie case which requires the court to terminate alimony unless some extraordinary circumstances are shown to warrant its continuation, we vacate the judgment of dismissal, discharge the report, and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-7\">At the time of the decree, a minor child of the parties resided with the defendant. On November 2, 1992, the plaintiff filed a complaint for modification seeking relief from his obligation to pay child support because the child had resided with the plaintiff since November 1, 1992. On December 17, 1992, a judge in the Probate and Family Court heard and allowed a motion for temporary orders granting the plaintiff temporary custody of the minor child and eliminating the child support obligation. This order is not a subject of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b839-8\">The probate judge also reserved and reported \u201cthe issue of whether Massachusetts law permits remarriage by an alimony recipient to be merely one factor that is considered in determining whether there has been a sufficient change in circumstances to economically justify a change in alimony and whether remarriage should give rise to any presumption.\u201d The Appeals Court consolidated this matter with the plaintiff\u2019s direct appeal. We need consider the matter solely on the basis of the appeal; we discharge the report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b840-7\">General Laws c. 208, \u00a7 37 (1992 ed.), provides in relevant part: \u201cAfter a judgment for alimony or an annual allowance for the spouse or children, the court may, from time to time, upon the action for modification of either party, revise and alter its judgment relative to the amount of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>alimony or annual allowance and the payment thereof, and may make any judgment relative thereto which it might have made in the original action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">We have held that, in order to obtain modification of a judgment for alimony, a petitioner must demonstrate a material change of circumstances since entry of the earlier judgment.

Contra <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Peters, </em>214 N.W.2d 151, 158 (Iowa 1974) (where remarriage of former wife was not consummated and was annulled, it did not constitute a \u201cremarriage\u201d within decree provision terminating alimony on wife\u2019s remarriage). See also <em>Robbins </em>v. <em>Robbins, </em>343 Mass. 247, 252 (1961) (payor spouse did not establish that recipient spouse\u2019s annulled remarriage resulted in change of circumstances that would justify modification of alimony obligation).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
