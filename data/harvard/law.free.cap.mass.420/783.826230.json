Represented by new counsel on appeal, he argues that the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a new trial, which was based on the allegation that the prosecution had failed to disclose exculpatory information contained in certain police reports and had also failed to disclose promises, rewards, and inducements offered to two Commonwealth witnesses. We reject these arguments. The defendant also argues that a new trial is required because of alleged errors with respect to the jury instructions on joint venture, reasonable doubt, and inferences, and in the admission of corroborative identification testimony of police officers. The defendant maintains as well that his trial counsel furnished him with ineffective assistance of counsel. We discern no basis for a new trial in any of these arguments. Finally, we conclude that there is no basis to exercise the authority granted to us under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E (1992 ed.). Accordingly, we affirm the order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial and the judgments of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>Based on the evidence in the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the jury could have found the following. On the night of September 2, 1986, the defendant, who was from Hartford, Connecticut, together with three or four other Hartford men, came to Springfield and went to the area of the After Five Lounge. Outside the lounge, shortly before 11:25 P.M., the group of Hartford men approached Charles Stokes and sought to purchase cocaine. Charles and his brother, David Stokes, who were standing with several other men, showed the Hartford men some cocaine. The mood became confrontational. As the cocaine was being passed around, Charles objected and asked them to \u201cgive me [back] my shit . . . .\u201d Someone in the Hartford group pulled a gold chain off David Stokes\u2019s neck, and he began to run toward the After Five Lounge. Charles grabbed for his cocaine and, hearing a gun shot, began running toward the side door of the lounge. He was hampered by his untied shoelaces, and fell several times. While he was trying to escape, Charles heard more shots. As he was running past the victim, Victoria Seymour, he heard her exclaim, \u201cI\u2019ve been shot.\u201d He again fell in the street. Before he could get up, a man stood over him with a handgun and told him, \u201cKick the shit in.\u201d Charles turned over the cocaine he was holding and all the money on his person. The robber, and others involved in the melee, fled on foot. The victim died from her gunshot wound early the next day. Anthony Cook was also shot during the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">At trial, Charles identified the defendant as one member of the Hartford group who had asked about the purchase of cocaine and as the man who had robbed him at gunpoint. In addition to Charles, five other eyewitnesses identified the defendant as the gunman who had robbed Charles. One of these identified the defendant as the man who had shot the victim, although the basis for this identification was not clear. Two Springfield area youths also identified the defendant as a member of a group of persons they had seen earlier at a Pizza King restaurant which was near the lounge. One <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>of the youths saw members of the group leave the restaurant in a van with a Connecticut registration plate.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">The defendant was arrested in Hartford about eight weeks after the incident. He told Springfield police after his arrest that he had not been in Springfield on September 2, 1986, and that he had gone to Springfield only once in his lifetime. To counter these assertions, and to show consciousness of guilt, the prosecution presented testimony that the defendant had been seen in Springfield frequently at various events and places in the months immediately preceding the homicide. The defendant did not testify at the trial. He presented evidence, however, from a dentist who testified that he had performed a root-canal type procedure on one of the defendant\u2019s back teeth late in the morning of September 2, 1986, and from the mother of the defendant\u2019s child and several of her relatives and acquaintances, who testified that the defendant had been in their presence in Hartford during the day and night of September 2, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">1. <em>Motion for a New Trial.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">The defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial raised two principal points. First, he argued that, despite the defendant\u2019s general request for exculpatory evidence and for evidence concerning out-of-court identification procedures, police department reports pertaining to the issue of identification had not been disclosed. In one instance, it was argued, a report had been tampered with to conceal the existence of a second page containing exculpatory evidence. Second, he contended that the prosecution had failed to reveal other exculpatory evidence in the form of promises, rewards, and inducements offered to two identification witnesses, Charles Stokes and Michael Bernard, in connection with criminal charges pending against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-8\">The trial judge conducted a lengthy and thorough evidentiary hearing on the motion for a new trial. Testimony was taken from seventeen witnesses, including the prosecutor, the defendant\u2019s trial counsel, counsel for Charles Stokes and Michael Bernard, (both men had the same lawyer for their respective criminal proceedings), and police officers. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>judge also conducted a careful review of the record, including the transcript of a hearing on the motion to suppress out-of-court identification evidence, and he was aided in his analysis of the merits of the motion for a new trial by his familiarity with the history of the case and his personal observation of the evidence as it had unfolded at the trial. The judge made thorough and extensive findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The judge\u2019s findings of fact are to be accepted if supported by the evidence, and he is the final arbiter of matters of credibility. His disposition of the motion is governed by the following general standards stated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>408 Mass. 117, 125 (1990): \u201cA motion for new trial is addressed to the sound discretion of the judge, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>381 Mass. 141, 142 (1980), and the judge\u2019s disposition of the motion will not be reversed unless it is manifestly unjust, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Little, </em>384 Mass. 262, 269 (1981), [rev\u2019d on other grounds, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santos, </em>402 Mass. 775, 788 (1988)]; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leavitt, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 84, 86 (1985), or unless the trial was infected with prejudicial constitutional error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>383 Mass. 253, 257 (1981). Reversal for abuse of discretion is particularly rare where the judge acting on the motion was also the trial judge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Leavitt, supra </em>at 85. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gordon, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 1085 (1982).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">a. <em>Disclosure of police reports. </em>The defendant argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the prosecution failed, despite a specific request, to turn over exculpatory information in the form of police reports related to out-of-court identification procedures. To prevail on this point, the defendant must establish that the evidence existed, that it tended to exculpate him, and that the prosecution failed to deliver the information. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adrey, </em>376 Mass. 747, 753 (1978), and cases cited. The defendant also must establish that the nondisclosed evidence was \u201cmaterial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When, as here, specifically requested evidence is at issue, it will be considered material if the defendant \u201cdemonstrate [s] that a substantial basis exists for claiming prejudice from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>nondisclosure.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass. 401, 412 (1992).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Under the standards expressed above, the trial judge properly decided that no basis had been shown to require a new trial. As the Commonwealth concedes, this case does not serve as \u201ca model of discovery procedure.\u201d The prosecutor did not keep a specific record of what had been produced in response to motions by the defendant\u2019s trial counsel, nor did that counsel keep a record of what he had received. Although the defendant\u2019s trial counsel testified that he had not received certain material, the judge noted that counsel was relying on his memory of a file that had been out of his possession for more than four years. While it was difficult to conclude with certainty, five years after the trial, what reports had been turned over to the defendant\u2019s trial counsel, the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence of out-of-court identifications (held during three days in July, 1987, about four months prior to trial) had provided to the defendant a thorough account of the police investigation. On the basis of the transcript of this hearing, the testimony at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>the hearing on the motion for a new trial, and the testimony at the trial, the judge found that most of the reports either contained no material exculpatory information,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> had been disclosed to the defendant\u2019s trial counsel,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or that counsel was aware of the contents of the reports or the information therein. There can be no prejudice when the contents of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>police report are known to the defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Vieira, </em>401 Mass. 828, 838 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">The record demonstrates that nothing in a sixth report was exculpatory.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The seventh report had not been disclosed to trial counsel, but its substance was generally known, and the one fact which was unknown and which could arguably be considered exculpatory, is not sufficient to grant a new trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Finally, the judge rejected the defendant\u2019s allegation that the prosecution and police had conspired to withhold information from the defendant\u2019s trial counsel by altering a police report, concluding that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel knew the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>tents of the report and of its existence.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As has been set out in the margin, there was ample evidence to support the judge\u2019s findings.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">b. <em>Promises, rewards, and inducements. </em>The defendant claims that the prosecutor had informal understandings with Charles Stokes and Michael Bernard regarding the disposition of criminal charges pending against them at the time of trial which should have been disclosed to him but were not.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>405 U.S. 150 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>At the time of trial, Charles Stokes was facing charges of armed robbery and assault by means of a dangerous weapon. After the trial, Charles entered guilty pleas on the charges and was sentenced, in accordance with the prosecutor\u2019s recommendation, to a suspended (for five years) sentence of from eighteen to twenty years at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution, at Cedar Junction. (Charles violated his probation approximately one month after this sentence was imposed, and he is now serving the sentence.) At the time of trial, Michael Bernard was facing charges of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon, shoplifting, and a variety of narcotics offenses. The charges were subsequently disposed of by changes of pleas and a sentence of probation of three years.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">A defendant- has a constitutional right to cross-examine \u201cto inquire whether [any key] witness expects more favorable treatment from the government in return for his testimony.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Michel, </em>367 Mass. 454, 459 (1975), <em>S.C., </em>381 Mass. 447, (1980). An \u201cinducement\u201d consists of any statement which \u201creasonably implies that the government ... is likely to confer or withhold future advantages . . . depending on [the] witnesses] cooperation.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Buendo, </em>701 F. Supp. 937, 942 (D. Mass. 1988), aff'd sub nom. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Penta, </em>923 F.2d 839 (1st Cir. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">There was sufficient evidence to support the judge\u2019s finding that the defendant had failed to prove that any promises, rewards, or inducements had been offered to Charles Stokes before his trial. While both Charles and his counsel had sought a promise of leniency from the prosecutor on Charles\u2019s pending charges, the prosecutor indicated only that he would be \u201cfair\u201d with Charles. Charles\u2019s counsel also testified at the hearing on the motion for a new trial that no promises had been made to his client before this trial even though both counsel and Charles had, according to the judge, \u201chounded\u201d the prosecutor to obtain \u201ca deal for Charles Stokes.\u201d A commitment to be \u201cfair\u201d is not a promise of favorable treatment. A prosecutor has a general obligation to be fair in dealings with every witness and defendant. An oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>erwise arm\u2019s-length relationship in the negotiation of a plea bargain cannot be construed to involve secret inducements simply because the plea bargain is reached under a commitment of fair treatment. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>White, </em>861 F.2d 994, 997 (6th Cir. 1988) (\u201cwhere the government\u2019s conversations with a plea bargainer do not amount to a promise of treatment beyond that extended to any other person, no promise cognizable under <em>Brady </em>[v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83 (1963)] has been made . . . and thus there is no duty to disclose such discussions to the defense\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">There was also adequate support for the judge\u2019s finding that the defendant had failed to prove that the prosecutor had offered any inducements to Michael Bernard in exchange for his trial testimony. Bernard\u2019s counsel at the time (who was also Charles\u2019s counsel) could not recall with any certainty whether he and the prosecutor had agreed to Bernard\u2019s probationary sentence before the defendant\u2019s trial. The prosecutor testified that he had not made Bernard any promises about the disposition of the charges prior to Bernard\u2019s testimony at the defendant\u2019s trial. The record thus left the defendant\u2019s claim of undisclosed governmental influence over Bernard totally to surmise.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">2. <em>Jury Instructions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">a. <em>Joint venture. </em>We reject the defendant\u2019s contentions that there was insufficient evidence to warrant jury instructions on joint venture to commit armed robbery and that the instructions given were erroneous. \u201cThe test [for participation in a joint venture] is whether [the] defendant was (1) present at the scene of the crime, (2) with knowledge that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>another intends to commit the crime or with intent to commit a crime, and (3) by agreement is willing and available to help the other if necessary.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>388 Mass. 358, 366, <em>S.C., </em>390 Mass. 254 (1983). The defendant was with a group of persons from Hartford. It could be inferred from the conduct of the members of this group, and particularly from the refusal to return to Charles Stokes the package of cocaine, that the group intended to rob the Springfield men. The jury could find that the defendant\u2019s pursuit of Charles was for the purpose of completing the robbery commenced when the Hartford group refused to return the narcotics to Charles Stokes. The judge\u2019s instructions (which were not objected to by defendant\u2019s trial counsel) were correct in every respect on armed robbery, felony-murder based on armed robbery, and joint venture, including, with respect to the latter issue, instructions on the need for active participation by the defendant in the venture and the need for him to share with others the specific intent to commit armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">b. <em>Reasonable doubt. </em>The instructions on reasonable doubt were not objected to at trial. The language now complained of<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (drawn apparently from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seay, </em>376 Mass. 735, 745-746 n.7 [1978]), could not reasonably have misled the jury as to the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof. Following this statement, the judge charged the jury in language which substantially tracked <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 295, 320 (1850), and made the jury aware that each element of each crime had to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt in language which properly conveyed the meaning of that concept. Further, viewing the instructions as a whole, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gagliardi, </em>418 Mass. 562, 572 (1994), cert. denied, 115 S. Ct. 753 (1995), the use of the words \u201cmoral certainty\u201d did not vitiate the charge, particularly in view of instructions that the Commonwealth\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>burden required a \u201cdegree of certainty . . . [that] leaves in your mind a clear and settled conviction of guilt,\u201d and that the jury\u2019s harboring of \u201cany reasonable doubt\u201d as to any element of a crime required an acquittal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> See <em>id. </em>at 568 n.3, 571-572 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">c. <em>Inferences. </em>The criticized portion of the instruction on inferences<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (also not objected to) could not have led the jury to engage in unwarranted speculation. This statement was part of a lengthy explanation of circumstantial evidence and inferences which, considered as a whole, correctly stated the relevant principles and essentially cautioned the jury to be sure of the strength and logic of any inferences they drew.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">3. <em>Corroborative Identification Testimony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">The defendant claims error in testimony of two Springfield detectives concerning out-of-court identifications made from photographic arrays by seven prosecution witnesses. Each of the witnesses identified the defendant in court and expressly testified that he had made a pretrial identification of a photograph of the defendant. The detectives corroborated the extra judicial identifications by verifying the photograph selected by each witness and testifying about the statements made by the witness when selecting the defendant\u2019s photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">The evidence was properly admitted. Each of the witnesses acknowledged in his testimony that he had made an out-of-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>court identification of the defendant. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Daye, </em>393 Mass. 55, 60-61 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seminara, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 789, 796 (1985). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Warren, </em>403 Mass. 137, 141 (1988) (defendant\u2019s due process rights not violated as long as identifying witness is present in court, is available to be cross-examined, and acknowledges the extra judicial identification).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The defendant is also not aided by his argument that the identification testimony of the detectives was prejudicial because they recounted out-of-court statements by some of the identifying witnesses in words which went beyond the scope of the witnesses\u2019 trial testimony. The detectives\u2019 testimony as to what the witnesses Michael Bernard and David Stokes said at their pretrial identifications did not go significantly beyond the trial testimony of these witnesses. The apparently mistaken remark made by Detective Scammons about the pretrial identification made by the witness William Darko (not objected to at trial) could not have caused any harm.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The focus at trial was identification of the defendant as the assailant of Charles Stokes. All the eyewitnesses, including Darko, identified the defendant as the person standing over Charles Stokes with' a handgun. One of the witnesses (Anthony Cooke) identified the defendant as the person who shot the victim. The jury had the full picture from the identifying witnesses themselves as to what was seen, and the case was put to the jury on the basis that they could find that the defendant fired the shot that killed Victoria Seymour, but even if they did not, they should nonetheless consider whether he was guilty as a joint participant in an armed robbery that resulted in her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">4. <em>Ineffective Assistance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">The defendant argues that the behavior of the police and prosecution concerning the alleged withholding of exculpatory evidence constituted an external governmental influence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>which prevented his trial counsel from furnishing him with effective representation within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The argument lacks merit. As has been discussed, the judge properly concluded that the alleged misconduct had not occurred or that any particular nondisclosure that had occurred had not been shown by the defendant to be prejudicial.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The defendant\u2019s trial counsel was also not ineffective for arguing in his opening statement that the evidence would prove the defendant\u2019s innocence. Counsel took the affirmative step in his opening of fully disclosing the defense theory of the case which was based on alibi and misidentification. The approach represented a reasonable tactical choice designed to stress to the jury at an early stage of the trial the importance of the anticipated evidence on alibi and misidentification and to leave for the defense closing the fact that the Commonwealth had the ultimate burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt on all the issues including the issue of identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">5. <em>Review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">There is no basis for the grant of relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. No prosecutorial or police misconduct has been proved. There was considerable identification testimony establishing the defendant\u2019s guilt, and the issues of misidentification and alibi were for the jury to resolve. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Auguste, </em>418 Mass. 643, 648 (1994). The evidence of joint venture was also more than sufficient to warrant the defendant\u2019s convictions. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hooks, </em>375 Mass. 284, 298-299 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>The order denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial is affirmed. The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-6\">We reject the defendant\u2019s contention (made for the first time on appeal) that art. 12 of the Declaration of Rights to the Massachusetts Constitution should be interpreted to impose on the Commonwealth the burden of persuasion on the issue of prejudice where exculpatory evidence has not been disclosed. In support of this contention, the defendant relies on a recent decision of the Supreme Court of New Hampshire, <em>State </em>v. <em>Laurie, </em>139 N.H. 325 (1995), interpreting a provision of the New Hampshire Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, </em>412 Mass. 401, 409 (1992), we noted that we have, as matter of State common law, respected the discretion of a judge, who was also the trial judge, \u201cto award a new trial, even if a new trial is not constitutionally required.\u201d Also as matter of common law, we have declined to follow the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667 (1985), see <em>Tucceri, supra </em>at 408; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallarelli, </em>399 Mass. 17, 21 n.5 (1987), which had the effect of increasing the burden of proof on the defendant who has specifically requested the production of exculpatory evidence. Nonetheless, we have continued to place with the defendant \u201cthe burden of showing prejudice warranting or requiring a new trial order.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tucceri, supra </em>at 404 n.2. We decline to alter the standards governing a defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial based on the prosecution\u2019s failure to produce exculpatory evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b807-5\">One report (the Scammons-Assad report of September 17, 1986) was found to contain no exculpatory material. The officers reported they had gone to Hartford to pick up photographs for an array; the defendant\u2019s photograph was not among them. Detective Scammons testified to the trip at the motion to suppress hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Three brief reports forwarded to Springfield police by the Hartford police department also were found to have no material exculpatory value. There is no copy of these documents in the defendant\u2019s appendix. They apparently implicated one Randy Weaver in the incident at the After Five Lounge. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel knew that Weaver was a suspect who had been placed at the scene, and that he was known to be an associate of the defendant. His photograph had been shown to eyewitnesses of the incident, none of whom had identified him as the gunman standing over Charles Stokes. The defendant would not have been exculpated by information tending, at best, only to identify another member of the group from Hartford. \u25a0</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b807-7\">The judge found that the defendant\u2019s trial counsel had received a copy of the relevant portions of Detective Scammons\u2019s personal notebook. During the hearing on the motion to suppress, the judge presiding over the motion proceeding ordered the prosecutor to copy various pages of Scammons\u2019s notebook. Five to ten pages were copied. During the motion to suppress, defendant\u2019s trial counsel questioned Scammons on the basis of the notebook. The judge\u2019s finding that the notebook had been turned over was supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">The judge also found that the September 3, 1986, Cheetham-Dean report of the officers\u2019 interview with Anthony Cooke on the night of the murder was turned over to the defendant\u2019s trial counsel. The report was in the prosecutor\u2019s notebook. Copies of police reports in this notebook were turned over to the defense. Cooke testified at the motion to suppress that he had spoken with police officers at the hospital on September 3. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel indicated that he consistently asked for police reports he did not have, but he made no request for a report of this conversation. The judge properly could infer from defense counsel\u2019s failure to inquire about a report that he already possessed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">Finally, the trial judge found that the McNulty-Fleury report of September 18, 1986, was furnished to the defendant. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel testified at the hearing on the motion for a new trial that he recalled the contents of the report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b808-5\">This is the September 18, 1986, Reid-Scammons report. The trial judge made no finding as to this report, which describes the showing of an array of the photographs the officers had picked up in Hartford to two young men, who, shortly before the shooting, had seen a group of young black men from Connecticut in a restaurant close to the scene of the shooting. There would have been ample basis for finding that the report was turned over to the defendant. Officer Reid testified at the hearing on the motion to suppress that he prepared daily activity reports summarizing each of the interviews he conducted in connection with the investigation. These had not been turned over by the police to the prosecution. At the close of the hearing, the officer was instructed to review the police file and produce daily activity reports related to the case. There is no reason to believe that defense counsel failed to obtain the material promised to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Even if the content of the report was not disclosed, a new trial would not be warranted. The defendant\u2019s photograph was not among those shown to the witnesses on September 18. Neither boy witnessed the shooting; it was not thought they could identify Charles Stokes\u2019s assailant. Neither boy identified anyone with certainty; each selected certain photographs as similar in appearance to a member of the group at the restaurant on September 2, 1986. This would not preclude the defendant\u2019s having been a member of the group.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b808-7\">This is the September 23, 1986, McNulty-Fleury report. The defendant was aware that the witness mentioned in this report had selected photographs of individuals who looked like those he had seen at the After Five Lounge, including the defendant and others. The defendant was not aware, however, that the witness had no recollection of seeing anyone with \u201ccorn-rolls\u201d (i.e., cornrows, a distinctive braided hairstyle). The defendant\u2019s hair was braided in cornrows. At trial, this witness was by far the weakest of the Commonwealth\u2019s identification witnesses, and the defendant\u2019s trial counsel effectively impeached his testimony. The defendant would not have been significantly aided by a modest addition to the fund of impeachment information.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The allegation concerned the September 24, 1986, Scammons-Reid report. In 1991, a copy of this report, with white tape over notations indicating the existence of a second page, was discovered in the Springfield police file. The prosecutor\u2019s trial file contained a copy of the unaltered, two-page report. It was suggested that the prosecutor had deliberately concealed from the defendant\u2019s trial counsel the existence of the report\u2019s second page, which summarized a police interview with Charles Stokes. As the trial judge noted, Stokes was questioned by the prosecutor about this interview before the grand jury and at the hearing on the motion to suppress. At trial, Detective Scammons was questioned by the prosecution about the interview. Scammons testified he had \u201cmade a note\u201d on the meeting. There was no deliberate attempt to suppress information about this meeting. If the defendant\u2019s trial counsel lacked a copy of the second page of the report (which seems unlikely, since he testified that he asked for copies of any written reports that had not been provided to him), he was aware of its contents. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel used Stokes\u2019s failure to identify the defendant prior to March, 1987, for impeachment purposes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b809-11\">We are unable to discern the factual basis for the argument that the prosecutor deliberately attempted to conceal information that one of the members of the group from Hartford may have had bad or decaying teeth. During the trial, <em>counsel for the defendant </em>introduced a copy of a police report with a handwritten notation \u201cone with bad/decaying teeth.\u201d Police officers involved in the investigation were unable to recall the source or relevance of the notation, but it was open to the defendant\u2019s trial counsel, who had this report prior to trial, to investigate whether the comment related to the report on which it appeared. Viewed in context, it was far from clear that two brief references to \u201cbad teeth\u201d were intended to describe a feature of the defendant. Even if the references were so intended, they could be viewed as accurate. The defendant had a gold front tooth. The defendant\u2019s trial counsel apparently made the reasonable decision to pursue other means of impeaching the witnesses\u2019 identifications of the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b809-12\">Although the defendant argues that promises, rewards, or inducements were made by the prosecution to \u201cthe Stokes brothers,\u201d he appears to have abandoned any claim on the issue with respect to David Stokes. The judge found that there were no undisclosed promises to David.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b811-8\">The defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>386 Mass. 1 (1982), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. 28 (1985), as paralleling this case, is misplaced. In the <em>Collins </em>case, the prosecutor made an express promise to a cooperating witness to reduce a pending first degree murder charge to a charge of murder in the second degree. See <em>id. </em>at 6. In the <em>Johnson </em>case, the prosecutor, at a minimum, made a promise to bring the witness\u2019s cooperation to the attention of the court sentencing him on a pending District Court complaint. See <em>id. </em>at 36 &amp; n.15. In this case, by contrast, there was no promise to do anything for Charles Stokes, not even to bring his cooperation to the attention of the sentencing judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b812-6\">\u201cWhat is proof beyond a reasonable doubt? Well, it\u2019s not proof beyond all doubt nor proof beyond a whimsical, fanciful doubt, nor proof beyond a probability of innocence because there is rarely a case so clear that it could be proved beyond the possibility of innocence.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b813-8\">The further language in the instructions that \u201c[t]he defendant is entitled to a verdict of not guilty unless the evidence produced by the Commonwealth is sufficient to warrant a finding of guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d is entirely proper. The defendant\u2019s claim that the use of the word \u201csufficient\u201d misdefined the burden of proof is baseless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b813-9\">\u201c[Y]ou may draw .reasonable inferences in connection with the evidence that you believe in this case, but you should not pile inference upon inference until the pile gets so high that it tips over logically or that the chain gets so weak that it doesn\u2019t hold together any more.
