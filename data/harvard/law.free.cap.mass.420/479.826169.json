J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkcB\">On November 21, 1991, a jury convicted the defendant of deliberately premeditated murder in the first degree. The trial judge sentenced the defendant to life imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant asserts that the conviction must be reversed because of several alleged errors in the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury. He also requests that we exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E (1992 ed.), to reduce the verdict from murder in the first degree to manslaughter. We affirm the conviction. We see no reason to utilize our extraordinary power to reduce the conviction to that of manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">The jury heard evidence which would have warranted finding the following facts. During the evening of December 14, 1990, the defendant and his sister went to visit an individual who resided in a second-floor apartment over the Harborview Cafe, a bar located at 82 Potomska Street in New Bedford. Shortly after midnight, the defendant\u2019s sister and another woman went downstairs to purchase beer at the bar. When the sister returned, she told the defendant that the victim, Jose Fernandes, had bothered her while she was in the bar. The defendant then entered the bar and confronted the victim. The two men stepped outside and began to argue about improper remarks the victim allegedly had made to the defendant\u2019s sister. After the defendant pushed him, Fernandes pulled a knife from his rear pocket, placed it on the ground, and challenged the defendant to fight \u201cman to man.\u201d The defendant indicated that he did not want to fight. Fernandes, the defendant, and his sister then returned to the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Shortly thereafter, Fernandes displayed the knife again and started to threaten the defendant\u2019s sister. The bartender yelled at Fernandes to stop, and Fernandes put away the knife. The defendant then pulled out a gun and fired three shots at Fernandes. The first shot, fired from a range of six to eighteen inches, hit the victim in the face. The other two shots entered the victim\u2019s back.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> When the defendant realized that the bartender had telephoned the police, he ran out of the bar. He and his sister telephoned a taxi and returned home, where the defendant ate dinner and went to sleep.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Later that morning, an officer with the New Bedford police department arrested the defendant and transported him to the police station. On route to the station, the defendant asked the officer whether the victim had died. When the officer did not respond, the defendant asked whether the victim had \u201cdied right away, or did he talk to you cops.\u201d The officer advised the defendant of his Miranda rights and told him that if he wished to speak with the officer, he could do so at the police station. The defendant then stated that he wished to speak with the officer about the incident, and the victim \u201chad no respect and deserved what he got.\u201d At the station, the officer booked the defendant and again advised him of his Miranda rights. The defendant then gave a statement. He claimed that the victim had a knife when the two men had been standing outside the bar. Once inside the bar, the defendant heard Fernandes threaten his sister. The sister shoved the victim, and the victim responded by pushing her in the face with his hand. At this point, the defendant walked over to Fernandes and shot him in the face. When Fernandes tried to run away, the defendant pursued him and shot him twice in the back. The defendant agreed to repeat this statement and have it videotaped. The videotape was admitted in evidence and viewed by the jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>The defense offered no evidence, conceding the homicide and defending solely on a theory of manslaughter, rather than murder in the first degree by deliberate premeditation, as the prosecution claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">I. <em>Jury instructions. </em>At the close of the evidence, defense counsel submitted a written request for jury instructions. During a charge conference, the judge, defense counsel, and the prosecutor discussed extensively the defendant\u2019s requested instructions, including instructions about malice, intent, mitigating circumstances, self-defense, and defense of another. At one point during the conference, the judge told defense counsel, \u201cI\u2019m not going to give the rest of that [requested instruction] under intention. So, you can note your exception to it.\u201d Before he finished instructing the jury, the judge asked the prosecutor and defense counsel if either party had any suggestions. Defense counsel asked the judge to give the jury two additional instructions that the defendant\u2019s conduct after the killing was not relevant to either premeditation or malice aforethought. The judge did so. Defense counsel made no other objection to the jury instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">On appeal, the defendant advances four claims of error relating to the jury instructions. The defendant first asserts that the judge erred in refusing to give the defendant\u2019s requested malice instruction, which defined malice by linking it to the mitigating circumstances raised by the evidence. The defendant next objects to the malice instruction actually given by the judge. The defendant\u2019s third and fourth claims involve the judge\u2019s instructions about reasonable provocation and excessive force in self-defense or defense of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">We first consider whether the defendant adequately preserved his rights for appellate review. \u201cIt is a fundamental rule of practice that where a party alleges error in a charge he must bring the alleged error to the attention of the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>in specific terms in order to give the judge an opportunity to rectify the error, if any.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keevan, </em>400 Mass. 557, 564 (1987), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McDuffee, </em>379 Mass. 353, 357 (1979). Rule 24 (b) of the Massachusetts Rules of Criminal Procedure, 378 Mass. 895 (1979), provides that \u201c[n]o party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, specifying the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection.\u201d In the absence of a proper objection, we review a challenged instruction to determine whether it created a \u201csubstantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagles, </em>419 Mass. 825, 834 (1995). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>417 Mass. 592, 595 (1994). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>414 Mass. 252, 265 (1993). See G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The defendant did not object specifically to the challenged instructions. He asserts nevertheless that the judge\u2019s declaration that defense counsel could note his exception to the judge\u2019s refusal to give the requested instruction on intention preserved for \u201cnormal appellate review\u201d the defendant\u2019s claim that the judge erred in refusing to give the requested instruction on malice.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In making this argument, the defendant relies on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grenier, </em>415 Mass. 680 (1993). In that case, we concluded that a defendant had saved his appellate rights where he submitted a written instruction about a specific issue and the judge denied the written request during a charge conference and stated that the defendant\u2019s exception was saved. <em>Id. </em>at 686 n.8. We noted that the defendant was not obliged to repeat his objection after the charge in order to preserve the issue for appeal. <em>Id. </em>In this case, as in the <em>Grenier </em>case, the judge denied the defendant\u2019s written instruction concerning a specific issue \u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>intention \u2014 and noted the defendant\u2019s exception to that denial. The defendant therefore preserved for appeal his objection to the judge\u2019s refusal to give the requested instruction about intention. However, the defendant did not save his appellate rights as to the judge\u2019s denial of the requested malice instruction or any of the three other claims of error. Thus, we evaluate each of the defendant\u2019s claims to determine whether the challenged instructions created a \u201csubstantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AF22\">a. <em>The trial judge\u2019s refusal to give requested malice instruction. </em>Defense counsel submitted a written request for jury instructions that defined malice by linking it to the absence of mitigating factors. The judge did not give the requested instruction. On appeal, the defendant asserts that the judge\u2019s failure to give the requested malice instruction amounted to prejudicial error and violated the defendant\u2019s right to constitutional due process. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">We do not require that any specific words be spoken in a jury instruction. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, supra </em>at 267. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chasson, </em>383 Mass. 183, 188 (1981). Judges need not deliver their instructions in any particular form of words, so long as all necessary instructions are given in adequate words. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinnott, </em>399 Mass. 863, 878 (1987), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Martorano, </em>355 Mass. 790 (1969). Although the judge may not have used the particular words requested by the defendant, he adequately explained the concept of malice aforethought.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, a review of the entire charge, including the portions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>concerning voluntary manslaughter and self-defense, clearly demonstrates that the charge conveyed that the Commonwealth had the burden of proving malice aforethought and the absence of any mitigating circumstances. The judge\u2019s charge contained the substance of what the defendant had requested, even though the judge did not use the defendant\u2019s exact wording. The judge properly acted within his discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s requested instruction and in choosing to explain mitigating circumstances later in the charge, rather than as part of his malice instruction. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>406 Mass. 581, 591 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freiberg, </em>405 Mass. 282, 303, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 940 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>b. <em>Instruction on malice. </em>The defendant next contends that the malice instruction actually given by the judge was erroneous because the instruction effectively told the jury that the frame of mind in which the defendant claimed to have acted constituted malice and because it suggested to the jury alternative ways to find malice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In support of this assertion, the defendant points to two sentences of the instruction. The judge began the instructions on malice by stating that \u201c[m]alice aforethought refers to a frame of mind which includes not only anger, hatred, and revenge, but also every other unlawful or unjustifiable motive.\u201d Several sentences later, the judge added: \u201cMalice aforethought also includes an unexcused specific intent to kill, or an unexcused specific intent to do grievous bodily harm, or an unexcused intent to do an act creating a plain and strong likelihood that death or grievous bodily harm would follow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The defendant contends that the first sentence was highly prejudicial because it undercut one of his key defenses, namely that he had shot the victim \u201cin a state of hot blood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>arising from the reasonable provocation of the victim\u2019s vile verbal and physical abuse of his sister\u201d and therefore was guilty only of voluntary manslaughter. The defendant asserts that this sentence \u201ceffectively wiped out that defense, by making the mitigating circumstance on which [he] relied to show the <em>absence </em>of malice evidence of the <em>presence </em>of malice.\u201d Although we have agreed that judges should avoid the frequently stated definition linking malice to \u201ca frame of mind which includes not only anger, hatred, and revenge, but also every other unlawful [or] unjustifiable motive,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagles, supra </em>at 836, we nevertheless conclude that the judge\u2019s use of that definition did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. When read in the context of the entire jury charge, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Carrion, </em>407 Mass. 263, 270 (1990), it is clear that the instruction adequately explained to the jurors the concept of malice aforethought. The judge properly referred to the three prongs of malice described in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grey, </em>399 Mass. 469, 470 n.1 (1987). In addition, the judge emphasized that, if the Commonwealth did not prove malice beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant could not be guilty of murder, but might be guilty of manslaughter. Furthermore, the judge repeatedly articulated the Commonwealth\u2019s burden to prove each element of the crimes charged and repeatedly stressed the defendant\u2019s presumption of innocence. The judge\u2019s use of the \u201cframe of mind\u201d language did not amount to reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">The defendant also contends that the judge erred in prefacing his definition of the three prongs of malice with the words \u201calso includes.\u201d He asserts that this instruction impermissibly suggested to the jury alternative ways to find malice, and that it allowed the jury to find malice \u201csolely on the basis of the defendant\u2019s undisputed \u2018frame of mind . . . [of] anger, hatred, and revenge\u2019 \u201d at the time of the killing.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Al<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>though we agree that the judge preferably would not have inserted the word \u201calso\u201d before describing the three prongs of malice, we conclude that, in the context of the entire instructions, the judge adequately conveyed to the jurors a correct definition of malice. The judge\u2019s use of the single extraneous \u201calso\u201d did not give rise to a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">c. <em>Reasonable provocation instruction. </em>The defendant next asserts that, because the judge mingled correct with incorrect instructions regarding the mitigating circumstance of heat of passion, without any explanation of the \u201cconstitutionally infirm\u201d instructions, the portion of the charge addressing \u201creasonable provocation\u201d denied the defendant his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We agree that the judge misstated the law when he instructed that \u201cin order to prove the defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter, the Commonwealth must prove . . . [that] the defendant injured the victim as a result of a sudden combat or in the heat of passion.\u201d Nevertheless, we conclude that the error did not vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>late the defendant\u2019s Federal due process rights, nor did it create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution \u201cprotects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\u201d <em>Francis </em>v. Franklin, 471 U.S. 307, 313 (1985), quoting <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970). This fundamental principle prohibits a judge from using \u201cevidentiary presumptions in a jury charge that have the effect of relieving the State of its burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt of every essential element of a crime.\u201d <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, supra. </em>See <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, </em>442 U.S. 510, 520-524 (1979); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lykus, </em>406 Mass. 135, 143 (1989). In order to determine whether a jury instruction fails to meet constitutional muster, a reviewing court first must focus on the specific language challenged. <em>California </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>479 U.S. 538, 541 (1987), citing <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, supra </em>at 315. If that language, considered in isolation, \u201ccould reasonably have been understood as creating a presumption that relieves the State of its burden of persuasion on an element of an offense,\u201d <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, supra, </em>then the reviewing court must examine the charge as a whole to see if the entire charge delivered a correct interpretation of the law. See <em>California </em>v. <em>Brown, supra </em>at 541. See also <em>Boyde </em>v. <em>California, </em>494 U.S. 370, 378 (1990), quoting <em>Cupp </em>v. <em>Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 146-147 (1973) (\u201cwe accept at the outset the well-established proposition that a single instruction to a jury may not be judged in artificial isolation, but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The defendant cites <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, supra, </em>in support of his claim. In that case, the United States Supreme Court stated that \u201c[l]anguage that merely contradicts and does not explain a constitutionally infirm instruction will not suffice to absolve the infirmity\u201d because \u201c[a] reviewing court has no way of knowing which of the two irreconcilable instructions the jurors applied in reaching their verdict\u201d (footnote omit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>ted). <em>Id. </em>at 322. <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin </em>does not assist the defendant for two reasons. First, although, at one point, the judge misstated the Commonwealth\u2019s burden, we do not believe that the error had \u201cthe effect of relieving the [Commonwealth] of its burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt of every essential element of [the] crime [charged],\u201d <em>id. </em>at 313, nor did it shift any burden to the defendant. See <em>Sandstrom </em>v. <em>Montana, supra </em>at 520-524. The judge\u2019s misstatement, therefore, was not \u201cconstitutionally infirm.\u201d Second, even if we were to conclude that the instruction was constitutionally infirm, <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin </em>accepts the general principle that such an instruction should be considered in the context of the entire charge. See <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 72 (1991), quoting <em>Cupp </em>v. <em>Naughten, </em>414 U.S. 141, 147 (1973) (\u201cinstruction \u2018may not be judged in artificial isolation,\u2019 but must be considered in the context of the instructions as a whole\u201d);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Repoza, </em>400 Mass. 516, 519, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 935 (1987) (\u201cjury instructions are not to be viewed in isolation but rather in the context of the charge as a whole\u201d).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Reviewing the whole <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>charge, including the judge\u2019s emphatic and repeated statements that only the Commonwealth \u2014 and never the defendant \u2014 bore any burden, we believe that the jury could not have concluded that the judge\u2019s misstatement created an unconstitutional presumption relieving the State of its burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt of every element of deliberately premeditated murder in the first degree.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The instruction did not violate the defendant\u2019s Federal due process rights, nor did it create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">d. <em>Instruction on excessive force in self-defense and defense of another. </em>The defendant\u2019s final claim of error involves the judge\u2019s instruction on excessive force in self-defense or defense of another. The judge instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">\u201cIf the Commonwealth fails to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in self-defense but the Commonwealth does prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant used excessive force in defending himself or defending another in light of the circumstances and if death resulted from the use of that excessive force, then you <em>may </em>find the defendant guilty of manslaughter\u201d (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVz\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>The defendant asserts that this instruction denied him Fourteenth Amendment due process because it left the jury \u201cfree not to return a manslaughter verdict despite reasonable doubt as to whether the defendant had acted in self-defense or defense of his sister but with excessive force.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">We agree that, in the context of this case, the judge should have used the mandatory word \u201cshall\u201d rather than the permissive \u201cmay.\u201d However, we conclude that, in light of the entire charge, the judge\u2019s use of that single word did not violate the defendant\u2019s Federal due process rights because it did not in any way relieve the Commonwealth of its burden of persuasion beyond a reasonable doubt of every element of the crime charged. See <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, supra </em>at 313. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Giguere, ante </em>226, 231 (1995). Nor did the instruction create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. First, the defendant was not entitled to any instruction on self-defense or defense of another. Therefore, whatever the judge said concerning self-defense or defense of another, and the use of excessive force in self-defense or defense of another, was more favorable to the defendant than he deserved and could not have prejudiced his position. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, </em>417 Mass. 619, 632 (1994). A judge must instruct on self-defense in a homicide case if the evidence most favorable to the defendant warrants a reasonable doubt whether \u201cthe defendant: (1) had reasonable ground to believe and actually did believe that he was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm, from which he could save himself only by using deadly force, (2) had availed himself of all proper means to avoid physical combat before resorting to the use of deadly force,' and (3) used no more force than was reasonably necessary in all the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Curtis, supra, </em>quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Harrington, </em>379 Mass. 446, 450 (1980). In this case, there was no evidence that the defendant had reasonable ground to believe and actually did believe that he or his sister was in imminent danger of death or serious bodily harm such that his use of deadly force was justified. Nor was there any evidence that the defendant availed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>himself of all proper means to avoid physical combat. The defendant had ample opportunity to leave the bar and avoid any further scuffle with the victim. Instead, the defendant shot the victim in the face and then shot him twice in the back as the victim attempted to flee.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">Second, even if the defendant were entitled to such an instruction, our review of the record shows that the jury\u2019s verdict of deliberately premeditated murder in the first degree \u201cwould have been substantially unsullied\u201d by any alleged error in the judge\u2019s instructions concerning excessive force in self-defense or defense of another. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>414 Mass. 252, 267 (1993), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Glass, </em>401 Mass. 799, 804 (1988). In reaching this conclusion, we note that during the deliberations the jury asked the judge only one question: \u201ca reclarification between murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree; i.e., deliberate premeditation.\u201d After the judge explained that distinction, the jury took only twenty minutes to reach a verdict of deliberately premeditated murder in the first degree. Any alleged error in the instructions concerning excessive force in self-defense or defense of another, therefore, did not create a substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>414 Mass. 618, 627-628 (1993) (error in instruction on third prong of malice did not give rise to substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice \u201cin light of the jury\u2019s finding the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree by reason of deliberate premeditation and extreme atrocity or cruelty\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">II. <em>Review under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>The defendant urges us to exercise our power under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to reduce the verdict from murder in the first degree to manslaughter. He argues that the evidence tended to establish that the killing was not premeditated or carried out with malice aforethought, but instead occurred in the heat of passion on reasonable provocation. The defendant also contends that \u201c[virtually all\u201d of the factors present in past cases where we have reduced murder verdicts are present here, including that the victim \u201cunquestionably\u201d was the instigator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>of trouble and that the gun used was a weapon of opportunity rather than of design. According to the defendant, these factors, in combination with the alleged errors in the jury instructions, \u201cpoint to a conclusion that \u2018justice will be best served\u2019 if the verdict is reduced pursuant to G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">After reviewing the entire record, we decline to exercise our extraordinary power to reduce the verdict from murder in the first degree to manslaughter. The evidence showed that the defendant shot the victim in the face from a range of six to eighteen inches. When the victim attempted to flee, the defendant pursued him and shot him twice in the back. We are satisfied that the facts of this case fully support the jury\u2019s verdict of deliberately premeditated murder in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b498-9\">The jury also convicted the defendant of a firearm charge, for which he received a concurrent sentence of from three to five years. The defendant does not appeal from this conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b499-6\">One bullet lodged in the victim\u2019s spinal canal, fracturing one vertebra and severing the spinal cord. The other bullet lodged in the \u201couter table\u201d of the victim\u2019s skull.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b499-7\">The videotaped statement was \u201cbasically\u201d the same as the first statement. However, there were some discrepancies. For example, in the initial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>statement, the defendant stated that the victim had put his knife away in his rear pocket before the defendant shot him. In the videotaped statement, the defendant first stated the same thing. He then recanted and stated that the victim may have had the knife out of his pocket at that time, and that the victim may have waved the knife around in the air.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b501-8\">The defendant further contends that, despite his failure to object at trial, we should review his other three claims of error as if he had properly preserved them for appeal because he saved his appellate rights as to the judge\u2019s failure to give the requested malice instruction, and because these three alleged errors \u201cflowed directly\u201d from that error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b502-6\">The judge charged as follows: \u201c[T]he Commonwealth must prove to you beyond a reasonable doubt that the killing was committed with malice aforethought. Malice aforethought refers to a frame of mind which includes not only anger, hatred, and revenge, but also every other unlawful or unjustifiable motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">\u201cIt does not necessarily imply ill will towards the person killed. Any intentional killing of a human being without justification or excuse, with no extenuating circumstances which would reduce the crime to manslaughter, is malicious within the meaning of malice aforethought. Whether a killing is actually committed with malice aforethought is determined from the nature and quality of the act which attends the killing. If the circumstances attending a killing disclose that death flows from a purposeful, self<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>ish, wrongful motive as distinguished from human frailty, then that would constitute malice aforethought.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u201cMalice aforethought also includes an unexcused specific intent to kill, or an unexcused specific intent to do grievous bodily harm, or an unexcused intent to do an act creating a plain and strong likelihood that death or grievous bodily harm would follow. Malice aforethought may be inferred if, in the circumstances known to the defendant, a reasonably prudent person would have known that, according to common experience, there was a plain and strong likelihood that death or grievous bodily harm would follow the contemplated act.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\u201cMalice may be inferred, also \u2014 it does not have to be \u2014 it may be inferred from the intentional use of a dangerous weapon. A dangerous weapon is any instrument which, by its construction or its use, is capable of causing death or grievous bodily harm, or one which could be perceived by a reasonable person to be so capable, and a gun may be considered a dangerous weapon. Malice may be inferred from the use of a dangerous weapon, but, again, it does not have to be. You need not, in other words, draw an inference of malice from the use of a dangerous weapon. It\u2019s entirely up to you to decide whether or not that inference is to be drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">\u201cYou may draw the inference of malice, however, only if the defendant used such force that, according to common experience, there was a plain and strong likelihood that death or grievous bodily harm would follow from the defendant\u2019s action; and the burden of proof, again, is upon the Commonwealth to prove that element beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">Although we conclude that in this case the judge adequately explained to the jury the concept of malice aforethought, we do not, for the reasons discussed in this opinion, approve of this instruction as a model malice instruction for use by trial judges. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagles, </em>419 Mass. 825, 836 (1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b504-5\">In his brief, the defendant argues that our decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>414 Mass. 252 (1993), decided after the trial of the case at bar, supports his assertion that the judge erred in stating that \u201c[m]alice aforethought refers to a frame of mind which includes not only anger, hatred, and revenge, but also every other unlawful or unjustifiable motive.\u201d In <em>Burke, supra </em>at 265, the judge used the \u201cframe of mind\u201d language and also stated that malice \u201cis the intent to inflict injury without legal justification\u201d and that malice aforethought exists where death results \u201cfrom a purposeful, selfish, wrongful motivation.\u201d The judge deviated from the three prongs of malice language of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grey, </em>399 Mass. 469, 470 n.1 (1987). We concluded that the judge\u2019s malice instruction was erroneous, but that there was no substantial likelihood of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burke, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Even if we were to assume that <em>Burke </em>has retroactive effect, our analysis in that case does not assist the defendant. In this case, although the judge did use the \u201cframe of mind\u201d language, he also defined malice by reference to the three prongs of malice. The instruction therefore was substantially similar to one approved by this court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ferreira, </em>417 Mass. 592, 597-598 &amp; n.7 (1994), a case not cited in the defendant\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">We note that, in light of our recent decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagles, supra, </em>judges should not use the \u201cframe of mind\u201d language when instructing juries about malice. Thus, we would not approve the <em>Ferreira </em>instruction as a model malice instruction for use by trial judges.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The defendant further asserts that, by using this language, the judge erroneously failed to \u201climit \u2018malice\u2019 to the \u2018three-pronged definition required by this court.\u2019 \u201d Although we advise judges to define malice by reference to the three prongs described in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grey, supra, </em>we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>do not require that a judge limit his malice instruction to that three-pronged definition. A trial judge has discretion to provide such additional explanation as may be appropriate to the jury\u2019s understanding of the charge. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eagles, supra </em>at 836. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Silva, </em>388 Mass. 495, 507 (1983) (trial judge has discretion \u201cto choose the form of expression best adapted to make the law intelligible to the jurors\u201d). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Judge, ante </em>433, 441-442 (1995) (charge of murder in the first degree based solely on deliberate premeditation may render irrelevant the theory of third prong of malice).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b506-7\">While explaining voluntary manslaughter, the judge correctly stated that \u201c[t]he Commonwealth has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt . . . that the defendant did not act in the heat of passion or sudden provocation. You may not return a verdict of guilty of murder unless the Commonwealth met that burden.\u201d Several paragraphs later, the judge incorrectly stated that \u201cin order to prove the defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter, the Commonwealth must prove . . . beyond a reasonable doubt. . . [that] the defendant injured the victim as a result of a sudden combat or in the heat of passion.\u201d At the end of this section of the charge, the judge again correctly stated that \u201cthe Commonwealth has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in the heat of passion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In doing so, we bear in mind that \u201c[j]urors do not sit in solitary isolation booths parsing instructions for subtle shades of meaning in the same way that lawyers might. Differences among them in interpretation of instructions may be thrashed out in the deliberative process, with commonsense understanding of the instructions in the light of all that has taken place at the trial likely to prevail over technical hairsplitting.\u201d <em>Boyde </em>v. <em>California, </em>494 U.S. 370, 380-381 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b508-6\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Repoza, </em>400 Mass. 516, 519, cert. denied, 484 U.S. 935 (1987), citing <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Franklin, All </em>U.S. 307, 315 (1985), we noted that, in considering challenged instructions in the context of the entire charge, a reviewing court would assess \u201cthe possible impact of the error on the deliberations of a reasonable juror.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">However, we note that the Supreme Court has adopted a different standard of review for jury instructions. In <em>Boyde </em>v. <em>California, supra </em>at 380, the Court also stated that the appropriate inquiry is \u201cwhether there is a reasonable likelihood that the jury has applied the challenged instruction in a way\u201d that violates the Federal Constitution. The Court reaffirmed this standard in <em>Estelle </em>v. <em>McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 72 n.4 (1991), and disapproved the \u201creasonable juror\u201d standard of review language used in cases such as <em>Cage </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>498 U.S. 39, 41 (1990), and <em>Yates </em>v. <em>Evatt, </em>500 U.S. 391, 401 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b509-6\"> As we already have noted, see note 8, <em>supra, </em>during the voluntary manslaughter portion of the charge, the judge explicitly told the jury that \u201c [t] he Commonwealth has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt on the manslaughter consideration that the defendant did not act in the heat of passion or sudden provocation. You may not return a verdict of guilty of murder unless the Commonwealth met that burden.\u201d The judge also clearly stated that \u201cwhere there is evidence of provocation, the Commonwealth has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant did not act in the heat of passion.\u201d In addition, the entire charge is replete with emphatic instructions as to the prosecution\u2019s burden and the defendant\u2019s presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">For these same reasons, we conclude that the judge\u2019s statement that \u201cthese mitigating circumstances, if they exist to your satisfaction, operate to negate the element of malice,\u201d did not impose on the defendant any burden to prove the mitigating circumstances that he claimed compelled a verdict of voluntary manslaughter rather than murder.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
