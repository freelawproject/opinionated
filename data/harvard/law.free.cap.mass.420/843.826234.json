The report concerned potential conflicts of interest between automobile body repair shops and drive-in appraisal services for automobile insurance companies. One portion of the second segment of the report focused on the plaintiffs. As a result of the broadcast of the investigative report, the plaintiffs brought this action for defamation (slander and libel), interference with business relations, injurious falsehood, and violation of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11 (1994 ed.). A Superior Court judge allowed the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on all counts. The plaintiffs appealed. We transferred the case here on our own motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">1. <em>Facts. </em>The facts are not disputed. On May 23, 1989, WBZ-TV4 broadcast a segment of a three-part investigative report entitled \u201cHighway Robbery?\u201d. The text of the portion of the broadcast relating to the plaintiffs\u2019 operations is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-9\">Reporter: \u201cOur investigation uncovered another area of potential abuse involving appraisal services. Those services do damage estimates on cars after collisions. The law says it\u2019s a conflict of interest for an appraiser to use a body shop for drive-in estimates. Here\u2019s why: there could be collusion whereby the appraiser could steer business to the nearby shop. That could create an unfair advantage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-11\">\u201cOn a recent Saturday we saw car after car pulling into an Allstate drive-in appraisal service operated out of this body shop in Lowell . . . The owner of the shop insists this is perfectly legal. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AyQ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>Bulgarian: \u201cPeople have a choice. They don\u2019t have to come here. We don\u2019t ask them to come here. They\u2019re given a choice of shops by the insurance company and they can go where they want.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axs\">Reporter: \u201cIn addition, Bulgarian has his own independent appraisal service housed in another part of the building . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdB\">Bulgarian: \u201cThey\u2019re two individual businesses. They pay taxes differently. They\u2019re registered differently. OK?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AiOu\">Reporter: \u201cWe showed videotapes of Bulgarian\u2019s operations to a former member of the appraisers board who helped write the conflict of interest regulations, and to this current member. Both said that there appeared to be a violation of the law. \u201cIn your opinion, does this present a conflict of interest?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9k4\">Jansson:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cIt certainly does, in my opinion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfBN\">Reporter: \u201cWe found similar set-ups at two other locations in Lowell, with body shops and appraisal services owned by the same people. Here, at Towne Auto Body, in the same building, and at American Auto Body, in two buildings on the same property. Our experts said both locations appear to be conflicts of interest. So what does this mean to the consumer? Possibly less competition among body shops, and higher prices for repairs, as the man who helped write the law explains.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>Bisceglia:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cWe had hoped to have an open market, with no undue pressure put on the consumer to try to force him to go somewhere. Let him use the whole marketplace to pick his own bodyshop without someone trying to steer him or lowball to a specific shop.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-5\">Reporter: \u201cLate last week, Allstate told us that they have stopped using the National Auto Body site for drive-in appraisals because they also have concluded that there was a conflict of interest. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">2. <em>Summary judgment. </em>\u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when \u2018there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and . . . the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 Mass. R. Civ. P. 56 (c), 365 Mass. 824 (1974).\u201d <em>Symmons </em>v. <em>O\u2019Keeffe, </em>419 Mass. 288, 293 (1995). \u201c[The] party moving for summary judgment in a case in which the opposing party will have the burden of proof at trial is entitled to summary judgment if he demonstrates . . . that the party opposing the motion has no reasonable expectation of proving an essential element of that party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>418 Mass. 394, 397 (1994). See <em>Flesner </em>v. <em>Technical Communications Corp., </em>410 Mass. 805, 809 (1991) (moving party\u2019s \u201cburden need not be met by affirmative evidence negating an essential element of the plaintiff\u2019s case, but may be satisfied by demonstrating that proof of that element is unlikely to be forthcoming at trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">\u201c[S]ummary judgment procedures are especially favored in defamation cases. . . . \u2018Allowing a trial to take place in a meritless case \u201cwould put an unjustified and serious damper on freedom of expression.\u201d \u2019. . . Even if a defendant in a libel case is ultimately successful at trial, the costs of litigation may induce an unnecessary and undesirable self-censorship.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"847\">*847</page-number>(Citations omitted.) <em>King </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>400 Mass. 705, 708 (1987), cert. denied, 485 U.S. 940 and 962 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">3. <em>Defamation, </em>a. <em>Legal principles. </em>The speech at issue was a news broadcast about a matter of public concern. \u201c[I]n order for [such speech] to be the basis of a recovery from th[e] media defendant [s], the plaintiffs must prove not only that the statements were defamatory but also that they were false.\u201d <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>Boston Broadcasters, Inc., </em>402 Mass. 376, 381 (1988). See <em>Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hepps, </em>475 U.S. 767, 776 (1986) (where plaintiff is a private figure and newspaper articles are a matter of public concern, there is \u201ca constitutional requirement that the plaintiff bear the burden of showing falsity, as well as fault, before recovering damages\u201d). This requirement insulates from liability statements that are not provable as false. <em>Hepps, supra </em>at 778. See <em>Phantom Touring, Inc. </em>v. <em>Affiliated Publications, </em>953 F.2d 724, 727 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 974 (1992) (\u201cstatements made by a media defendant \u2018must be provable as false\u2019 before there can be defamation liability\u201d); <em>National Ass\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees, Inc. </em>v. <em>Central Broadcasting Corp., </em>379 Mass. 220, 230 (1979), cert. denied, 446 U.S. 935 (1980), quoting <em>Hotchner </em>v. <em>Castillo-Puche, </em>551 F.2d 910, 912 (2d Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Hotchner </em>v. <em>Doubleday &amp; Co., </em>434 U.S. 834 (1977) (\u201cAn assertion that cannot be proved false cannot be held libelous\u201d). The Superior Court judge correctly granted summary judgment because the plaintiffs had no reasonable expectation of proving the statements in the broadcast false. See <em>Symmons, supra </em>at 293, quoting <em>Wheatley, supra </em>at 397.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">b. <em>Discussion. </em>The relevant portion of the report began by stating that the \u201cI-Team\u201d investigation uncovered another area of \u201cpotential abuse.\u201d To prove the statement false, the plaintiffs would have to prove that there was no possibility, however slight, of any form of abuse in the matter under investigation. The plaintiffs did not have a reasonable expectation of proving the statement false.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>The reporter stated that appraisal services do repair cost estimates on automobiles damaged in collisions. The plaintiffs did not contend that this statement was false. The reporter then gave an essentially correct statement of the relevant law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Taibbi, </em>400 Mass. 786 (1987) (concluding that statement was \u201cessentially true\u201d). The reporter\u2019s explanation of the purpose of the law was not challenged by the plaintiffs. Further, this statement does not appear \u201creasonably susceptible of a defamatory connotation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">The reporter\u2019s statement that, on a recent Saturday \u201cwe saw car after car pulling into an Allstate drive-in appraisal service operated out of this body shop in Lowell,\u201d was not accurate. As seen in the accompanying video, the automobiles pulled up to the curb in front of a sign saying \u201cAllstate Drive-In Appraisal Services\u201d which was located in front of plaintiff, National Auto Body and Sales. In defamation actions, we \u201cmake an independent examination of the whole record.\u201d <em>Milkovich </em>v. <em>Lorain Journal Co., </em>497 U.S. 1, 17 (1990). Viewed as a whole, the tenor of the report was accurate. The inaccurate description of automobiles pulling up to, instead of into the shop was counterbalanced by the accompanying video. The reporter\u2019s statements were balanced by Bulgarian\u2019s. The inaccurate statement, when considered in the context in- which it was broadcast, was not \u201creasonably susceptible of a defamatory connotation.\u201d <em>Taibbi, supra </em>at 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">There is no dispute that the statements by the reporter that \u201c[t]he owner of the shop insists this is perfectly legal\u201d and that \u201cBulgarian has his own independent appraisal service housed in another part of the building\u201d were true. The plaintiffs did not contest the veracity of the statements made by Bulgarian.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>The opinions of Jansson and Bisceglia (the experts, see nn.3 &amp; 4, <em>supra) </em>that the law appeared to be violated and that there was a conflict of interest also do not support a cause of action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As a republisher of these statements, the defendants are subject to the same liability as if they were the original publishers. See <em>Taibbi, supra </em>at 786, and cases cited. The Superior Court judge correctly determined that these were statements of opinion. In making such a determination, \u201c[t]he court must \u2018examine the statement in its totality in the context in which it was uttered or published. The court must consider all the words used . . . [and] must give weight to cautionary terms used by the person publishing the statement. Finally, the court must consider all of the circumstances surrounding the statement ....\u2019\u201d <em>Lyons </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>415 Mass. 258, 263 (1993), quoting <em>Fleming </em>v. <em>Benzaquin, </em>390 Mass. 175, 180-181 (1983). See <em>Lyons, supra </em>at 263, quoting <em>Myers </em>v. <em>Boston Magazine Co., </em>380 Mass. 336, 339 (1980) (\u201cIf \u2018the statement unambiguously constitutes either fact or opinion,\u2019 this issue is a question of law for the [judge] to decide\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">That the statements were statements of opinion does not preclude a cause of action. See <em>Milkovich, supra </em>at 18. \u201c[Expressions of \u2018opinion\u2019 may often imply an assertion of objective fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The opinions at issue, however, were based on disclosed nondefamatory facts, namely the regulation described in the broadcast, videotapes of the plaintiffs\u2019 operations,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the experts\u2019 experience as members of the auto damage appraiser licensing board. The \u201clogical nexus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>between the facts and the opinion [s] was sufficiently apparent to render unreasonable any inference that \u2018the derogatory opinion[s] must have been based on undisclosed facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lyons, supra </em>at 266. An \u201cexpression of opinion based on disclosed or assumed nondefamatory facts is not itself sufficient for an action of defamation, no matter how unjustified or unreasonable the opinion may be or how derogatory it is.\u201d <em>Lyons, supra </em>at 262, quoting <em>National Ass\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees, Inc., supra </em>at 227. See <em>Milkovich, supra </em>at 20 (\u201ca statement of opinion relating to matters of public concern which does not contain a provably false factual connotation will receive full constitutional protection\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The reporter\u2019s statements about the possible effects of apparent conflicts of interest also were opinion based on disclosed nondefamatory facts, namely the facts disclosed in the broadcast and the statement of Bisceglia. Further, these statements were not \u201cprovable as false.\u201d Bisceglia\u2019s statement about the intent of the law was not \u201cprovable as false\u201d and therefore not actionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">The reporter\u2019s statement that Allstate had told \u201cus\u201d that they had stopped using the National Auto Body site for drive-in appraisals because they (Allstate) concluded that there was a conflict of interest, does not support a cause of action. This statement asserts two facts: that Allstate concluded that there was a conflict of interest and therefore stopped using the site, and that Allstate told this to the defendants. The plaintiffs did not make an offer of proof that showed that either of these facts were untrue.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">Finally, the title of the series of reports, \u201cHighway Robbery?\u201d, constitutes rhetorical flourish or hyperbole, which is protected from defamation liability. See <em>Lyons, supra </em>at 266-267 (statements of rhetorical hyperbole excluded from defamation liability); <em>Phantom Touring, supra </em>at 727 (\u201ccases explicitly protect \u2018rhetorical hyperbole\u2019 and other types of \u2018imaginative expression\u2019 that writers use to enliven their prose. . . . For example, a theater critic who wrote that, \u2018The producer who decided to charge admission for that show is committing highway robbery,\u2019 would be immune <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>from liability because no reasonable listener would understand the speaker to be accusing the producer of the actual crime of robbery\u201d [citation omitted]); <em>id. </em>at 728 (description of theater production as \u201ca rip-off, a fraud, a scandal, a snake-oil job\u201d is \u201cobviously protected hyperbole\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">The plaintiffs claim that, in its entirety, the report could be seen as a factual assertion that Bulgarian operated his two businesses together and that this constituted a violation of the law. The broadcast did not constitute such an assertion. Each statement was a true fact, a nonprovable as false fact or an opinion, clearly identified as such, based on disclosed nondefamatory facts. In addition to the underlying facts and the opinions that a conflict of interest existed, the report presented Bulgarian\u2019s opinions. It was up to the viewers to draw their own conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">4. <em>Intentional interference with business relations. </em>The plaintiffs, claim that there was a triable issue whether the defendants\u2019 statements in the broadcast and the statements they made to Allstate constituted intentional interference with the plaintiffs\u2019 business relations. Summary judgment was proper because the plaintiffs could not establish that the defendants\u2019 conduct arose from improper motives or involved improper means.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">An essential element of the tort of intentional interference with business relations is that the interference be improper in motive or means.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> See <em>G.S. Enters., Inc. </em>v. <em>Falmouth </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number><em>Marine, Inc., </em>410 Mass. 262, 272 (1991); <em>United Truck Leasing Corp. </em>v. <em>Geltman, </em>406 Mass. 811, 815-816 (1990). The plaintiffs did not allege, and the evidence did not support, any improper motive or means. As discussed above, the plaintiffs could not prove that any of the defendants\u2019 statements were false. There is no indication that the report was broadcast for any reason other than the reporting on an issue of public concern. There is no indication that the conversation with Allstate personnel was improper or carried on for any purpose other than journalism.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">5. <em>Injurious falsehood. </em>The Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 623A (1977) sets forth the requirements for liability for publication of injurious falsehoods: \u201cOne who publishes a false statement harmful to the interests of another is subject to liability for pecuniary loss resulting to the other if (a) he intends for publication of the statement to result in harm to the interests of the other having a pecuniary value, or either recognizes or should recognize that it is likely to do so, and (b) he knows that the statement is false or acts in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity.\u201d The plaintiffs did not offer affidavits or other documents showing or tending to show that the defendants knew or should have known that their statements were false or that the defendants acted in reckless disregard of their truth or falsity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, the Superior Court judge correctly allowed the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on this count.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">6. <em>G. L. c. 93A, \u00a711. </em>General Laws c. 93A, \u00a7 11, allows recovery for \u201cthe use or employment ... of an unfair method of competition or an unfair or deceptive act or practice.\u201d See G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (1994 ed.). The plaintiffs argue that this claim was supported by the defendants\u2019 \u201cbroadcast <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>of erroneous assertions couched as facts.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Defamatory statements are actionable under G. L. c. 93A. <em>A.F.M. Corp. </em>v. <em>Corporate Aircraft </em>Management, 626 F. Supp. 1533, 1551 (D. Mass. 1985). However, where allegedly defamatory statements do not support a cause of action for defamation, they also do not support a cause of action under G. L. c. 93A. See <em>id. </em>at 1552 (\u201cAs [the defendant] did not exceed its qualified privilege, . . . [the defendant] did not engage in any unfair or deceptive trade practices\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b863-4\">Bertill Jansson, member of the Massachusetts auto damage appraiser licensing board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b864-9\">Frank Bisceglia, former member of the same board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b866-7\">The reporter stated: \u201cThe law says that it\u2019s a conflict of interest for an appraiser to use a body shop for drive-in estimates.\u201d The applicable regulation, 212 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 2.02 (7) (1986) states: \u201cIt shall be a conflict of interest if any licensed appraiser uses an auto body repair shop for Drive-In Appraisal Service for an insurer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b867-6\">The plaintiffs did not allege that the defendants were untruthful in stating that they showed the experts videotapes of Dulgarian\u2019s operations, that the experts were a present and former member of the licensing board, or that they both said that there appeared to be a violation of the law and conflicts of interest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b867-7\">That the videotapes viewed by the experts were different than those shown in the broadcast is irrelevant. The news report broadcast only short excerpts of the tapes shown to the experts. These excerpts demonstrated the nature of the tapes. Stone stated that the experts were shown videotapes of the operations, not that they were shown only the short excerpts included in the broadcast.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b869-8\">We previously had required that the interference be malicious. <em>Elm Medical Lab., Inc. </em>v. <em>RKO Gen., Inc., </em>403 Mass. 779, 787 (1989). In 1990, we clarified the requirement by replacing the term malicious with the term improper. <em>United Truck Leasing Corp. </em>v. <em>Geltman, </em>406 Mass. 811, 815-816 (1990). Recent cases on intentional interference with contractual relations have further clarified the requirement to be that the interference be \u201cimproper in motive or means.\u201d See, e.g., <em>Draghetti </em>v. <em>Chmielewski, </em>416 Mass. 808, 816 (1994); <em>G.S. Enters., Inc. </em>v. <em>Falmouth Marine, Inc., </em>410 Mass. 262, 272 (1991). See also <em>Draghetti, supra </em>at 809, 816 (treating unlawful interference with advantageous business relations together with and under rules for unlawful interference with contractual relations); <em>Geltman, supra </em>at 815 (setting new rule for both interference with a business relationship and interference with a contemplated contract).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b870-7\">The Superior Court judge did not discuss this requirement, but instead, said that malice was required. See <em>Gott </em>v. <em>Pulsifier, </em>122 Mass. 235, 239 (1877) (where statement is in public interest, there is no action without proof of malice). The plaintiffs argue that malice is not an element of the tort. We do not reach this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b871-5\">Their complaint alleged as the unfair business practices the defendants\u2019 \u201cfabricating a scandalous documentary,\u201d \u201cpublishing a false and misleading documentary,\u201d and \u201cpublish [ing] and airfing] a false documentary after being advised of the false statements contained therein by Dulgarian.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
