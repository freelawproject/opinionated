L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B (1992 ed.). In June, 1989, a jury found the defendant guilty. This court reversed the conviction on appeal because the defendant did not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>a meaningful opportunity to exercise his right to self-representation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conefrey, </em>410 Mass. 1, 13 (1991). After retrial in August, 1991, a jury again found the defendant guilty of indecent assault and battery on his daughter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Appeals Court affirmed the conviction. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conefrey, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 290 (1994). We granted the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">The defendant contends that the trial judge committed reversible error in refusing to instruct the jury that they must unanimously find one specific incident of indecent assault and battery in order to convict.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Appeals Court concluded that the judge erred in declining to give the defendant\u2019s requested instruction on \u201cspecific unanimity,\u201d but that this error did not prejudice the defendant. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conefrey, supra </em>at 297. We agree that the judge erred in not giving the requested specific unanimity instruction. However, we conclude that a harmless error analysis is not appropriate in this case. We reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\"><em>Facts. </em>The Commonwealth presented three witnesses at the second trial. The defendant\u2019s daughter, whom we shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>call Lisa, was eight years old at the time of the alleged incidents in 1986. She testified to eight incidents of indecent assault and battery. Lisa gave no specific dates for any of the incidents. Seven incidents (the \u201cbed incidents\u201d) were substantially similar: while Lisa and the defendant sat on his bed watching television, the defendant pulled down his pants, exposed his penis, and asked her to touch it. Although Lisa initially objected, the defendant told her that \u201cit was okay.\u201d He then took her hand and put it on his penis. The defendant also told Lisa that she need not tell her mother. Lisa testified that three bed incidents occurred at the defendant\u2019s apartment in Falmouth. She further testified that four bed incidents occurred after the defendant moved to West Falmouth. Another incident (the \u201cshower incident\u201d) also occurred in West Falmouth. While Lisa and the defendant were showering together, the defendant rubbed his penis against her stomach.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">In fresh complaint testimony, a Department of Social Services social worker corroborated Lisa\u2019s description of the \u201cbed\u201d and \u201cshower\u201d incidents of indecent assault and battery. A second fresh complaint witness, a State police investigator, corroborated Lisa\u2019s testimony about the \u201cbed incidents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\"><em>Specific unanimity instruction. </em>Near the conclusion of the jury charge, the judge instructed the jury that \u201cthere is no verdict until every juror subscribes to that verdict. In short, whatever the verdict is, it has to be unanimous.\u201d The defendant had requested, in writing, that the judge give this specific unanimity instruction: \u201cIn order to convict the defendant you must unanimously agree beyond a reasonable doubt upon at least one incident.\u201d Although defense counsel objected at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>end of the jury charge, the judge refused to give the requested specific unanimity instruction.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant asserts that the judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on \u201cspecific unanimity\u201d amounted to reversible error.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">At the outset, we note that \u201c[i]t is beyond dispute that the jury verdict in a criminal trial in this Commonwealth must be unanimous.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Hebert, 379 Mass. 752, 754 (1980), citing <em>Brunson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>369 Mass.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>106, 120 (1979). Mass. R. Crim. P. 27 (a), 378 Mass. 897 (1979).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This case is the first in which we have addressed a trial judge\u2019s refusal to give a specific unanimity instruction after a proper request and a timely objection, where alternate incidents could support a conviction. \u201cA general unanimity instruction informs the jury that the verdict must be unanimous, whereas a specific unanimity instruction indicates to the jury that they must be unanimous as to which specific act constitutes the offense charged.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keevan, </em>400 Mass. 557, 566-567 (1987).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">We recognize that in certain circumstances a general unanimity instruction adequately will protect a defendant\u2019s right to a unanimous verdict. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>400 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Mass. 334, 340 (1987) (where general unanimity instruction is given, reviewing court assumes that jury followed it absent evidence to the contrary). However, in other situations, where evidence of separate incidents is offered to the jury and any one incident could support a conviction, a general unanimity instruction may not suffice to ensure that the jury actually does reach a unanimous verdict. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>31 Mass. App. Ct. 362, 367 (1991).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We believe that this is such a case.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comtois, </em>399 Mass. 668 (1987), the defendant was charged with rape and abuse of a child under the age of sixteen years on divers dates. At trial, the defendant did not request that the judge give a specific unanimity instruction. On appeal, the defendant claimed that the judge erred in failing to instruct the jury sua sponte that they could not convict him without agreeing unanimously on a specific unlawful act as the basis for the conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 675-676.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">We concluded that, even if the judge\u2019s instructions were in error, they did not create a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Id. </em>at 677. However, we noted that a judge should give a specific unanimity instruction if a defendant requested it in accordance with the normal procedure of Mass. R. Crim. P. 24 (b), 378 Mass. 895 (1979). <em>Id. </em>at 676-677 n.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Similarly, in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lemar, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 170 (1986), the Appeals Court addressed the need for a specific unanimity instruction where the defendant, like the defendant in this case, had been charged with indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen years of age \u201con divers dates and times.\u201d The evidence at trial showed that criminal incidents had occurred on three separate dates. Although the judge instructed the jury that they must act unanimously, he did not instruct that the jurors must unanimously agree to at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>least one of the incidents in order to convict the defendant. Because the defendant had not requested a specific unanimity instruction at trial, the issue on appeal was whether the judge\u2019s failure to give such an instruction sua sponte created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Id. </em>at 173. The Appeals Court concluded that there was no such risk, but also assumed that a judge would be obliged to give a specific unanimity instruction if the defendant properly requested it. <em>Id. </em>at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">In light of Massachusetts precedent, we conclude that the judge erred in refusing to give the defendant\u2019s requested specific unanimity instruction. In a case such as this one, where the defendant requested a specific unanimity instruction and where there is a significant likelihood that the conviction resulted from different jurors concluding that the defendant committed different acts, the judge should give the requested specific unanimity instruction. Because the judge did not give such an instruction, we cannot know whether the jurors unanimously agreed that any particular incident occurred. Indeed, in light of the fact that Lisa testified to eight incidents, there exists the distinct possibly that the jury did not agree about which of those numerous incidents actually occurred. Some jurors may have convicted the defendant on the basis of one alleged incident, while others may have convicted him based upon any of the seven other alleged incidents. Indeed, as to the so-called bed incidents, they allegedly occurred at three distinct locations (the defendant\u2019s Falmouth apartment and both of his West Falmouth apartments). To correct any potential confusion, the judge should have augmented the general unanimity instruction to ensure that the jurors understood their duty unanimously to agree to a particular set of facts. Even with the general unanimity instruction, the judge\u2019s charge could have permitted the jury to reach a nonunanimous verdict. This we cannot accept.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>We consider next the effect of the judge\u2019s error. Specifically, we must determine whether we should affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction because the judge\u2019s refusal to give the requested specific unanimity instruction amounted to harmless error. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit recently addressed this issue in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Edmonds, </em>52 F.3d 1236 (3d Cir. 1995). In that case, the court held that the trial judge erred in not giving a requested specific unanimity instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 1243. The court then noted that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>508 U.S. 275 (1993), precluded harmless error analysis. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garcia, </em>379 Mass. 422, 445 (1980) (Liacos, J., dissenting) (erroneous charge on reasonable doubt cannot be harmless error). In <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra </em>at 279, the Supreme Court addressed the propriety of harmless error analysis where the jury instructions gave an unconstitutional definition of reasonable doubt. The Court held that using harmless error analysis in such a situation would violate the defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 281-282. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-5\">\u201cSince [the jury never found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt,] there has been no jury verdict within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment [and] the entire premise of [harmless error] review is simply absent. There being no jury verdict of guilty-beyond-a-reasonable-doubt, the question whether the <em>same </em>verdict . . . would have been rendered absent the constitutional error is utterly meaningless. There is no <em>object, </em>so to speak, upon which harmless-error scrutiny can operate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit concluded that this same reasoning applied to bar harmless error analysis where the absence of a specific unanimity instruction had permitted the jury to return a nonunanimous verdict. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Edmonds, supra </em>at 1243-1244. We adopt the Third Circuit\u2019s approach. In this case, the judge\u2019s failure to give the requested specific unanimity instruction allowed the jury to return a nonunanimous verdict. Thus, there may not have been a unanimous jury finding of guilty of the crime charged. Because there was no verdict, it is impossible for us to consider \u201cwhether the guilty verdict actually rendered in <em>this </em>trial was surely unattributable to the error\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Louisiana, supra </em>at 279. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thornley, </em>406 Mass. 96, 101-102 (1989) (essential question in harmless error analysis is whether the error might have contributed to the verdict).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The trial judge denied the defendant\u2019s motion to stay execution of his sentence pending appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Although the defendant does not state explicitly whether he bases his argument on State or Federal law, his brief and counsel\u2019s oral argument concentrated on Massachusetts cases. We therefore focus our discussion on State law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b527-8\">The only issue presented in the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review was the judge\u2019s refusal to give the requested specific unanimity instruction. In his brief, the defendant raises two additional claims of error. He contends that an indecent touching under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B (1992 ed.), must have a sexual purpose or intent, and that the judge therefore erred in refusing to instruct the jury that the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt \u201cthat the touching was for the purpose of sexual arousal, gratification, or offense.\u201d The defendant also argues that G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 13B, is unconstitutionally overbroad. Because we reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction on the sole issue presented for further appellate review, the judge\u2019s failure to give a requested specific unanimity instruction, we need not discuss the two additional claims of error. We state only that we are content with the Appeals Court\u2019s analysis of these two issues. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Conefrey, </em>37 Mass. App. Ct. 290, 299-302 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Lisa testified that the defendant had lived in two different apartments at the same West Falmouth address. He first lived in an upstairs apartment that did not have a shower. The defendant then moved to a downstairs apartment that had a private shower. Lisa testified that the shower incident occurred in the downstairs apartment. She did not specify whether the four bed incidents had occurred in one, or both, of the West Falmouth apartments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Defense counsel stated at side bar: \u201cIf they can\u2019t agree on any particular incident \u2014 like if six think that something happened in the shower and six thought something didn\u2019t happen in the shower, but maybe something happened in the bedroom, that would not be unanimous even thoughtwelve agreed' that something happened.\u201d The judge responded, \u201cOh, I\u2019m not going to get into that. I don\u2019t think that I should really.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b529-11\">The defendant also contends that his ability to present a defense was limited by the indictment, which charged him with indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen years of age \u201cat divers times and dates during\u201d 1986. He asserts that, because of the \u201camorphous indictment,\u201d he had limited knowledge of the particulars of the charges against him. The defendant argues that the judge should have taken every opportunity to limit the extent of this prejudice by giving the requested specific unanimity instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">Although we conclude that the judge should have given the requested instruction, we do not agree that the indictment prejudiced the defendant at his second trial. First, we note that, because the time of the offense is not an element of the crime of indecent assault and battery on a child under fourteen years, it need not be precisely alleged. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>387 Mass. 464, 467-469 (1982). Thus, at least as to the statutory elements, the indictment was sufficiently specific. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, </em>409 Mass. 500, 511-512 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-13\">Second, to the extent that the defendant\u2019s assertion of prejudice implicates due process concerns, we conclude that the defendant had sufficient knowledge about the charges against him adequately to prepare his defense at the second trial. The purpose of an indictment is, \u201cfirst, to furnish the accused with such a description of the charge against him as will enable him to make his defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, supra </em>at 512, quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cruikshank, </em>92 U.S. 542, 558 (1875). At the second trial, the defendant had the benefit of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence at the first trial, including information about the time, place, and circumstances of the alleged incidents. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Montanino, supra </em>at 513. In addition, the defendant does not assert that he would have conducted his defense differently had the indictment specified the dates and times of the alleged incidents. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, supra </em>at 468. In light of these considerations, we conclude that the indictment did not prejudice the defendant at the second trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Unanimity is \u201cone of the indispensable features of [a] federal jury trial.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Louisiana, </em>406 U.S. 356, 369 (1972) (Powell, J., concurring). See <em>Andres </em>v. <em>United States, </em>333 U.S. 740, 748 (1948) (\u201c[ujnanimity in jury verdicts is required where the Sixth [Amendment] appl[ies]. In criminal cases this requirement of unanimity extends to all issues . . . which are left to the jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Although neither the Federal Constitution nor the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights specifically guarantees the right to a unanimous jury verdict, the right was recognized at common law as a means to ensure that the government has met its burden of proving all facts necessary to show the defendant\u2019s guilt. See <em>Apodaca </em>v. <em>Oregon, </em>406 U.S. 404, 407-408 &amp; n.2 (1972); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Correa-Ventura, </em>6 F.3d 1070, 1076 (5th Cir. 1993), citing 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *343-344. Thus, the requirement of a unanimous jury is related to the requirement that the government prove the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Correa-Ventura, supra </em>at 1077. Both requirements guarantee that jurors reach a \u201csubjective state of certitude\u201d about a defendant\u2019s guilt before rendering a verdict. See <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970). If all jurors agree as to a defendant\u2019s guilt, their unanimity indicates that the government indeed did prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. A less than unanimous jury, in contrast, tend to show that a reasonable doubt exists as to the crime charged. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Correa-Ventura, supra, </em>citing Howe, Jury Fact-Finding in Criminal Cases: Constitutional Limits on Factual Disagreements Between Convicting Jurors, 58 Mo. L. Rev. 1, 12 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Massachusetts appellate courts have discussed the propriety of specific unanimity instructions in recent years. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keevan, </em>400 Mass. 557, 566-567 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sylvester, </em>400 Mass. 334, 340 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comtois, </em>399 Mass. 668 (1987); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramos, </em>31 Mass.
