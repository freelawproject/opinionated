Arthur, was charged in the District Court with indecent exposure in vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>lotion of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53 (1992 ed.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant requested a first instance jury trial, and after trial before a jury of six, was found guilty of the charge. He appealed, and we transferred the case here on our own motion. We conclude that the conviction must be reversed, and judgment entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The Commonwealth presented evidence in its case as follows. At about 10:45 a.m., on July 11, 1993, a mother and her then nine year old daughter were sitting in their vehicle waiting to leave a parking lot in Medway. The defendant walked in front of the vehicle. The mother described him as wearing a white \u201ctank top\u201d and blue shorts. The daughter described him as wearing a white tank top and a light blue bathing suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The defendant walked by the vehicle, rubbing his stomach with one hand while holding his tank top with the other. After he rubbed his stomach, the defendant started to pull up his shirt and to display his stomach while staring \u201caffectionately\u201d at the mother and her daughter. The mother observed the defendant lower his shorts, and she saw what she believed was pubic hair, a conclusion she reached because the defendant had a tan line. The mother averted her gaze because she did not want to see anything further.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">The daughter testified that she saw the defendant pull the waistband on the right side of his bathing suit down to his knees. The daughter indicated that, as the defendant did this, the left side of his bathing suit \u201cjerked\u201d down to his mid-thigh. The defendant did not have any clothes on under his bathing suit, and his movement revealed his crotch area and pubic hair to the daughter, who also immediately turned her attention away. Neither the mother nor the daughter saw any portion of the defendant\u2019s genitalia or buttocks. The incident was reported to the police. A Medway police officer stopped the defendant, and, after questioning, placed him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>under arrest. The defendant was subsequently identified by the mother and daughter at the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">In his closing argument, the prosecutor argued that the evidence was sufficient to compel the conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had exposed his penis to the complainants. The prosecutor further argued that, even if it had not been proved that the defendant had exposed his genitalia, there was proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the complainants had observed pubic hair. This exposure, it was argued, was \u201cso closely connected to [the] genital area, that it could be considered part of [the] genital area,\u201d and was sufficient to constitute indecent exposure. The judge instructed the jury that the defendant could be found guilty of indecent exposure only if they found (among other things), beyond a reasonable doubt, that he had \u201cexposed his genitals or buttocks to one or more persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">1. The defendant concedes that, if the evidence were sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he exposed his genitalia, his conviction under G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, would be warranted. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Bishop, 296 Mass. 459, 460 (1937) (defendant completely naked from waist down). The point is close, but we agree with the defendant\u2019s contention that the evidence did not warrant the conclusion that the defendant had exposed his genitalia. We do not deem the daughter\u2019s testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s pulling down of the right side of his bathing suit or shorts as sufficient to support an inference by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that his conduct at that point had necessarily exposed some portion of his genitalia.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">2. We turn therefore to the Commonwealth\u2019s alternative contention, which was argued to the jury, that exposure of pubic hair falls within the ambit of the statutory prohibition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>in G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, against \u201cindecent exposure.\u201d We have said that \u201c[i]ndecent exposure . . . requires \u2018an intentional act of lewd exposure, offensive to one or more persons.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Broadland, </em>[315 Mass. 20,] 21-22 [1943], quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>273 Mass. 229, 231 (1930).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitta, </em>391 Mass. 394, 396 (1984). The defendant argues that, if the statute is construed to prohibit the exposure of pubic hair, its application to him would violate constitutional principles of due process.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitta, supra </em>at 395-396 (statute must provide sufficient notice as to what conduct will violate its provisions); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, </em>382 Mass. 108, 117-118 (1980) (same). We have not had occasion to consider whether exposure of the genital area or pubic hair might be indecent within the meaning of the statute. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, supra </em>(construing and defining conduct which would warrant conviction under \u201clewd, wanton and lascivious persons\u201d provision of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>\u201c[A] law is not vague [in the constitutional sense] if its meaning is ascertainable by reference to similar or related statutes, or if the questioned [term has] a commonly understood meaning. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>374 Mass. 5, 12-13 (1977); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jarrett, </em>359 Mass. 491, 496-497 (1971). Further, even a vague statute may be made constitutionally definite by giving it a reasonable construction. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>368 Mass. 580, 595-598 (1975); <em>Alegato </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>353 Mass. 287, 303-304 (1967).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, supra </em>at 111. The offense of indecent exposure has been defined as the wilful and intentional exposure of the private parts of one\u2019s body. See <em>Duvallon </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>515 A.2d 724, 726 (D.C. 1986). See also 3 C. Torcia, Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law \u00a7 317 (14th ed. 1980). In truly circular fashion, it has been said that \u201cprivate parts,\u201d the exposure of which constitutes the offense, are those parts of the body \u201cwhich instinctive modesty, human decency or self-respect require shall be kept covered in the presence of others.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Borchard, </em>24 Ohio App. 2d 95, 100 (1970). See Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 768 (6th ed. 1990). Courts construing legislation with general language similar to that found in \u00a7 53, have differed on its applicability. In <em>Duvallon </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, supra, </em>construing legislation which made unlawful an individual\u2019s \u201cobscene or indecent exposure of his or her person,\u201d the court held that the statute applied only to the exposure of a person\u2019s genitalia and did not apply to the intentional exposure of the buttocks. <em>Id. </em>at 725, 728. The court concluded that to construe the statute as applying to an intentional exposure of the buttocks \u201cwould raise an issue of vagueness [in the constitutional sense].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 728 n.10. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Parenteau, </em>55 Ohio Misc. 2d 10, 11 (1990) (female breasts are not \u201cprivate parts\u201d within meaning of indecent exposure statute). In contrast, in <em>Belmar </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>187 N.J. Super. 107 (App. Div. 1982), a municipal ordinance prohibiting \u201cindecent or unnecessary exposure\u201d was construed to apply to the exposure of female breasts. According to the court, \u201cthe proscription against \u2018indecent or unnecessary exposure\u2019 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>person would unmistakably apprise persons of ordinary intelligence that topless sunbathing on a public beach ... is prohibited.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Among jurisdictions which have enacted legislation naming with specificity those parts of the body exposure of which constitutes the offense, a significant number limit their prohibition to exposure of the genitalia. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Santorelli, </em>80 N.Y.2d 875, 882 (1992) (Titone, J., concurring) (noting that twenty-two States prohibit only indecent exposure of genitalia and collecting the statutes). See also Model Penal Code \u00a7 213.5 (Official Draft 1980) (limiting model rule to exposure of genitals). So far as we have been able to determine, only three States (Indiana, Iowa, and New Mexico), would treat as indecent the intentional exposure of the genital area or pubic hair, and these jurisdictions do so by means of legislation which is explicit in its terms. See Ind. Code Ann. \u00a7 35-45-4-1 (Burns 1994) (prohibiting exposure of pubic area or buttocks); Iowa Code \u00a7 709.9 (1992) (prohibiting exposure of \u201cgenitals or pubes\u201d); N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 30-9-14 (Michie 1978) (prohibiting exposure of primary genital area). It thus appears that the term \u201cindecent exposure\u201d lacks a \u201ccommonly understood meaning,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, supra </em>at 111, when considered with respect to parts of the body other than the genitalia. Certainly, it cannot be said that any commonly accepted definition of the term extends to the exposure of the genital area or pubic hair. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Balthazar, </em>366 Mass. 298, 300 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">When a term used in a criminal statute lacks precision, it may nonetheless be \u201cclarified by judicial explanation or by application to particular conduct.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>389 Mass. 265, 271 (1983). If this occurs, \u201cthe statute will withstand a challenge that it is unconstitutionally vague.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The defendant would have had fair warning that the exposure of his genitalia would be a crime from the decision in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>246 Mass. 459 (1937). Moreover, we have said that the \u201copen and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior\u201d provision of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>(1992 ed.), is \u201cclosely similar\u201d to the prohibition against indecent exposure in \u00a7 53. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitta, supra </em>at 396; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, supra </em>at 116. That provision has been applied to, among others, cases of indecent exposure in front of children. See <em>id., </em>citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Templeman, </em>376 Mass. 533, 538 (1978). Cases of conduct amounting to indecent exposure brought pursuant to the provisions of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, invariably have involved exposure of the genitalia. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, supra </em>at 266 (defendant driving automobile with his penis exposed); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>348 Mass. 767 (1964) (defendant naked from waist down in automobile); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wardell, </em>128 Mass. 52, 53 (1880) (defendant made indecent exposure of \u201chis person\" to two young children). Neither G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, nor the related provisions of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 16, have been construed by judicial decision to apply to an intentional exposure of the genital area or the pubic hair. We do not doubt that the defendant\u2019s conduct was designed to offend, and did offend, those at whom it was directed. Nonetheless, we are unable to conclude that the term \u201cindecent exposure,\u201d or the decisional law of the Commonwealth construing the term, would have adequately apprised the defendant that the conduct in which he engaged (by which we mean the conduct proved beyond a reasonable doubt by the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence) could subject him to criminal sanctions. In these circumstances, his conviction pursuant to G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53, must be reversed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, supra </em>at 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">The judgment of conviction is reversed and the verdict is set aside. Judgment is to be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b554-8\">A nolle prosequi was entered on an additional charge which asserted that the defendant had violated the lewd, wanton, and lascivious person provision of G. L. c. 272, \u00a7 53 (1992 ed.).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Our agreement with the defendant\u2019s argument concerning the sufficiency of the evidence will not benefit the individual whose conduct is sufficiently offensive that his victims turn away before he has completed an act of indecent exposure. There may be evidence sufficient to prove that exposure of genitalia occurred, even when a victim has averted his or her eyes. Such evidence was lacking in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b556-5\">\u201cGenerally, a challenge to the constitutionality of a statute <em>as applied </em>should be preserved in a motion for a required finding of not guilty . . .\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oakes, </em>407 Mass. 92, 94 (1990). It does not appear that the defendant argued below that, if the statute was construed to prohibit the exposure of pubic hair, it would be unconstitutionally vague as applied to him. Until the point was raised in the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, it was not apparent that the Commonwealth espoused this interpretation of the term \u201cindecent exposure.\u201d Thus, the defendant could not have anticipated the issue in his motion for a required finding, which was filed at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence in accord with Mass. R. Crim. P. 25 (a), 378 Mass. 896 (1979). In view of the argument, and the judge\u2019s instruction, which did not clarify whether the term \u201cgenitals\u201d could include the genital area, it is possible that the defendant\u2019s conviction rested on proof of the exposure of pubic hair only. For this reason, and because Massachusetts decisions have not, thus far, provided clear and definite content to the term \u201cindecent exposure,\u201d we exercise our power to reach an issue that was not squarely raised at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Oakes, supra </em>at 94-95; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, </em>382 Mass. 108, 115 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>352 Mass. 556, 564 (1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b556-6\">It was noted in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sefranka, supra </em>at 112, that \u201cmost of the provisions in \u00a7 53 have been attacked for vagueness.\u201d See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Templeman, </em>376 Mass. 533, 535 (1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
