From this, the defendant argues that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects him from liability in the absence of proof of actual malice. The defendant\u2019s claim fails from its inception because the activity on which liability was based was, on the defendant\u2019s own admission, not intended to influence the union election. The Supreme Court has distinguished plaintiffs\u2019 claims for defamation or intentional infliction of emotional distress on the basis of the plaintiffs\u2019 prominence with regard to <em>public controversies </em>relevant to their causes of action. See <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 342 (1974).

L. c. 12, \u00a7 111 (1992 ed.).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After a jury-waived trial, judgment was entered in favor of the plaintiff, and damages were awarded in the amount of $35,000. The trial judge ruled that \u201cany one of the plaintiff\u2019s claims . . . [was] a sufficient basis\u201d for the $35,000 judgment, but refused to award \u201cduplicative\u201d damages. The defendant appeals. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We conclude that the judgment based on the tort claim of intentional or reckless infliction of emotional distress should be affirmed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">I. <em>Facts. </em>At the time of the incident which gave rise to this litigation, the plaintiff, Sylvia Smith Bowman, was a sixty year old supervisor in the Worcester office of the Department of Public Welfare (department). She began working as a social worker for the department in 1967, and was a longstanding and active member of Local 509 of the Service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Employees International Union (union). In the 1987 union election, the plaintiff challenged the incumbent president of the local chapter of the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">In October, 1987, while the plaintiff was on an approved leave to campaign in the union election, the defendant, David Heller, an employee in the plaintiff\u2019s office who supported the incumbent president, created two distinct photocopied representations of the plaintiff by superimposing a photograph of her face and name on two different photographs of women striking lewd or masturbatory poses. The photograph of the plaintiff\u2019s face was taken from a campaign card she had distributed to union members. The photographs on which the defendant superimposed the plaintiff\u2019s face were taken by the defendant from pornographic magazines. In one of the photographs, the model is nude from the waist down, except for garters, and is posed toward the camera with her legs wide apart as she holds a banana next to her exposed breast. In the other photograph, the model is entirely naked, and appears to be engaged in masturbation. The representations were crafted by the defendant during regular office hours and reproduced on photocopiers owned by the department. The defendant then distributed his handiwork to five coworkers in the Worcester office. Subsequently, the representations were reproduced by employees other than the defendant and distributed to a wider office audience.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The trial judge credited the defendant\u2019s claim that, in distributing the caricatures, \u201cit was not his intent to sway votes or to induce people not to vote for [the plaintiff],\u201d and that he sought to make the plaintiff \u201clook ridiculous.\u201d The trial judge also credited Heller\u2019s statement that he wanted \u201c[t]o make sure they wouldn\u2019t be seen by [the plaintiff],\u201d because they were \u201ca private satire among a select group of friends.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">When the plaintiff returned to the office from her campaign leave in November, 1987, she learned of the sexually explicit nature of the photocopies and their distribution throughout the office. The defendant made various allegations that the plaintiff harbored a desire for revenge, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>that she made various crude references to men in general and the defendant in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">The trial judge found that once the plaintiff saw the pictures she was \u201cshocked\u201d and experienced severe stress, crediting her testimony that she felt \u201cdegraded, publicly humiliated, and vulnerable upon seeing the photocopies; [and that] she also felt that the matter was too serious for her to remain silent.\u201d The judge also credited the testimony of an expert who explained the sequelae associated with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and opined that the plaintiff suffered from PTSD and that the trauma of being represented in the workplace in the compromising caricatures created by a coworker was the cause. According to the record, the plaintiff had to undergo, and still is undergoing, psychological therapy for PTSD. The trauma of the event had a negative impact on her ability to function as productively as she had for many years at her job.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The judge found that this trauma was unrelated to the plaintiff\u2019s loss in the union election.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">As a result of her distress about the photocopies, the plaintiff filed formal complaints with department administrators and the union. The department officials determined that the defendant\u2019s conduct was sexually harassing, reprimanded the defendant, and explained to the plaintiff that \u201cthe production and limited distribution of sexually explicit material by [the defendant] which contained a reproduction of your facial features . . . subjected [you] to highly improper and unacceptable behavior which constituted sexual harassment.\u201d The union trial board concluded that the defendant\u2019s conduct was unbecoming to a union member. The union\u2019s determination resulted in a public apology by the defendant to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Subsequently, the plaintiff filed her tort claims, and amended her complaint to add her statutory claims. The defendant filed counterclaims alleging the plaintiff had defamed him. The trial judge allowed the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the defendant\u2019s counterclaims. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>defendant did not appeal the disposition of his counterclaims. Those claims are not before us.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">II. <em>The plaintiff is neither a public figure nor a limited purpose public figure. </em>The trial judge ruled that the plaintiff was a public figure because she voluntarily became involved in the local union election. See <em>Hustler Magazine, Inc. </em>v. <em>Falwell, </em>486 U.S. 46 (1988). Whether the plaintiff is a public figure is a question of law. See <em>Wolston </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Ass\u2019n, </em>443 U.S. 157, 165-169 (1979); <em>Materia </em>v. <em>Huff, </em>394 Mass. 328, 331 (1985). The Supreme Court has said that an individual plaintiff\u2019s status is context-dependent and thus determined \u201cby looking to the nature and extent of an individual\u2019s participation in the particular controversy giving rise to the [tort liability].\u201d <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 352 (1974). \u201cAbsent clear evidence of general fame or notoriety in the community, and pervasive involvement in the affairs of society, an individual should not be deemed a public personality for all aspects of [her] life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The fame required for an individual to be a public figure for all purposes, as opposed to a limited purpose public figure, is very great; the individual must be a \u201chousehold name\u201d on a national scale. <em>Tavoulareas </em>v. <em>Piro, </em>817 F.2d 762, 772 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 870 (1987) (although plaintiff was \u201chighly prominent individual, especially in business cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>cles,\u201d he was not a general purpose public figure for \u201call aspects\" of his life where his \u201ccelebrity in society at large [did] not approach that of a well-known athlete or entertainer \u2014 apparently the archetypes of the general purpose public figure\u201d). The plaintiff clearly is not a general purpose public figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The Federal Courts of Appeal have developed various tests to aid judges in applying the two-prong limited purpose public figure standard set forth in <em>Gertz.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>See, e.g., <em>Clyburn </em>v. <em>News World Communications, Inc., </em>903 F.2d 29, 31 (D.C.Cir. 1990) (applying test for limited purpose public figure first set forth in <em>Waldbaum </em>v. <em>Fairchild Publications, Inc., </em>627 F.2d 1287, 1296-1298 [D.C. Cir.], cert. denied, 449 U.S. 898 [1980]: \u201c[1] that there have been a public controversy; [2] that the plaintiff have played a sufficiently central role in the controversy; and [3] that the alleged defamatory statement have been germane to the plaintiff\u2019s participation in the controversy\u201d);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Silvester </em>v. <em>American Broadcasting Cos., </em>839 F.2d 1491, 1493 (11th Cir. 1988) (adopting <em>Waldbaum </em>three-part limited purpose public figure test); <em>Lerman </em>v. <em>Flynt Distrib. Co., </em>745 F.2d 123, 136-137 (2d Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 471 U.S. 1054 (1985) (requiring a defendant to show that the plaintiff has: \u201c[1] successfully invited public attention to his views in an effort to influence others prior to the incident that is the subject of litigation; [2] voluntarily injected himself into a public controversy related to the subject of the litigation; [3] assumed a position of prominence in the public controversy; and [4] maintained regular and continuing access to the media\u201d); <em>Contemporary Mission, Inc. </em>v. <em>New York Times Co., </em>842 F.2d 612, 617 (2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Cir.), cert. denied sub nom. <em>O\u2019Reilly </em>v. <em>New York Times Co., </em>488 U.S. 856 (1988); <em>Bruno &amp; Stillman, Inc. </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>633 F.2d 583, 590 (1st Cir. 1980) (\u201cfirst task\u201d is to determine \u201cthe sort of public controversy referred to in <em>Gertz\u201d). </em>Courts must determine if there is a public controversy because of the \u201cprofound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it should include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\u201d <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 270 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">Because most cases involve media defendants reporting on controversies of interest to the public, the courts have had little difficulty in recognizing public controversies in most of the limited purpose public figure cases, and thus they have ruled that the plaintiffs had limited purpose public status. Of course, media attention does not alone transform a private controversy into a public one, <em>Time, Inc. </em>v. <em>Firestone, </em>424 U.S. 448 (1976), and the attention that a defendant\u2019s alleged wrong itself generates does not create a public controversy necessary for limited purpose public figure status. See <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Proxmire, </em>443 U.S. 111, 135 (1979) (\u201cClearly, those charged with defamation cannot, by their own conduct, create their own defense by making the claimant a public figure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The defendant does not claim that the election contest received any public attention. There was no basis for concluding the result of the election contest would be felt by persons who were not participants in the union election. The election in this case had no more public controversy than the usual election of a president of a social club or an election to the governing board of an educational institution, to the directorship of a corporation, or to the governing body of a condominium association (see, e.g., <em>Sewell </em>v. <em>Eubanks, </em>181 Ga. App. 545, 546 [1987]).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">The fact that the controversy was a union election does not provide an automatic basis for deciding for First Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>purposes that there was a public controversy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant makes no claim that Federal statutory or regulatory law preempts State tort law when a union election is involved. See <em>Old Dominion Branch No. 496, Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Letter Carriers </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>418 U.S. 264, 273 (1974); <em>Linn </em>v. <em>United Plant Guard Workers of Am., Local 114, </em>383 U.S. 53, 65 (1966); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 413 (1988). If all candidates for office in a union, particularly a union of State employees, are to be treated automatically as limited purpose public figures, the standard that courts have been following in determining that status will have to be abandoned. In sum, the plaintiff was not a limited purpose public figure because the circumstances did not involve a public controversy.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Even if the election had received some public attention, \u201c[a] private individual is not automatically transformed into a public figure just by becoming involved in or associated with a matter that attracts public attention.\u201d <em>Wolston </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Ass\u2019n, </em>443 U.S. 157, 167 (1979). \u201cIt is speech on \u2018matters of public concern\u2019 that is \u2018at the heart of the First Amendment\u2019s protection.\u2019. . . In contrast, speech on matters of purely private concern is of less First Amendment concern.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. </em>v. <em>Greenmoss Builders, Inc., </em>472 U.S. 749, 758-759 (1985). In <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, </em>the Supreme Court followed the stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>dard for determining whether an issue was of public concern set forth in <em>Connick </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 147-148 (1983) (\u201cWhether . . . speech addresses a matter of public concern must be determined by the [expression\u2019s] content, form, and context ... as revealed by the whole record\u201d), holding that a credit report was not of public concern. In addition, the Court noted that the report was available confidentially to only five subscribers and thus the information was not vital to \u201cthe free flow of commercial information.\u201d <em>Dun &amp; Bradstreet, supra </em>at 762. Thus, the Court concluded that no \u201cspecial protection\u201d was required for the credit reports \u201cto ensure that \u2018debate on public issues [will] be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The imposition of tort liability in circumstances where the record does not disclose a public controversy is not prohibited.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">The defendant argues that the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411 (2), provides the defendant, as a union member, with \u201cextraordinarily broad freedoms.\u201d We believe that the defendant mistakenly relies on decisions under the National Labor Relations Act, such as <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Local Union No. 815, United Textile Workers, </em>479 F. Supp. 613 (E.D. Tenn. 1979); and <em>Rollison </em>v. <em>Hotel, Motel, Restaurant, &amp; Constr. Camp Employees, Local 879, </em>677 F.2d 741 (9th Cir. 1982). The defendant does not argue that the statute is applicable. If the statute is not applicable, \u201c[t]he test for preemption of a tort claim is whether the [S]tote \u2018confers nonnegotiable [S]tote-law rights on employers or employees independent of any right estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>lished by contract, or, instead, whether evaluation of the tort claim is inextricably intertwined with consideration of the terms of the labor contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Young </em>v. <em>Anthony\u2019s Fish Grottos, Inc., </em>830 F.2d 993, 999 (9th Cir. 1987), quoting <em>Allis-Chalmers Corp. </em>v. <em>Lueck, </em>471 U.S. 202, 213 (1985). On this record, there is no union contract involved. The defendant does not assert that the plaintifFs tort claims are \u201cinextricably intertwined with the terms of the labor contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The record does not support any such claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">III. <em>Conclusion. </em>We conclude that the defendant\u2019s speech was not entitled to constitutional protection because there was no public controversy. Further, because the defendant did not intend to influence the union election, the imposition of liability for the defendant\u2019s speech does not chill constitutional rights of free speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The elements of a cause of action for reckless infliction of emotional distress are the same as those for intentional infliction of emotional distress. Thus, our discussion of the latter applies equally to the former cause of action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The plaintiff alleged that the defendant\u2019s actions violated her right to run for union office and her right to be free from sexual harassment. General Laws c. 12, \u00a7 111 (1992 ed.), provides in relevant part: \u201cAny person whose exercise or enjoyment of rights secured by the constitution or laws of the United States, or of rights secured by the constitution or laws of the commonwealth, has been interfered with, or attempted to be interfered with, as described in [ \u00a7] 11H, may institute and prosecute in his own name and on his own behalf a civil action for injunctive and other appropriate equitable relief as provided for in said section, including the award of compensatory money damages . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b537-9\">The defendant also claimed that the evidence was insufficient to support the judgment in the plaintiffs favor under the MCRA. The distribution of the two photocopies did not constitute a threat, intimidation, or coercion as defined by the MCRA. We vacate the judgment to the extent that it is based on any violation of the MCRA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Pursuant to the settlement agreement between the plaintiff and the department, the plaintiff no longer works for the department.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b540-6\">The defendant does not challenge the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact or the sufficiency of the evidence on the elements of the torts of intentional and reckless infliction of emotional distress. See <em>Boyle </em>v. <em>Wenk, </em>378 Mass. 592 (1979); <em>Agis </em>v. <em>Howard Johnson Co., </em>371 Mass. 140, 144-145 (1976). The judge found that the defendant\u2019s actions in creating and distributing the photocopies at work were extreme and outrageous, e.g., outside all reasonable bounds of civilized society, were aimed intentionally at causing, and actually did cause, the plaintiff severe emotional harm. We review the judge\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are clearly erroneous. See <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Freetown-Lakeville Regional Sch. Dist. Comm., </em>392 Mass. 656, 659 (1984); <em>Marlow </em>v. <em>New Bedford, </em>369 Mass. 501, 508 (1976). See also Mass. R. Civ. P. 52 (a), 365 Mass. 816 (1974). Conclusions of law are not set aside by a reviewing court unless inconsistent with applicable law. See <em>Powers, supra-, Marlow, supra. </em>We conclude that there is neither error of fact nor a mistake of law in the trial judge\u2019s findings and order on these tort claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b541-6\"><em>Gertz </em>established the two-pronged analysis to determine if an individual is a limited public figure.

Second, \u201cthe nature and extent of the individual\u2019s participation in the particular controversy\u201d must be ascertained. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>American Broadcasting Co., </em>684 F.2d 1208, 1218 (6th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1040 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b541-7\">On the view we take of the issues, we need not decide if the defendant\u2019s cartoons were germane to the plaintiffs participation in the union election.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The defendant does not argue that there was an issue of public concern in the union election.

I disagree with the court\u2019s holding that the plaintiff was not a limited purpose public figure because the union election was not a public controversy. I conclude that the plaintiff became a limited purpose public figure when she voluntarily thrust herself into the election campaign. I also conclude that the caricatures at issue addressed the plaintiff\u2019s campaign for the presidency, despite their horrid content. As a result, I would use the \u201cactual malice\u201d standard of liability in determining whether the plaintiff should recover on her claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Hustler Magazine, Inc. </em>v. <em>Falwell, </em>485 U.S. 46, 56 (1988). Thus, because the plaintiff has failed to prove that the caricatures contained a false statement of fact, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>In reviewing the trial judge\u2019s finding of liability on the plaintiff\u2019s claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, we must \u201cmake an independent examination of the whole record\u201d in order to ensure \u201cthat the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression.\u201d <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 285 (1964). Having reviewed the entire record, I am compelled to disagree with the court\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff was not a limited purpose public figure. This court decided precisely this issue in <em>Materia </em>v. <em>Huff, </em>394 Mass. 328 (1985), where we held that the plaintiff was a limited purpose public figure as a matter of law because he \u201cvoluntarily thrust himself into the controversy by campaigning for reelection to the position of secretary-treasurer of Local 526.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331. Nevertheless, today the court decides that an election campaign for the presidency of a union local is not a public controversy. In support of this decision the court states that \u201c[t]here was no basis for concluding [that] the result of the election contest would be felt by persons who were not participants in the union election.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 524. The court continues in this vein stating that \u201c[t]he election in this case had no more public controversy than the usual election of a president of a social club or an election to the governing board of an educational institution, to the directorship of a corporation, or to the governing body of a condominium association.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">These conclusions are in reference to the first prong of the three-part test for determining whether an individual is a limited purpose public figure, set forth in <em>Waldbaum </em>v. <em>Fairchild Publications, Inc., </em>627 F.2d 1287, 1297-1298 (D.C. Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 898 (1980). The first prong, which addresses the issue whether there is a public controversy, requires the reviewing court to \u201cask whether a reasonable person would have expected persons beyond the immediate participants in the dispute to feel the impact of its resolution. If the issue was being debated publicly and if it had foreseeable and substantial ramifications for non-participants, it was a public controversy.\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 1297.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>In my opinion, an election is the absolute paradigm of a public controversy. The \u201cimmediate participants\u201d in this union election campaign, the candidates, would not have been the only persons to have felt the impact of the election. Instead, the election would have had an effect on each of the 8,700 members of Local 509.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, the Supreme Court of the United States has stated repeatedly that the public has an interest in labor unions in general and in union elections in particular. See <em>Wirtz </em>v. <em>Local Union No. 125, Laborers\u2019 Int\u2019l Union of N. Am., </em>389 U.S. 477, 483 (1968) (noting that the public has an interest in labor union elections); <em>Wirtz </em>v. <em>Local 153, Glass Bottle Blowers Ass\u2019n of the U.S. &amp; Can., </em>389 U.S. 463, 475 (1968) (stating that \u201cCongress [has] emphatically asserted a vital public interest in assuring free and democratic union elections\u201d); <em>Thornhill </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>310 U.S. 88, 102-103 (1940) (stating that labor relations are not matters of mere local or private concern). See also <em>National Ass\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Employees </em>v. <em>National Fed\u2019n of Fed. Employees, </em>844 F.2d 216, 220 (5th Cir. 1988) (indicating that the labor union election campaigns are a matter of public concern). Based on this authority, I conclude that the election campaign for the presidency of Local 509 was a public controversy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The plaintiff, therefore, be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>came a limited purpose public figure when she voluntarily thrust herself into the election campaign for the presidency of Local 509.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See <em>Materia </em>v. <em>Huff, supra </em>at 331. See also <em>Jean </em>v. <em>Dugan, </em>20 F.3d 255, 262 n.7 (7th Cir. 1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Speech concerning a limited purpose public figure will qualify for the actual malice standard set forth in <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra </em>at 279-280, only if that speech addresses the public controversy into which the limited purpose public figure has voluntarily injected herself. See <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 351 (1974). See also <em>Waldbaum </em>v. <em>Fairchild Publications, Inc., </em>627 F.2d 1287, 1298 (D.C. Cir. 1980), (stating that the alleged defamation must have been \u201cgermane\u201d to the limited purpose public figure\u2019s participation in the controversy). If, however, the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>tested speech does not address the controversy into which the limited purpose public figure has thrust herself, then the States may impose liability \u201con a less demanding showing than that required by <em>New York Times Co. </em>[v. <em>Sullivan],\u201d </em>as long as they do not impose liability without fault. <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc., supra </em>at 347-348. \u201cWhether . . . speech addresses a matter of public concern must be determined by the content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record.\u201d <em>Connick </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 147-148 (1983). After reviewing the entire record and considering the content, form, and context of the caricatures, I am compelled to conclude that the speech in this case addressed a matter of public concern \u2014 the plaintiff\u2019s candidacy for the presidency of Local 509.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See <em>Connick </em>v. <em>Myers, supra </em>at 147-148. Although I find the content of the caricatures to be totally repulsive, even \u201cthe most repulsive speech enjoys immunity provided it falls short of a deliberate or reckless untruth.\u201d <em>Linn </em>v. <em>United Plant Guard Workers of Am., Local 114, </em>383 U.S. 53, 63 (1966). As a result, liability for intentional infliction of emotional distress should be imposed on the defendant only if the plaintiff can prove by clear and convincing evidence that the caricatures contained a false statement of fact and that the defendant had knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>edge of the falsity or had acted with reckless disregard of the truth. See <em>Hustler Magazine, Inc. </em>v. <em>Falwell, supra </em>at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">Even if the plaintiff was a private figure, despite her entering the election campaign for the presidency of Local 509, the actual malice standard remains the appropriate standard to use in this case. See <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Shiflett, </em>325 Md. 684, 728 (1992); <em>McKinnon </em>v. <em>Smith, 52 </em>Misc. 2d 349, 352 (N.Y. 1966). The Supreme Court of the United States has used the actual malice standard in free speech cases involving unions because \u201cfederal policies favor [ ] uninhibited, robust, and wide-open debate in labor disputes.\u201d <em>Old Dominion Branch No. 496, Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Letter Carriers </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>418 U.S. 264, 273 (1974) <em>(Letter Carriers). </em>The Supreme Court has recognized that \u201cexaggerated rhetoric was commonplace in labor disputes and protected by federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286. Therefore, in order to avoid \u201cunwarranted intrusion upon free discussion\u201d in labor disputes, the Court adopted by analogy the actual malice standard used in <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, supra </em>at 279-280. <em>Linn </em>v. <em>United Plant Guard Workers, supra </em>at 65. As a result, the Supreme Court held that Federal labor policy preempts State libel actions for defamatory statements, made in the course of a labor dispute, which were published without knowledge of their falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth. See <em>id. </em>Subsequently, in <em>Letter Carriers, </em>the Supreme Court rejected the argument that the actual malice standard applied only in the context of a labor-management dispute or a representation campaign. See <em>Letter Carriers, supra </em>at 278-279.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Instead, the Supreme Court reasoned that \u201capplication [of the actual malice standard] of <em>Linn </em>[v. <em>United Plant Guard </em>Workers] must turn on whether the defamatory publication is made in a context <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>where the policies of the federal labor laws leading to protection for freedom of speech are significantly implicated.\u201d <em>Letter Carriers, supra </em>at 279.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">In the present case, the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) is the relevant federal law because the controversy arose in the context of union officer elections.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Petersen </em>v. <em>Dole, </em>956 F.2d 1219, 1223 (D.C. Cir. 1992); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481 (1988). \u201c[T]he [LMRDA\u2019s] overriding objective was to ensure that unions would be democratically governed, and responsive to the will of the union membership as expressed in open, periodic elections.\u201d <em>Finnegan </em>v. <em>Leu, </em>456 U.S. 431, 441 (1982). Congress \u201crecognized that democracy would be assured only if union members are free to discuss union policies and criticize the leadership without fear of reprisal. Congress also recognized that this freedom is particularly critical, and deserves vigorous protection, in the context of election campaigns. For it is in elections that members can wield their power, and directly express their approval or disapproval of the union leadership.\u201d <em>United Steelworkers of Am. </em>v. <em>Sadlowski, </em>457 U.S. 102, 112 (1982). Thus, a claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, in the context of a union election, implicates the same federal labor policies leading to the protection of freedom of speech as in <em>Linn </em>v. <em>United Plant Guard Workers, supra </em>at 65, and <em>Letter Carriers, supra </em>at 279. See <em>Henry </em>v. <em>National Ass\u2019n of Air Traffic Specialists, </em>836 F. Supp. 1204, 1211 (D. Md. 1993), aff'd without opinion, 34 F.3d 1066 (4th Cir. 1994); <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Duke, </em>116 Ariz. 298, 300-301 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>By imposing an outrageousness standard on union election speech, today\u2019s decision will permit a candidate for a union office to seek damages for emotional distress from fellow union members who \u201csay naughty things during [election campaigns].\u201d <em>Linn </em>v. <em>United Plant Guard Workers, supra </em>at 67 (Black, J., dissenting). The Supreme Court has recognized the dangerously chilling effect of such a standard on free speech stating that \u201c \u2018[o]utrageousness\u2019 in the area of political and social discourse has an inherent subjectiveness about it which would allow a jury to impose liability on the basis of the jurors\u2019 tastes or views, or perhaps on the basis of their dislike of a particular expression. An \u2018outrageousness\u2019 standard thus runs afoul of our longstanding refusal to allow damages to be awarded because the speech in question may have an adverse emotional impact on the audience.\u201d <em>Hustler Magazine, Inc. </em>v. <em>Falwell, supra </em>at 55. It is unavoidable, therefore, that the court\u2019s imposition of an outrageousness standard will chill protected speech in the context of a union election. See L. Tribe, American Constitutional Law \u00a7 13-26, at 1131-1132 (1988). Thus, to provide \u201cadequate \u2018breathing space\u2019 to the freedoms protected by the First Amendment,\u201d the actual malice standard is the appropriate standard to use in the context of a union election. <em>Hustler Magazine, Inc. </em>v. <em>Falwell, supra </em>at 56. See <em>Beruan </em>v. <em>French, </em>56 Cal. App. 3d 825, 828-829 (1976) (stating that labor union operates like a system of government and strong policies favor the full exercise of the right to free speech in union election campaigns).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">Where the actual malice standard applies, the <em>\u201csine qua non </em>of recovery ... is the existence of falsehood.\u201d <em>Letter Carriers, supra </em>at 283. In the present case, the plaintiff has not proved that the caricatures contained a false statement of fact. Accordingly, I dissent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Under the actual malice standard, the plaintiff must prove that the speech was false and that the speaker either had knowledge of the falsity or had acted with reckless disregard of the truth.

As employees of the State, their salaries were paid with State tax dollars. The court\u2019s comparison, therefore, between a union election and an election in a social club or the governing body of a condominium association is particularly ill conceived in this case. Both a social club and a condominium association are purely private organizations created to protect the private entertainment or the private property interests of their members.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b547-6\">If, however, the election was not a public controversy in relation to the public at large, it was certainly a public controversy in relation to the members of Local 509. See <em>Materia </em>v. <em>Huff, supra </em>at 331 (stating that \u201cthe plaintiffs status as a public figure is determined in relation to those [union] members, rather than to the community at large\u201d); <em>Walko </em>v. <em>Kean College of N.J., </em>235 N.J. Super. 139, 152 (1988) (deciding that a college administrator was a public figure within the college community). Indeed, the plaintiff had communicated directly with many of the members of Lo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>cal 509 while campaigning for the presidency. In 1987, the plaintiff spent a total of forty-five days visiting most of the four hundred union work sites throughout the State. She also mailed thousands of campaign postcards to the homes of members of Local 509. Thus, it is clear that the plaintiff enjoyed broad access to channels of communication in her effort to generate support for her campaign. See <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 345 (1974) (stating that a plaintiff\u2019s access to channels of effective communication is an important consideration in determining whether he is a public figure).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Many other courts have concluded that union officers are limited public figures.

He testified that he \u201cwas trying to state that [the plaintiff\u2019s] statements during the campaign were ridiculous.\u201d The defendant stated also that the caricatures \u201cwere the most absurd pictures that I could think of, and [the plaintiff\u2019s] views were the most absurd I could think of.\u201d In addition, the defendant stated that \u201c[t]he picture was not to be of any sexual nature, except of [the plaintiff] as a political candidate.
