SCHEINDLIN, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b417-17\">I. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b417-18\">Dave Tonneson purchased vacant land along scenic Route 9W near the Hudson River as an investment. After discovering that the drinking water wells on the property had been contaminated with the gasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether (\u201cMTBE\u201d), Tonneson sued the corporation that owned a nearby Sunoco gasoline station seeking various forms of relief including compensatory and punitive damages.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendants Sunoco, Inc. and Sunoco, Inc. (R <em>&amp; </em>M) now \u201crequests that the Court grant summary judgment dismissing all of Tonneson\u2019s claims and causes of action regarding the 2.2-acre parcel of vacant land....\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-19\">For the reasons that follow, defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-20\">II. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b417-21\">The following facts are presented in the light most favorable to Tonneson.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Tonne-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>son purchased vacant property along Route 9W and intended to develop it into a \u201c28-unit townhouse project using modular homes.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cModular homes are- pre-manu-factured homes that are delivered to the building site via truck, and placed on the home site with a crane.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cTonneson has more than 12 years of experience using modular homes, and was, in fact, the only builder approved by the modular home manufacturer to pick up and set his own modular homes.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">In April 2003, two wells developed by Tonneson to provide drinking water for the modular homes were sampled for MTBE. \u201cMTBE was detected in Well No. 1 at 190 ppb and Well No. 2 at 2,200 ppb.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Tonneson then attempted to find an alternative source of water for the proposed townhouses \u201cincluding Town of Highlands municipal or well water from another townhouse development nearby called Corbin Hills.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cAfter these efforts were unsuccessful, Tonneson reached an agreement with the adjacent residential property developer, Corbin Hills, to sell the property.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cThe final purchase price, and completion of the contract, is contingent upon Tonneson obtaining final approval for the townhouse project from the Town of Highlands planning board.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">In the complaint, Tonneson asserted the following claims against defendants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-12\">(1) design defect,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-13\">(2) negligence,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-14\">(3) trespass,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-15\">(4) nuisance,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-16\">(5) intentional interference with right to appropriate,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-17\">(6) violation of section 349 of New York General Business Law,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-18\">(7) outrageous conduct causing the infliction of emotional distress, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-19\">(8) various violations of article 12 of the New York State Navigation Law.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-20\">If Tonneson proves these claims to a jury by a preponderance of the evidence, Tonneson seeks the following relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-21\">(1) compensatory damages,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-22\">(2) punitive damages,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-23\">(3) declaratory judgment,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWM\">(4) fees incurred in pursuing this action,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ae7\">(5) any other relief as may be deemed necessary, just and proper by the Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-25\">III. DEFENDANTS\u2019 MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT IS DENIED</p>\n<p id=\"b418-26\">Defendants have moved for summary judgment under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-27\">The judgment sought should be rendered if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>davits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">The key issue on a summary judgment motion is whether \u201cthe evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court has explained, \u201cthe plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Defendants argue that summary judgment should be granted in their favor for three reasons. <em>First, </em>\u201cTonneson has suffered no cognizable injury due to MTBE and any lost profits are not \u2018directly traceable\u2019 to Sunoco....\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Second, </em>\u201c[t]he Court should grant Sunoco summary judgment on all claims relating to the Property because ... the evidence of lost profits is too speculative to be tried ...\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Third, </em>\u201cneither the Property itself nor any reasonably specific claim of lost profits are mentioned in the Complaint, and the claim was time-barred when Tonneson first raised it.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-14\">A. Tonneson Has Suffered a Cognizable Injury Directly Traceable to Defendants</p>\n<p id=\"b419-15\">While defendants argue that plaintiffs have not suffered a \u201ccognizable injury,\u201d this argument has no merit. A reasonable jury could find that property with drinking wells that have been contaminated with MTBE is worth less than property with drinking wells that have not been contaminated. \u201cThe turpentine-like taste and odor of MTBE ... can make such drinking water unacceptable to consumers.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Studies have also shown that inhalation and exposure to MTBE causes cancer in animals and it may cause cancer in humans such as leukemia and lymphoma.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-16\">Moreover, the injury to Tonneson\u2019s property is directly traceable to the gas station owned by Sunoco, Inc. and Sunoco, Inc. (R &amp; M). Plaintiffs allege that defendants stored gasoline containing MTBE in underground storage tanks.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u201cIn October 1999, Sunoco removed an old underground fuel storage tank from its Port Montgomery gas station and discovered certain petroleum contaminants in the soil and groundwater surrounding the tank.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u201cAfter detecting MTBE in the station well, Sunoco\u2019s consultants tested residential wells in the surrounding area, revealing MTBE concentrations in forty-one potable wells [near the station].\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> \u201cThe Sunoco <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>station closed in October 2002.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">This evidence is more than sufficient for a reasonable jury to find that Tonneson has suffered a cognizable injury directly traceable to defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">B. A Reasonable Jury Could Return a Verdict for Tonneson</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Defendants argue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b420-7\">In New York, lost profits arising from the development of real property may be recovered only if the injured party can establish to a reasonable certainty that the prospective development would have been profitable. This rule accords with the general principle that \u201cconsequences which are contingent, speculative or merely possible are not proper to be considered in estimating ... damages and may not be proved.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcI\">\u201cSummary Judgment is appropriate on Tonneson\u2019s lost profit claims,\u201d defendants argue, \u201cbecause his alleged damages are too speculative as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">The problem with defendants\u2019 argument is that lost profits are merely a way of measuring compensatory damages \u2014 there is no such thing as a \u201clost profit claim.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> I have previously emphasized the difference between a plaintiffs claims and the various forms of relief that may be awarded.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> This distinction is important because \u201cRule 56 was designed to provide a mechanism by which unsupportable <em>claims </em>can be terminated before trial.\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark> A \u201cclaim\u201d is the legal theory under which relief is sought.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> \u201cA single claim may support multiple types of relief, including declaratory judgments, injunctions, compensatory damages, and punitive damages.\u201d <footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-15\">A simple question can be asked when determining whether a party has properly identified a claim: What common law or statute did the defendants allegedly violate? For example, New York common law prohibits negligence and trespass. Thus, plaintiffs may bring negligence and trespass claims against defendants in their complaints. Likewise, New York General Business Law \u00a7 349 prohibits \u201c[deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any business, trade or commerce or in the furnishing of any service.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> It would be proper to refer to a \u201cSection 349 claim\u201d or even, for the sake of ease, \u201ca deceptive act claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-16\">But there is no such thing as a \u201cpunitive damage claim,\u201d a \u201cdeclaratory relief claim,\u201d a \u201cres ipsa <em>loquitur </em>claim,\u201d or a \u201cmarket share liability claim\u201d \u2014 all of which have been referred to at various times in this multidistrict litigation \u2014 because it makes no sense to say that the law prohibits them. \u201cPunitive damages are a monetary remedy 'aimed at deterrence and ret<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>ribution,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> while \u201cdeclaratory relief is not a claim but only a remedy that Congress has created so that the court \u2018may declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party... ,\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <em>Res ipsa loquitur </em>is \u201conly an evidentiary method of proving negligence,\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and \u201c[mjarket share liability is an evidentiary tool that allows a plaintiff to prove causation, which is an element of a claim.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">The law does not prohibit lost profits. Rather, determining lost profits is one method that juries use to place plaintiffs in the same position that they would have been had defendants not violated the law\u2014 <em>ie., </em>award compensatory damages. Thus, a plaintiff may not bring, and defendants may not move for summary judgment on, \u201clost profit claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">A review of the complaint shows that the claims brought by Tonneson are straightforward: (1) design defect, (2) negligence, (3) trespass, (4) nuisance, (5) intentional interference with right to appropriate, (6) violation of section 349 of New York General Business Law, (7) outrageous conduct causing the infliction of emotional distress, and (8) various violations of article 12 of the New York State Navigation Law. If a jury finds that Tonneson has proven one or more of these claims (ie., defendants violated the law), the next question will be what relief should be awarded to Tonne-son.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">\u201cEstablishing the appropriate measure of damages for injuries suffered from environmental conditions on neighboring land <em>is separate and distinct from offering the requisite proof of the underlying claim. </em>\u2019<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> <em>\u201cA </em>court may award property damages to address necessary restoration and repairs, lost rental value or property devaluation, depending on the type of action brought and the specific facts and circumstances of the case.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> \u201cThere are many ways, however, to determine the proper measure of damages for wrongful occupation of property, and courts are very flexible in choosing a measure of recovery which is most appropriate to the particular facts of the case.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b421-14\">In this case, defendants have focused on one way that the Court may instruct the jury to award compensatory damages, referred to plaintiffs\u2019 claims as \u201clost profit claims\u201d and now move for summary judgment under Rule 56. However, the tactic of \u201crewriting the complaint\u201d or presenting new \u201cclaims\u201d is one that courts properly reject.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Once defendants\u2019 misrepresentation of Tonneson\u2019s claims is corrected, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>becomes obvious that the summary judgment motion must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Tonneson must establish that he was harmed in order to prove certain claims, such as design defect and negligence. Yet defendants concede that Tonneson was harmed if only because they contend that he could simply install a treatment system to filter the drinking water.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Thus, even under defendants\u2019 theory, Tonneson should be compensated by an amount equivalent to purchasing and maintaining a treatment system. For this reason alone, defendants have failed to demonstrate that a reasonable jury must return a verdict in their favor.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Moreover, defendants\u2019 argument that plaintiffs should only receive compensatory damages equivalent to the cost of a filtration system assumes that purchasers of modular homes would place the same value on a home with a treatment system that filters MTBE out of the drinking water as a home with uncontaminated drinking water. If the jury finds that this assumption is not true, then Tonneson would have been harmed by the decrease in the price due to the MTBE contamination that people are now willing to pay for modular homes on the property.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Tonneson has testified that he was harmed by the profits that he lost as a result of the contamination. His deposition testimony relies heavily on his twelve years of experience using modular homes for residential construction projects in Ft. Montgomery.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> \u201cTonneson had, in fact, already sought preliminary cost estimates from the manufacturer of the modular townhouses that he intended to use to develop this property.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> He also reviewed current price sheets for other modular homes in the area when confirming his costs estimates. Tonneson took into consideration that the townhouses and condominiums completed by Corbin Hills adjacent to Tonneson\u2019s property sold in 2002 and 2003 for prices ranging from approximately $250,000 to $330,000.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Finally, Tonneson estimates that he would have received \u201ca gross income of about 12,000,-000 to 12,600,000 in sales.\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Extrapolating from these numbers, Tonneson estimates that he would have sold his twenty-eight modular homes for, on average, approximately $428,000 to $450,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-11\">Defendants argue that Tonneson is trying to \u201cshoot the moon\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> \u2014 that is, run up his estimate of damages. It is certainly true that in this case, as in all cases, plaintiff has an incentive to exaggerate the harm that he suffered now that he is involved in litigation.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Indeed, a strong cross-examination of Tonneson will undoubtedly reveal the weaknesses in his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">But at this stage, I cannot resolve disputes over a witness\u2019s credibility. \u201cCredi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>bility determinations, the weighing of the evidence, and the drawing of legitimate inferences from the facts are jury functions, not those of a judge, whether [she] is ruling on a motion for summary judgment or for a directed verdict.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> All of the evidence and all inferences from that evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to Tonneson.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">In this case, the jury will be instructed that the goal of compensatory damages is to place the plaintiff in the same position he would have occupied had the wrongful conduct not occurred. In so doing, the jury will be allowed to consider, <em>inter alia, </em>the profits that Tonneson argues that he lost once his property was contaminated with MTBE. In sum, the evidence is sufficient for Tonneson to prove his claims and it is the jury\u2019s responsibility to determine the harm to the value of Tonneson\u2019s property if it awards compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">C. Defendants Received Fair Notice of Plaintiffs\u2019 Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Defendants\u2019 final argument is that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-7\">The Complaint does not articulate any facts necessary to support Tonneson\u2019s claim for lost profit damages relating to the Property, and thereby fails to meet even the lenient pleading standards of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8. Because of this failure, Sunoco was denied the requisite fair notice of Tonneson\u2019s lost profits claim, and the claim is not properly before the Court. Sunoco is therefore entitled to summary judgment dismissing the claim from this action.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AFP\">There are at least three problems with this argument. <em>First, </em>as explained above, plaintiffs have not alleged a \u201clost profit claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-14\"><em>Second, </em>Rule 56 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-15\">The judgment sought should be rendered if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-16\">Under the plain language of the rule, defendants may move for summary judgment on the ground that the evidence is so weak that a reasonable jury could not render a judgment in plaintiffs favor and thus \u201cthe movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> However, Rule 56 does not allow a court to dismiss claims for lack of notice.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-17\"><em>Third, </em>even if the defendants had made this motion under Rule 8 at the beginning of the litigation, dismissal would still be inappropriate because the Federal Rules do not require a plaintiff to specify the relief sought in the complaint. As Judge Posner has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-18\">Although Rule 8(a)(3) of the civil rules requires that a complaint contain \u2018a demand for judgment for the relief the pleader seeks,\u2019 the demand is not itself a part of the plaintiffs claim, and so failure to specify relief to which the plaintiff was entitled would not warrant dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) (dismissal for failure to state a claim).<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-19\">\u201cAny doubt on this score is dispelled by Rule 54(c), which provides that a prevailing party may obtain any relief to which he\u2019s entitled even if he has not demanded such relief in his pleadings.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-20\">Rule 54(c) states in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>A default judgment must not differ in kind from, or exceed in amount, what is demanded in the pleadings. Every other final judgment should grant the relief to which each party is entitled, <em>even if the party has not demanded that relief in its </em>pleadings.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">Under the plain language of the Federal Rules, a party does not need to demand a particular form of relief in the complaint <em>(ie., </em>the pleadings). It is sufficient for the plaintiff to give notice of her claims and state that she is seeking relief as may be deemed necessary, just and proper by the Court <em>(ie., </em>relief to which the party is entitled). Tonneson\u2019s complaint satisfies these requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">For the reasons above, defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment is denied. The Clerk of the Court is directed to close this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-10\">.
