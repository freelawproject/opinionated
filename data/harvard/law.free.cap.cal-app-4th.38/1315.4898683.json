J.</author>\n<p id=\"AaR\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Wims </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 293 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 241, 895 P.2d 77] our Supreme Court examined both the nature of the sentence enhancement for personal use of a deadly or dangerous weapon required by Penal Code section 12022, subdivision (b), and also the standard for reviewing instructional error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this case we undertake the same examination for personal use of a firearm, the subject of section 12022.5, subdivision (a) (hereinafter section 12022.5(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">One of the ways in which a firearm can be used is \u201cto display [it] in a menacing manner.\u201d (\u00a7 1203.06, subd. (b)(3).) We read this language to mean that a defendant has personally used a firearm by a menacing display only if that display was intentional. Although the jury in this case was not so instructed, under the standard of <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818 [299 P.2d 243], on the facts of this case we conclude that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">All of the charges arose out of a domestic dispute between defendant Michael Dee Johnson and his wife, Teresa, on May 18, 1992. The couple\u2019s infant daughter Meagan and two older children stayed with defendant when, in anticipation of a separation and without warning, Teresa left about a week earlier. During that week Teresa appears to have stayed nearby with a friend, and to have used methamphetamine, although the details of her usage are not certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">Teresa returned to the house on May 18 to have dinner with defendant. The meeting was stressful. As Teresa moved to leave, a heated argument developed, in part over custody of Meagan. Once Teresa walked out of the house with the children, defendant \u201cflipped out.\u201d He disabled Teresa\u2019s car, took Meagan from her arms, and went back into the house. Teresa followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-11\">About the time defendant was \u201cscreaming at me that we would all be better off dead if we couldn\u2019t be together,\u201d Teresa noticed that defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>a gun in his trousers. Once inside the house, defendant pushed Teresa into a chair, knelt on the floor, and put his upper body on her lap so that she could not rise. Holding Meagan in one arm, the gun in his other hand, defendant repeated his \u201cbetter off dead\u201d statement. He called to the other children to come into the house, but Teresa told them to stay in the car. Defendant held the gun \u201clike you would hold it to shoot,\u201d and pointed it in Teresa\u2019s direction if not actually at her. Defendant was \u201csaying that he was going to kill me.\u201d According to Teresa, \u201cit was made very clear to me that he wanted to shoot me.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Seeing a neighbor, Teresa yelled that defendant \u201chad a gun, and . . . was going to kill us\u201d and asked that police be called. Telling Teresa that he was \u201cgoing to kill himself,\u201d defendant got up, went into another room with Meagan, and \u201che said I could pick her up out of a pool of blood.\u201d Hearing sirens, defendant \u201cstarted yelling . . . now I had done it, that there was going to be a shoot out if the police came.\u201d Refusing Teresa\u2019s pleas for Meagan, defendant told her \u201cthe police wouldn\u2019t shoot . . . if he had the baby with him.\u201d When the sirens stopped, defendant \u201cpushed Meagan at me, and I took her and ran out of the house.\u201d During this entire episode defendant kept the gun in his hand \u201cas if he was going to fire it.\u201d Teresa told a group of officers what had happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">Defendant was arrested after complying with the officers\u2019 order to come out of the house. Asked about a gun, defendant responded that he \u201cthrew it in the river.\u201d The gun, partially loaded, was found secreted in the laundry area at the rear of the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Defendant testified that he begged Teresa not to leave, but he did not restrain her from doing so except for not allowing her to take Meagan with her. According to defendant, what he. did was \u201cI asked [Teresa] to sit down, and I put my hand on her shoulder, . . . and I put Meagan in her lap, and I kneeled down in front of her.\u201d \u201cI was kind of halfway in her lap, I guess.\u201d Teresa sat in the chair only a minute or so, and was not held down. As for the gun, defendant \u201ckept it at my side\u201d and pointed at the floor; it was never pointed at his wife. Defendant did not load the gun until the officers had arrived and Teresa and Meagan had left the house. He quickly decided \u201cthis is stupid,\u201d abandoned the gun, and surrendered to the waiting officers. He did admit that he got the gun after he had disabled Teresa\u2019s vehicle, but intended only to use it to end his own life. He did not threaten to kill Teresa or Meagan, only himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">Having heard this evidence a jury found defendant guilty as charged of felony child endangerment (former \u00a7 273a, subd. (1)), felony false imprisonment (\u00a7\u00a7 236-237), and being a past-convicted felon in possession of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>firearm (\u00a7 12021). The jury found that defendant had personally used a firearm in the commission of these offenses (\u00a7 12022.5(a)). The jury found defendant not guilty of the charged offense of assault with a firearm, but guilty of the lesser offense of brandishing a firearm (\u00a7 417, subd. (b)). Finally, the jury found true an allegation that defendant had a prior serious felony conviction (\u00a7 667, subd. (a)). After the trial court sentenced him to state prison for an aggregate term of 12 years, defendant perfected this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Review</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">I-V<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">Section 12022.5(a) specifies additional punishment for \u201cany person who personally uses a firearm in the commission or attempted commission of a felony.\u201d A defendant is entitled to proper jury instructions regarding the meaning of a weapon use enhancement, particularly the concept of personal use. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wims, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 303.) Section 1203.06, subdivision (b)(3) states that personal use means \u201cto display a firearm in a menacing manner, to intentionally fire it, or to intentionally strike or hit a human being with it.\u201d The lack of parallelism in the language of the section is the source of defendant\u2019s claim. Did the Legislature, by omitting the adverb \u201cintentionally\u201d before \u201cto display . . . in a menacing manner\u201d mean to provide that there is no intent required for display as distinguished from the intent required for use by firing or use by striking?</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">The definition of personal use given in section 1203.06 has been accepted as applicable to section 12022.5(a) and has been incorporated in CALJIC No. 17.19, which was given to the jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Cory </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 1094, 1104 [204 Cal.Rptr. 117] and decisions cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">Defendant argues that CALJIC No. 17.19 thus has a major gap: it makes no mention of the mental state which must accompany the menacing display <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>variety of personal use. Thus, defendant maintains that the trial court has a sua sponte duty to modify the instruction by describing the requisite mental state. We agree with defendant\u2019s position and hold that personal use by menacing display, just as with firing or striking, must be done intentionally and that the jury must be instructed accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">The Attorney General contends that because enhancement statutes such as section 12022.5(a) do not create crimes they have no scienter requirement beyond that required to commit the underlying offense. Our Supreme Court in <em>Wims </em>held that an enhancement is a mere \u201csentencing factor\u201d or \u201cpenalty provision,\u201d but \u201cnot a substantive crime\u201d which would trigger a defendant\u2019s federal right to trial by jury. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wims, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th 293, 304-309.) The Attorney General\u2019s argument goes beyond the holding of <em>Wims. </em>The Legislature can certainly establish a valid enhancement which does not have a mental element. But the converse is equally true\u2014the Legislature can establish a valid enhancement which <em>does </em>have a mental element.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">In <em>Wims </em>our Supreme Court concluded that in order to find true a personal use enhancement under section 12022, subdivision (b) a fact finder must conclude that, during the crime or attempted crime, the defendant <em>\u201cintentionally </em>displayed in a menacing manner or struck someone with an instrument capable of inflicting great bodily injury or death.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wims, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 302, italics added.) The court went on to note that: \u201cThe evidence did not permit a conclusion that [defendant] displayed a knife <em>without a menacing </em>intent.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 316, italics added.) We need do nothing more than apply the same reasoning to a virtually identical statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">The scope of our inquiry is concerned only with defendant\u2019s use of a firearm in the commission of the felony false imprisonment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The relevant evidence is essentially undisputed. Defendant testified that he got the gun and stuck it in his pants when Teresa began leaving with the children. Defendant prevented that departure. With her car disabled and her daughter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>grabbed by an obviously agitated defendant, Teresa had little choice but to follow him back into the house. Once he, Teresa, and Meagan were back inside the house, defendant moved the gun to his hand. Whether the gun was loaded or operable is irrelevant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nelums </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 355, 359 [182 Cal.Rptr. 515, 644 P.2d 201].) The gun was in defendant\u2019s hand while he knelt beside Teresa and again asked her to stay. Clearly it was seen by Teresa. Its proximity to her infant daughter would effectively stifle any impulse Teresa might have had to escape. As shown by both her testimony and that of her neighbor, Teresa was terrified of what defendant might do with the gun. That fear, for herself and her daughter, effectively glued Teresa to her chair. No other purpose could be served by defendant moving the gun from his waistband to his hand. In short, the gun would and did ensure that Teresa became a captive audience to defendant\u2019s renewed pleas for her not to leave. If defendant did point the gun at Teresa or threaten its actual use, these circumstances would only be further constraints holding Teresa in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">In light of this record, there is no reasonable probability that a properly instructed jury would conclude that defendant did not use a firearm\u2014in short that defendant\u2019s moving the gun from his pants\u2019 waistband to his hand was an intentional act of menacing display of the gun.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wims, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p 316.)</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">The felony child endangerment conviction is reversed. The personal use enhancement to the firearm possession charge is stricken. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">Perley, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and Reardon, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">Petitions for a rehearing were denied November 1, 1995, and the petitions of both appellant and respondent for review by the Supreme Court were denied January 18, 1996.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b901-12\">Statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b903-11\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1315.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b903-12\">The jury here was instructed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7\">\u201cIt is alleged in Counts 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4 that the defendant personally used a firearm during the commission of the crimes charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANv\">\u201cIf you find the defendant guilty of one or more of the crimes charged, you must determine whether the defendant personally used a firearm in the commission of such felonies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZt\">\u201cThe word \u2018firearm\u2019 includes a pistol.
