J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7J\">In 1965, an extensive investigation by the grand jury for the City and County of San Francisco resulted in the indictment of Russell L. Wolden, the assessor thereof, on multiple counts charging his criminal misconduct in office. Four San Francisco taxpayers thereafter commenced this action in the form of a taxpayers\u2019 suit against the City and County, its board of supervisors (as such and as the board of equalization), and against Wolden as the assessor, seeking a writ of mandate to require official action addressed to the situation brought about by Wolden\u2019s activities in office as disclosed by the grand jury investigation. In 1 Civil 24553, defendants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeal from a judgment directing issuance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>of a writ of mandate substantially as prayed (hereinafter the \u201cmain judgment\u201d), from a judgment awarding petitioners their attorneys\u2019 fees, and other orders. In 1 Civil 25160, defendants appeal from an order which was entered after the main judgment and which spelled out certain specific standards to be followed by defendants in complying with the peremptory writ of mandate issued pursuant thereto.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">On both appeals, the parties have literally inundated this court with written arguments (their printed briefs, with appendices, run to 'an aggregate length of 1,500 pages) whose sheer volume will require extensive discussion on the appeals\u2019 merits. Despite this prospect, we first find it necessary\u2014because the remedy successfully exercised by petitioners is novel both in concept and application\u2014to describe the action and the main judgment in some detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">The trial court entered the main judgment as a judgment on the pleadings. The latter (the petition for writ of mandate and an answer thereto filed by the City and County and by its respective boards) are too long and complicated<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to permit summarizing them here and, as will appear, this is not necessary. We note at this point, however, that the petition set forth these pertinent allegations among others:</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Each of the four petitioners was a \u201ccitizen resident\u201d of San Francisco and the owner of property therein which, during the three years preceding commencement of the action, had been annually assessed by the assessor thereof and upon which each had paid the property taxes \u201cso assessed.\u201d The assessor during said period was Russell L. Wolden, upon whom various constitutional and statutory provisions imposed certain specified duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">The petition further alleged the fact of the 1965 investigation of Wolden by the grand jury (referring to it by the grand jury\u2019s title of \u201cIn the Matter of the Investigation of Russell L. Wolden\u201d); that the grand jury had received therein \u201csworn testimony of 25 witnesses, . . . which testimony is reflected\u201d in a 750-page grand jury transcript; and that, acting upon such testimony, the grand jury had indicted Wolden on \u201cten counts of bribery and one count of conspiracy.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>The petition incorporated the 1965 grand jury transcript by reference. This was followed by extensive allegations which were explicitly \u201cbased upon\u201d the grand jury testimony (in effect, they summarized it), and which recounted a course of conduct by Wolden, as the San Francisco assessor, wherein he accorded preferential assessment treatment to certain property taxpayers who bribed him to do so.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">The petition for writ of mandate was filed on February 23, 1966. In response thereto and on the same day, the trial court issued an alternative writ of mandate directed to the various defendants and returnable on March 7. Prior to the return date, the City and County and the two boards (i.e., the board of supervisors as such and as the board of equalization) filed (1) a written objection to \u201cany offer, and to the receipt, in evidence\u201d of the 1965 grand jury transcript, upon the ground that it contained \u201cinadmissible hearsay\u201d; (2) a general demurrer to the petition for writ of mandate; (3) notice of a motion to strike those portions thereof which incorporated the 1965 grand jury transcript and which alleged Wolden\u2019s misconduct based upon the transcript\u2019s contents; and (4) their answer to the petition. Wolden did not join in these pleadings, nor did he personally plead in the action at any time.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>At several hearings (commencing on the March 7 return date), the trial court, among other things, denied a motion for continuance of the cause until after Wolden\u2019s then-pending criminal prosecution had been concluded; overruled the general demurrer to the petition; and denied the motion to strike those portions thereof which incorporated the 1965 grand jury transcript and reiterated its contents. The court finally stated that, in its view, the material allegations of the petition had been admitted by the answering defendants; that the court would therefore enter judgment on the pleadings ordering issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate as prayed; and that it would retain jurisdiction of the cause. These proceedings were followed by entry of the main judgment, and issuance of the peremptory writ of mandate pursuant thereto, on March 28, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\n<em>The Main Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">In the main judgment the trial court made detailed \u201cdeterminations\u201d which included both findings of material fact<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and recitals of matters of law. In them, the court accurately summarized the material allegations of the petition which had not been denied by the answering defendants; for this reason, and because we hereinafter recite the substance of the \u201cdeterminations,\u201d we need not summarize the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Under \u201cdeterminations\u201d sounding in terms of fact, the judgment stated that the grand jury investigation of Wolden had occurred in 1965; that the transcript thereof, as incorporated in the petition by reference, contained \u201creasonable information\u201d which showed that the City and County had lost property tax revenues because of unassessed or underassessed properties; that such information constituted reasonable cause for an immediate \u201cinvestigation, inquiry and examination\u201d to be made by the board of supervisors, with the cooperation of the assessor\u2019s office and with the assistance of experts to be employed by the board, of \u201cproperties of San Francisco taxpayers\u201d which may have been improperly underassessed or not assessed; and that such project would, in reasonable probability, \u201clead to the discovery of substantial escaped assessments and properties which have escaped assessment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">In other \u201cdeterminations,\u201d the judgment stated that none of the defendants, despite proper demands made upon them, had acted in the situation at hand; that the reason for inaction by the City and County and the board of supervisors, as asserted by their counsel<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (that they desired to await the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>conclusion of Wolden\u2019s criminal prosecution so as not to prejudge his guilt of the crimes charged therein), did not justify delay; that, because of the commencement of the new assessment year on March 7, 1966 (the current lien date), and applicable statutes of limitation, the City and County had already suffered \u201cirreparable loss\u201d from such inaction to date; and that the assessor\u2019s present engagement in the assessment of personal property, and the impending function of the board of supervisiors as a board of equalization in July 1966, required that an \u201cinvestigation, examination and inquiry\u201d commence forthwith.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Following these \u201cdeterminations\u201d (and those reciting matters of law relative to the duties of the public officers involved, which we hereinafter discuss), the judgment ordered that a peremptory writ of mandate issue; that the trial court retained jurisdiction of the cause and jurisdiction to modify the peremptory writ upon noticed request by the petitioners; and that defendants report to the court, at specified intervals, concerning the steps being taken to comply with the peremptory writ. The judgment also awarded petitioners \u201creasonable attorneys\u2019 fees\u201d in the action, the amount thereof to be subsequently fixed as hereinafter discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The peremptory writ of mandate, issued pursuant to the judgment, was addressed to each of the defendants and followed the judgment in close detail. All defendants were ordered to take all appropriate action \u201ccommanded herein and called for\u201d by the information contained in the 1965 grand jury transcript. The board of supervisors was ordered to initiate, immediately, a \u201cfull investigation, inquiry and examination into the matter of loss by . . . [the City and County] ... of property tax revenues during this or any prior assessment year\u201d as to which such recovery was permitted by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The writ further ordered the board of supervisors to conduct the project, in cooperation with the assessor and his office but \u201cthrough\u201d independent experts (\u201cauditiors, appraisers and certified public accountants\u201d). The experts were to be employed by the board for the purpose of identifying taxable properties which had not been assessed, or which had been underassessed or had \u201cotherwise escaped taxation for any reason,\u201d due to the assessor having applied an improperly low assessment ratio, inaccurate reporting of cost or value by a taxpayer, misuse of cost or value figures (accurately reported or not) by the assessor; and the fixing of improperly low assessed valuations by the assessor pursuant to \u201carrangement\u201d with him or with anyone employed in his office. The experts were to make a full \u201caudit or re-audit\u201d and \u201cappraisal or re-appraisal\u201d of property which, there was reasonable cause to believe, had escaped taxation by reason of any of the just-mentioned acts or omissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">The assessor and the board of equalization were ordered to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>appropriate action to identify the property in question, to make new assessments-as authorized by law (including penal assessments); to make appropriate changes in the assessment roll (the board of equalization was specifically ordered to direct the assessor to do this); and to recover any property taxes owing the City and County, with appropriate penalties authorized by law. The assessor was ordered to cooperate with the board of supervisors in the investigation and to give its experts full access to all information in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\n<em>The Appeal From The Main Judgment (1 Civil 24553)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">On the appeal from the main judgment, we categorize appellants\u2019 principal arguments (which they present under 19 separate headings) as contending (1) that the remedy of mandamus did not lie in principle; (2) that petitioners could not exercise it, as such or in the form of a taxpayers\u2019 suit; (3) that it could not be exercised without exhausting precedent administrative remedies; (4) that the trial court committed various procedural errors; and (5) that the main judgment is erroneous in content. None of these arguments can be sustained; we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">\n<em>Mandamus Was The Proper Remedy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The propriety of mandamus as petitioners\u2019 remedy rests upon the trial court\u2019s \u201cdeterminations\u201d reciting, in the judgment, matters of law relative to the public duties imposed by law upon the assessor, the board of supervisors and the board of equalization. We uphold these determinations (as pertinent, and referring to each by paraphrasing it or by quoting it in part) as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">As to the assessor, the trial court first determined that he \u201cis required faithfully to comply with all duties imposed upon him under the revenue laws.\u201d The statement recited a truism whose manifest correctness requires neither discussion nor supporting authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-9\">In the same context, the court determined that the assessor is under a duty \u201cnot to allow anyone to escape a just and equal assessment through favor, reward or otherwise.\u201d This statement primarily defines the assessor\u2019s duties' (1) to assess <em>all </em>property in his jurisdiction and (2) to do so <em>on a uniform basis. </em>The statement was correct in both respects. The Constitution requires that <em>\u201cAll </em>property subject to taxation shall be assessed at its full cash value.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7 12 [italics added].) The duty to do this lies with the assessor. (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u00a7 405; <em>County of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Hickman </em>(1967) 66 Cal.2d 841, 845 [59 Cal.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>Rptr. 609, 428 P.2d 593].) While the courts have interpreted the constitutional mandate as permitting him (the assessor) to assess taxable property at a fraction of its true market value (see, e.g., <em>County of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Hickman, supra, </em>at p. 851), the decisions impose upon him the duty to apply a fractional evaluation standard <em>uniformly </em>within his county. <em>(County of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Hickman, supra, </em>at p. 851; <em>Michels </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1964) 229 Cal.App.2d 404, 413 [40 Cal.Rptr. 464], See <em>Hanks </em>v. <em>State Board of Equalization </em>(1964) 229 Cal.App.2d 427, 430-431 [40 Cal.Rptr. 478].) That he is under this duty necessarily means that he is obligated \u201cnot to allow anyone to escape a just and equal assessment through favor, reward or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Moreover, the same statement\u2014relative to the assessor\u2019s duty \u201cnot to allow anyone to escape\u201d assessment\u2014correctly bespeaks his statutory obligation to assess, upon discovery, \u201cproperty belonging on the local roll [which] has escaped assessment.\u201d (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 531, 533-534.) The trial court also correctly determined in the judgment that the assessor must \u201cpenally assess, on discovery, any property willfully or fraudulently concealed to evade taxation.\u201d (See Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 503-505.)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Concerning the pertinent duties of the board of supervisors, the trial court determined that the board had \u201cthe duty ... to supervise the official conduct of the Assessor to the extent of requiring him faithfully to discharge his duties under the law.\u201d The duties of a board of supervisors are as the Legislature \u201cshall prescribe.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7 5.) The trial court\u2019s language correctly stated one such duty as prescribed by the Legislature\u2014with emphasis as to the assessor\u2014in Government Code section 25303.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The trial court also determined in broad terms that the assessor and the board of supervisors, holding \u201cpositions of public trust,\u201d had \u201can active duty to take timely and appropriate action, . . . through inquiry, examination and investigation respecting, and through undertaking recovery of, any uncollected property tax revenues\u201d which had not been paid to the City and County due to the actions or omissions of a taxpayer or public officer thereof; and that these duties specifically required performance \u201c[wjherever reasonable information shows probable or reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>cause for an investigation . . . respecting the loss of property tax revenues, <em>... or </em>shows the reasonable probability that there has been such a loss.\u201d The first statement correctly defined a necessary dimension of the previously described duties of the assessor and the board concerning property tax revenues (i.e., to pursue and remedy the consequences of dereliction). The second, saying in effect that public officers must respond to duty when reasonably called upon, recites another truism which requires no elaboration.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">As used in the constitutional and statutory provisions just cited relative to the public duties involved (Cal.Const., art. XI, \u00a7 12; Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 405, 531, 533-534, 503-505; Gov. Code, \u00a7 25303), the word \u201cshall\u201d must be construed as mandatory because of the constitutional and legislative purposes patently appearing therein, the public policy considerations involved (relative to the public revenue), and the context in which the word appears in each instance. (See <em>Francis </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1953) 3 Cal.2d 19, 28-29 [43 P.2d 300]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1956) 145 Cal.App.2d 767, 775-776 [303 P.2d 375], See also Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 16; Gov. Code, \u00a7 14.) The law, thus, \u201cspecially enjoins\u201d the public duties determined by the trial court to exist, which means that the remedy of mandamus lies to compel their performance. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Gogerty </em>v. <em>Coachella Valley Jr. College Dist. </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 727, 730 [21 Cal.Rptr. 806, 371 P.2d 582] and cases cited; <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water Dist. </em>(1966) 242 Cal.App.2d 52, 57 [51 Cal.Rptr. 120]; <em>Lagiss </em>v. <em>County of Contra Costa </em>(1963) 223 Cal.App.2d 77, 92 [35 Cal.Rptr. 450].)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">While it is true that mandamus will not lie to \u201ccontrol\u201d the exercise of administrative discretion <em>(City &amp; County of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1959) 53 Cal.2d 236, 245 [1 Cal.Rptr. 158, 347 P.2d 294]; <em>Gong </em>v. <em>City of Fremont </em>(1967) 250 Cal.App.2d 568, 572 [58 Cal.Rptr. 664]), this action did not seek that result and the judgment did not order it. The judgment is explicit in terms of the steps to be taken by the public officers it reached, the objectives to be pursued, and the methods to be used, but it directs no specific result as to any individual assessments or taxpayers. The results to be realized will depend upon the assessor\u2019s or the board\u2019s discretion <em>when exercised. </em>The action is therefore within the rule that, \u201c[w]hile ordinarily, mandamus may not be available to compel the exercise by a court or officer of the discretion possessed by them in a particular manner ... it does lie to command the exercise of discretion \u2014to compel some action upon the subject involved. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Hollman </em>v. <em>Warren </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 351, 353 [196 P.2d 562]. See <em>Browning </em>v. <em>Dow </em>(1923) 60 Cal.App. 680, 682 [213 P. 707].)</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>\n<em>Petitioners\u2019 Standing To Bring Mandamus In A Taxpayers\u2019 Suit</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">On this subject, and as pertinent, the trial court determined in the judgment that \u201cThis is a public taxpayers\u2019 action filed by petitioners on their behalf and on behalf of all other citizen-resident taxpayers of San Francisco, in aid of the collection of taxes ...\u201d This statement, which reached petitioners\u2019 standing both (1) to sue in mandamus and (2) to do so in the form of a taxpayers\u2019 suit, was correct in both respects. One who will be \u201cbeneficially interested\u201d thereby may petition for a writ of mandate. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1086; <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water Dist., supra, </em>242 Cal.App.2d 52, 56.) Petitioners\u2019 status as San Francisco taxpayers made them \u201cbeneficially interested\u201d parties who could maintain this action because (as we have seen) its object was to compel the performance of public duties which the law specially enjoins. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085; <em>Gogerty </em>v. <em>Coachella Valley Jr. College Dist., supra, </em>57 Cal.2d 727 at p. 730 and cases cited; <em>Fuller </em>v. <em>San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water Dist., supra, </em>at pp. 57-58; <em>Lagiss </em>v. <em>County of Contra Costa, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.2d 77 at p. 92.) For the same reasons, they brought the action in a representative capacity <em>(Gogerty </em>v. <em>Coachella Valley Jr. College Dist., supra), </em>which made it a class action. The trial court, therefore, correctly determined that they sued \u201con behalf of all other citizen-resident taxpayers of San Francisco\u201d as well as on their own behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Appellants contend that the action was not maintained on behalf of \u201call taxpayers\u201d because some of them (i.e., those who had previously received preferential treatment from Wolden and who might now be brought to \u2022 book) will not be benefitted by it. But the purpose of the action and of the writ of mandate is to achieve uniformity of treatment of all taxpayers at the assessor\u2019s hands, and this prospect is one of its reasonably predictable results. Those taxpayers previously favored by Wolden, among all San Francisco taxpayers, will share in the public benefits to be realized from that objective; and this fact is not negated by the detail that some might be required to pay property taxes which they rightfully owed in the first instance. The action was therefore on behalf of \u201call taxpayers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">\n<em>Administrative Remedies</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">The trial court further determined that \u201cit was not a condition to the filing of this action, and there is no need, that petitioners exhaust any administrative remedies,\u201d and that no such precedent remedy \u201cwas or is available ... to afford relief on the subject of this proceeding.\u201d Challenging this conclusion, appellants invoke \u201cthe general rule that a taxpayer seeking relief from an erroneous assessment must have exhausted his remedies before the administrative body empowered initially to correct the error [i.e., the board of equalization].\u201d <em>(Security-First Nat. Bank </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number><em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1950) 35 Cal.2d 319, 320 [217 P.2d 946]; <em>McCaslin </em>v. <em>DeCamp </em>(1967) 248 Cal.App.2d 13, 15 [56 Cal.Rptr. 42].)</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">The decisions applying the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d involved actions in which taxpayers sought judicial relief from <em>specific </em>assessments of their own properties (see, e.g., <em>Security-First Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>35 Cal.2d 319 at p. 320; <em>McCaslin </em>v. <em>DeCamp, supra, </em>248 Cal.App.2d 13 at pp. 14-15; <em>Los Angeles etc. Co. </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1912) 162 Cal. 164, 165-166 [121 P. 384, 9 A.L.R. 1277]) or of properties owned by others. (See, e.g., <em>Clunie </em>v. <em>Siebe </em>(1896) 112 Cal. 593, 594-595 [44 P. 1064].) (See, generally, cases cited in Early, <em>Local Equalization Practice in </em>California. (1964) 4 Santa Clara Law. 147, 148-152.) In such an action, prior recourse to the board of equalization is properly required because the board, through the exercise of its statutory power to equalize assessments on the local roll by increasing or lowering some of them (Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 1605), is the \u201cadministrative body empowered initially to correct the error.\u201d <em>(Security-First Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">This is not such an action. Although the petition cites gross error in several individual assessments, it pleads them as symptomatic of the much broader problem the action is designed to relieve. The action\u2019s purpose is not to have these assessments, as such, changed: it is to bring about examination and correction of wholesale deficiencies in the San Francisco assessment situation which reasonably require, not the adjustment of some specific assessments or the recovery of taxes paid upon them, but the examination of all assessments and the adjustment of those which require such action and can legally be reached. As to the assessor, the action is addressed to the full dimensions of his public duties in office, not to isolated entries in the local assessment roll. As to the board of supervisors, the action invokes the board\u2019s duty to \u201csupervise . . . [the assessor\u2019s] . . . official conduct.\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 25303.) The local equalization procedure would not reach the real problem with the assessor, and it is not germane to the duties of the board of supervisors sitting as such. Accordingly, it is not a precedent administrative remedy to the action because the board of equalization is not an \u201cadministrative body empowered ... to correct\u201d the situation from which judicial relief is sought <em>(Security-First Nat. Bank </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>35 Cal.2d 319 at pp. 320-321), and no prior administrative remedy is provided by law for this purpose. Therefore, the trial court\u2019s determination in these respects was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\n<em>Claimed Procedural Errors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">The trial court determined in the judgment that appellants\u2019 answer to the petition for writ of mandate (i.e., the answer filed thereto by the City <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>and County and its respective boards) \u201craised only questions of law, or put in issue immaterial statements not affecting the substantial rights of the parties or the gravamen ... [of the action] ...\u201d Although we have not summarized the pleadings because of their length, we state here that we agree with this determination. The answer therefore stated no defense to the action; hence the trial court properly entered judgment on the pleadings. (See <em>MacIsaac </em>v. <em>Pozzo </em>(1945) 26 Cal.2d 809, 812-813 [161 P.2d 449].)</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">Because the pleadings joined no genuine issue of material fact, the trial court was not required to consider the evidentiary effect (if any) of various presumptions relative to the regularity of Wolden\u2019s conduct in office. (E.g., Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1963,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> subd. 1 [presumption of innocence of crime or wrong]; see also <em>id., </em>subds. 15, 33.) For the same reason, the court did not err in denying appellants any exercise of discovery rights pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 2030.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Appellants make several arguments to the effect that the trial court erred in examining the transcript of the grand jury\u2019s investigation of Wolden (which transcript was incorporated by reference in the petition for writ of mandate), and in considering its contents because such were hearsay evidence. They also contend that the petition\u2019s allegations relative to specific instances of misconduct by Wolden do not support the judgment because they were made \u201cupon information and belief.\u201d Although the petition did not physically include the 750-page transcript, it alleged (1) the fact of the grand jury\u2019s investigation of Wolden, (2) the results thereof as indicated by Wolden\u2019s indictment upon \u201cthe sworn testimony of 25 witnesses,\u201d and (3) that the transcript was in existence as \u201ca public document and public record.\u201d Appellants\u2019 answer (i.e.,the answer filed by the City and County and by the respective boards) admitted the first two allegations explicitly, and admitted the third by not denying it. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 462.)</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">The testimony received by the grand jury as recounted in the transcript, and the fact of Wolden\u2019s indictment pursuant thereto, were subjects of which the trial court could properly take judicial notice. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1875, subd. 3 [see fn. 12, <em>ante]. </em>See Pen. Code, \u00a7 938.1.) Because appellants admitted that the transcript was in existence as a public record, the trial court could therefore\u2014as it did\u2014take judicial notice of its contents by examining it.  Having done so, the court had reasonable cause to order the investigation and other actions determined in the judgment to be necessary. The transcript\u2019s contents were hearsay evidence in the literal sense, but the adequacy thereof to show \u201creasonable cause\u201d is well settled. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Boyles </em>(1955) 45 Cal.2d 652, 656 [290 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>535]. See also Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1966) Exclusion of Illegally Obtained Evidence, \u00a7 111, p. 110.) Having developed such reasonable cause from the grand jury transcript, the trial court did not rely upon the petition\u2019s allegations which, paraphrasing the transcript, were made upon information and belief. We therefore find it unnecessary to discuss appellants\u2019 arguments disparaging such allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The trial court did not err in declining to postpone proceedings in petitioners\u2019 action until Wolden\u2019s criminal prosecution had been concluded. The court determined that the pleadings showed reasonable cause to order the actions spelled out in the judgment. Given such reasonable cause, the question of Wolden\u2019s guilt or innocence of specific crimes was irrelevant. The trial court was under no duty to defer proceedings in deference to Wolden\u2019s rights as a criminal defendant, and the actions ordered in the judgment were urgent in point of time and because of the commanding public interest in their subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Appellants complain of alleged irregularity in the service of process (i.e., of the trial court\u2019s alternative writ of mandate) upon Wolden personally. The record, however, shows that his attorney appeared in the trial court on the alternative writ\u2019s return date (March 7, 1966) and moved for a continuance of the action. This was a general appearance, by Wolden, which\u2014apart from the validity of personal service of process\u2014 conferred jurisdiction upon the trial court to act with reference to him and to the conduct of his office. <em>(Zobel </em>v. <em>Zobel </em>(1907) 151 Cal. 98,100-102 [90 P. 191]. See 1 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (1954) Jurisdiction, \u00a7\u00a7 71-72 [pp. 341-342], 75 [pp. 344-345].)</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">\n<em>The Content of the Judgment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">Appellants contend that the judgment is erroneous in both scope and detail. The tenor of their arguments is that the judgment, and the peremptory writ issued pursuant thereto, ordered the affected public officials to act in excess of their legal powers. As to the board of supervisors, some of the actions ordered represented the trial court\u2019s concept of the manner in which the board\u2019s duty to \u201csupervise the official conduct\u201d of the assessor could appropriately be discharged. Spelling them out in the judgment, the court correctly determined that the board could examine the assessor\u2019s \u201cbooks, records and papers\u201d (see Gov. Code, \u00a7 25303 (quoted in fn. 10, <em>ante)) </em>and could employ its own expert staff for the purpose of complying with the peremptory writ. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 31000;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> see <em>Skidmore </em>v. <em>County of Amador </em>(1936) 7 Cal.2d 37, 39-42 [59 P.2d 818].)</p>\n<p id=\"b206-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Contrary to appellants\u2019 contention, the board\u2019s employment of experts did not involve a violation of Revenue and Taxation Code section 1721 (which prohibits assessment except by the assessor or the valuation of assessable property except by the board of equalization while sitting as such). The judgment and the peremptory writ contemplates that the experts would turn up individual cases requiring both such actions, but each would be performed by the assessor and by the board of equalization, respectively and as the law requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">The trial court also determined in the judgment that the board of supervisors, sitting as such and as the board of equalization, was both dutybound and empowered to require the assessor to \u201ccorrect his errors\u201d to the extent that he had applied a \u201cnon-uniform assessment ratio to properties ... for the purpose of fixing assessed valuations favoring certain taxpayers.\u201d The assessor\u2019s duty to apply <em>uniform </em>assessment ratios to all property is clear. (Cal. Const., art. XI, \u00a7 12; <em>County of Sacramento </em>v. <em>Hickman, supra, </em>66 Cal.2d 841 at p. 851.) We deem it equally clear that the board of supervisors is obligated by its duty to \u201csupervise ... the assessor\u2019s . . . official conduct\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 25303 (see fn. 10, <em>ante)), </em>and enabled by the powers vested in it by the statutes previously cited (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 25303, 31000 (See fn. 13, <em>ante); </em>as to the board of equalization, see Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 1611) to see that the assessor achieves uniformity among San Francisco property taxpayers. The trial court\u2019s determination in this regard was therefore correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">The judgment nowhere conceives that appellants should or would exceed any of their legal powers in acting pursuant to the writ of mandate. (The writ, in fact, is explicit to the opposite effect: it repeatedly directs the affected officials to act \u201cas authorized by law\u201d or subject to limiting words of similar import.) Whether they exceed their legal powers at any point is a matter to be resolved between them and the affected taxpayers at that time. Until then, various authorities cited by the appellants as limiting their powers to comply with the writ (e.g., <em>Stafford </em>v. <em>Riverside County </em>(1957) 155 Cal.App.2d 474, 478 [318 P.2d 172]; <em>Napa Sav. Bank </em>v. <em>County of Napa </em>(1911) 17 Cal.App. 545, 548 [120 P. 449]) are notin point.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\n<em>The Judgment For Attorneys\u2019 Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">The main judgment further provided (in response to pertinent allegations in the petition and as prayed therein) that \u201c. . . pursuant to section 27 of the San Francisco Charter, petitioners have and recover from . . . [the]. . . City and County of San Francisco . . . such sum or sums as shall be fixed by this Court as reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees . . . at a hearing . . . [thereupon set for a subsequent date] . . .,\u201d plus court costs (later fixed in the judgment, pursuant to petitioners\u2019 cost bill, in the amount of $27).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>On July 12, 1966, having received evidence pertaining to attorneys\u2019 fees, the trial court entered a \u201cJudgment and Award of Attorneys\u2019 Fees.\u201d The July 12 judgment ordered the City and County to make specified payments directly to the law firms named in the petition for writ of mandate. These payments were to be made upon the City and County\u2019s receipt of property tax revenues collected after March 28, 1966, in consequence of appellants\u2019 compliance with the peremptory writ of mandate. The payments included the fixed amounts of $1,010.81 (referred to in the judgment as the attorneys\u2019 \u201cout-of-pocket expenditures\u201d) and sums fixed in accordance with a schedule of the property tax revenues collected (20 percent of the first $1 million, 10 percent of the second and 5 percent of the third).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">\n<em>The Appeal From the Judgment For Attorneys\u2019 Fees (1 Civil 24553)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">Several of appellants\u2019 attacks on this judgment rest upon the premises that petitioners were not \u201cbeneficially interested\u201d in the action (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1086) and that it is not a class action. As we have previously rejected both premises, these arguments fail. (See <em>Gogerty </em>v. <em>Coachella Valley Jr. College Dist., supra, 57 </em>Cal.2d 727 at p. 730 and cases cited.)</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Appellants further challenge the judgment because it makes a \u201ccontingent, percentage award\u201d of attorneys\u2019 fees, because it orders the payment thereof directly to the law firms involved (rather than to petitioners), and because no \u201cfund was in the court\u2019s custody\u201d from which the payment could be made. These provisions, it is argued, violate section 27 of the City and County\u2019s charter<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (\u201cpursuant\u201d to which, according to the main judgment, the award of attorneys\u2019 fees was made).</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">However, this was a class action (see <em>Gogerty </em>v. <em>Coachella Valley Jr. College Dist., supra, 57 </em>Cal.2d 727 at p. 730 and cases cited) to which equitable principles applied because it was in the nature of mandamus. <em>(Bruce </em>v. <em>Gregory </em>(1967) 65 Cal.2d 666, 671 [56 Cal.Rptr. 265, 423 P.2d 193].) It follows that the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and the details thereof were proper exercises of the trial court\u2019s broad equitable powers <em>(Fletcher </em>v. <em>A. J. Industries, Inc. </em>(1968) 266 Cal.App.2d 313, 319-324 [72 Cal.Rptr. 146], hear den.), of which the existence of an actual fund of money is not a condition precedent. <em>(Ibid, </em>at pp. 322-323.) We read nothing in charter section 27 (see fn. 14, <em>ante) </em>which conflicts with these equitable powers or their exercise here; the section tends to confirm both and to limit neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">Appellants have cited numerous decisions in opposition to an attorneys\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>fee award on a \u201ccontingent, percentage\u201d basis (e.g., <em>Estate of McDonald </em>(1940) 37 Cal.App.2d 521, 525-526 [99 P.2d 1115]), to the payment thereof directly to the attorney recipients (e.g., <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Knapp </em>(1936) 7 Cal.2d 168, 173 [60 P.2d 127], and to the propriety of any award at all in a mandamus action (e.g., <em>Holbrook </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1952) 113 Cal.App.2d 840 [249 P.2d 29]). None of these involved a class action and, in each, the trial court\u2019s power to award \u2022attorneys\u2019 fees was limited by statute. The character of the present case as a class action, in which the court\u2019s broad equitable powers were not limited by statute (including, as we have seen, San Francisco Charter section 27), distinguishes it from any of the authorities cited. (See <em>Fletcher </em>v. <em>A. J. Industries, Inc., supra, </em>266 Cal.App.2d 313 atpp. 319-322.)</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment for attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\"><em>The Appeal From The Order of April </em>3, 1967 <em>(1 Civil 25160)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The order of April 3, 1967, was entered upon petitioners\u2019 verified \u201cApplication for Instructions\u201d to the trial court, relative to the steps being taken\u2014and to be taken\u2014to comply with the peremptory writ of mandate issued pursuant to the main judgment. Generally, petitioners\u2019 application related and referred to the trial court\u2019s determination, in the main judgment, that the San Francisco board of supervisors (sitting as such and as the board of equalization) was both dutybound and empowered to require that the assessor \u201ccorrect his errors\u201d to the extent that he (i.e., Wolden, when in office) had given non-uniform treatment to \u2019 certain San Francisco taxpayers by applying a \u201cnon-uniform ratio to [certain] properties for the purpose of fixing assessed valuations favoring certain taxpayers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">Specifically, petitioners\u2019 application recounted the steps taken by the affected public officers to comply with the peremptory writ, and alleged that these had included the application (by Tinney as Wolden\u2019s successor in office) of a 50 percent assessment ratio to some personal property as the standard by which he measured the degree to which such property had \u201cescaped\u201d assessment by Wolden during the 1964-1966 tax years and by which standard he (Tinney) had made \u201cdeficiency assessments\u201d of such property for the tax periods involved in those years.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">The application set forth the prospect that some taxpayers, seeking relief from Tinney\u2019s new assessments by the board of equalization sitting in April 1967, would show that the new assessments of their property should have been made by an application of a ratio lower than 50 percent because such lower percentage had been \u201caverage\u201d in San Francisco during the tax years in which these taxpayers had been affected by Tinney\u2019s compliance with the peremptory writ. According to petitioners\u2019 further allegations, the application of a lower-than-50 percent ratio to any such property would subvert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>the purpose and the designed effect of the peremptory writ. In the order of April 3, 1967 (entitled \u201cOrder and Instructions to Respondents\u201d), the trial'court summarily responded to petitioners\u2019 application by ordering that the board of equalization was not to \u201cconsider nor adopt\u201d any assessment ratio lower than 50 percent in measuring the validity of new assessments involved in any pertinent applications for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Mounting a characteristically massive attack upon the order of April 3, 1967,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> appellants contend\u2014and we here, again, categorize their numerous points\u2014that (1) the order invokes the erroneous concept that different assessment ratios must be applied as between real and personal property; (2) that it erroneously prohibits the board of equalization from considering the \u201caverage\u201d 1964-1966 assessment ratio in dealing with applications for equalization of new assessments made by Tinney for those years; and (3) that it erroneously forecloses relief to taxpayers who are affected by it and who seek relief from it before the board of equalization.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">We reject the first argument because, contrary to appellants\u2019 interpretation, the April 3 order does not require the application of different assessment ratios as between real and personal property. (Appellants\u2019 arguments go to the order\u2019s \u201ctheory\u201d; we refer to its explicit terms, which neither differentiate between classes of property nor require different ratios to be applied as between real and personal property.) For the reasons which follow, we do not reach the second and third arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">The main judgment and the peremptory writ of mandate issued pursuant thereto (the latter of which we have upheld by affirming the former) established only that the affected public officers must examine past (i.e., Wolden\u2019s) assessments and adjust them to the extent necessary and legally possible. The order of April 3, 1967, sets a standard for compliance with the peremptory writ in significant respects. If the standard was wrong in the case of any affected taxpayer (e.g., because such person could show a competent court that he had received discriminatory treatment as a consequence of official compliance with the writ), only that taxpayer can complain: the City and County of San Francisco cannot, the board of supervisors and the board of equalization cannot, the assessor cannot. The question posed by appellants\u2019 arguments on this point relate only to the interests (if any) of affected taxpayers. We conclude that the interests of appellants\u2014whatever they might be, even considered severally\u2014are not \u201cinjuriously affected\u201d by the April 3 order; for this reason, we dismiss their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>appeal from it,(See <em>Teitelbaum Furs, Inc. </em>v. <em>Dominion Ins. Co. </em>(1964) 231 Cal.App.2d 80, 81-82 [41 Cal.Rptr. 597].)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\n<em>Miscellaneous Appeals</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The city attorney saw fit to file four separate notices of appeal at various intervals, thereby imposing upon this court the onerous burden of sifting through the 1,200-page clerk\u2019s transcript in order to dispose of at least a dozen appeals from orders not previously mentioned herein. One of them is an appeal from an order entered pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1110b, denying a stay of execution upon the main judgment. Having affirmed the latter on the appeal therefrom, we dismiss this one as moot. <em>(Fuller </em>v. <em>San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water Dist. </em>(1966) 242 Cal.App.2d 66, 67-68 [51 Cal.Rptr. 130].) Others purport to be from orders denying appellants\u2019 various motions to vacate the main judgment and the judgment awarding attorneys\u2019 fees. Assuming (but not holding) that these were appealable orders (see 3 Witkin, Cal. Procedure, <em>supra, </em>Appeal, \u00a7 26, 2170-2171), we similarly dismiss them\u2014as moot\u2014because we have affirmed both judgments. <em>(Fuller </em>v. <em>San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water Dist., supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">Among the other appeals purportedly pending, we dismiss some because they were taken from patently nonappealable orders. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 963; <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Schweitzer </em>(1962) 200 Cal.App.2d 448, 452 [19 Cal.Rptr. 429]. As to one such order, e.g., which substituted Tinney for Wolden as a party to the action, see <em>Camp </em>v. <em>Oakland Mortg. etc. Co. </em>(1928) 205 Cal. 380, 381-382 [270 P. 685].) Other appeals are merely repetitive; the city attorney purportedly appealed at least twice from several orders. Because he should have known better, we deem these appeals frivolous and dismiss them for that reason. <em>(Estate of Wunderle </em>(1947) 30 Cal.2d 274, 279 [181 P.2d 874]; see <em>Estate of D\u2019Avila </em>(1963) 217 Cal.App.2d 123, 124 [31 Cal.Rptr. 363].)</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">In 1 Civil 24553, the judgments entered on March 28, 1966 (directing issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate) and on July 12, 1966 (fixing and awarding attorneys\u2019 fees) are affirmed.

Code, \u00a7 68) and one count of conspiracy (Pen. Code, \u00a7 182) to accept bribes. His trial on these charges commenced on February 21, 1966 (two days before petitioners\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>action was filed). He was convicted, on all counts, on May 28, 1966, and was removed from office forthwith The conviction was affirmed on appeal in 1967 and became final in 1968. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wolden </em>(1967) 255 Cal.App.2d 798, 806 [63 Cal.Rptr. 467], hearing denied January 3, 1968.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b196-9\">In these respects, petitioners, generally alleged that \u201cin derogation\u201d of their rights and the rights of \u201call other taxpayers of San Francisco,\u201d Wolden had breached his public trust as assessor by making \u201carbitrary, fraudulent and dishonest assessments\u201d from which he realized \u201cunauthorized profit out of the public business entrusted . . . to his care\u201d by accepting bribes.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">Somewhat more specifically, they next alleged that Wolden had failed to perform his duty of identifying and assessing, at its proper value, all property subject to assessment in San Francisco; that he had permitted his bribers to omit reporting taxable property to him, or to report such property at falsely low values which resulted in its nonassessment or underassessment; that he had permitted and encouraged the employees in his office to act similarly; and that he had \u201capplied,\u201d to property owned by his bribers, a \u201cpreferentially lower assessment ratio than that applied to property in the same class\u201d owned by others.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-11\">Finally and most specifically (and recounting details of the 1965 grand jury testimony incorporated in the petition by reference), petitioners alleged instances in which Wolden had accorded preferential treatment to taxpayers who had bribed him. These allegations included the names of the persons who had given bribes, the dates of the transactions, the nature and amounts of the bribes, and the assessment or other figures involved. The preferential treatment given to these persons was alleged to have consisted of specific actions on Wolden\u2019s part: e.g., permitting the favored taxpayer to \u201cescape assessments\u201d through failure to report equipment and inventories, reducing the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cassessment ratio\u201d by and to specified percentages of the real value of the property involved, reducing assessed valuations outright, and settling deficiency assessments for improperly low cash amounts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b196-12\">As we hereinafter hold, Wolden appeared in the action on March 7, 1966.
