Negligence\u2014notice to defendant of impending danger. In an action to recover damages for a personal injury resulting from the alleged negligence of the defendant, the plaintiff having himself contributed to such result by negligence on his part, by placing himself in a situation of danger, if the question arises as to the measure of care it was the duty of the defendant to have observed in case it was in his power to have avoided the consequences of the plaintiff\u2019s negligence, then in order to charge the defendant it must he shown he had knowledge of the peril in which the plaintiff had placed himself, or the equivalent of such knowledge, at least long enough before the injury inflicted, to have enabled him'to form an intelligent opinion as to how the injury might be avoided, and to apply the means.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b512-20\" pgmap=\"512\">2. Same\u2014contributory and comparative negligence. To authorize the plaintiff to recover on the ground of the mere negligence, as distinguished from the willful tort, of the defendant, it must appear that the party injured exercised ordinary care, such as a reasonably prudent person will always adopt for the security of his person or property, to avoid the injury complained of. In the absence of ordinary care on the part of the plaintiff, in such case, there is no right of action, and can be no recovery.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b512-21\" pgmap=\"512\">3. In applying the rule that the plaintiff may recover in an action for negligence, notwithstanding he has been guilty of contributive negligence, where his negligence is but slight and that of the defendant gross in comparison with each other, it must be understood the terms \u201cslight negligence\" and \u201cgross negligence\u201d are used in their legal sense, as defined by common law judges and text writers, and as expressing the extremes of negligence, of which there are no.degrees. In giving the definitions of the-degrees of negligence, the word \u201cdiligence,\u201d as used in that connection, is synonymous with \u201ccare.\u201d So it is said, gross negligence is the want of slight diligence. Slight negligence is the want of great diligence, and intermediate there is ordinary negligence, which is defined to be \u201cthe want of ordinary diligence.\u201d</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b512-22\" pgmap=\"512(92) 513(25)\">4: In applying the measure of slight and gross negligence, however, to the acts of the respective parties charged to have been negligent, it is, of course, to be considered that the term \u201cnegligence\u201d is, itself, relative, and its application\" must depend on the situation of the parties, and the degree of care and vigilance which the circumstances reasonably impose. So that in each case, where there has been contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff, and he seeks still to recover under the rule in respect to comparative negligence, the question will relate to the measure of care, under the circumstances shown by the evidence to have existed, imposed upon the parties respectively.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b513-4\" pgmap=\"513\">5. In this case, where the plaintiff sought to recover for the death of his intestate, caused by the alleged negligence of the defendant railroad company in the running and management of a locomotive and train of cars on its road, the evidence tending to show contributory negligence on the part of the person killed, the trial court, in undertaking to lay down the rule of comparative negligence, instructed the jury, at the instance of the plaintiff, that although it should appear that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was not exercising ordinary care, yet the plaintiff might recover if the negligence of his intestate was slight and that of defendant was gross in comparison with each other. It was held, the rule was not correctly stated, as it can not legally be true that where the person injured fails to exercise ordinary care, and the defendant is guilty of negligence only, the negligence of the person injured is slight and that of the defendant gross in comparison with each other.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b513-8\" pgmap=\"513\">6.

Same\u2014as to pecuniary circumstances of parties. In a suit to recover damages for the death of a person caused by the alleged negligence of the defendant, it is technically erroneous to admit evidence that the family of the deceased were entirely dependent on his labor for support, though in the particular case the admission of such evidence was not considered as doing any harm.</syllabus><syllabus data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b513-14\" pgmap=\"513\">8.

Johnson, as administrator of Christian L. Johnson, deceased, against the railroad company, to recover damages for the death of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, occasioned, as is alleged, by the negligence of the company in the management and running of a locomotive and train of cars. Upon a trial the plaintiff recovered a judgment for the sum of $1500, from \u2022which the defendant appealed to the Appellate Court for the Second District, where the judgment was affirmed. The railroad company thereupon appealed to this court. The principal question presented in the case arises upon certain instructions given at the instance of the plaintiff, relating to the measure of care, under the circumstances shown by the evidence to have existed, imposed upon the respective parties. The defendant company also objected that the trial court permitted witnesses to give their opinions as to the rate of speed at which the train was running when the accident occurred, and that the widow of the deceased was allowed to testify that she and a minor child were entirely dependent on his labor for their support.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b514-4\" pgmap=\"514\">Mr. Charles Wheaton, for the appellant :</attorneys><p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b514-5\" pgmap=\"514\">To warrant a recovery, the party injured must have exercised ordinary care, or the injury must have been wantonly inflicted.

Co. 96 Ill. 25.</p> <opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b517-7\" pgmap=\"517\">Mr. Justice Scholfield</author> <p id=\"AhXz\" pgmap=\"517\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p> <p id=\"b517-8\" pgmap=\"517\">The declaration contains two counts. In the first the allegation is general that the defendant negligently drove and managed its locomotive, etc. In the second the negligence alleged is in driving its engine, etc., at a rate of speed prohibited by an ordinance of the town of Plano.</p> <p id=\"b517-9\" pgmap=\"517\">At the time he received the fatal injury, plaintiff\u2019s intestate was in the employ of a firm engaged in the manufacture of the \u201cMarsh Harvester, \u201d at the shops of the company of that name, at Plano. For the convenience of those in charge of these shops, a switch had been laid on the grounds of the Marsh Harvester Company, connecting with defendant\u2019s main track, which was used by those in charge of the shops for unloading materials shipped to the shops, and for loading machines to be shipped from the shops. In one of the buildings used for shops was a saw room, the door of which opened towards this switch, and within ten or twelve feet of it. It was the duty of plaintiff\u2019s intestate, in conjunction with several others, to take lumber out of the saw room by that door and across the track to another id art of the grounds of the \u201cHarvester\u201d Company. While thus occupied, and as he was passing over this switch with a load of lumber on his shoulder, one of the defendant\u2019s trains, which was being backed along the side-track, struck and instantly killed him.</p> <p id=\"b518-4\" pgmap=\"518\">- The evidence tended to show that the defendant did the switching for the shops twice a day, at fixed regular hours, which were generally known to the employ\u00e9s in and about the shops; that the plaintiff\u2019s intestate had been engaged in the performance of the duties that he then was performing, for several months; that others saw the approaching train and gave him warning, and that, by looking in the proper direction, the train could have been observed in time to have avoided the injury. As to the weight of this evidence, it is not our province to express any opinion. It is sufficient to state there was evidence of this tendency before the jury. There was also a conflict in the evidence as to the rate of speed at which the train was moving,\u2014some evidence tending to show that it was less than that allowed by the ordinance of the town of Plano, and some tending to show that it was greater.</p> <p id=\"b518-5\" pgmap=\"518\">Among other instructions given by the court at the instance of the plaintiff, were the following:</p> <p id=\"b518-6\" pgmap=\"518(170) 519(105)\">\u201c1. The jury are instructed that the fact that a municipal corporation by ordinance prohibits the running of engines, locomotives and railway trains at a certain rate of speed, as, per example, six miles an hour, through its corporate territory, does not warrant or license the running of such trains at such rate of speed. It is the duty of those having the management and control of such engines, locomotives and trains, to conform the rate of speed to the safety of the public at all places where such a rate of speed would probably cause the death of individuals or endanger their personal safety. If, therefore, the jury believe, from all the evidence in this cause, that the defendant at the time, and on the said side-track where said Johnson was killed,\u2014if the proof shows that Johnson was killed on the side-track in question,\u2014was running its said train of cars and locomotive at a rate of speed dangerous to the personal safety of those whose right and privilege it was to cross said side-track, and that by reason of such dangerous rate of speed of said locomotive engine and cars, plaintiff\u2019s intestate, who was in the exercise of reasonable prudence and care, was struck, run over and killed by said defendant, the verdict should be for plaintiff, and the jury should so find. But if the jury believe from the evidence that Johnson did not exercise ordinary care, yet that Johnson\u2019s negligence was slight and that the negligence of the defendant was gross in comparison with each other, then the plaintiff must recover, and the verdict must be for the plaintiff.</p> <p id=\"b519-5\" pgmap=\"519\">\u201c2. The court instructs the jury that railroad companies in cities and thoroughfares where there are many persons frequently passing over their tracks, are under legal obligations to regard the safety of such persons, and must conduct their trains and regulate their speed with reference to the safety of the public at such places, or be liable for damages resulting from such negligence or willfulness. If, therefore, the jury believe, from all the evidence in this cause, that the said Christian L. Johnson was killed by said defendant, its agents or employ\u00e9s, without negligence on his part, by reason of the rapid and unlawful running of one of its trains, as in plaintiff\u2019s declaration charged, the verdict should be for plaintiff. But if, from all the evidence, it should appear that Johnson was not exercising ordinary care, yet the plaintiff may recover if Johnson\u2019s negligence was slight and that of defendant was gross in comparison with each other, and the verdict must be for plaintiff.</p> <p id=\"b519-6\" pgmap=\"519(77) 520(155)\">\u201c3. The jury are instructed that if they believe, from all the evidence in this cause, that at the time of the alleged killing of the said Christian L. Johnson, the said killing took place at and within the corporate limits of the town of Plano, in the county of Kendall, and State of Illinois, and that at said time there was in force a valid ordinance in said incorporated, town, prohibiting the running in the corporate limits of said town at a greater rate of speed than six miles per hour, locomotives, engines and freight trains, and if the jury further believe, from all the evidence in this cause, that at said time and place the defendant was running one of its engines, with cars attached, at a greater rate of speed than was permitted by said ordinance, and that by reason of such unlawful rate of speed, if such speed is shown by the.proof, the said Johnson, without fault or negligence on his part, was killed, the verdict of the jury should be for the plaintiff. But if, from all the evidence in this cause, it appears the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, Johnson, was not exercising ordinary care, yet the plaintiff may recover, provided the jury believe that Johnson\u2019s negligence was slight and the negligence of the defendant gross in comparison with each other, then the verdict must be for plaintiff. \u201d</p> <p id=\"b520-5\" pgmap=\"520\">No .question arises under these instructions with regard to the measure of care it would have been the duty of the defendant to have observed, if it had been within the power of the defendant to have avoided the consequences of the negligence of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate.. Such a question would have required proof of knowledge in those in charge of defendant\u2019s train, of the peril in which plaintiff\u2019s intestate had placed himself, at least long enough before the injury inflicted to have enabled them to have formed an. intelligent opinion as to how the injury might be avoided, and apply the means, or the equivalent of such knowledge\u2014of which there is no pretense in this ease; and it would, obviously, involve legal principles not necessary to be now discussed. But the question here relates simply to the doctrine of comparative negligence in a case wherein the injured party was a cooperative cause of the injury,\u2014in other words, where his acts directly contributed, in conjunction with the acts of the defendant, to the injury.</p> <p id=\"b520-6\" pgmap=\"520(20) 521(306)\">The doctrine has been announced, and often reiterated in this court, that in order to authorize the plaintiff to recover on the ground, of the mere negligence, as distinguished from the willful tort, of the defendant, it must appear that the party injured exercised ordinary care, such as a reasonably prudent person will always adopt for the security of his person or property, to avoid the injury complained of. In the Jacobs case, 20 Ill. 488, where the doctrine of comparative negligence was first announced, one of the rulings is: \u201cTo maintain an action for negligence there must be fault on the part of the defendant, and no want of ordinary care on the part of the plaintiff. \u201d And so it was ruled in Chicago, Burlington and Quincy R. R. Co. v. Hazzard, 26 Ill. 373; Chicago, Burlington and Quincy R. R. Co. v. Dewey, Admx. id. 255; Illinois Central R. R. Co. v. Simmons, 38 id. 242; Chicago and Alton R. R. Co. v. Gretzner, 46 id. 76; Chicago and Northwestern R. R. Co. v. Sweeney, 52 id. 325; Chicago, Burlington and Quincy R. R. Co. v. Damerell et al. 81 id. 450; Chicago, Burlington and Quincy R. R. Co. v. Lee, 68 id. 580. In the case last cited it was said, after stating the rule of comparative negligence; \u201cIt is an essential element to the right of action in all cases, the plaintiff, or party injured, must himself exercise ordinary care, such as a reasonably prudent person will always adopt for the security of his person or property. There are and there can be no degrees of gross negligence. The cases all go to the length of holding, where a party has been injured for the want of ordinary care, no action will lie unless the injury is willfully inflicted. \u201d See, also, St. Louis, Alton and Terre Haute R. R, Co. v. Manly, 58 Ill. 300.</p> <p id=\"b521-5\" pgmap=\"521(68) 522(169)\">These instructions, it is to be borne in mind, relate to the law of negligence, which, according to the generally approved definition of Alderson, B., in Blyth v. Burningham Water Works Co. 11 Exch. 784, \u201cis the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided upon those ordinary considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do.\u201d See Railroad Co. v. Jones, 95 U. S. (5 Otto,) 439. Or, according to the more terse definition of this court in Great Western R. R. Co. v. Hatoorth et al. 39 Ill. 353: \u201cThe opposite of care and prudence\u2014the omission to use the means reasonably necessary to avoid injury to others.\u201d When there is a particular intention to injure, or a degree of willful and wanton recklessness which authorizes the presumption of an intention to injure generally, the act ceases to be merely negligent, and becomes one of violence! or fraud. \u201cIn negligence there is no purpose to do a wrongful act, or to omit the performance of a duty. \u201d Gardner v. Heartt, 3 Denio, 236. \u201cNegligence, even when gross, is but an omission of duty. It is not. designed and intentional mischief, although it may be cogent evidence of such an act. \u201d Towanda R. R. Co. v. Munger, 5 Denio, 267. See, also, Wharton on Negligence, secs. 1, 2, 3.</p> <p id=\"b522-6\" pgmap=\"522(185) 523(89)\">In holding the plaintiff may recover in an action for negligence, notwithstanding he has been guilty of contributive negligence, where his negligence is but slight and that of the defendant gross in comparison with each other, it must, of course, be understood the terms \u201cslight negligence\u201d and \u201cgross negligence \u201d are used in their legal sense, as defined by common law judges and text writers, for otherwise the terms would convey no idea of a definite legal rule. As defined by those judges and writers, these terms express the extremes of negligence. Beyond gross and slight there are no degrees of negligence. \u201cGross gross,\u201d \u201cgrosser gross,\u201d and \u201cgrossest gross,\u201d and \u201cslight slight,\u201d \u201cslighter slight,\u201d and \u201cslightest slight,\u201d are absurd, and, in a legal sense, impossible terms. What is less than slight negligence the law takes no cogniza\u00f1ce of as a ground of action, and beyond gross negligence the law, while recognizing there may be liability for a trespass because of a particular intention to do wrong, or of a degree of willful and wanton recklessness which authorizes the presumption of a general intention to do wrong, recognizes no degree of negligence. The definition of gross negligence itself proves that it is not intended to be, the subject of comparison. It is, \u201cthe want of slight diligence. \u201d Slight negligence is, \u201cthe want of great diligence, \u201d and intermediate there is ordinary negligence, which is defined to be \u201cthe want of ordinary diligence.\u201d Story on Bailments, sec. 17; Shearman &amp; Redfield on Negligence, (2d ed.) secs. 16, 17; Cooley on Torts, 631; Central Military Tract R. R. Co. v. Rockafellow, 17 Ill. 541.</p> <p id=\"b523-5\" pgmap=\"523\">In applying the measure of slight and gross negligence to the acts of the respective*parties charged to have.been negligent, it is, of course, always to be held in remembrance that the term \u201cnegligence\u201d is, itself, relative, \u201cand its application depends on the situation of the parties, and the degree of care and vigilance which the circumstances reasonably impose.\u201d (Cooley on Torts, 630.) The question, therefore, in the present instance, related to the measure of care, under the circumstances shown by the evidence to have existed, imposed upon the respective parties. It was to that measure of care that these instructions related, and if they had related to any other, they would, for that cause alone, have been erroneous.</p> <p id=\"b523-6\" pgmap=\"523\">The word \u201cdiligence,\u201d as used in the definitions of the degrees of negligence to which We have referred, is synonymous with \u201ccare.\u201d This is shown by the text in Story, immediately following the definitions quoted. It is there said: \u201cFor he who is only less diligent than very careful men, can not be said to be more than slightly inattentive; he who omits ordinary care, is a little more negligent than men ordinarily are; and he who omits even slight diligence, fails in the lowest degree of prudence, and is deemed grossly negligent. \u201d It can not, then, legally be true, that where the plaintiff fails to exercise ordinary care, and the defendant is guilty of negligence only, the plaintiff\u2019s negligence is slight and that of the defendant gross in comparison with each other;</p> <p id=\"b524-4\" pgmap=\"524\">We have seen, and we repeat, the measure is to he applied, with reference to the rights, duties and obligations of the . respective parties, under the peculiar circumstances in evidence. Whether, therefore, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate failed to exercise ordinary care, is to be determined\u2014and there can be no presumption under these instructions otherwise\u2014with reference to his rights, duties and obligations, and the rights, duties and obligations of the defendant, under the peculiar circumstances here, in evidence. Being thus determined that he has failed to exercise ordinary care, the legal conclusion is, he is guilty of ordinary negligence. The utmost degree of negligence, merely,\u2014and it is of this only, and not of trespass or other wrongs, that the instructions speak,\u2014of which the defendant can be guilty, is gross negligence. The plaintiff\u2019s negligence, then, by the very terms employed, is ordinary, and that of the defendant gross, in comparison with each other. The language employed, in effect, says, although, as to this particular act, the plaintiff\u2019s intestate was guilty of ordinary negligence, and the defendant guilty of gross negligence, still, if the jury believe the plaintiff\u2019s intestate\u2019s negligence was slight,\u2014that is, that it was not what the very terms employed admit it to have been,\u2014and that of the defendant gross, in comparison with each other, they will find the defendant guilty, etc. Surely it needs no demonstration that if, as to a particular act, the negligence of the plaintiff was ordinary and that of the defendant gross, their relation is not changed by comparing them with each other. The same evidence that determines the one is gross and the other ordinary, fixes their relative degrees with reference to each other. 1</p> <p id=\"b524-6\" pgmap=\"524(54) 525(102)\">It seems to be thought what is said in Stratton v. Central City Horse Ry. Co. 95 Ill. 25, in criticising certain instructions there given, sustains the ruling below in regard to these instructions. This is a misapprehension. In those instructions it was said a failure to exercise ordinary care was gross negligence, and in one it was said no action would lie if the plaintiff failed to exercise ordinary care, unless the defendant willfully inflicted the injury. We have before herein shown both these positions to be inaccurate. The failure to exercise ordinary care is only ordinary negligence, and although a plaintiff might not exercise ordinary care, yet the defendant would be liable for .injuring him if his act causing injury was so willfully and wantonly reckless as to authorize the presumption of an intention to injure generally, notwithstanding he might have had no special intention to injure the plaintiff.</p> <p id=\"b525-4\" pgmap=\"525\">These instructions are clearly erroneous in the respect pointed out, and must necessarily have misled the jury as to the doctrine of comparative negligence. There is in them, moreover, a manifest attempt to connect discordant propositions, which always tends to confusion. Attempts to blend separate and distinct legal propositions in the same sentence or paragraph usually cause error, in that such blending tends to confuse and mislead, and should be avoided.</p> <p id=\"b525-5\" pgmap=\"525\">The objection taken to the admission of evidence with regard to the speed of the train, is not tenable. This is clearly a subject upon which any one is entitled to express an opinion, the jury being presumably able to estimate it for what it was worth. Nor can we say that the evidence of the poverty of the family of the deceased did any harm, although it was technically erroneous to admit it. In a future trial this error can and should be avoided.</p> <p id=\"b525-6\" pgmap=\"525\">For the error in giving the first, second and third of the plaintiff\u2019s instructions the judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded. T 7 7</p> <p id=\"b525-9\" pgmap=\"525\">T 7 7 Judgment reversed.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\"> <author id=\"b525-10\" pgmap=\"525\">Mr. Justice Dickey :</author> <p id=\"A0A\" pgmap=\"525(38) 526(50)\">I concur in the judgment rendered in this case. While the evidence tends to charge the defendant with palpable negligence, still, in my judgment, there is no evidence tending to show gross negligence on the part of defendant, and the turning question in the case in fact seems to be, whether the plaintiff\u2019s intestate used ordinary care. In such a ease I think it error to submit to the jury the rule of law as to comparative negligence. On this ground the judgment ought to be reversed.</p> <p id=\"b526-5\" pgmap=\"526\">\u25a0 There is, however, a line of thought in the opinion prepared by Mr. Justice Scholfield, which I think a departure from the law as laid down by this court ever since the.decision of the Jacobs case, in 20 Ill.</p> <p id=\"b526-6\" pgmap=\"526(273) 527(280)\">I do not think that the terms \u201cslight negligence, \u201d and \u201cgross negligence,\u201d as used in the opinion delivered in the Jacobs case, and in the long series of cases which have followed that case, were used in the sense of the definitions quoted from Story, in his treatise On Bailments. That author, in the same work, says: \u201cThere are infinite shades of care or diligence, from the slightest momentary thought, to the most vigilant anxiety. There may be a high degree of diligence, a common degree of diligence, and slight degree of diligence.\u201d He defines \u201cordinary diligence\u201d as \u201cthat degree of diligence which men in general exert in respect to their own concerns.\u201d He defines \u201cextraordinary diligence\u201d as \u201cthat which very prudent persons take of their own concerns. \u201d And he says \u201cslight diligence\u201d is \u201cthat which persons of any prudence at all take of their own concerns. \u201d All this is readily understood,\u2014is in harmony with the common meaning of the words used; but when he says, in section 17, that \u201cordinary negligence\u201d may be defined to be \u201cthe\u2022 want of ordinary diligence,\u201d and \u201cslight negligence\u201d to be \u201cthe want of great diligence,\u201d and \u201cgross negligence\u201d to be \u201cthe want of slight diligence, \u201d he surely does not give to these phrases the meaning in which they are used in a common or popular sense, or the meaning in which they have generally been used by this court in the Jacobs case, and other kindred cases ; nor does he give' the meaning which would naturally be adopted by a jury in giving effect to an instruction given by the court. Giving the words their popular sense, it would rather seem that ordinary negligence would be such negligence as men-of common prudence indulge in, which betokens only the exercise of ordinary care, and not the want of ordinary care, as is suggested. This, where the law requires only ordinary care, is not negligence at all, for in law negligence is always faulty. It is the failure in some degree to use that care which the law requires under the circumstances. In a case where the law demands only the use of ordinary care, and ordinary care is actually exercised, there is in law no negligence whatever. In such case it is not true that the want of great diligence is in law slight negligence. In the popular sense of the words, slight negligence is a slight want of the care which the circumstances demand. A man obviously, therefore, may in such case fail slightly to use ordinary care, and in the popular sense of the words he would be guilty of slight negligence, and only slight negligence, and this, although he did not do all that ordinary care required. And so of \u201cgross negligence. \u201d, Its popular meaning is a very great failure to use the care which the law requires. It is not essential to gross negligence that there shall be an utter want of care, or, in the language of Story, \u201cthe want of\u201d even \u201cslight diligence.\u201d The exercise of slight diligence, where the highest degree of care is by law required, may still leave the party guilty of gross negligence,\u2014that is, guilty of a very great failure to exercise the highest care.</p> <p id=\"b527-5\" pgmap=\"527(89) 528(92)\">Nor do I concur in the dicta which say there are and can be no degrees in gross negligence, and no degrees in slight negligence. The adjectives \u201cslight,\u201d and \u201cgross,\u201d seem to me to be capable of comparison, as most adjectives are. I see no absurdity in saying \u201cgross,\u201d \u201cmore gross,\u201d \u201cmost gross,\u201d or \u201cgross,\u201d \u201cgrosser,\u201d \u201cgrossest,\u201d or \u201cslight,\u201d \u201cmore slight,\u201d \u201cslightest.\u201d In fact in the quotation supra, from Story, he speaks of \u201cinfinite shades of care, \u201d from the \u201cslightest\" momentary thought to the \u201cmost vigilant solicitude.\u201d In fact, the imperfection of these definitions of Story leads Cooley, in his work on Torts, page 630, to say of this classification, that it \u201conly indicates that under the special circumstances great care or caution was required, or only ordinary care, or only slight care; \u201d and to add, \u201cif the care demanded was not exercised, the case is one of negligence. \u201d The terms \u201cslight negligence,\u201d or \u201cmoderate negligence,\u201d or \u201cgross negligence,\u201d do not indicate offences of a different nature, but different degrees in offences of the same nature.</p> <p id=\"b528-4\" pgmap=\"528\">I think, therefore, there may be cases in which it may be legally true that the plaintiff has failed in some degree to exercise ordinary care, and that in the same case the defendant has been guilty of gross negligence wherein the plaintiff\u2019s negligence may be slight,\u2014that is, may consist of a slight failure to use ordinary care,\u2014and that of the defendant gross in comparison therewith. To my mind the proposition that a plaintiff\u2019s negligence is slight, is not incompatible with the proposition that he has failed in some degree to use ordinary diligence.</p> <p id=\"b528-5\" pgmap=\"528\">I pursue this discussion no further here, for the reason that in my judgment the propriety of adopting in this connection Mr. Story\u2019s definitions, is a question which does not come in judgment in this case.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
