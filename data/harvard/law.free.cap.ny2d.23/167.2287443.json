Claimant is entitled to recover interest on the contract balance. <em>(Higgins &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>20 N Y 2d 425; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>12 N Y 2d 25.) IX. The affirmance by the Appellate Division of the dismissal of the second cause of action on the ground that the \u201cproof\u201d sustains the judgment of the Court of Claims was erroneous in that the dismissal by the Court of Claims was based on interpretation of the contract and not upon \u201c proof \u201d on any issue of fact; the interpretation by the Court of Claims of the contract, as affirmed by the Appellate Division, was erroneous, and the proof did not sustain such interpretation. <em>(Gitelson </em>v. <em>Du Pont, </em>17 N Y 2d 46; <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Atlantis Steel Partition Co., </em>295 N. Y. 80.) III. In the absence of a contract provision requiring vertical casting, the method of performing the work was within the discretion of the contractor. In addition, the contract expressly provided that the method of forming should be left to the discretion of claimant. The refusal of the State to permit the method chosen by claimant constituted a breach of contract. <em>(Meads &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>191 App. Div. 365; <em>Turner Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>253 App. Div. 784; <em>Arc </em>Eng. <em>Cory. </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>267 App. Div. 797.) IV. Any ambiguity in the contract, specifications or drawings as to whether vertical casting of the girders was required, and horizontal casting prohibited, must be resolved in favor of claimant. <em>(Gamarco Contrs. </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>40 Misc 2d 486; <em>Heating Maintenance Cory, of N. Y. </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>206 Misc. 605; <em>Frye </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>192 Misc. 260; <em>Evelyn Bldg. Cory. </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>257 N. Y. 501; <em>Blount Bros. Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>346 F. 2d 962.) V. Vertical casting in lieu of horizontal casting as permitted by the contract involved a change in the character of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>the work. The unit prices specified in the contract for such work thereupon became inapplicable. Claimant is entitled to. recover in <em>quantum meruit </em>for the reasonable value of such work. <em>(Foundation Co. </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>233 N. Y. 177; <em>Depot Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>41 Misc 2d 764, 23 A D 2d 707,19 N Y 2d 109; <em>Tufano Contr. Corp. </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>25 A D 2d 329.) VI. The imposition of a condition for permission to cast the girders in horizontal position, that no partial payments would be made during the performance of such work, was illegal since such nonpayment would have constituted a breach of contract. <em>(Guerini Stone Co. </em>v. <em>Carlin Constr. Co., </em>248 U. S. 334; <em>People </em>v. <em>C. &amp; W. Constr. Co., </em>256 App. Div. 17; <em>Cranford Co. </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>150 App. Div. 195, 211 N. Y. 534; <em>S. T. Grand, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cedar Bay Park Corp., </em>14 Misc 2d 428; <em>Wharton &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Winch, </em>140 N. Y. 287; <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Hayes Constr. Co., </em>243 N. Y. 140.) VII. With respect to the fourth cause of action claimant was entitled to recover for extra work.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b202-4\"><em>Louis J. Lefkowitz, Attorney-General (Joseph A. Cutro </em>and <em>Ruth Kessler Toch </em>of counsel), for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbJ\">I. The Appellate Division was correct in affirming the holding of the Court of Claims that the contract contemplated vertical casting of the girders because the contract documents as a whole mandated vertical casting. Therefore, there was no breach of contract. <em>(Baker Co. </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>267 App. Div. 712; <em>Heating Maintenance Corp. of N. Y. </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>206 Misc. 605; <em>Meads &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>191 App. Div. 365; <em>Turner Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>253 App. Div. 784.) II. There was no ambiguity in the contract clearly because the contract contemplated vertical casting. <em>(Camarco Contrs. </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>40 Misc 2d 486.) III. Since vertical casting of the girders was decreed, mandated, contemplated, and intended by the contract, the contention raised by appellant relative to periodic payments does not constitute a breach of contract. Therefore, the Appellate Division was correct in affirming the holding of the Court of Claims that the State acted reasonably in refusing to approve claimant\u2019s method of horizontal casting. IV. The contract, under \u201c Disputed Work \u201d, expressly provided the measure of damages for extra work in the form of a force account, and, since claimant has\" failed to comply with the terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>of the contract, it has waived its right to all damages. Therefore, the Appellate Division was correct in affirming the holding of the Court of Claims that there was no breach of contract. <em>(Borough Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>City of New York, </em>200 N. Y. 149; <em>Depot Constr. Corp. </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>41 Misc 2d 764, 23 A D 2d 707,19 N Y 2d 109; <em>Tufano Contr. Corp. </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>25 A D 2d 329; <em>Foundation Co. </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>233 N. Y. 177.) V. The dismissal of the fourth cause of action in the courts below should be affirmed because claimant failed to prove a breach of contract by defendant. VI. Claimant is not entitled to recover interest on the contract balance. Therefore, the holding by the Appellate Division which modified the judgment of the Court of Claims should be affirmed. <em>(Merritt-Chapman Scott Corp. </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>25 A D 2d 455; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>12 N Y 2d 25; <em>Higgins &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>20 N Y 2d 425.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b203-4\">Burke, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AuB\">The claimant entered into a contract with the State by which it undertook the construction of the superstructure and part of the substructure of a precast, prestressed continuous concrete girder bridge consisting of three spans across the Oneida River at Brewerton in Onondaga County. Subsequent to the completion and acceptance of the contract work, claimant filed a claim against the State which included four causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">In its first cause of action, claimant sought to recover the conceded contract balance, with interest on the amount of that balance from the date of the acceptance of the work by the State. Claimant contends that interest was properly awarded by the Court of Claims and that the decision of this court in <em>Higgins &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>State of New York </em>(20 N Y 2d 425), decided after the decision of the Appellate Division in this case, indicates that the award of interest on the undisputed contract balance should not have been reversed. The work was accepted by the State on October 20, 1961, but the claimant did not present the affidavits required as conditions precedent to payment until October 24, 1962. The State tendered final payment of that amount on November 2,1962, nine days after the affidavits were submitted by the claimant. The claimant refused that tender because of a contract provision to the effect that acceptance of final payment would constitute a waiver of all additional claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>and, instead, filed a claim against the State for the contract balance and for the items which are the subjects of the remaining causes of action. The cause of action for the contract balance was severed and a judgment was entered and paid in full for the amount of that balance on March 20, 1963. At that time, the question of interest on that amount was reserved until the determination of the remaining claims. The contract was subject to standard specifications, one of which provided that a refusal of tender of final payment constituted a waiver of any claim to interest. It is the effect of this specification on claimant\u2019s present claim for interest which must now be determined. Initially, it seems clear that claimant is not entitled to interest on the amount of the conceded contract balance for the period between the State\u2019s acceptance of the work (October 21, 1961) and the claimant\u2019s submission of the affidavits which were conditions precedent to payment (October 24, 1962), nor does claimant have any right to interest for the period between the submission of those affidavits and the State\u2019s tender of final payment nine days later on November 2, 1962, since that nine-day period was clearly a reasonable time for the State to take in processing the final payment <em>(Merritt, Chapman S Scott Corp. </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>25 A D 2d 455). This leaves for consideration only the period between the tender of final payment on November 2, 1962 and the entry and payment in full of the judgment entered on the severed cause of action for the conceded contract balance on March 20, 1963. In <em>Wood </em>v. <em>State of New York </em>(12 N Y 2d 25), we held that the refusal of tender of final payment constituted a waiver by the claimant of any claim to interest on that amount, as provided for by a specification identical to the one presently before us. However, in <em>Higgins &amp; Sons </em>v. <em>State of New York </em>(20 N Y 2d 425, <em>supra), </em>we held that the State could waive the <em>\u201c </em>no-interest \u201d provision of the specifications by stipulating at the time of the severance of the cause of action for the conceded contract balance that the question of interest be reserved until such time as the remaining portions of the claim were decided. We there said it was \u201c not * * * unreasonable to interpret this stipulation as a waiver of the contract provision on the part of the State, with the question of interest on the severed claim <em>hinging upon the validity of the additional claims asserted by claimant </em>\u201d <em>(supra, </em>p. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>429; emphasis added). That holding merely recognized that the claimant, otherwise, by accepting the tender of final payment, waived all additional claims and was thus faced with an essentially unfair choice. In the present case, the question of interest was reserved until the determination of the claimant\u2019s additional claims and claimant was successful in recovering judgment on his third cause of action, the judgment was affirmed by the Appellate Division and the State has not appealed to this court from that judgment. In this situation, our holding in <em>Higgins </em>is controlling rather than the holding in <em>Wood (Johnson, Drake &amp; Piper </em>v. <em>State of New York, </em>29 A D 2d 793). Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should be modified to allow interest on the severed amount from the date of tender of final payment to the date on which the severed judgment was paid by the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">In its second cause of action, claimant sought to recover the increased cost of fabricating the bridge\u2019s cantilever girders in a vertical position, the one approved by the State, rather than in the less expensive horizontal position, the one claimant desired to use. Claimant contends that the State committed a breach of contract by refusing to approve the claimant\u2019s proposal to use horizontal fabrication and that, therefore, claimant is entitled to recover the increased costs involved in using the vertical method. In support of its contention, claimant relies principally on a single paragraph of the design specifications, leaving the method of forming the girders in the claimant\u2019s discretion, as indicating that the entire method of fabrication (including forming) was to be in the claimant\u2019s discretion. The Court of Claims, however, from an examination of the specifications <em>as a whole </em>found that the contract and specifications contemplated vertical casting. The Appellate Division affirmed on the ground that the proof amply supported the findings and conclusions of the Court of Claims. Without extended discussion of the intricacies of the specifications and drawings, the record does indeed amply indicate that the contract, taken as a whole, called for vertical casting and that the State\u2019s refusal to approve the horizontal method, therefore, did not constitute a breach of contract by the State. Illustrative are those portions of the specifications which showed that the \u201c soffit \u201d, or under side, of the girders was to be on the bottom when the girder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>was in a vertical position, that the <em>\u201c </em>screed \u201d, or the surface of the concrete exposed to the free air during fabrication, was to be on top of the girder, thereby necessarily indicating that vertical fabrication was called for and, finally, that1 \u2018 windows \u2019 \u2019 were to be used through which to pour the concrete and it is conceded that such \u20181 windows \u2019 \u2019 were unnecessary when horizontal fabrication is the method used. Taken together, these separate requirements of the specifications which all necessarily point to vertical fabrication indicate that the courts below were correct in their conclusion that the State did not breach its contract with the claimant as to this issue and the dismissal of the second cause of action should, therefore, be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Claimant\u2019s fourth cause of action sought recovery for two items of alleged \u201c extra \u201d work not called for by the contract. The State, however, contends that the items were provided for by the original contract and by a supplemental agreement entered into between the claimant and the State. As to the first item of asserted extra work, the preparation of the concrete deck prior to the application of the waterproofing substance, the original specifications called for such preparation and the mere fact that the supplemental agreement referred to such preparation as work to be done under the agreement cannot alter the fact that such work was already required to be done by the terms of the original contract specifications and was, therefore, not <em>\u2018 </em>\u2018 extra \u2019 \u2019 work. The second item of alleged extra work involved the surface area required by the contract specifications to be covered with the waterproofing substance. The Court of Claims found that claimant covered only the area called for by the contract and was paid in full therefor and the Appellate Division affirmed. Suffice it to say that there is ample evidence to support that determination. Accordingly, the dismissal of the fourth cause of action was properly affirmed by the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">The order of the Appellate Division is modified to the extent that the claim for interest is allowed to the extent limited above and is otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Chief Judge Fuld and Judges Scileppi, Beegan, Keating. Beeitel and Jasen concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">Order modified, with costs, in accordance with the opinion herein, and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
