We find that the order is not appealable and accordingly dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">In November of 1980, the Plan filed suit against defendant Ad Compositors to recover arrearages in pension plan contributions allegedly due the Plan as a third party beneficiary of a contract dated August 6, 1973, between Ad Compositors and Los Angeles International Typographical Union No. 174. According to the complaint, Ad Compositors\u2019 accrued liability as of August 31, 1980, amounted to approximately $53,680. In its answer, Ad Compositors asserted as one of its defenses the existence of an agreement between itself and the Plan to settle the Plan\u2019s claims for $25,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-12\">In March of 1982, the Plan filed an application seeking a writ to attach property of Ad Compositors in the sum of $55,269.39, the amount it asserted was the presently accrued liability under the contract. After a hearing, the trial court denied the application, finding the Plan had failed to demonstrate \u201cthat it will probably recover a judgment in a fixed or readily ascertainable amount.\u201d (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 483.010.) The Plan appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>We cannot consider the Plan\u2019s various arguments seeking to reverse the trial court\u2019s decision. Generally, a judgment or order is appealable only if the right to appeal it is expressly granted by statute. <em>(Skaff v. Small Claims Court </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 76, 78 [65 Cal.Rptr. 65, 435 P.2d 825].) The right to appeal from orders relating to attachments is limited by statute to orders \u201cdischarging or refusing to discharge\u201d attachments that have already been executed. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 904.1, subd. (e), 904.2 subd. (f).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The only case to consider the matter concluded that \u201c[t]here is no statutory right of appeal from an order denying an application for a writ of attachment.\u201d <em>(San Diego Wholesale Credit Men\u2019s Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 458, 462, fn. omitted [110 Cal.Rptr. 657].) Our research confirms this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The Plan urges us to review the order despite the lack of specific statutory authority to do so. It cites the exception to the \u201cone final judgment rule\u201d which permits an appeal from an interlocutory judgment that \u201crequires as a collateral matter, the immediate payment of money, or the performance forthwith of an act [citations]; or has the effect of a final determination of property rights [citations].\u201d <em>(Degnan </em>v. <em>Morrow </em>(1969) 2 Cal.App.3d 358, 364-365 [82 Cal.Rptr. 557] [order providing for immediate sale and disposition of proceeds of real property owned by a partnership is appealable]; see also <em>Stockton </em>v. <em>Rattner </em>(1972) 22 Cal.App.3d 965, 968-970 [99 Cal.Rptr. 787] [order authorizing sale of real property and ordering the proceeds to be impounded is appealable].) This exception, however, is inapplicable in the instant case, where the denial of the writ <em>prevents </em>the \u201cimmediate payment of money\u201d or the \u201cperformance forthwith of an act\u201d or the determination of <em>any </em>property right, whether final or temporary. (See <em>Stockton </em>v. <em>Rattner, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.3d at p. 969 [the denial, as distinguished from the grant, of a motion to sell property held under attachment affects no property rights and is not appealable].)</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Finally, the Plan contends that the denial of the writ seriously impairs and therefore determines its property rights because Ad Compositors\u2019 business allegedly is in a precarious financial condition. The initial establishment of the nature and extent of the Plan\u2019s \u201crights\u201d to Ad Compositors\u2019 property, however, is the heart of the lawsuit and prerequisite to <em>any </em>recovery; it follows that the impairment of these \u201crights\u201d can in no way be described as a collateral matter. The denial of the writ simply is not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Stephens, Acting P. J., and Hastings, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The latest amendment to these sections, to become effective July 1, 1983, expands the right of appeal to the original order <em>granting </em>a writ of attachment, but significantly contains no reference to orders <em>denying </em>the writ.

(1982) pp. 701, 717.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
