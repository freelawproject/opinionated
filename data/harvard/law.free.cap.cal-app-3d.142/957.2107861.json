We affirm and hold that Government Code sections 31729 and 31730 do not compel the continuance of a disability retirement if the retiree is substantially able to perform the duties of a given permanent assignment within the office or department in which he or she was employed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b801-10\">The trial court\u2019s finding that appellant is no longer disabled from performing his duties as a deputy sheriff is supported by substantial evidence. Ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>pellant was injured on July <em>4, </em>1972, while on duty as a deputy sheriff. As a result thereof, he remained off work on disability until approximately September 1975, at which time he was placed on disability retirement due to orthopedic and ocular problems. His orthopedic problems at that time were best summarized by his primary physician as \u201cpersistent mechanical derangement of the cervical and lumbosacral spine which will have to continue to be managed by limitation of his physical activities. It is felt that he must be considered as having disability precluding heavy lifting, repeated bending and stooping and all other work categories involving physical activities greater than the category mentioned above.\u201d His ocular problem then consisted of a mild diplopia \u201cin extreme lateral gaze and in gaze above the midline\u201d with \u201cvision of 20/20 in each eye,\u201d and \u201cminimal residual impairment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">During his disability retirement, appellant completed college, received a B.A. degree, worked for a time as manager of the security department of a major department store, and subsequently obtained employment as a claims adjuster for a large casualty insurance carrier. His job as an adjuster required him to drive approximately 300 miles per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">In 1978, the county required appellant to undergo a medical examination pursuant to section 31729, at which time his physical condition had improved significantly. The diagnostic impression of the examining orthopedic surgeon was: \u201cHealed fracture of the left wrist and some mild chronic low back pain and an old healed fracture of the left index finger with slight limitation of extension, overall no functional disability. No treatment is indicated.\u201d One ophthalmologist found he might have difficulty driving a pursuit vehicle, but could \u201cmanage most other occupations without difficulty.\u201d Another noted that \u201chis diplopia is mainly in the extremes of gaze and seems to have little effect on his behavior. The phoria in primary position is of such small degree that it would be quite unusual if he were not able to control it. It would be very few circumstances under which the residue described above would have a significant impact on Mr. Schrier\u2019s behavior or ability to perform.\u201d The disability evaluation team of the department of social services concluded that appellant was \u201ccurrently capable of performing the duties of deputy sheriff.\u201d The assistant sheriff in charge of administrative services testified that the sheriff\u2019s office has many assignments that do not involve pursuit driving. Since appellant had been driving at least 300 miles per week without difficulty in the course of his employment as an adjuster, normal driving is not an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-8\">Both parties agree that the trial court was required to, and did, exercise its independent judgment on the evidence and the record before the board. (See <em>Strumsky </em>v. <em>San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 28 [112 Cal.Rptr. 805, 520 P.2d 29].)  Our review is restricted to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>\u201cdetermination of whether the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the respondent, sustains the findings of the trial court, resolving any reasonable doubts in favor of those findings.\u201d <em>(Harmon </em>v. <em>Board of Retirement </em>(1976) 62 Cal.App.3d 689, 692 [133 Cal.Rptr. 154].)  The facts herein constitute substantial evidence of appellant\u2019s recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Appellant contends that <em>Newman </em>v. <em>City of Oakland Retirement Bd. </em>(1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 450 [145 Cal.Rptr. 628], requires reversal, but <em>Newman </em>is distinguishable. In <em>Newman, </em>the physical condition of the retired officer had not changed from the date of retirement, and the city\u2019s decision to reinstate the officer and terminate his pension was based on an admitted change of policy within the police department regarding standards under which disabled officers might be recalled. The instant case presents a retiree whose physical condition has improved significantly to the point where he is fit for duty, and no change of standards is involved. Sections 31729 and 31730 were applicable at all relevant times. The standard applicable to appellant is set forth in section 31729 as \u201cincapacitated for service in the office or department of the county or district where he was employed and in the position held by him when retired for disability.\u201d When retired for disability, appellant was in the position of deputy sheriff. The only current limitation which affects his incapacity is the possible inability to drive a pursuit vehicle. However, there are many permanent full-time positions in the sheriff\u2019s office which do not require vehicular pursuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">Appellant urges a \u201cfull range of duties\u201d construction of section 31729 to impose the requirement that unless he is fully fit for vehicular pursuit, he be found incapacitated. Existing authority does not support this position. While no cases specifically construing sections 31729 and 31730 can be located, similar language has been defined. <em>Mansperger </em>v. <em>Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System </em>(1970) 6 Cal.App.3d 873 [86 Cal.Rptr. 450] held that \u201c \u2018incapacity for the performance of duty\u2019 within section 21022 means the <em>substantial </em>inability of the applicant to perform his usual duties. \u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 876, italics in original.) In <em>Barber v. Retirement Board </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 273 [95 Cal.Rptr. 657] the phrase \u201cincapacitated for the performance of his duty\u201d in the San Francisco Charter section relating to firemen was construed to refer to <em>\u201cduties required to be performed in a given permanent assignment within the department </em>. . . .\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 277-278, italics in original.) <em>Craver </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 42 Cal. App.3d 76 [117 Cal.Rptr. 534], dealt with the similar issue of physically disabled police officers. Citing <em>Barber, supra, Craver </em>held that, \u201c. . . where there are permanent light duty assignments and a person who becomes \u2018incapacitated for the performance of his duty . . . shall be retired,\u2019 that person should not be retired if he can perform duties in a given permanent assignment within the department. He need not be able to perform any and all duties performed by firemen or, in the instant case, policemen. Public policy supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"962\">*962</page-number>employment and utilization of the handicapped. <em>(Barber, supra.) </em>If a person can be employed in such an assignment, he should not be retired with payment of a disability retirement pension. \u201d <em>(Craver, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.3d at pp. 79-80.) Recently, in <em>O\u2019Toole </em>v. <em>Retirement Board </em>(1983) 139 Cal.App.3d 600 [188 Cal.Rptr. 853], another division of this court construed the phrase \u201cincapacitated for the performance of his duty\u201d in the San Francisco Charter section relating to policemen, and held that if the injured police officer \u201cwas able to perform the duties of his permanent assignment within the department, under the <em>Barber-Craver </em>standard, he should not be retired with a disability pension.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 603.) Most persuasive, however, is <em>Harmon </em>v. <em>Board of Retirement, supra, </em>62 Cal.App.3d at pp. 694-695, in which the court, defining the phrase \u201cpermanently incapacitated physically or mentally for the performance of his duties in the service\u201d as contained in section 31724, adopted the construction of <em>Mansperger </em>and <em>Barber, supra. </em>Sections 31724, 31729 and 31730 are all in article 10, entitled \u201cDisability Retirement,\u201d of the County Employees\u2019 Retirement Law. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 31450 et seq.) They were enacted simultaneously, deal with the same subject matter and are <em>in pari materia. </em>As such, they should be harmonized and similarly construed. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Navarro </em>(1972) 7 Cal.3d 248, 273-274 [102 Cal.Rptr. 137, 497 P.2d 481]; <em>Mannheim </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 3 Cal.3d 678, 687 [91 Cal.Rptr. 585, 478 P.2d 17]; <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>State Bd. of Education </em>(1981) 117 Cal.App.3d 132, 141 [172 Cal.Rptr. 748]; <em>In re Marriage of Pinto </em>(1972) 28 Cal.App.3d 86, 89 [104 Cal.Rptr. 371].)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">With established rules of statutory construction in mind (see <em>Palos Verdes Faculty Assn. </em>v. <em>Palos Verdes Unified Sch. Dist. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 650, 658-659 [147 Cal.Rptr. 359, 580 P.2d 1155]) and the persuasive rationale of <em>Mansperger, Barber, Craver, O\u2019Toole </em>and <em>Harmon, supra, </em>as precedent, we reject appellant\u2019s suggested construction of sections 31729 and 31730.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Appellant argues that section 31730 is unconstitutional on due process and equal protection grounds, contending that governmental employees in other retirement systems have different reinstatement rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The fact that the Legislature has placed other classes of governmental employees into different retirement systems does not, without more, deny appellant equal protection of the laws. The Constitution does not require uniform treatment; it requires only that the basis for classification be reasonable. <em>(Bilyeu </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement System </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 618, 623 [24 Cal.Rptr. 562, 375 P.2d 442].)  \u201cWide discretion is vested in the Legislature in making the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>classification and every presumption is in favor of the validity of the statute; the decision of the Legislature as to what is a sufficient distinction to warrant the classification will not be overthrown by the courts unless it is palpably arbitrary and beyond rational doubt erroneous.\u201d <em>(Sacramento M. U. Dist. </em>v. <em>P. G. &amp; E. Co. </em>(1942) 20 Cal.2d 684, 693 [128 P.2d 529].)  The Legislature may reasonably classify peace officers and other employees differently. <em>(Bilyeu, supra.) </em>The distinctions between the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System and the County Employees\u2019 Retirement Law have been recognized as valid classifications <em>(Pennington </em>v. <em>Workmen\u2019s Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1971) 20 Cal.App.3d 55, 58-60 [97 Cal.Rptr. 380]), and we cannot say that either system is arbitrary, unreasonable or erroneous beyond rational doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">Appellant\u2019s claim that the trial court failed to make findings concerning a \u201cfull range of duties\u201d standard is irrelevant. The proper standard is that contained in sections 31729 and 31730, as defined in <em>Harmon, supra, </em>62 Cal.App.3d 689, and again herein, and the trial court properly applied that standard. Appellant cites no relevant authority to support his remaining contention that his return to work under the provisions of section 31730 will deprive him of retirement benefits as a safety member. Further, this contention is based on an unsupported factual supposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">Low, P. J., and King, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied June 8, 1983, and appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied July 27, 1983.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b801-11\"> Government Code section 31729 states: \u201cThe board may require any disability beneficiary under age 55 to undergo medical examination. The examination shall be made by a physician or surgeon appointed by the board at the place of residence of the beneficiary or other place mutually agreed upon. Upon the basis of the examination the board shall determine whether the disability beneficiary is still physically or mentally incapacitated for service in the office or department of the county or district where he was employed and in the position held by him when retired for disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-12\">Government Code section 31730 states: \u201cIf the board determines that the beneficiary is not incapacitated, and his or her employer offers to reinstate that beneficiary, his or her retirement allowance shall be canceled forthwith, and he or she shall be reinstated in the county service pursuant to the regulations of the county or district for reemployment of personnel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-13\">Unless otherwise stated, all further statutory references are to the Government Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b804-8\">Appellant cites the Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (Gov.
