The matter having been submitted upon an agreed statement there is no dispute as to the facts. These include the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-10\">\u201cDuring the entire period of 1974 through 1978, inclusive, defendant maintained its corporate headquarters within the City of Los Angeles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-11\">\u201cDuring each of the years 1974 through 1978, inclusive, defendant engaged in the business of selling eggs at wholesale within the City of Los Angeles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-12\">\u201cDuring each of the years 1974 through 1978, inclusive, defendant had interest income which was derived exclusively from its subsidiary corporations in an amount equal to the amount of interest expense incurred by defendant. The reason that the interest income was equal to the interest expense was that defendant did not have excess cash on hand from which to make loans, as necessary, to its subsidiary corporations. Rather, defendant borrowed from its principal bank according to its subsidiaries\u2019 needs and charged the same interest rate as charged by the bank. All repayments by subsidiaries were used by defendant to immediately repay the bank.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-13\">\u201cFor the tax years 1976 through 1978, inclusive, defendant reported gross receipts from selling goods, wares or merchandise at wholesale and paid tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>thereon at the rate of $1.00 per $1,000.00 of gross receipts or fractional part thereof pursuant to Los Angeles Municipal Code Section 21.166, but did not report any gross receipts from interest income and did not pay any tax attributable thereto.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-4\">\u201cDuring the calendar years 1974 through 1977, inclusive, defendant had interest income in the following amounts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\"><em>Year </em>1974 1975 1976 1977</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJu\"><em>Gross Receipts </em>$300,399 217,518 155,597 53,862</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">\u201cPursuant to an audit of defendant\u2019s business records plaintiff\u2019s City Clerk included interest income in gross receipts and determined that defendant had underpaid its business taxes for tax years 1975 through 1978, inclusive, by the total amount of $582.78.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">\u201cOn January 19, 1979, plaintiff\u2019s City Clerk levied, and sent notice of, an assessment against defendant for business taxes for 1975, 1976, 1977 and 1978, which included principal and interest in the total sum of $721.09, based upon the difference between the amount of tax paid by defendant and the amount determined by plaintiff\u2019s City Clerk to be owing. A true and correct copy of said notice of assessment is attached hereto, marked Exhibit \u2018A\u2019 and incorporated herein by this reference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">\u201cOn February 7, 1979 defendant paid to plaintiff $200.97 in payment of all portions of said assessment other than the tax attributable to interest income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">\u201cOn April 3, 1979 a hearing on said assessment was held before a Board of Review, composed of representatives of plaintiff\u2019s City Attorney, Controller and City Clerk, and on June 12, 1979 said Board of Review made its decision affirming said assessment except for giving credit for the payment of $200.97 made by defendant. ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">On the basis of the foregoing facts, the trial court made the following express conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-11\">\u201c1. Defendant is subject to tax under Los Angeles Municipal Code Section 21.108 and 21.166 for having engaged in the business of lending money to its subsidiary corporations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>\u201c2. The amount of interest income received from said subsidiary corporations constitutes taxable gross receipts under said Section 21.166.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-4\">\u201c3. The assessment of January 19, 1979 was properly levied by plaintiff\u2019s City Clerk against defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-5\">\u201c4. The decision of the Board of Review regarding said assessment was correct and proper.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-6\">\u201c5. The amount of business tax now due and owing from defendant to plaintiff under the provisions of the Los Angeles Municipal Code is as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-7\"><em>Principal </em>$381.81</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay1\"><em>Interest </em>$234.21</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A--\"><em>Penalty </em>$38.18</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATF\"><em>Total </em>$654.20</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b486-9\">\u201c6. That plaintiff have judgment against defendant in the sum of $654.20, together with interest on the sum of $381.81 at the rate of three-quarters of one percent per month, being $2.86 per month, from October 1981 until judgment is entered herein, together with its cost of suit herein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">Defendant urges that although its owners have elected, presumably for sound financial reasons, to conduct their business activities by means of entirely separate and distinct legal entities, nonetheless, and despite the clear provisions of section 21.108 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code, it should be allowed to cast aside all their corporate veils in this instance. We cannot agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">Subsection (a) of section 21.108 provides that the city license fee for \u201ceach person engaged in the business of lending money, advancing credit, or lending credit or arranging for the loan of money or advancing of credit or lending of credit for and on his own behalf or on behalf of any other person as principal, agent or broker . . . shall be $750.\u201d However, subsection (c) thereof permits a person so engaged to avoid the payment of such tax if, during his conduct of another business, his lending, or credit arranging activities are carried on \u201csolely with customers or suppliers of that other business\u201d or \u201cpersons who either stand in the relation of parent or subsidiary to him, or are so constituted as to have substantially common ownership with him. \u201d In these latter instances, if the license tax for the person\u2019s other business is \u201cmeasured by gross receipts, all interest and other charges received as a result of the activity described in subsection (a) shall be included in the gross receipts by which the tax elsewhere imposed by this Article is measured . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">For this reason during the four years appellant was lending money or otherwise arranging credit for its subsidiaries it was charged only $381.81 rather than the $3,000 that would have otherwise been due if it had so conducted itself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>with strangers who were neither customers, suppliers, nor related to it by a common ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">Nonetheless, appellant urges, in essence, that we should declare section 21.108 completely void as to it, and presumably all other business entities in the city who engage in any similar lending or credit arranging activities, so long as such activities are (1) made in a profitless manner, and (2) restricted to borrowers who share common ownership. It bases this argument on the semantic proposition that since it was not directly profiting from its lending activities, a fact that in these difficult economic times is also true of a number of banks and savings and loans, it should not be deemed to be \u201cengaged in the <em>business </em>of lending money.\u201d (\u00a7 21.108; italics added.) However, unlike the considerations underlying the income tax, profit or loss play no role in the determination of a licensing tax, whether the latter be computed upon \u201cgross receipts,\u201d \u201cinterest or other charges,\u201d or simply set at a fixed flat fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Identical arguments were rejected in <em>Rexall Drug Co. </em>v. <em>Peterson </em>(1952) 113 Cal.App.2d 528 [248 P.2d 433], and <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Clinton Merchandising Corp. </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 675 [25 Cal.Rptr. 859, 375 P.2d 851]. In <em>Rexall, </em>a drug company was providing \u201caccounting, financial, personnel, legal, executive managerial, and directive services to its subsidiaries\u201d charging each of them \u201cits proportionate cost thereof\u201d but without profit. <em>(Rexall, </em>p. 529.) The court held that such activities, nonetheless, brought Rexall\u2019s activity within catchall section 21.190 of the code observing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">\u201cWhile in exceptional cases, to prevent fraud or injustice, the law will look through what has been termed the corporate veil [citation], in tax matters a corporation and its stockholders are deemed separate entities. [Citation.] Ownership of capital stock in one corporation by another does not itself create identity of corporate interest as between the two. [Citation.] To do otherwise would lead to endless confusion and trouble in the imposition of taxes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-7\">\u201cBearing in mind that each of Rexall\u2019s subsidiary corporations is an independent legal entity, it becomes manifest that the transactions here in question were subject to business license tax by the city.\u201d (113 Cal.App.2d at p. 530.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">In <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Clinton Merchandising Corp., supra, </em>58 Cal.2d 675, Clinton was an affiliate of various sales corporations to whom it both (1) supplied merchandise, and (2) acted \u201cas the central managing, accounting and disbursing office for these stores. \u201d (P. 677.) Our Supreme Court adhered to the <em>Rexall </em>approach, and held that the first activities constituted \u201csales\u201d for which a \u201cgross receipts\u201d tax under section 21.166 must be paid and that <em>\u201cthe distribution of merchandise \u2018at cost, \u2019 </em>rather than upon a profit-making mark-up [did not] change the situation.\u201d (P. 680; italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b488-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>As to the second aspect of Clinton\u2019s operation, the court also adopted the <em>Rexall </em>rationale, although pointing out that under the measuring standard set forth in section 21.190, as opposed to that in section 21.166, Clinton\u2019s \u201cgross receipts\u201d were to be determined by the charges made therefor, not by the amount of the reimbursement payments it chanced to make on behalf of its affiliates. However, the court did not suggest, as appellant urges, that if Clinton had made no \u201cprofitmaking\u201d charges for even these latter services it could have avoided payment of all appropriate licensing fees therefor. In any event, we are not here faced with this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">The instant situation does not involve catchall section 21.190, nor an unknown or undefined methodology for computing the basis for the prescribed license tax. Here, appellant supplied its subsidiaries with specific items, i.e., sums of money. Just as the clothing supplied by Clinton to its affiliates resulted in the imposition of a gross receipts tax measured in accordance with section 21.166, so the monies supplied by appellant created a similar tax measurable in accordance with section 21.108, i.e., upon the \u201cinterest\u201d charged therefor. In each instance, of course, it is immaterial whether or not a profit resulted to the supplying corporation. Therefore, the fact the monies appellant lent its subsidiaries in this instance were derived from outside sources is equally irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">We assume that from a bookkeeping point of view, appellant\u2019s practice of lending its subsidiaries money at the same interest rates it paid therefor, constituted an immediate paper \u201closs\u201d by reason of the man hours expended by its employees in such a \u201cprofitless\u201d function. Presumably, however, the overall operation of both parent and subsidiaries benefited thereby.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Nonetheless, in its reply brief appellant suggests that in the future it may seek to avoid even the most nominal tax consequences of its present financial arrangement by having each of its subsidiaries deal directly with the lending institutions with appellant merely acting as their guarantor. We express no opinion as to whether or not such modified activity would remove appellant from the broad reach of section 21.108. We need merely note that if appellant finds it advantageous to conduct its operations in a fashion that does bring it outside this section, it is certainly free to do so. However, what it, and the innumerable other companies operating in Los Angeles through complex interlocking parent and subsidiary corporations, may not do, is require the city to expend the time of its limited personnel investigating their infinite variety in an effort to determine whether or not, \u201cform should prevail over substance\u201d in a given instance. Legal entities are not such ephemeral creatures that they may be made to appear and disappear as best suits a taxpayer\u2019s passing desires.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Roth, P. J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b489-5\">BEACH, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7X\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">The majority makes the same error made by the trial court and the city review board. They all assume without authority, explanation or reference to specific definitions in any part of the city ordinance, any statute or decision that appellant Olson Farms (Olson) is \u201cengaged in the business\u201d of lending money. Clear and solid demonstration of this basic fact is an absolute prerequisite to the imposition of the tax under Los Angeles Municipal Code section 21.108.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Olson is not seeking an exemption from the tax. Rather, the City of Los Angeles is seeking to apply the tax to one who is not clearly in the money-lending business. Accordingly, the burden is on the City of Los Angeles to demonstrate that the operative facts making applicable section 21.108 of its tax ordinance are clear, unambiguous and unequivocal. <em>(County of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Jones </em>(1939) 13 Cal.2d 554 [90 P.2d 802].) The record before us does not demonstrate that to be the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Section 21.108, subsection (c) under which the city seeks to tax Olson requires at least three essential parts for its application. They are; (1) being \u201cengaged in the business\u201d of lending money (2) to a subsidiary and (3) dealing confined to the subsidiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Parts (2) and (3) above are stipulated facts. But part (1) is not. The loan of money to the subsidiaries was an activity by Olson with its subsidiaries. But an activity is not necessarily a business. Although the activity is done as part of another business, it still does not make Olson \u201cengaged in the business\u201d of lending money. Olson is in the wholesale egg-selling business. It paid the legitimate tax on its wholesale sale of eggs under the gross receipts tax. (\u00a7 21.166.) No one, the city review board, the trial court or the majority opinion, explains clearly how the bare fact of an incidental activity with its subsidiary justifies the conclusion that it is thereby proven or established as a matter of law that Olson was also \u201cengaged in the business\u201d of lending money.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">The majority discounts as a test the use of the fact that no profit was made. By doing so it also diminishes the fact that the purpose of engaging in a business is to make a profit. Thus the majority equally rejects as irrelevant, the helpful guide of considering the purpose of Olson\u2019s activity. That purpose was accom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>modation to another rather than becoming a money lender.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I respectfully suggest that in this regard the majority errs.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Although profitmaking or receipt of other benefit or advantage may not be the sole determining factor or even in combination with other elements the most important, yet it is nonetheless more important than the majority allows. Courts in other cases defining the terms \u201cbeing in business\u201d or \u201cbusiness\u201d have used the \u201cprofit\u201d test primarily, if not exclusively, e.g., <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Cohen </em>(1954) 124 Cal.App.2d 225 [268 P.2d 183]; other cases, for example, allude to profit-making as a secondary aid or construe other benefits as equivalent to taxable \u201cprofit,\u201d <em>Union League Club </em>v. <em>Johnson </em>(1941) 18 Cal.2d 275 [115 P.2d 425]; or distinguish mere \u201cincidental activity\u201d from \u201cprofitmaking activity,\u201d <em>Child </em>v. <em>Warne </em>(1961) 194 Cal.App.2d 623 [15 Cal.Rptr. 437]; <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Clinton Merchandising Corp. </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 675 [25 Cal.Rptr. 859, 375 P.2d 851].</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Subsection (c) of section 21.108 provides that \u201call <em>interest </em>and <em>other charges </em>received as a result of the <em>activity described in subsection(a) </em>shall be included in the gross receipts . . .\u201d (to be taxed under \u00a7 21.166). There are two significant features in this phrase: (1) the activity described refers to subsection (a). There, the imposition of the tax is described as applicable not in terms of persons who engage in an \u201cactivity\u201d but expressly to persons \u201cengaged in the business. \u201d As explained, that feature is a predicate, not here demonstrated present, to the section\u2019s application. We lack fact applied to clear authority. (2) Olson did not make a charge for its services nor did it retain the interest collected but merely handled it by passing it on in full to the bank. The collecting and handling of money, which is not a charge for interest nor received for any other services even though it results from the activity of aiding its subsidiaries, is not necessarily \u201cbusiness\u201d income or receipt gross or otherwise. <em>(City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>Clinton Merchandising Corp., supra, </em>58 Cal.2d 675.) It is not received from \u201cbeing engaged in the business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">I would reverse the judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b489-10\"> All references to \u201csection\u201d followed by number are to Los Angeles Municipal Code sections.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The ordinance lists the taxable businesses and the form of tax applicable to them by the nature of the business. Section 21.108 is entitled \u201cMoney Lenders,\u201d and is located between the provisions applicable to \u201cLaundry, Cleaning, Dyeing,\u201d etc. (\u00a7 21.102) and \u201cCashing Checks\u201d (\u00a7 21.108.1) businesses.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
