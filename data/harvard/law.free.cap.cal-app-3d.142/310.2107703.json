In an information filed by the Los Angeles County District Attorney, appellant was charged in count I with driving while under the influence of alcohol and in so doing causing bodily injury and death to Carrie Lee (Veh. Code, \u00a7 23101, now \u00a7 23153), and in count II with vehicular manslaughter (Pen. Code, \u00a7 192, subd. 3(a)). Appellant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1538.5) was denied. After a jury trial, appellant was found guilty on both counts. He was sentenced to state prison for the upper term of three years on each count, the sentences to run concurrently. The sentence on count I was stayed (Pen. Code, \u00a7 654). On appeal, he contends:</p>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>(1) The trial court erroneously denied the motion to suppress blood sample test results;</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">(2) The trial court erroneously refused certain jury instructions requested by the defense, thereby denying appellant his right to a fair trial;</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">(3) The probation report was based upon second-hand, and not \u201caccurate and reliable\u201d information; and</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">(4) The trial court misapplied California Rules of Court, rule 421(a)(3), in imposing the upper term, because the victim was not \u201cparticularly vulnerable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">On June 15, 1980, at approximately 6 p.m., appellant, driving a blue Chevy Vega, was traveling west on Foothill Boulevard in Sunland, on the way to pick up his wife at her place of employment in Van Nuys. Carrie Lee, driving a brown Ford Pinto station wagon, was going eastbound on Foothill, on her way home from work. Greg Dinsmore, who was riding in the back of a Toyota pickup also westbound on Foothill, saw appellant\u2019s car traveling at approximately 50 miles per hour, whereas the rest of the traffic was going about 35 miles per hour.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant was traveling in the curb lane but swerved into the center lane to avoid a rear-end collision with the car in front of him. He went partially over the center divider strip (marked with yellow lines), swerved back into the center lane, and then swerved again over the center line and into the eastbound lane, striking Carrie Lee\u2019s vehicle head-on. According to Kenneth Thurman, who had been following appellant westbound on Foothill, appellant \u201ccompletely lost total control of his car.\u201d According to Dinsmore, Lee tried to avoid the collision but was unable to do so. This was corroborated by the testimony of Los Angeles Police Officer Michael Ogne, who stated that Lee\u2019s car left 20 feet of front wheel skid (resulting from locked wheels). There were no skid marks from appellant\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">Los Angeles Fire Department paramedics responded to the accident. One of the paramedics, Alan Bush, testified that while the paramedics were removing appellant from his vehicle, appellant emitted a strong odor of alcohol. To protect appellant in case of cervical injuries, they placed appellant on a \u201cback board\u201d and placed a cervical collar around his neck. While in the paramedic ambulance, appellant sat up on the board, removed the cerv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>ical collar, and began to yell abusive language at the paramedics. He also tried to punch the paramedics several times. There was a strong odor of alcohol from appellant\u2019s mouth every time he spoke.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Appellant and Carrie Lee were transported to Pacoima Memorial Hospital in the same ambulance. Lee\u2019s vital signs were poor and she was on a life support system while being transported.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Los Angeles Police Officer Carl Helm entered the room where appellant was being treated at the hospital. Appellant smelled strongly of alcohol,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and was also being loud, boisterous, and obnoxious. In Helm\u2019s opinion, appellant was definitely under the influence of alcohol. He told appellant that he was placing him under arrest and requested a blood sample. According to Helm, appellant said, \u201cSure, I\u2019ll give you a blood sample.\u201d The sample was taken by Dr. Andrew Kochan and tested by David Margolis, a chemist with the Los Angeles Police Department. The test result showed that appellant\u2019s blood alcohol content was .31, more than three times the amount required to invoke the presumption of intoxication under California law (former Veh. Code, \u00a7 23126, subd. (a)(3) now \u00a7 23155, subd. (a)(3)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Appellant was transported by police car from Pacoima Memorial Hospital to County USC Medical Center. Carrie Lee never regained consciousness and died after lying in a coma for 21 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">Appellant testified in his own defense, and denied being under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident. Appellant stated that June 18th was his day off and, after working on his truck in the morning, he had gone to the Cubby Hole, a beer bar, around 3 p.m. to eat lunch and shoot pool. He ate a burrito and consumed four 12-ounce bottles of beer between 3 and 6 p.m.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This was confirmed by Walter Culverhouse, part-owner of the Cub-by Hole, who was the bartender on duty that afternoon.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">Appellant\u2019s version of the accident was as follows: As he was proceeding westbound on Foothill Boulevard at about 40 miles per hour, the car in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>front of him slowed abruptly and appellant had to swerve into the center lane to avoid a rear-end collision. In doing so, he went slightly over the yellow line but returned immediately to the center lane. He turned his head sharply to look at the car he had just passed and his pipe came out of his mouth and landed on the seat. His pipe threw out some hot coals and he reached over to brush them olf the seat so it would not catch fire. He looked up, saw a car in front of him, and cranked the wheel hard to the right. The next thing he knew, he was in the paramedic ambulance.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Appellant admitted that he had been unpleasant with the paramedics, but said that his face hurt and he did not want them to touch it.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">With respect to the blood sample, appellant denied giving permission for a blood sample and did not recall anyone drawing blood from his arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">1. <em>Motion to Suppress. </em>Appellant contends that his motion to suppress the results of his blood test was erroneously denied because (1) he testified that he did not consent to the taking of the blood sample, (2) even assuming that he did give his consent, the People did not show that such consent was freely and voluntarily given, and (3) he was not advised of his right to choose among three types of tests (breath, blood or urine) as required under Vehicle Code section 13353.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">The question of consent arose by virtue of a conflict in the testimony between appellant and Officer Helms, which conflict was resolved by the trial court in favor of the officer.  The power to judge credibility of witnesses, resolve conflicts in testimony, weigh evidence and draw factual inferences, is vested in the trial court. Under the well-established principles of appellate review, all presumptions favor proper exercise of that power and the court\u2019s finding must be upheld if, as here, it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Keithley) (1975) 13 Cal.3d 406, 410 [118 Cal.Rptr. 617, 530 P.2d 585].)</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">Further, admission of the blood sample into evidence would have been proper even without the court\u2019s finding of express consent, since the taking of the blood sample was permissible under California\u2019s \u201cimplied consent\u201d law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Hawkins) (1972) 6 Cal.3d 757 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>[100 Cal.Rptr. 281, 493 P.2d 1145], the case upon which the trial court based its ruling denying the suppression motion, the Supreme Court stated: \u201cIt is clear that the Fourth Amendment does not bar a compulsory seizure, without a warrant, of a person\u2019s blood for the purposes of a blood alcohol test to determine intoxication, provided that the taking of the sample is done in a medically approved manner, is incident to a lawful arrest, and is based upon the reasonable belief that the person is intoxicated.\u201d (6 Cal.3d at p. 761.)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The court went on to discuss the legislative intent behind California\u2019s \u201cimplied consent\u201d law: \u201cAlthough it is clear under <em>Schmerber [Schmerber </em>v. <em>California, </em>384 U.S. 757 (16 L.Ed.2d 908, 86 S.Ct. 1826)] that a person who has been lawfully arrested may have a blood sample forcibly removed without his consent, provided it is done in a reasonable, medically approved manner and provided further that the arresting officer had probable cause to believe the arrestee was intoxicated, nevertheless such an episode remains an unpleasant, undignified and undesirable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\u201cHowever, the shocking number of injuries and deaths on the highways caused by drunk drivers has compelled society to adopt extreme measures in response. ... It is noteworthy that in [enacting section 13353], the Legislature took pains to condition its use upon a lawful arrest for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor and upon the reasonable belief of the peace officer that the arrestee was in fact.so driving.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 764-765.)</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">In this case, the three criteria set forth in <em>Hawkins </em>were, as the trial court found, clearly met. Appellant was under arrest when the blood sample was taken, Officer Helm having correctly concluded that appellant was under the influence of alcohol, and the sample was taken in a hospital by a physician, in a medically approved manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">Appellant argues further that the test results should have been suppressed because Officer Helm admittedly did not discuss with him the choice of three possible tests, blood, breath or urine, as required by section 13353. However, this omission does not violate any constitutional right. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brannon </em>(1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 971, 975-976 [108 Cal.Rptr. 620]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ryan </em>(1981) 116 Cal.App.3d 168, 182 [171 Cal.Rptr. 854].) As stated by the court in <em>Ryan: </em>\u201cAs pointed out in cases, the immediate purpose of section 13353, the implied consent law, is to obtain the best evidence of blood alcohol content at the time of the arrest of a person who is reasonably believed to be driving while intoxicated. Its ultimate purpose is to inhibit intoxicated persons from driving on the highways. [Citations.] It is also well recognized that, as a matter of public policy, it is desirable to obtain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>a sample of one of the tests in a noncoercive fashion thereby substituting volition for compulsion. [Citations.]</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">\u201cHowever, the desirability of obtaining blood samples in a noncoercive manner by one of the tests provided for in section 13353 may not be equated with constitutionality.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Since appellant\u2019s constitutional rights were not violated by virtue of the failure of Officer Helm to advise him that he had a choice of three kinds of tests,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the trial court correctly denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">2. <em>Jury Instructions. </em> Without any supporting authority or citation to case law, appellant contends that by refusing to give requested defense jury instructions the trial court denied him his right to a fair trial and due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The defense submitted 11 proposed instructions lettered A through K. During a discussion regarding which instructions would be given to the jury, the court said: \u201cAll right, the defense has submitted instructions with counsel, both counsel in chambers. The court will allow defense instructions A, B, C, D, and E. The court will reject and [djisallow instructions F, G, H, I, J, K, either on the basis it\u2019s an improper statement of the law or it\u2019s covered by other instructions that the court is giving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">Appellant makes no argument with respect to the refused instructions F, H, I and K, apparently conceding that the court\u2019s ruling was correct as to those instructions. However, he claims that the court\u2019s refusal to give instructions \u201cG\u201d and \u201cJ\u201d was error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">The crux of requested instruction \u201cG\u201d was that the defendant need only raise a reasonable doubt to rebut the presumption of \u201cunder the influence\u201d created by a chemical test showing of a .10 percent blood alcohol. This merely duplicates CALJIC No. 16.834, given on the court\u2019s own motion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>The requested instruction \u201cJ\u201d purported to address the requirements for a finding of guilt on count I: \u201cIf you find as a fact that the defendant was operating a vehicle on a public highway, you must also find as a fact he was driving under the influence of an alcoholic beverage before you can find him guilty of Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u201cThe presumption that defendant was under the influence of alcohol if the results of the analysis of his blood were 0.10% or more, as defined in these instructions, may be overcome if the defendant merely raises a reasonable doubt as to the existence of the presumed fact.\u201d The second paragraph of this instruction merely duplicates CALJIC No. 16.834. Further, the instruction was an incomplete statement of the law, as it not only failed to set forth the elements of the crime, but failed to define \u201cunder the influence.\u201d The correct, and more complete statement of the law is set forth in CALJIC No. 12.60, also given on the court\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The court\u2019s refusal to give the requested special instructions did not result in any prejudice to appellant. He was adequately protected by the CALJIC instructions given on the court\u2019s own motion, which correctly and completely stated the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">3. Appellant next contends that the trial court was influenced in its sentencing determination by a probation report which contained \u201cinaccurate prejudicial unreliable second-hand information,\u201d specifically: (1) Frank Williams, who was interviewed by the probation officer, heard that on the day of the accident appellant had been offered a ride home from the bar because he was too drunk to drive; (2) Williams also heard that appellant laughed and joked saying that he, appellant, was never going to go to jail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>because he was going to beat the case; (3) appellant was unemployed; and (4) appellant drinks five or six beers after work, and twelve beers if he knows he is not going out.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u201c[T]he basic evil which should be avoided in probation reports tendered to the court for sentencing purposes is that the reports should not in any way be misleading or inaccurate.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Lutz </em>(1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 489, 497 [167 Cal.Rptr. 309].) The fact that a probation report contains hearsay is in itself not improper, but fundamental fairness demands that such reports be founded on accurate and reliable information. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Santana </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 773 [184 Cal.Rptr. 733].) If the defendant feels the probation report is insufficient or inaccurate, or is based upon unreliable information, he or she may present witnesses to counteract or correct any portion of the report. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Valdivia </em>(1960) 182 Cal.App.2d 145 [5 Cal.Rptr. 832].)</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">The court indicated that it would not consider any of the statements attributed to Frank Williams unless Williams was available to testify in person. Williams then testified that (1) he had often seen appellant drinking beer at meetings of a CB club which they both attended, and (2) an individual by the name of Pat Poulson told him that appellant was \u201claughing and joking\u201d and said he would never go to jail because he was going to \u201cbeat the case.\u201d The court specifically stated that it took Williams\u2019 statements in the context in which they were made, that is, \u201cthat this is something that Mr. Williams had heard from other than the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">According to the probation report, the source of information with respect to appellant\u2019s drinking habits was appellant himself, and not his wife as he claims. Appellant\u2019s wife also testified at the probation and sentencing hearing that the statement attributed to appellant in the probation report did not sound like something appellant would say, and that the most appellant would drink would be one or two beers.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">With respect to the report\u2019s indication that appellant was unemployed, this was an accurate statement of the situation as it existed when the report was made, since appellant was incarcerated at the time. The report certainly does not suggest that appellant was chronically unemployed, and in fact the probation officer set forth appellant\u2019s complete employment history including his service with the Marine Corps in Vietnam.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">Appellant was afforded an ample opportunity to contradict any statements in the probation report which he felt were inaccurate or misleading. The defense was able to cross-examine Frank Williams about the statements attributed to him in the probation report, and the information with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>to appellant\u2019s drinking habits was contradicted by appellant\u2019s wife, who testified for the defense at the probation and sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">Appellant fails to recognize the one factor which most influenced the court in its sentencing determination. In the court\u2019s words, this was \u201cthe fact that this defendant, knowing that he had taken the life of another person by virtue of his drinking alcohol, still continued to drink alcohol.\u201d Thus, the testimony of appellant\u2019s wife that when he did drink he had \u201conly one or two beers\u201d was of very little help to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">4. In sentencing appellant to state prison for the upper term, the court cited the following factors in aggravation:</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">(1) The victim was particularly vulnerable (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 421 (a)(3));<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">(2) \u201cThe defendant had a high blood alcohol reading, indicating that a considerable amount of alcohol was consumed during the day;\u201d and</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">(3) The defendant had a \u201ccomplete lack of remorse,\u201d evidenced by'the fact that \u201cthis defendant, knowing that he had taken the life of another person by virtue of his drinking alcohol, still continued to drink alcohol.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">Appellant contends that there was no evidence to support the court\u2019s finding that the victim was \u201cparticularly vulnerable\u201d within the meaning of rule 421(a)(3), and therefore the use of this factor was \u201ccapricious, and was merely a ploy used to impose an excessive and illegal term.\u201d We hold that although this rule was in fact applied incorrectly, there were sufficient factors in aggravation to impose the upper term.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-11\">As used in the context of rule 421(a)(3), a \u201cparticularly vulnerable\u201d victim is one who is vulnerable \u201cin a special or unusual degree, to an extent greater than in other cases. Vulnerability means defenseless, unguarded, unprotected, accessible, assailable, one who is susceptible to the defendant\u2019s criminal act. An attack upon a vulnerable victim takes something less than intestinal fortitude. In the jargon of football players, it is a cheap shot.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 433, 436 [156 Cal.Rptr. 502].) Rule 421(a)(3) has thus far been applied exclusively in criminal cases involving violent felonies, where the age or physical characteristics of the victim, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>the circumstances under which the crime is committed, make the defendant\u2019s act especially contemptible.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">There are few individuals as \u201cdefenseless, unguarded, unprotected, accessible, assailable and susceptible\u201d as those who have the misfortune of being in the wrong place at the wrong time when a drunk driver takes to the road. All victims of drunk drivers are \u201cvulnerable victims,\u201d but it is precisely because they are <em>all </em>vulnerable that Carrie Lee cannot be considered to be vulnerable \u201cin a special or unusual degree, to an extent greater than in other cases.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.3d at p. 436.) While we can visualize extraordinary situations in which a drunk driving victim might be considered to be \u201cparticularly vulnerable,\u201d such a situation is not present here, and therefore the court erred in applying rule 421(a)(3) to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">This error is not prejudicial, however, since the court stated two other reasons besides the above for selecting the upper term: (1) appellant\u2019s astonishingly high blood alcohol level, and (2) the fact that appellant continued to drink alcohol despite the fact that drinking alcohol had caused him to take the life of another human being.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although these are not among the criteri a set forth in rule 421, rule 408 makes it clear that the factors listed in rule 421 are not exclusive and the sentencing judge may consider other criteria \u201creasonably related to the decision being made.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1982) 135 Cal.App.3d 343, 355 [185 Cal.Rptr. 498].) The factors in aggravation stated by the court here met this requirement. The sentence imposed was appropriate and well-deserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Stephens, Acting P. J., and Ashby, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied May 11, 1983.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-10\"> Michael LePeilbet, an off-duty county marshal who was following Carrie Lee, testified that she was going approximately 30 miles per hour.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b285-11\">Officer R.

Seizing the moment, they proceeded, over a four-hour period, to sexually harass and abuse the two victims and a third woman resident who arrived later.
