Hoffmann-LaRoche, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>284, 491 A.2d 1257 (1985) applied to the student handbook.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">Anthony Romeo is an openly gay student at Seton Hall University. He claims he elected to attend Seton Hall in part because of its published antidiscrimination policy, which he argues created a \u201cunilateral contract\u201d binding upon it. On November 13, 2003, he applied to the Seton Hall University Department of Student Affairs for provisional recognition of a gay and lesbian student organization to be named \u201cTRUTH,\u201d an acronym for the phrase \u201cTrust, Respect and Unity at The Hall.\u201d Dr. Laura A. Wankel, Vice President of Student Affairs at Seton Hall, responded to Romeo\u2019s application in a December 18, 2003 letter, stating in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b421-9\">The most compelling guidance from the Church directs us to care for the human person whose fundamental identity is as a \u201cchild of God\u201d \u2014 not as a \u201cheterosexual\u201d or a \u201chomosexual.\u201d The Church teaches that an exclusive focus on a person\u2019s sexual orientation denies the fullness of human dignity and diminishes persons in a way that is both reductionist and marginalizing. As a result, although SOAC [Student Organization Activities Committee] recommended to me that \u201cTRUTH\u201d be approved, I am informing you that your application for provisional recognition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>has been denied. No organization based solely upon sexual orientation may receive formal University recognition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-4\">***</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">Further, the Division of Student Affairs remains prepared to work with gay and lesbian students to meet their needs. I am committed to working collaboratively with you and other students in fostering a positive, safe and caring community. To that end, X am providing the following plan that outlines how we may move forward.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">The plan referenced in her letter was entitled \u201cMemorandum of Understanding,\u201d and provided guidelines for gay and lesbian students wishing to operate as a group within the Seton Hall University community. The guidelines in the memorandum offered privileges, including the ability to: (1) sponsor educational events, meetings and programs; (2) sponsor volunteer and community service initiatives; (3) provide a forum for the exchange of views; (4) support gay students through campus educational programs aimed against discrimination; (5) elect officers and have ad hoc committees; and (6) request funds for particular activities and the use of other resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">This proposal was not satisfactory to the students, and thus, Romeo filed his complaint on March 10, 2004, alleging violations of the LAD and breach of contract. The complaint was dismissed, but on a reconsideration motion the dismissal was vacated and Romeo was granted leave to amend. The appeal is from that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">Seton Hall first argues that the motion judge erred in denying its motion to dismiss. As our discussion will indicate, it was error not to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-10\">Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5 \u2014 12(f) the owner of a place of public accommodation may not discriminate against any person on various grounds stated, including \u201csexual orientation.\u201d This term is broad and not defined in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>However, Seton Hall argues that it is exempt from the provisions of the LAD by virtue of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-5(2), which states: \u201cnor shall anything herein contained apply to any educational facility operated or maintained by a bona fide religious or sectarian institution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Seton Hall argues that the dismissal of Romeo\u2019s claims under the LAD is required as a matter of law based on the exemption in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-5(l). It is not disputed that Seton Hall qualifies as an educational facility operated by a bona fide religious institution. Thus, by its very terms the provisions of LAD, including the prohibition of discrimination based on sexual orientation, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-3, do not apply to such religiously affiliated institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Romeo argues that Seton Hall waived its exemption through the written statement found in its \u201cNon Discrimination Policy\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-8\">No person may be denied employment or related benefits or admission to the University or to any of its programs or activities, either academic or nonacademic, curricular or extracurricular, because of race, color, religion, age, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, handicap and disability, or veteran\u2019s status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-9\">It was conceded by Romeo\u2019s attorney at oral argument that Romeo was not denied \u201cadmission to the University or to any of its programs or activities\u201d based on his \u201csexual orientation.\u201d In response to Romeo\u2019s contention that Seton Hall, through its internal \u201cNon Discrimination Policy\u201d which is listed on its website and in its handbooks, waived the statutory exemption, Seton Hall argues that it could not waive its exemption and did not do so by adopting its antidiscrimination policy. It asserts that First Amendment protections and considerations under the United States Constitution also apply. <em>See Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, </em>530 <em>U.S. </em>640, 120 <em>S.Ct. </em>2446, 147 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>554 (2000) (relying on First Amendment right of expressive association). It thus argues that Romeo\u2019s complaint must be dismissed as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-10\">Our Supreme Court has utilized Title VII case law \u201cfor guidance in developing standards to govern the resolution of LAD claims.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number><em>Craig v. Suburban Cablevision, Inc., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>623, 631, 660 A.2d 505 (1995) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">In <em>Little v. Wuerl, </em>929 A.2d 944 (3d Cir.1991), the Third Circuit discussed the issue of waiver of a religious exemption in the Title VII context. The court held: \u201cOnce Congress stated that \u201c[t]his title shall not apply\u201d to religiously-motivated employment decisions by religious organizations, no act by Little [the plaintiff] or the Parish [the defendant] could expand the statute\u2019s scope.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 951.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The Sixth Circuit agreed with <em>Little, </em>stating that \u201cthe statutory exemptions from religious discrimination claims under Title VII cannot be waived by either party.\u201d <em>Hall v. Baptist Memorial Health Care Corp., </em>215 F.3d 618 (6th Cir.2000) <em>(citing Little, </em>929 F.2d at 951; <em>Siegel v. Truett-McConnell College, Inc., </em>13 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>1335, 1345 (N.D.Ga.1994), <em>aff'd </em>73 A.3d 1108 (11th Cir.1995)).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-6\">The exemptions reflect a decision by Congress that religious organizations have a constitutional right to be free from government intervention. <em>Id. </em>\u201cOnce Congress stated that \u2018[t]his title shall not apply\u201d to religiously-motivated employment decisions by religious organizations,\u201d neither party could expand the statute\u2019s scope. <em>Siegel, </em>13 F.Supp.2d at 1345 <em>(quoting Little, </em>929 <em>F.2d </em>at 951). Accordingly, the court in <em>Ward v. Hengle, </em>124 <em>Ohio App.3d </em>396, 400, 706 N.E.2d 392 (1997), held that the trial court need not even determine whether a church waived its Title VII exemption from religious discrimination claims based on a statement in its employment handbook that it would not discriminate against its personnel on the basis of religion. <em>See also Siegel, </em>13 F.Supp.2d at 1344 (government funds are most likely available to all institutions of higher learning whether or not they have a religious affiliation).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b424-7\"><em>[Hall, </em>215 F.3d at 625.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">In <em>Egan v. Hamline United Methodist Church, </em>679 N.W.2d 350 (Minn.Ct.App.2004), the Minnesota Court of Appeals addressed a similar issue. The plaintiff in <em>Egan </em>argued that the church had waived its exemption to a statute prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation due to the church\u2019s commitment to nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, as provided in the church\u2019s <em>Personnel Handbook </em>and the United Methodist Church\u2019s <em>The Book of Discipline. Id. </em>at 352-356. After discussing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>waiver issue <em>in the </em>Title VII context, in particular <em>Little </em>and <em>Hall, </em>the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-6\">we would not take the rule from the Title VII eases to its logical extreme. We do not hold that it is impossible for churches to waive their exemption from the MIIRA. If the waiver is specific and unequivocal, and if the scope of that waiver is evident, then there is not a risk of entanglement. It ought to be recognized. It would be illogical and unjust to ignore such a waiver; however, a pronouncement by the religious organization that it will conform to the principle of nondiscrimination only indicates an intent to voluntarily embrace that principle. Without greater clarity, we would be compelled to conduct an examination and interpret statements of Hamline Methodist and the United Methodist Church on doctrinal policy as it relates to the alleged reason for an employee\u2019s discharge. This invites an unconstitutional entanglement of the church with the judicial and administrative branches of government. <em>[Id. </em>at 358.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">The court proceeded to hold that the policy at issue did not constitute an effective waiver. <em>Ibid. </em>The court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-8\">the debate over sexual orientation in religious bodies is highly contentious and the position of religious organizations on this subject may be revised from time-to-time. The legislature has decided to balance the prohibition against discrimination that deprives individuals of basic human dignity with a recognition of the importance of religious freedoms guaranteed in the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. The right to be free from discrimination and retaliation based on sexual orientation is provided by state statute. The legislature has authority to define the scope of the statutory protection. Embodied in the provisions of the MHRA is the legislature\u2019s recognition that the government interest in eliminating such discrimination is outweighed by the rights of religious associations to be free from government intervention in matters of doctrine and governance and in matters related to the sexual orientation of religious staff. The decision of Hamline Methodist to invoke its statutory right to be exempt from the requirements of the MHRA may make its commitment to nondiscrimination appear hollow. But, when faced with such conflicts, it is for the religious organization, not the government, to resolve possible inconsistencies between Hamline Methodist\u2019s policies in principle and its policies in practice. Absent a specific waiver, the legislature\u2019s decision not to intrude upon this process does not violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and should be respected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 359.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">Cases such as <em>Little </em>persuade us to conclude that the exemption in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-5(l) of the LAD cannot be waived. But, even if Seton Hall could waive the exemption, its antidiscrimination policy is general and akin to that in <em>Egan, </em>which the Minnesota Court of Appeals deemed inadequate to constitute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>waiver. Thus, Romeo\u2019s claim under the LAD fails as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Seton Hall also argues that its antidiscrimination policy did not create a unilateral contract, and therefore, could not be breached as alleged by Romeo. It contends that as a matter of law, Romeo\u2019s breach of contract claim cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The parties dispute the effect of Seton Hall\u2019s antidiscrimination policy that states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-7\">No person may be denied employment or related benefits or admission to the University or to any of its programs or activities, either academic or nonacademic, curricular or extracurricular, because of race, color, religion, age, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, handicap and disability, or veteran\u2019s status.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">This policy has to be read in conjunction with the \u201cStudent Rights and Responsibilities\u201d provision, also contained in the student handbook, which states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-9\">Students have the right to self-determination in their own affairs within the parameters of sound and reasonable judgment, and <em>which are respectful of the values and mission of the University. </em>Students may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-11\">5. seek to join or organize clubs, organizations or associations that promote their common interests, and <em>respect the values and mission of the University. </em>Such organizations are required to submit a statement of purpose, a statement of compliance with all anti-discrimination polices of the University and a list of current officers, (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-12\">In determining whether Seton Hall\u2019s antidiscrimination policy constitutes a unilateral contract, the parties dispute the appropriateness of applying the standard in <em>Woolley v. Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>284, 307, 491 A.2d 1257 (1985), <em>modified, </em>101 <em>N.J. </em>10, 499 A.2d 515 (1985). <em>Woolley </em>held that an employment manual\u2019s provisions on job security constituted a binding contract between the employer and the employee \u201cunless the manual elsewhere prominently and unmistakably indicates that those provisions shall not be binding or unless there is some other similar proof of the employer\u2019s intent not to be bound.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Seton Hall asserts that <em>Woolley </em>does not apply here because the university-student relationship markedly differs from an employer-employee relationship. We agree. The situation here is more appropriately analyzed under <em>Mittra v. University of Medicine &amp; Dentistry of New Jersey, </em>316 <em>N.J.Super. </em>83, 719 A.2d 693 (App. Div.1998), where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-6\">the relationship between the university and its students should not be analyzed in purely contractual terms. As long as the student is afforded reasonable notice and a fair hearing in general conformity with the institution\u2019s rules and regulations, we defer to the university\u2019s broad discretion in its evaluation of academic performance. <em>[Id. </em>at 85, 719 <em>A.2d </em>693.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">In <em>Mittra </em>we ruled that a contractual relationship was not created by the UMDNJ\u2019s dissemination of a student handbook containing a student evaluation process. <em>Ibid. </em>In reaching this conclusion, we acknowledged our prior holding in <em>Napolitano v. Trustees of Princeton Univ., </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>548, 566, 453 A.2d 263 (App.Div.1982), to the effect \u201cthat the relationship between a private university and its students can not be described either in pure contract or associational terms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 89, 453 A.2d 263. While recognizing that the tuition paid by the student in order to be educated at a university may in some circumstances be considered contractual consideration, \u201c[w]e nevertheless emphasized the \u2018necessity for independence of a university in dealing with the academic failures, transgressions or problems of a student.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. (quoting Napolitano, </em>186 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 567, 453 A.2d 263).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-8\">In <em>Mittra, </em>we recognized that <em>Napolitano </em>was decided before the decisions in <em>Woolley </em>and <em>Witkowski v. Thomas J. Lipton, Inc., </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>385, 643 A.2d 546 (1994). <em>Woolley </em>decided that \u201c \u2018[a]n employment manual providing terms and conditions of employment ... including] grounds and procedures for dismissal can create an employment contract.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 90, 491 A.2d 1257 <em>(iquoting Witkowski, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>at 392, 643 A.2d 546). In the university context, <em>Mittra </em>determined that \u201c[w]e nevertheless adhere to our holding in <em>Napolitano </em>rejecting the rigid application of contractual principles to university-student conflicts involving academic performance and limiting our scope of review to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>determination whether the procedures followed were in accordance with the institution\u2019s rules and regulations.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">The standard in <em>Woolley </em>cannot be applied here in light of the inherent differences between the employer-employee relationship and the university-student relationship. As noted in <em>Woolley:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ5\">A policy manual that provides for job security grants an important, fundamental protection for workers. If such a commitment is indeed made, obviously an employer should be required to honor it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-6\">[99 <em>N.J. </em>at 297, 491 A.2d 1257.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">In <em>Woolley </em>it was considered important that an employer\u2019s policy manual \u201crepresents the most reliable statement of the terms of their employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 298, 491 A.2d 1257. The Court stated: \u201cOur courts will not allow an employer to offer attractive inducements and benefits to the workforce and then withdraw them when it chooses, no matter how sincere its belief that they are not enforceable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300, 491 A.2d 1257. Finally, <em>Woolley </em>said that \u201cthe manual is an offer that seeks the formation of a unilateral contract \u2014 the employees\u2019 bargained-for-action needed to make the offer binding being their continued work when they have no obligation to continue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302, 491 A.2d 1257. Clearly, application of the <em>Woolley </em>standard to a relationship outside of the employer-employee context, particularly the university-student relationship, is not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">Even if <em>Woolley </em>applied, Seton Hall\u2019s policy \u201cprominently and unmistakably indicates\u201d that student clubs, organizations and associations can only be formed that \u201crespect the values and mission of the University.\u201d The values and mission of Seton Hall as a private religious university were fully analyzed in Dr. Wankel\u2019s December 18, 2003 letter denying \u201cTRUTH\u201d provisional recognition under church policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">The position of the Catholic Church on its values and mission regarding homosexuality is described in various documents in the record. These documents were attached as exhibits to a certification in support of defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Included was an October 1, 1986 \u201cLetter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>the Pastoral Care of Homosexual Persons,\u201d which was approved by Pope John Paul II and adopted by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, on the subject. That document states in pertinent part that \u201cHomosexual activity is not a complementary union, able to transmit life; and so it thwarts the call to a life of that form of self-giving which the Gospel says is the essence of Christian living____\u201d The document further states that the human person cannot adequately be \u201cdescribed by a reductionist reference to his or her sexual orientation.\u201d The Church, it is said, does not consider an individual as a \u201cheterosexual\u201d or a \u201chomosexual,\u201d but rather \u201cinsists that every person has a fundamental Identity: the creature of God, and by grace, his child and heir to eternal life.\u201d In addition, a March 20, 1992 opinion letter from the New Jersey Office of Legislative Services to a State Assemblyman regarding amendments to the LAD and other statutes, states that the New Jersey Catholic Conference was of the view that Catholic teaching \u201cfinds homosexual activity to be morally wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">In reaching her conclusion, Dr. Wankel analyzed the proposed recognition of \u201cTRUTH\u201d in light of the values and mission of the Catholic Church, as contemplated by the student handbook. Therefore, even under <em>Woolley, </em>the student application for provisional recognition of an entity neither created a contract nor provided a basis for a breach of contract claim. Rather, the case is more akin to <em>Mittra. </em>A contractual relationship cannot be based on isolated provisions in a student manual. Just as in <em>Mittra, </em>where the evaluation of a student\u2019s academic performance is left to the judgment of the university, a private religious university\u2019s values and mission must be left to the discretion of the university. The case for such discretion is even greater, where as here, the very values and mission in question address fundamental religious ideals. Courts should avoid entanglement in religious disputes involving ecclesiastical \u201cpolity or doctrine,\u201d as well as policy. <em>Elmora Hebrew Center, Inc. v.
