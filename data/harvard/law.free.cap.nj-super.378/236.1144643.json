We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-11\">In an opinion filed July 18, 2003, we remanded defendant\u2019s PCR application for disposition on the merits with respect to his contention that trial counsel rendered constitutionally ineffective assistance by failing to file a motion to suppress tangible evidence. <em>State v. Roper, </em>362 <em>N.J.Super. 248, 827 A.2d 1099 </em>(App.Div.2003). The background of the case is set forth in our prior opinion and need not be repeated here. <em>Id. </em>at 251-52, 827 A.2d 1099. We stated that on remand, the PCR judge could decide on the record already established whether the motion to suppress had merit. If it had no merit, then defendant would be unable to establish the \u201cprejudice prong\u201d of the ineffective assistance of counsel standard established by <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>668, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2052, 80 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>674, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>467 <em>U.S. </em>1267, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>3562, 82 L.Ed.2d 864 (1984); <em>State v. Worlock, 117 N.J. </em>596, 625, 569 A.2d 1314 (1990); <em>Roper, supra, </em>362 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 255, 827 A.2d 1099.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-12\">On remand, the judge reviewed the facts bearing on the search of July 11,1998, and concluded that any motion to suppress would have been denied, citing <em>State v. Anaya, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>31, 568 A.2d 1208 (App.Div.1990), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, State v. Dillihay, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>42, 49-50, 601 A.2d 1149 (1992). We agree. Based on his observations, Officer Clemens had probable cause to believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>that he had witnessed a drug transaction and to search Beck. <em>See also State v. Guerrero, </em>232 <em>N.J.Super. </em>507, 557 A.2d 713 (App.Div. 1989). We reject defendant\u2019s argument to the contrary. As a result, defendant\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel has lost one of its legs and falls.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">We reject as entirely without merit defendant\u2019s argument that we should exercise our original jurisdiction pursuant to <em>R. </em>2:10-5 and review the matter de novo. <em>R. </em>2:ll-3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
