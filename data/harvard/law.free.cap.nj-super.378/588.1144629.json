Plaintiffs summary proceeding application under <em>R. </em>4:67-2 on the basis of a claim of violation of the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination (LAD), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-12(g)(4), was rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">On appeal, Pasquince argues that the trial judge erred in: (1) concluding that a landlord may consider a legitimate assessment of creditworthiness as a valid issue to reject a prospective Section 8 tenant\u2019s application under the amended LAD Section; (2) finding that he failed to prove that the poor credit history defense was a pretext for discrimination; and (3) rejecting his rental application based solely on poor \u201ccreditworthiness\u201d where the government has guaranteed payment of a \u201csubstantial portion\u201d of the rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">Pasquince suffers from a medical condition which confines him to a wheelchair. He receives approximately $556 per month in combined social security disability insurance (SSD) and supplemental security income (SSI). On March 24, 2004, Pasquince submitted an application to rent a one-bedroom apartment on the first floor, which had a concrete ramp for wheelchair access, in the Brighton Arms Apartments\u2019 complex. The unit rental was $915 per month. The record indicates that Brighton Arms consists of 428 units, accepts Section 8 tenants, and presently has between thirteen and sixteen residents who receive Section 8 subsidies.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>At the time Pasquince completed the rental application he presented Brighton Arms with copies of the Section 8 housing voucher and verification of his income from SSD and SSI. Pas-quince\u2019s Section 8 housing voucher would cover $774 per month of the rent, leaving him responsible for the remaining $141 per month. He also told Brighton Arms about his poor credit history and discussed the possibility of his sister eosigning the lease. Although she initially agreed to cosign the lease, his sister subsequently withdrew her consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Brighton Arms has a written policy to obtain credit checks on all applicants. It also imposes minimum income requirements and performs criminal background checks on applicants who pass the initial credit check. However, Brighton Arms exempts Section 8 applicants from its minimum income requirements because it may not discriminate against such applicants based on the source of their income. It does not exempt Section 8 applicants from other checks and its policy is to deny rental applications based upon poor credit history. The credit report on Pasquince indicated numerous unpaid obligations, including $2,922 owed to a prior landlord who had evicted Pasquince, and unpaid medical, utility and credit card bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Pasquince attributed his credit difficulties to the window of time between the onset of his disability and the loss of his employment in 2000-2001, and the date in 2003 he was awarded SSD and SSI benefits. He asserted that since he received approval for SSD and SSI payments he had begun to resolve his poor credit history and get his life back on track.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Brighton Arms denied Pasquince\u2019s rental application based upon his poor credit history and informed him of his right to contact the consumer reporting agency to dispute the accuracy of his credit report. At the hearing, Brighton Arms\u2019 representative explained to the trial judge that Pasquince\u2019s credit report raised concerns as to whether he would have the ability or inclination to pay his portion of the rent, notwithstanding receipt of Section 8 housing assistance funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>In an attempt to rebut poor credit history as a basis for his application denial, Pasquince argued that two of Brighton Arms\u2019 Section 8 tenants had poor credit histories. However, Brighton Arms distinguished those tenants\u2019 credit histories. One tenant did not have any bad debt write-offs, and except for a child support collection account, the debts were medical. Brighton Arms indicated that it gives less weight to medical collection items because they are often disputed with Medicare and remain open for long periods of time before they are resolved. With respect to the second tenant, she had been employed at the same job for twenty-four years and her poor credit resulted from a personal bankruptcy filed in 1992 with her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">The trial judge rejected Pasquinee\u2019s arguments and found no evidence that Brighton Arms discriminated against him on the basis of his Section 8 status. The judge filed a comprehensive letter opinion on June 21, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">The factual findings of a trial judge are disturbed only where they are unsupported by competent evidence in the record. <em>Rova Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co. of Am., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974). We review legal conclusions de novo. <em>Manalapan Realty, LP v. Township Comm, of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995). We affirm Judge Sullivan\u2019s decision, and add the following discussion with respect to Pas-quince\u2019s argument that the 2002 amendment of the LAD statute, including the deletion of a reference in a repealed statute to creditworthiness, should give rise to a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">Prior to September 15, 2002, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:42-100 provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">No person, firm or corporation or any agent, officer or employee thereof shall refuse to rent or lease any house or apartment to another person because of the source of any lawful income received by the person or the source of any lawful rent payment to be paid for the house or apartment____ Nothing contained in this section shall limit the ability of a person, firm or corporation or any agent, officer or employee thereof to refuse to rent or lease any house or apartment because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>the creditworthiness of the person or persons seeking to rent a house or apartment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>2A:42-100 (repealed).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">This statute was repealed by <em>L. </em>2002, c. 82, \u00a7 7 (effective September 5, 2002). However, the same enactment amended the LAD to prohibit discrimination based upon an individual\u2019s source of lawful income used for rental or mortgage payments. <em>L. </em>2002, c. 82, \u00a7 3 (effective September 5, 2002). Among this legislation\u2019s amendments to the LAD was the addition of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-12(g)(4), which currently provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-6\">It shah be an unlawful employment practice, or, as the case may be, an unlawful discrimination:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">g. For any person, including but not limited to, any owner, lessee, sublessee, assignee or managing agent of, or other person having the right of ownership or possession of or the right to sell, rent, lease, assign, or sublease any real property or part or portion thereof, or any agent or employee of any of these:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">(4) To refuse to sell, rent, lease, assign, or sublease or otherwise to delay or to withhold from any person or group of persons any real property or part or portion thereof because of the source of any lawful income received by the person or the source of any lawful rent payment to be paid for the real property; ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">The Legislature obviously repealed <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:42-100 and evinced an intent to move its provisions to the LAD. The effects of moving the non-discrimination provision to the LAD were to significantly increase the civil penalties available for discrimination of this type, and to give enforcement authority to the housing authorities, the Division on Civil Rights, and the Attorney General. <em>Press Release, </em>Office of Governor (Sept. 5, 2002); <em>Sponsors\u2019 Statement to S.631 </em>(enacted as L.2002, c. 82); <em>Statement of Senate Judiciary Committee to S.631 </em>(enacted as <em>L. </em>2002, c. 82); <em>Sponsors\u2019 Statement to A.710 </em>(enacted as <em>L. </em>2002, c. 82); <em>Statement of Assembly Housing and Local Government Committee to A.710 </em>(enacted as <em>L. </em>2002, c. 82).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Obviously, the language in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5 \u2014 12(g)(4) is not an exact replica of the repealed statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:42-100, because it does not state that, notwithstanding the non-discrimination provision, landlords may still consider creditworthiness as a criteria for accepting or rejecting rental applicants. Nevertheless, as discussed hereinafter, it is well established that creditworthiness is a legitimate, non-discriminatory criteria which landlords are permitted to consider when evaluating prospective tenants, including recipients of Section 8 housing assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">There is no evidence that, by repealing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:42-100, the Legislature intended to change the status quo, and, absent a clear manifestation to the contrary, the judiciary will not impute to the Legislature an intent to change established law. <em>State v. Dalglish, </em>86 <em>N.J. </em>503, 512, 432 A.2d 74 (1981); <em>In re Formal Complaint of Borough of Glen Rock Against Village of Ridgewood, </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>241, 249, 135 A.2d 506 (1957), <em>overruled on other grounds, City of N. Wildwood v. Bd. Of Comm\u2019rs of City of Wildwood, </em>71 <em>N.J. </em>354, 365 A.2d 465 (1976); <em>Caldwell v. Township of Rochelle Park, </em>135 <em>N.J.Super. </em>66, 74, 342 A.2d 583 (Law Div.1975) (\u201cGenerally, there is a presumption against legislative intent to effect a change of substance by a revision of laws, and that presumption is not necessarily overcome by mere change of phraseology, or addition or omission of words.\u201d). <em>Cf, Singleton v. Consol. Freightways Carp., </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>357, 362, 316 A.2d 436 (1974) (\u201cThere is a presumption against a legislative intention to effect a change in substance of a statute unless the change is expressed in language admitting of no reasonable doubt of its purpose.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The legislative history does not suggest that there was any intent by the Legislature to eliminate creditworthiness as an appropriate selection criteria for Section 8 tenants. Rather, it suggests that the statutory amendments were intended to codify in the LAD the Court\u2019s decision in <em>Franklin Tower One, LLC v. N.M., </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>602, 618-623, 725 A.2d 1104 (1999), which held that, under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:42-100, landlords were prohibited from refusing to rent to families or individuals solely because of the use of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Section 8 voucher to assist in the payment of rent. <em>Press Release, </em>Governor (Sept. 5, 2002); <em>Sponsors\u2019 Statement to S.631 </em>(enacted as <em>L. </em>2002, c. 82); <em>Statement of Senate Judiciary Committee to S.631 </em>(enacted as <em>L. </em>2002, c. 82); <em>Sponsors\u2019 Statement to A.710 </em>(enacted as <em>L. </em>2002, c. 82); <em>Statement of Assembly Housing and, Local Government Committee to A.710 </em>(enacted as <em>L. </em>2002, c. 82). <em>See also, T.K v. Landmark West, </em>353 <em>N.J.Super. </em>353, 359-363, 802 A.2d 609 (Law Div.2001) (holding that defendant unlawfully discriminated against plaintiff based upon her receipt of Section 8 housing assistance, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:42-100 (repealed)), <em>aff'd, </em>353 <em>N.J.Super. </em>223, 802 A.2d 527 (App.Div.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In <em>Franklin Tower, supra </em>(157 <em>N.J. </em>at 611, 725 A.2d 1104), the Court also recognized that, under federal law, landlords are permitted \u201cto evaluate the fitness of Section 8 recipients as they would any other prospective tenant.\u201d The Court also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">[W]e acknowledge that a landlord approached by a prospective tenant eligible for Section 8 assistance has the full right to screen and review the tenant\u2019s references, background, employment and rental history to verify that the tenant is otherwise qualified to reside in the landlord\u2019s building. <em>See </em>42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1437f(d)(1)(A); 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 982.307.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">[Id at 622, 725 A.2d 1104.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">As noted in <em>Franklin Tower, </em>federal law explicitly recognizes the right of landlords to perform background cheeks, including credit checks, on prospective Section 8 tenants. <em>Id. </em>at 610-611, 725 A.2d 1104. Federal law provides that landlords are responsible for the evaluation and selection of Section 8 tenants. 42 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1437f(d); 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 982.452(b)(1). Furthermore, 24 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 982.307 provides criteria for the screening of Section 8 tenants and states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-9\">Tenant screening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-10\">(a) PHA option and owner responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-11\">(3) The owner is responsible for screening of families on the basis of their tenancy histories.

Housing Authority of City of Camden, N.J., </em>278 <em>F.Supp.2d </em>365, 375-377 (D.N.J.2003) (the Housing Act\u2019s implementing regulations permit the use of creditworthiness as a screening criterion for issuing Section 8 vouchers).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Moreover, both the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Community Affairs (DCA) have published documents encouraging landlords to utilize credit checks and rental history as means by which to screen rental applications submitted by recipients of Section 8 housing assistance. See Appendix A.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-9\">It is significant that both HUD and the DCA, the agencies responsible for administering the Section 8 program, consider that landlords may take into account the creditworthiness of Section 8 applicants. Courts typically give deference to agencies\u2019 construction of the statutory schemes they are entrusted to administer. <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 <em>U.S. </em>837, 843-845, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2778, 2782-83, 81 L.Ed.2d 694, 703-704 (1984). Similarly, courts typically defer to the expertise of agencies in technical matters which lie within their special competence. <em>New Jersey Chapter of Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Indus. &amp; Office Parks v. New Jersey Dept. of Envt\u2019l Prot., </em>241 <em>N.J.Super. </em>145, 165, 574 A.2d 514 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>374, 585 A.2d 379, 380 (1990); <em>Application of Boardwalk Regency Corp. for a Casino License, </em>180 <em>N.J.Super. </em>324, 333-334, 434 A.2d 1111 (App.Div.1981), <em>modified, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>361, 447 A.2d 1335 (1982); <em>DiBlasi v. Board of Trustees, </em>315 <em>N.J.Super. </em>298, 301-302, 718 A.2d 241 (App.Div.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">Pasquince nonetheless contends that it is unlawful for landlords to reject Section 8 tenants based upon poor credit histories, relying on an unpublished Law Division opinion provided in his appendix, <em>Reed v. Rustic Village Apartments, </em>DC-A136-02M (Law Div. Jan. 14, 2003). In <em>Reed, </em>the plaintiffs rental application had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>been denied based in. part upon her poor credit history, notwithstanding that her Section 8 voucher would pay more than eighty percent of her rent, and her income was sufficient to cover her portion of the monthly rent. The landlord was ordered to reconsider the plaintiff\u2019s rental application without an automatic rejection based upon her creditworthiness, but the judge in <em>Reed </em>also stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\"><em>a verified previous poor payment history as to rent for a residential apartment or rental home, </em>or a bad reference as to the applicant\u2019s behavior or actual behavioral problems of the applicant or the applicant\u2019s family that are shown to have existed at such a home, <em>are appropriate factors to be considered by the landlord as a reason to reject an applicant, </em>(emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Based upon <em>Reed, </em>Pasquince argues that it is always arbitrary and capricious to consider a Section 8 rental applicant\u2019s credit history because the Section 8 program will be paying the large majority of the tenant\u2019s rent obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">We recognize that an unpublished trial court opinion is hardly legal precedent. However, we reject the holding in <em>Reed, </em>that landlords may not consider a Section 8 tenant\u2019s creditworthiness where the Section 8 voucher would be paying 50% or more of the monthly rent as inconsistent with federal law. Such a holding is also contrary to common sense. The prospective tenant is still responsible for the payment of some portion of the rent, and, if the applicant has a history of not paying his or her financial obligations, it is logical and reasonable for a landlord to conclude that the applicant might avoid the rent obligation, no matter how small the amount. Moreover, the rent subsidy could be terminated, in which case the tenant would be responsible for the entire rent obligation. <em>See, e.g., Edward Gray Apartments v. Williams, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>457, 467, 800 A.2d 259 (App.Div.2002) (tenant evicted for not paying her rent obligation after her Section 8 subsidy was terminated).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">Even under <em>Reed\u2019s </em>reasoning, Brighton Arms acted appropriately by denying Pasquince\u2019s rental application based upon his negative credit report. His credit history reflected a prior eviction and the prior non-payment of rent and utility bills. Even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number><em>Reed </em>recognized that such factors would justify a landlord\u2019s rejection of a rental application submitted by a recipient of Section 8 housing assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">Accordingly, in the case before us, Judge Sullivan did not err in concluding that it was lawful for Brighton Arms to rely upon creditworthiness as a selection criteria for Section 8 tenants, and it did not violate the law by relying upon plaintiffs poor credit history in rejecting his rental application.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">The record also supports Judge Sullivan\u2019s conclusion that Brighton Arms did not use creditworthiness as a pretext to discriminate against plaintiff based upon his receipt of Section 8 housing assistance, thereby violating <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-12(g)(4) \u2014 the ultimate issue in this case. In order to prove discrimination, a plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case showing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-9\">(1) plaintiff is in the class of persons [the statute] is intended to protect;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-10\">(2) defendant was aware that plaintiff is a member of the protected class;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-11\">(3) plaintiff was ready and able to accept defendant\u2019s offer to rent or lease; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-12\">(4) [defendant] refused to rent an apartment to plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-13\"><em>[T.K, supra, </em>(353 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 360, 802 A.2d 609) (applying former <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:42-100, now repealed).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-15\">The burden of production<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> then shifts to the defendant to articulate a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for denying the plaintiffs rental application. If the defendant meets this burden of production, the plaintiff then bears the burden of proving that the defendant\u2019s articulated reason was merely a pretext for unlawful discrimination. <em>Ibid. See also, Zive v. Stanley Roberts, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>182 <em>N.J. </em>436, 447-450, 867 A2d 1133 (2005) (discussing burden-shifting scheme in context of alleged employment discrimination under the LAD).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">In <em>T.K, swpra </em>(353 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 360, 802 A.2d 609), the judge found that the plaintiff established a prima facie ease of discrimination. He also found that the defendant\u2019s articulated reason for rejecting the plaintiffs rental application \u2014 the plaintiffs lack of creditworthiness \u2014 was unsupported by the record and merely a pretext to discriminate against the plaintiff based upon her receipt of Section 8 housing assistance. <em>Id. </em>at 361-363, 802 A.2d 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">On appeal, we affirmed and acknowledged that creditworthiness was a legitimate criteria for landlords when considering prospective tenants, including Section 8 tenants, but found no basis for overruling the determination that, under the circumstances, defendant\u2019s reliance upon the plaintiffs poor credit history lacked credibility. <em>T.K, supra </em>(353 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 225, 802 A2d 527).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\"><em>T.K. </em>is distinguishable from the case before us. Here, Brighton Arms consistently maintained that the reason it rejected Pas-quince\u2019s rental application was his poor credit history. Moreover, unlike <em>T.K, </em>the record supports Brighton Arms\u2019 assessment of Pasquince\u2019s credit history and the rejection of his rental application on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Pasquince\u2019s credit history reflects not only unpaid medical bills whose validity plaintiff does not dispute, but also reflects negative information about Pasquinee\u2019s rental history, including a prior eviction and the failure to pay rent and utility obligations. Moreover, unlike the rental applicant in <em>T.K, </em>Pasquinee would be responsible for a portion of his rent obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Pasquinee failed to show that Brighton Arms used his poor credit history as a pretext for discrimination based upon Section 8 status. The record reflects that Brighton Arms has Section 8 tenants. Moreover, unlike in <em>T.K, </em>Brighton Arms maintains a written set of standards for assessing a prospective tenant\u2019s credit history. While the record reflects that Pasquinee made out a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>prima facie case of discrimination and Brighton Arms may have made exceptions to its creditworthiness standards when admitting two of its Section 8 tenants, that does not establish an intent to discriminate against Pasquinee based upon his Section 8 status. The situation might be different if there was evidence that Brighton Arms deviated from its creditworthiness criteria for non-Section 8 applicants. However, there is no such evidence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Appendix A</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">Section 8 Housing Program Guidelines for Landlords</p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">4-7 <em>Screening for Suitability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">E. <em>Permitted Screening Criteria Commonly Used by Owners</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">1. <em>Overview.

A credit check can help demonstrate whether an applicant has the ability to pay rent on time.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-13\">a. <em>Owners may reject an applicant for a poor credit history, </em>but a lack of credit history is not sufficient grounds to reject an applicant.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-14\">b. As part of their written screening criteria, and in order to ensure that all applicants are treated fairly, owners should describe the general criteria they will use for distinguishing between an acceptable and unacceptable credit rating.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-15\">c. Owners may determine how far back to consider an applicant\u2019s credit history. Owners generally focus on credit activity for the past three to five years. It is a good management practice to give priority to current activity over older activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-16\">d. Owners may have to justify the basis for a determination to deny tenancy because of the applicant\u2019s credit rating, so there should be a sound basis for the rejection.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>4^-27 <em>Implementing Screening Reviews</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">B. <em>Screening for Credit History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">1. <em>Owners may reject an applicant for a poor credit history, </em>but owners must not reject an applicant for <em>lack </em>of a credit history.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">2. There are two primary sources that owners use to determine credit history.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-9\">a. <em>Previous landlords. It is good practice to contact the applicant\u2019s previous landlords to determine if the applicant paid rent on time.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-10\">b. <em>Credit report companies. </em>There are a number of private companies that can provide owners with a credit report on an applicant. These private companies charge a fee for this service. Owners may use such services but may not pass on these fees to the applicant. At an additional cost, some companies can provide additional information by searching public databases for criminal records. Owners must be consistent in the use of credit reporting services.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-11\">C. <em>Screening for Rental History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-12\">1. The most common method for assessing rental history is to ask for comments</p>\n<p id=\"b636-13\">from the applicant\u2019s current and former landlords. When collecting information from landlords, it is important to collect objective information____</p>\n<p id=\"b636-14\">2. <em>Information that an owner may learn from a landlord that may be grounds for rejecting an applicant includes:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-15\">a. Failure to cooperate with recertification procedures;</p>\n<p id=\"b636-16\">b. Violations of house rules;</p>\n<p id=\"b636-17\">c. <em>Violations of the lease;</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-18\"><em>\u25a0 </em>History of disruptive behavior;</p>\n<p id=\"b636-19\">\u2022 Poor housekeeping practices;</p>\n<p id=\"b636-20\">\u2022 <em>Previous evictions;</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-21\"><em>\u25a0 </em>Termination of assistance for fraud; or</p>\n<p id=\"b636-22\">\u2022 Conviction for the illegal manufacture, distribution, or use of controlled substances.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-23\"><em>[HUD Diredive Number 4350.8, </em>Chapter 4 (Waiting List and Tenant Selection), Sections 4-7E and 4-27B (emphasis added) (available at www.hudclips.org).]</p>\n<p id=\"b636-24\">Similar to HUD, the DCA advises landlords:</p>\n<p id=\"b636-25\">Once a Housing Choice Voucher holder has indicated that they wish to rent your property, you must decide whether or not you want to rent to this tenant. <em>We strongly advise you to do a thorough background check on all potential tenants before you decide whether or not you will rent to them.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b636-26\">\n<em>The background check should include an application requiring the tenant to provide information such as their name, social security number, past rental history including prior landlords, information on employment, income, savings, and personal and credit references.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>\n<em>You should also consider using one of the many services available to landlords that will give you the information needed to make an informed decision about renting to a potential tenant. For example, services will tell yon, whether or not a tenant has ever been evicted, has a criminal record, or has a bad credit history.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\"><em>[A Landlord\u2019s Guide to the Section 8 Housing Program, </em>at p. 4 (Sept.2003) (emphasis added) (www.nj.gov/dea/publications).]</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b625-9\">The Section 8 housing choice voucher program is funded by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and administered by the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, Division of Housing and Community Resources. It provides financial assistance to eligible individuals so that they may rent privately owned housing. An individual deemed eligible for Section 8 housing assistance is issued a housing choice voucher which verifies eligibility for assistance and that money is being set aside to assist the individual with paying his or her rent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b633-16\"> In <em>T.K., </em>the court erroneously refers to defendant\u2019s burden as a burden of proof. <em>T.K., infra, </em>353 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 360, 802 A.2d 609. In actuality, plaintiffs alleging discrimination bear the burden of proof at all stages of the litigation. The only burden which shifts to the defendant (and then only if a plaintiff makes out a prima facie case of discrimination), is a burden of production, i.e., the burden of articulating a legitimate, non-discriminatoiy reason for the allegedly discriminatory decision. <em>See, e.g., Zive v.
