Following a trial before a jury, defendant was found not guilty of murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>but guilty of aggravated manslaughter and endangering the welfare of a child. The judge sentenced defendant to a custodial term of twenty-two years, with a period of parole ineligibility as prescribed by the No Early Release Act (NERA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2d. Defendant was sentenced on the endangering conviction to a consecutive term of seven years, with parole ineligibility as prescribed by NERA. Penalties were also imposed. Defendant appeals his convictions and the sentences imposed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">This matter arises from the death of D.R. on May 31, 1998. D.R. was born on April 19, 1996. His biological parents were Laurie Roberts and Mimi Mollo.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Roberts and Mollo ended their relationship before D.R. was born. Roberts met defendant in October 1997. They began dating and, in December 1997, they moved together with D.R. to an apartment in the basement of a home owned by Laurie\u2019s aunt, Elaine Roberts.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">From the time of his birth, D.R. suffered from an enlarged scrotum resulting from \u201chydrocele\u201d or fluid around the testicles. D.R. also suffered from a genetic disorder called Hunter\u2019s Syndrome, a form of mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS), which is a condition that affects the joints and bones and makes movement of the arms difficult. On May 29, 1998, two days before his death, D.R. underwent surgery to reduce the size of his scrotum. Dr. Michael Louis Nance, a pediatrician at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia, performed the operation. The doctor testified that at the time of the surgery, D.R.\u2019s scrotum was slightly enlarged and bruised and the bruising extended to D.R.\u2019s lower abdomen. Nance stated that he observed blood in the tissues surrounding D.R.\u2019s scrotum, which he had never seen when performing a hydrocele reduction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>procedure. Nance said that D.R.\u2019s platelet count was normal. The child\u2019s blood clotting ability also was normal. Nance stated that the incision made during the operation was not near D.R.\u2019s mesentery, the fibrous tissue that holds the small bowel in place and supplies blood to the bowel. D.R. was discharged from the hospital on May 30,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">After D.R.\u2019s release from the hospital, Roberts and defendant left D.R. at the home of Jean Mangini, Roberts\u2019 aunt. Roberts and defendant went home and went to sleep. D.R. was brought home around 9:30 in the evening. Roberts testified that defendant put D.R. to bed around 10:30 p.m. While D.R. slept, Roberts and defendant watched rented movies.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Around 5:30 a.m., the phone rang and D.R. was awakened. Roberts picked up D.R. to calm him and then she handed the child to defendant, who said he would put D.R. back to bed. Roberts went upstairs to the bathroom and, while she was in the bathroom, Roberts heard D.R. cry out. Roberts testified that she went back downstairs and asked defendant why D.R. had cried out. Defendant said that D.R. did not want to go to sleep. Roberts and defendant went to bed, but shortly thereafter Roberts heard D.R. making a gagging sound. She went to the child and saw that his body was \u201cclenching and unclenching.\u201d Roberts thought that D.R. was having a seizure. Roberts and defendant called 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">One of the paramedics who responded to the call testified that when he arrived at the apartment, D.R. was tossing, turning and crying. The paramedic said that D.R. looked pale and sickly. The initial physical check indicated that D.R. was in shock and he appeared to be bleeding internally. D.R.\u2019s abdomen was distended and, according to the paramedic, there was a \u201cvery, very black and blue\u201d bruise on the child\u2019s right flank. He stated that the bruise was round, oval-like and about three to four inches in diameter. D.R.\u2019s testicles were \u201cpurplish,\u201d like a black color and \u201cgrossly swollen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">D.R. was taken to Kennedy Memorial Hospital. Dr. Frank J. DeMartino was the attending physician in the emergency room. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>He stated that, when he was brought in, D.R. was in a \u201cvery grave clinical state.\u201d He also observed the swollen testicles and a fair amount of bruising to the child\u2019s right flank. DeMartino asserted that D.R. was losing blood and the blood was collecting in the child\u2019s testicles, the abdominal area and the flanks.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">Anita Brown, a registered nurse who attended to D.R. in the emergency room, testified that D.R. was \u201cstill and unresponsive\u201d when he was first brought to the hospital. She noticed that D.R. had a huge bruise on the lower right abdomen, that was larger than a grapefruit and round in shape. Brown also noticed that D.R.\u2019s scrotum was swollen and appeared to be filled with blood. Brown approached defendant and she asked him what happened but defendant did not reply. Brown testified that defendant was \u201cvery pale and very quiet.\u201d The medical personnel worked for an hour-and-a-half to resuscitate D.R. Their efforts failed and D.R. died.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">An autopsy was performed at Children\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia. Dr. Paul Hoyer, the assistant medical examiner for Gloucester County, testified that the autopsy revealed that the surgical incision that had been made in the hydrocele procedure was open and gaping. The autopsy also revealed that about a quart of blood had collected in D.R.\u2019s abdominal cavity. Hoyer observed a four-inch tear of the child\u2019s mesentery. He testified that in his opinion the tear had been caused by a \u201clarge blunt force,\u201d such as from a forceful kick or punch, a car accident or a fall from ten or fifteen feet. Hoyer also observed the bruise on D.R.\u2019s abdomen and concluded that the child\u2019s death might be the result of child abuse and homicide. He asserted that D.R.\u2019s death was not a \u201cmetabolic death.\u201d The cause of death was \u201chypovolemic shock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">Evidence also was presented at trial concerning injuries that D.R. had sustained in the months preceding his death. On February 2, 1998, D.R. was brought to Dr. Jeffrey P. Kovaes, an orthopedic surgeon, because he was having problems with a cast placed by another doctor to treat a fracture in D.R.\u2019s left tibia. Kovaes examined D.R. and observed that the child\u2019s left upper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>thigh was \u201cmassively swollen.\u201d He found signs of a spiral fracture in D.R.\u2019s left femur. The femur fracture was about a week old. The tibia fracture had been sustained about a month before the office visit. Kovacs testified that Roberts\u2019 vague account of the injuries made him suspect that she was not telling him the full story. Kovacs stated that it is uncommon to see two fractures in the same leg within a one-month period. Such an occurrence, he said, is \u201cone of the hallmarks of child abuse.\u201d Kovacs opined that D.R.\u2019s fractures were not \u201cpathologic fractures\u201d related to the child\u2019s MPS.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">Dr. Paige Kaplan, head of the Biochemical Genetics Unit at Children\u2019s Hospital, treated D.R. in February 1998. She also concluded that D.R.\u2019s fractures were not causally related to MPS.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">Dr. Cindy Christian testified that she saw D.R. when he was admitted to Children\u2019s Hospital in February 1998. She consulted Kaplan who confirmed that there is no association between MPS and bone fractures. Christian stated that she became convinced, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, that D.R. was a victim of child abuse. She asserted that, when D.R. was brought to the hospital on May 31,1998, his platelet count was normal and he had no problem with blood clotting. Christian stated that a clotting problem was not the cause of the child\u2019s death. She also stated that the hemorrhaging in D.R.\u2019s stomach was caused by the tearing of the mesentery. She asserted that such a tear could not have been caused by dropping a child of D.R.\u2019s size ten inches onto a bed railing.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-7\">Dr. John Gregg is a pediatric orthopedic surgeon at Children\u2019s Hospital. He treated D.R. in February 1998 for the multiple fractures. Gregg testified that D.R. had normal bone density and his bones were not especially brittle. The child also did not have a problem with blood clotting. Dr. Gregg testified that, based on his observations, there was no doubt that D.R. had been physically abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">The police commenced an investigation shortly after D.R.\u2019s death. Roberts and defendant both agreed to accompany the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>investigating officers to the prosecutor\u2019s office for interviews. Defendant rode with Detective Sergeant Richard O\u2019Brien. When he arrived at the prosecutor\u2019s office, defendant was taken to an interview room. Defendant was given a copy of the prosecutor\u2019s rights form and he was asked to read it aloud. Defendant did so and agreed to give a statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">O\u2019Brien and Investigator Kenneth E. Crane interviewed defendant and took a taped statement in which defendant stated that when D.R. awoke on the morning of May 31, 1998, Roberts attended to D.R. while he went outside to smoke a cigarette. When defendant came back into the apartment, Roberts handed him the child and she went upstairs to the bathroom. Defendant said that D.R. was screaming because he did not want to part with his mother. He said that when Roberts returned, D.R. quieted down. After defendant went to bed, D.R. began making a heaving sound. Roberts thought D.R. was having a seizure and called 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">During a break, Sergeant Alex Illas informed defendant that what he and Roberts told the police did not \u201cadd up.\u201d Defendant said that he wanted to smoke a cigarette. Illas accompanied defendant outside, where defendant asked Illas, \u201cDo you think I need a lawyer?\u201d Illas told defendant that it was his responsibility to tell defendant that he had a right to have a lawyer, but \u201cthat was his call.\u201d Defendant said, \u201cWhat is going to happen to me if I tell you what happened?\u201d Defendant became tearful and told Illas that he had dropped D.R. and D.R. struck the side of the bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">In a second taped interview, defendant said that when Roberts went up to the bathroom, he attempted to put D.R. on the bed by holding the child with both hands, one on each side of the abdomen. According to defendant, D.R. squirmed in his hands, slipped from his right hand and fell. Defendant said that the child fell about one or one-and-a-half feet. Defendant asserted that D.R. hit the bed railing against his upper chest. Defendant said that he placed D.R. on his bed. According to defendant, D.R. cried at first and then calmed down. When Roberts returned, she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>and defendant went to sleep and shortly thereafter the child began to heave. They called 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Defendant did not testify at trial. He called two witnesses. Dr. Roger A. Berg testified as an expert in the field of radiology. He opined that the x-rays taken of D.R.\u2019s tibia fracture indicated that it was a \u201ctoddler\u2019s fracture\u201d which is common in children learning to walk. Berg stated that the femur fracture could have been caused by a fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Dr. John E. Adams, a forensic pathologist, also testified. He stated that D.R.\u2019s abdominal injury was not consistent with a fist blow. He asserted that D.R. had some sort of blood clotting problem but he did not know its cause. He also stated that D.R.\u2019s abdominal bruise could have been the result of striking the right flank against the rail of the bed when he fell from defendant\u2019s hands. Adams said that the patterns in the bruise were not the sort of patterns that could have resulted from a bare fist.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">Adams also stated that that there were Hurley-Schleie cell deposits in the child\u2019s mesentery. The condition made the mesen-tery tissue thicker and shorter and therefore susceptible to injury from a lot less force than would otherwise be required for a major injury. Adams opined that, strictly speaking, the child had not suffered from a mesentery tear but rather from a rare bowel injury, where the bowel had been torn from the mesentery.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">In this appeal, defendant raised the following contentions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">POINT ONE: THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT SUPPRESSING THE STATEMENTS GIVEN FOLLOWING INADEQUATE <em>MIRANDA </em>WARNINGS AND AT LEAST AN AMBIGUOUS REQUEST FOR COUNSEL.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-10\">POINT TWO: THE COURT ERRED IN CHARGING THE JURY BY A) FAILING TO INSTRUCT PROPERLY ON THE ELEMENTS OF AGGRAVATED MANSLAUGHTER, B) GIVING CONFLICTING INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO CONSIDER THE LESSER OFFENSES, AND C) PROVIDING ERRONEOUS INSTRUCTIONS TO THE JURY ON THE ENDANGERING CHARGE.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-11\">POINT THREE: DEFENDANT\u2019S DETERMINATION NOT TO SEEK A LESSER-OFFENSE INSTRUCTION SHOULD HAVE BEEN HONORED, GIVEN THE PROOFS AND POTENTIAL FOR A COMPROMISE VERDICT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>POINT FOUR: DEFENDANT RECEIVED AN ILLEGAL AND MANIFESTLY EXCESSIVE SENTENCE; THE CONVICTION FOR ENDANGERING SHOULD HAVE MERGED WITH THE MANSLAUGHTER CONVICTION, ALTERNATIVELY, THE SENTENCE ON COUNT TWO SHOULD HAVE RUN CONCURRENTLY, AND THE SENTENCE ON AGGRAVATED MANSLAUGHTER EXCEEDED WHAT WAS APPROPRIATE, IN VIEW OF THE MITIGATING FACTORS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-5\">POINT FIVE: THE TRIAL COURT ERRONEOUSLY LIMITED THE CROSS-EXAMINATION OF CERTAIN WITNESSES FOR THE STATE, THEREBY MATERIALLY INTERFERING WITH DEFENDANT\u2019S RIGHT OF CONFRONTATION UNDER THE SIXTH AMENDMENT.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">POINT SIX: TIIE PROSECUTOR EXCEEDED THE BOUNDS OF PROPER ADVOCACY IN HIS EXAMINATION OF LAURIE ROBERTS AND ALSO MADE IMPROPER REMARKS IN SUMMATION.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">We turn first to defendant\u2019s assertion that his statements to the police should have been suppressed because the <em>Miranda </em>warnings failed to explicitly inform defendant that any statement could be used \u201cagainst him.\u201d As stated previously, defendant was given a copy of the prosecutor\u2019s form and he was asked to read it aloud. The form stated in part that, \u201cAnything you say can and will be used in a court of law.\u201d The trial judge found that, when he gave his statements, defendant was in custody. The judge further found that although he was not told that any statement made by defendant could be used \u201cagainst him,\u201d defendant \u201cclearly knew that statements could be used against him or at least could be used in court however they were going to be used.\u201d The judge found that defendant provided his statements \u201cvoluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o person ... shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself____\u201d <em>U.S. Const., </em>amend V. This privilege against self-incrimination applies to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Malloy v. Hogan, </em>378 <em>U.S. </em>1, 6, 84 <em>S.Ct. </em>1489, 1492, 12 L.Ed.2d 653 (1964). The right against self-incrimination applies to persons subjected to custodial interrogation. <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>436, 444, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1602, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>1612, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, 706 (1966). The police must inform the suspect that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement may be used against him, that he has a right to an attorney, and an attorney will be provided if the suspect can not afford one. <em>Ibid. </em>A statement provided in custody is not admissible unless it is preceded by a knowing, intelligent and voluntary waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>State v. DiFrisco, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>195, 235, 804 A.2d 507 (2002), <em>cert, denied, </em>537 <em>U.S. </em>1220, 123 <em>S.Ct. </em>1323, 154 L.Ed.2d 1076 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">Initially, we reject the State\u2019s assertion that defendant was not in custody when he gave his statements to the investigators. Custodial interrogation is \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d <em>Miranda, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 444, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1612, 16 L.Ed.2d at 706. The test of whether an individual is in custody for <em>Miranda </em>purposes is an objective test, which focuses on the totality of the circumstances. <em>State v. P.Z., </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>86, 102-03, 703 A.2d 901 (1997). The circumstances include the time and place of the interrogation, the length of the interrogation, the conduct of the interrogators and the status of the suspect. <em>P.Z., supra, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>at 103, 703 A.2d 901. \u201c[C]ustody exists if the action of the interrogating officers and the surrounding circumstances, fairly construed, would reasonably lead a detainee to believe he could not leave freely.\u201d <em>State v. Coburn, </em>221 <em>N.J.Super. </em>586, 596, 535 A.2d 531 (App.Div.1987), <em>certif. denied, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>300, 540 A.2d 1281 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">Here, the evidence supports the judge\u2019s finding that defendant was subjected to a custodial interrogation. Defendant voluntarily agreed to accompany the police officers to the prosecutor\u2019s office for an interview. Defendant was not placed under arrest. At no point was defendant told that he was free to leave. Moreover, as the trial judge found, there was no practical way for defendant to leave the building \u201cunless he was going to run from Woodbury to Franklinville,\u201d a distance of about 18 or 20 miles. In the cireum-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>stances, a reasonable person would not believe that he was free to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">We are convinced, however, that the warnings provided to defendant were sufficient to inform him of the substance of his constitutional rights. \u201c[TJhe words of <em>Miranda </em>do not constitute a ritualistic formula which must be repeated without variation in order to be effective. Words which convey the substance of the warning alone with the required information are sufficient.\u201d <em>State v. Melvin, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>1, 14, 319 A.2d 450 (1974) (quoting <em>United States v. Vanterpool, </em>394 F.2d 697, 698-99 (2d Cir.1968)). In this matter, defendant was informed of the substance of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Defendant was told that any statement he made could be used in a court of law. Defendant could have readily inferred that any statement given to the investigators could be used against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Defendant\u2019s reliance upon <em>United States v. Tillman, </em>963 <em>F.</em>2d 137 (6th Cir.1992), is misplaced. In that case, defendant was told he had a right to remain silent, he had the right to the presence of an attorney if he wished, he was not required to answer any questions and if he could not afford an attorney, one would be provided. <em>Id. </em>at 140. The defendant in <em>Tillman </em>was not given any warning about the use of his statements. <em>Ibid. </em>However, in this case, defendant was told that his statements could be used in a court of law, which in substance informed defendant that his statements could be used against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">Defendant also argues that the interrogation should have ceased after he made what he contends was an ambiguous request for a lawyer. As we stated previously, after he made his first taped statement, defendant asked Sergeant Illas whether he thought that defendant needed a lawyer. When a suspect makes a statement that could be interpreted as a request for an attorney, the questioning must cease until an attorney has been made available or the accused \u201cinitiates further communication, exchanges, or conversation with the police.\u201d <em>State v. Chew, </em>150 <em>N.J. </em>30, 61, 695 A.2d 1301 (1997) (quoting from <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>451 <em>U.S. </em>477, 484-85,-101 <em>S.Ct. </em>1880, 1885, 68 L.Ed.2d 378, 386 (1981)). An \u201cequivocal request for an attorney is to be interpreted in a light most favorable to the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63, 695 A.2d 1301 (citing <em>State v. Reed, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>237, 253, 627 A.2d 630 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">In our view, defendant\u2019s statement to Illas was not a request for an attorney. Defendant merely asked the officer whether he thought defendant needed a lawyer, an inquiry that readily may be distinguished from other statements considered to be requests for counsel. <em>See Maglio v. Jago, </em>580 F.2d 202, 203 (6th Cir.1978) (\u201cMaybe I should have an attorney.\u201d), and <em>United States v. Clark, </em>499 F.2d 802, 805 (4th Cir.1974) (\u201cI had better talk to a lawyer.\u201d). There is no dispute that defendant was told that he had a right to a lawyer. Defendant could have requested an attorney. His statement to Illas was not such a request.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">We turn to defendant\u2019s assertion that the trial judge erred in his jury instructions and that such errors warrant reversal of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">Defendant argues that the judge erred in his charge on aggravated manslaughter. It is undisputed that in his initial instructions, the judge did not instruct the jury on all of the elements of aggravated manslaughter. However, after commencing deliberations, the jury sent a question to the judge asking that he repeat the instructions on homicide. The judge read the entire instructions on murder, aggravated manslaughter and reckless manslaughter. The following day, the jury requested that the judge review \u201cone more time, the full charge.\u201d The judge\u2019s instructions again included a full definition of aggravated manslaughter. Defendant argues that the charge was \u201cprejudicially tainted\u201d because, although the judge twice instructed the jury on aggravated manslaughter, the re-instruction did not inform the jury that this was \u201cnewly-instructed\u201d material. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>The judge\u2019s initial failure to provide a complete instruction on aggravated manslaughter \u201ccannot be dealt with in isolation\u201d and the charge must be \u201cexamined as a whole to determine its overall effect.\u201d <em>State v. Savage, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>374, 387, 799 A.2d 477 (2002). The standard for assessing the soundness of jury instructions is whether, in the circumstances, the jurors would understand the instructions as a whole. <em>Ibid. </em>We are convinced that, having been twice provided with full and correct instructions on the elements of aggravated manslaughter, the jurors can reasonably be expected to have understood the instructions for that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Indeed, there is nothing in the record that suggests the jury was in any way confused by the instructions. Defense counsel did not ask the judge to highlight the fact that the judge\u2019s second and third reading of the instructions included material not included in the initial instructions. We are satisfied that the judge\u2019s failure to provide the complete definition of aggravated manslaughter in his initial reading of the instructions was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">Defendant next contends that the judge gave conflicting instructions on how the jury should deliberate on the murder charge and the lesser offenses. It is undisputed that the judge initially instructed the jury that they could consider the three charges together. However, the judge\u2019s later instructions essentially informed the jury that it should consider the charges sequentially. We agree with defendant\u2019s assertion that the judge\u2019s instructions were to some extent contradictory. But any such inconsistency \u201ccannot be dealt with in isolation.\u201d <em>Savage, supra, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>at 387, 799 A.2d 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">We reject defendant\u2019s assertion that he was prejudiced by the instructions on the order of deliberations. The inconsistency was not material. It did not touch upon the substance of the charges, which remained consistent throughout. Moreover, it is not uncommon for a trial judge to suggest an order of deliberations. <em>State v. Josephs, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>44, 91-92, 803 A.2d 1074 (2002). There is nothing inherently wrong with instructing a jury to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>consider offenses sequentially. <em>Ibid. </em>A danger may arise if a charge encourages a jury to convict on the first, and most serious charge, because the jury may believe defendant is guilty of \u201csome\u201d crime. <em>Ibid. </em>But that danger obviously was not present in this case. Defendant was not found guilty of the most serious charge. The inconsistency in the charge on the order of deliberations is not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Defendant also argues that the instructions on the endangering charge were erroneous. We disagree. On the endangering charge, the judge instructed the jury in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">The second element is that the defendant has a legal duly for the care of the child or assumed responsibility for the care of the child. A person having a legal duty for the care of a child means a parent or guardian. Parent or guardian means any natural parent, adoptive parent, foster parent, step-parent, or any person who has assumed responsibility for the care, custody or control of a child or upon whom there is a legal duly for such care. A person who has assumed the responsibility for the care of the child includes any person with whom a child is living at the time the offense is committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">Defendant argues that the instructions failed to adhere to <em>State v. Galloway, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>631, 628 A.2d 735 (1993), where the Court held that the second-degree endangering requires proof that the defendant assumed \u201ca general and ongoing responsibility\u201d for the care of the child and established a \u201ccontinuing or regular supervisory or caretaker relationship\u201d with the child. <em>Id. </em>at 661, 628 A.2d 735. Defendant asserts that the charge here was flawed because the instructions allowed the jury to find defendant guilty merely because defendant was living with D.R. at the time the offense was committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">Again, we disagree. The Court in <em>Galloway </em>explained that \u201cgeneral and ongoing responsibility\u201d for the care of a child may arise from informal arrangements \u201csuch as a person\u2019s cohabitation with the child\u2019s parent.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Although the trial judge here did not incorporate in his charge a statement regarding \u201cgeneral and ongoing responsibility\u201d for a child, the instruction nevertheless required proof that defendant assumed responsibility for the \u201ccare, custody or control of a child,\u201d and specifically made reference to precisely the sort of informal arrangement that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number><em>Galloway </em>Court stated would be evidence of \u201cgeneral and ongoing responsibility\u201d for a child. The charge was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">Defendant also argues that the judge erred in charging the jury on the lesser offenses of aggravated and reckless manslaughter. Defendant opposed the State\u2019s request to charge on these lesser offenses, arguing that he was willing to take the risk of an \u201call or nothing\u201d verdict. Defendant asserts that there was insufficient evidence to support a verdict of aggravated or reckless manslaughter and therefore the jury should not have been charged on those offenses. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">As defendant concedes, it is not the strategic choice of either the defendant or the State that controls. \u201c[T]he integrity of the justice system and the fact-finding process is not subordinate to the singular interests of the parties.\u201d <em>State v. Garron, </em>177 <em>N.J. </em>147, 180, 827 A.2d 243 (2003) (citing <em>State v. Powell, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>305, 319, 419 A.2d 406 (1980)). \u201cVery simply, where the facts on the record would justify a conviction of a certain charge, the people of this State are entitled to have that charge rendered to the jury, and no one\u2019s strategy, or assumed (even real) advantage can take precedence over that public interest.\u201d <em>Powell, supra, </em>84 <em>N.J. </em>at 319, 419 A.2d 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">If the charge is requested by the State, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-8d authorizes the judge to charge the jury if the offense is \u201cincluded\u201d in an offense for which defendant was indicted. However, \u201c[t]he court shall not charge the jury with respect to an included offense unless there is a rational basis for a verdict convicting defendant of the included offense.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-9(e). There must be rational basis in the evidence not only to convict the defendant of the lesser offense, but also to acquit the defendant of the charged offense. <em>State v. Brent, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>107, 113-14, 644 A. 2d 583 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-10\">Here, there was a rational basis in the evidence to charge the jury with the lesser offenses. To be guilty of murder, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>defendant must have knowingly or purposely inflicted serious bodily injury with actual knowledge that the injury created a substantial risk of death and that it was highly probable that death would result. <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>347, 363, 840 A.2d 242 (2004). To convict on a charge of aggravated manslaughter, defendant must have caused death with an awareness and conscious disregard of the probability of death. <em>Ibid. </em>If the defendant disregarded only a possibility of death, the result is reckless manslaughter. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">In this case, there was overwhelming evidence from which a jury could find that D.R. died as a result of the traumatic injury that caused a tear to his mesentery. In addition, there was evidence that supported a finding that D.R. sustained the injury in the early morning hours on May 31, 1998 when defendant was alone with the child. The jury could have determined that defendant inflicted the injury knowingly and intentionally but not with actual knowledge the injury created a substantial risk and a high probability of death. However, the jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant caused the injury by striking the child with force and that he did so with an awareness of and conscious disregard of the fact that the injury would probably cause the child\u2019s death. In short, there was a rational basis in the evidence to charge the lesser offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">We next consider the issues raised in defendant\u2019s supplemental brief. Defendant first argues that the trial judge erred in limiting his cross-examination of Jean Mangini, Dennis Mangini and Dr. Paul Hoyer. Defendant contends that he was denied his right to confront these witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">The right to confront a witness in a criminal trial is protected by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article 1, para. 10 of the New Jersey Constitution. <em>State v. Harvey, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>117, 187-88, 699 A.2d 596 (1997). \u201cThe right to cross-examine is an essential element of that right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 188, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>699 A.2d 596 (citing <em>State v. Budis, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>519, 530-31, 593 A.2d 784 (1991)). However, a defendant's right of confrontation does not permit unlimited cross-examination. <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>Delaware v. Fensterer, </em>474 <em>U.S. </em>15, 20, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>292, 294, 88 L.Ed.2d 15, 19 (1985)). The scope of cross-examination rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>Ibid, </em>(citing <em>State v. Martini </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>176, 263, 619 A.2d 1208 (1993), <em>cert, denied, </em>516 <em>U.S. </em>875, 116 <em>S.Ct. </em>203, 133 L.Ed.2d 137 (1995)). We will not interfere with the trial judge\u2019s authority to control the scope of cross-examination \u201cunless clear error and prejudice are shown.\u201d <em>State v. Gaikwad, </em>349 <em>N.J.Super. </em>62, 87, 793 A.2d 39 (App.Div.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">Jean Mangini is Roberts\u2019 aunt. Jean testified concerning defendant\u2019s relationship with D.R. She stated that D.R. began to sustain certain injuries after Roberts started seeing defendant. The defense sought to cross-examine Jean about her interview with Investigator Crane, in which he asked if Jean had been told that defendant had a \u201ccriminal record.\u201d Defense counsel sought to establish that Jean\u2019s view of defendant had been affected by an alleged misrepresentation of defendant\u2019s record because defendant only had been arrested and he had not been convicted of a crime. Defense counsel also sought to question Dennis Mangini on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">We are convinced that the judge did not abuse his discretion in limiting the cross-examination of Jean and Dennis Mangini. Both witnesses were questioned outside the presence of the jury concerning the investigator\u2019s comments. Jean testified that she had no recollection of the police mentioning defendant\u2019s criminal record. Jean also said that she had no bias against defendant based on the information provided by the police. Dennis testified that he did not recall whether the investigator mentioned that defendant had a criminal record. We are satisfied that in the circumstances, the limitation on cross-examination of these witnesses was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">We are likewise satisfied that the trial judge properly limited the cross-examination of Dr. Paul Hoyer. Defendant sought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>question Hoyer on an allegation that he had improperly touched a body at an autopsy and then made sarcastic comments. The allegation was reflected in affidavits from six persons employed in the Medical Examiner\u2019s Office in Philadelphia. Defendant proposed to have the affiants testify that they had a negative opinion as to Hoyer\u2019s truthfulness. Defendant argues that he should have been permitted to explore these issues in cross-examination. However, as the judge found, defense counsel was not simply seeking to have individuals testify as to Hoyer\u2019s character for truthfulness but was instead endeavoring to introduce evidence of a lack of truthfulness arising from one allegedly bad act. Such evidence was properly excluded pursuant to <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403 and <em>N.J.R.E. </em>608. The judge did not abuse his discretion in limiting Hoyer\u2019s cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">Defendant additionally asserts that the judge erred in allowing the State to show Roberts autopsy photos of D.R. Defendant argues that he was prejudiced because Roberts became emotional when she was shown the photos. The judge found that the possible prejudicial effect of showing the photos to Roberts did not substantially outweigh the probative value of the evidence. <em>N.J.R.E. </em>403. We agree. Roberts saw D.R. just before he was put to bed on May 30, 1998. She was asked whether she saw the bruises that were depicted in the autopsy photos. The evidence obviously was relevant to establishing that defendant was responsible for the child\u2019s injuries and resulting death. In our view, the judge did not abuse his discretion in allowing the photos to be shown to Roberts.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">Defendant further contends that the prosecutor commented improperly upon defendant\u2019s silence at the hospital on May 31,1998. The prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">Anita Brown testified ... she testified about what her role was at the hospital that day. And basically what she told you was the doctors, and the people who were treating [D.R.], were looking for answers ... they asked the people who were with the child the night before what happened and they got no answers. This accident of falling on the bed rail, who got that answer? Sergeant Illas ... when this child was being treated \u2014 being resuscitated and there\u2019s all these monumental efforts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>being done to try to save this child\u2019s life \u2014 this man, [defendant] tells Sergeant Illas it was an accident. He sits there with his mouth shut. And he sits at the hospital with his mouth shut.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Defendant maintains that the prosecutor referred improperly to defendant\u2019s decision not to testify at trial. It is clear, however, that the prosecutor\u2019s comment was not directed at the defendant\u2019s failure to testify but rather at defendant\u2019s failure to tell the medical personnel at the hospital that the child had accidentally fallen from his hands onto the bed rail.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">Defendant also asserts that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were improperly directed to his pre-arrest silence. We disagree. Evidence of pre-arrest silence, in the absence of official interrogation, does not implicate the defendant\u2019s right against self-incrimination. <em>State v. Brown, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>595, 613, 573 A.2d 886 (1990). Such evidence may be admitted \u201cif, when viewed objectively and neutrally in light of all circumstances, it generates an inference of consciousness of guilt that bears on the credibility of the defendant when measured against the defendant\u2019s apparent exculpatory testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 615, 573 A.2d 886. In this case, the evidence of defendant\u2019s silence at the hospital had a direct bearing on the credibility of defendant\u2019s statement to Illas that he accidentally dropped the child. The prosecutor\u2019s comments on this issue were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">We turn to defendant\u2019s assertion that his sentences are excessive. Defendant argues that his convictions for aggravated manslaughter and endangering the welfare of a child merge. We disagree. The overriding principle of merger analysis is that a defendant who has been convicted of one offense cannot be punished as if convicted of two. <em>State v. Hill, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>532, 542, 868 A.2d 290 (2005) (citing <em>State v. Brown, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>481, 561, 651 A.2d 19 (1994), <em>overruled on other grounds, State v. Cooper, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>326, 700 A.2d 306 (1997)). We follow a \u201cflexible approach\u201d to merger and consider the elements of the crimes, the Legislature\u2019s intent in creating the offenses and the specific facts of each case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number><em>Ibid. </em>We are further guided by the principle that \u201cthe Legislature may fractionalize a single criminal episode into separate offenses when the Legislature intends them to be punished separately and when the fraetionalization does not offend constitutional principles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543, 868 A.2d 290 (citing <em>State v. Mirault, </em>92 <em>N.J. </em>492, 504, 457 A.2d 455 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Defendant argues that his convictions merge because the conviction of endangering the welfare of a child must have been based on the same evidence as the manslaughter conviction. We disagree. There was sufficient evidence to establish that defendant had physically abused D.R. prior to May 31, 1998 and therefore committed separate and distinct crimes. <em>State v. Bass, </em>221-<em>N.J.Super. </em>466, 492, 535 A.2d 1 (App.Div.1987). Moreover, the convictions do not merge even if both convictions were based on evidence that defendant injured D.R. on May 31, 1998. <em>See State v. Miller, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>112, 118-21, 527 A.2d 1362 (1987) (holding that convictions for aggravated sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child which are based on the \u201csame general conduct\u201d do not merge because the latter offense is aimed not only at specific conduct but also at the violation of the duty owed by a responsible person to a child).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Defendant also contends that the judge erred in imposing consecutive sentences. We are satisfied, however, that the judge did not abuse his discretion in ordering that the sentences be served consecutively because the evidence established that D.R. was the victim of separate and distinct criminal offenses committed by defendant at different times. The sentences represent an appropriate application of the factors in <em>State v. Yarbough, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>627, 643-44, 498 A.2d 1239 (1985), <em>cert, denied, </em>475 <em>U.S. </em>1014, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>1193,89 L.Ed.2d 308 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">We additionally are satisfied that the judge properly weighed the aggravating and mitigating factors when he imposed his sentences. His findings are amply supported by the record. The sentences are not manifestly excessive or unduly punitive and do not constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. O\u2019Donnell, </em>117 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number><em>N.J. </em>210, 215-16, 564 A.2d 1202 (1989); <em>State v. Ghertler, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>388, 393, 555 A.2d 553 (1989); <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 363-65, 471 A.2d 370 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Defendant further asserts that the judge erred in applying NERA to his conviction of endangering the welfare of a child. The version of NERA in effect at the time defendant committed the offenses applied to \u201cviolent crimes\u201d in which the actor causes death or serious bodily injury, or uses or threatens the use of bodily injury. <em>State v. Kane, </em>335 <em>N.J.Super. </em>391, 398, 762 A.2d 677 (App.Div.2000). The statute was amended in 2001 and, instead of applying to certain \u201cviolent crimes,\u201d the statute provides a list of the specific crimes for which a NERA sentence must be imposed. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2(d), as amended by <em>L. </em>2001, c. 129. Endangering the welfare of a child is not listed as one of the predicate crimes. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Defendant argues that the amendment shows that, when it enacted the original statute, the Legislature did not intend that endangering the welfare of a child would be considered a \u201cviolent crime.\u201d Again, we disagree. Before the statute was amended, NERA plainly applied to any \u201cviolent crime\u201d in which the actor causes serious bodily injury. As the evidence shows here, endangering the welfare of a child can be a \u201cviolent crime.\u201d Indeed, the jury here made an explicit finding that defendant committed a \u2018Violent crime.\u201d In our view, NERA was properly applied in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b603-9\"> Roberts also was charged with endangering the welfare of a child. She pled guilty to a charge of obstruction of justice, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:29-1. In exchange for the plea, the prosecutor agreed to dismiss the endangering charge. The prosecutor also agreed to recommend probation on the condition that Roberts testified truthfully at defendant\u2019s trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
