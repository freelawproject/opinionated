All Shore argues that \u201cpetitioner was not entitled to temporary disability benefits\u201d for that period as she \u201cwas not totally disabled on a temporary basis and unable to work as a result of a work-related injury\u201d because she had resumed \u201cperforming light duty,\u201d and that as the employer \u201coffered to secure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>the judgment ... with a bond,\u201d a stay pending appeal should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The critical facts were stipulated as contained in petitioner\u2019s affidavit of September 4, 2003. Petitioner is \u201cthe owner and chief gymnastics instructor at All Shore ...\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She suffered an injury to her right shoulder as a result of an assault<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> incident to her work on May 1, 2003, and on August 5, 2003 was \u201creleased\u201d by her doctor to do \u201clite duty with no use of [her] right arm or shoulder.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to petitioner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">17. As the owner and chief gymnastics instructor, I must spot my students, which involves catching a student before they fall or sustain an injury. Spotting requires the use of both shoulders and both arms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">18. When I perform spotting, I must frequently catch a student who weighs in excess of 100 lbs. while they are in a free-fall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">19. My chief value to my company, and my main area of duties, is as a gymnastics instructor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\">20. My value as a gymnastics instructor is based on my seventeen years of experience as a student, competitor, and instructor. I am the most experienced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>and valuable gymnastics instructor at All Shore, All-Star Cheerleading &amp; Gymnastics.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-5\">21. I employ several instructors at All Shore to aid me in teaching the various classes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">22. I employ a bookkeeper to perform general accounting, paperwork, and to run the office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">23. Since my right shoulder was injured, I have had to employ and pay an additional instructor to perform my duties as chief instructor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-8\">24. There is no lite duty at All Shore, All-Star Cheerleading &amp; Gymnastics for an instructor with the limitations imposed by Dr. Ferenz, which required no use of the right arm or right shoulder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">As a result of a dispute concerning entitlement to continued benefits after August 5, All Shore\u2019s carrier referred petitioner for a \u201csecond opinion\u201d by Dr. Kirschenbaum who, on August 11, 2003, also \u201creleased [her] to lite duty with no use of [her] right arm and shoulder and no spotting.\u201d According to petitioner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-10\">31. There is no lite duty meeting Dr. Kirschenbaum\u2019s restrictions at All Shore, All-Star Cheerleading and Gymnastics, and I have again had to hire and pay an additional instructor to perform my duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-11\">32. After my visit with Dr. Kirschenbaum, I subsequently called up NJ Manufacturers and spoke with Mr. Lloyd.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-12\">33. I informed Mr. Lloyd that there was no lite duty meeting Dr. Ferenz\u2019s or Dr. Kirschenbaum\u2019s restrictions. Mr. Lloyd informed me that I was capable of performing paperwork and office duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-13\">34. I informed Mr. Lloyd that an employee was paid to perform paperwork and office duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-14\">35. Mr. Lloyd informed me that I would not be paid temporary benefits if I was present at All Shore, All-Star Cheerleading &amp; Gymnastics in any capacity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-15\">36. I informed Mr. Lloyd that it was necessary to the survival of my company that I be present to supervise, and escort any injured students for medical care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-16\">38. I informed Mr. Lloyd that if I could not be present at my company, All Shore, All-Star Cheerleading &amp; Gymnastics, it would go out of business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-17\">40. <em>I cannot presently perform my duties as a gymnastics instructor, I am receiving no pay since I cannot perform instructor duties, and I have had to hire and pay an additional instructor\u2022 to perform my duties.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>41. There are no other positions available for me at All Shore, All-Star Cheer-leading &amp; Gymnastics that meet the doctor\u2019s restrictions. (Emphasis added.) 5</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Petitioner did not receive a salary for the period in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Petitioner supplemented her affidavit with testimony on January 20, 2004. At the time she sought the temporary disability benefits, All Shore had approximately ten employees all of whom, with the exception of one individual who serves as \u201cfull-time\u201d bookkeeper and office manager, are instructors who are paid at an \u201chourly\u201d rate. The rate is based on the instructor\u2019s experience, and petitioner was paid $15.00 an hour as \u201cthe most experienced and valuable gymnastics instructor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Petitioner further testified that before her injury on May 1, petitioner worked between twelve and thirteen hours each day in the summer, instructing day camp classes as well as evening classes. During the remainder of the year, petitioner worked five to six hours a night. Petitioner also provided private instruction for which she was paid $30.00 for a half-hour.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Petitioner testified that she generally collected a net income of about $620 to $650 per week for her work as an instructor. The parties stipulated that \u201cher gross weekly wage\u201d was $890 per week before the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">In addition to providing instruction, petitioner also had other responsibilities as the owner of the facility. These duties included unlocking the facility, general supervision of the business, and handling injured students. Prior to her injury, petitioner did not collect a salary for the duties associated with ownership of the business, but was paid only for performing her duties as an instructor.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">After petitioner was injured, she worked for a couple of weeks, \u201ctrying to tolerate the pain.\u201d She testified that \u201c[t]he pain just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>got too intense and I couldn\u2019t take the pain.\u201d She explained that she stopped instructing because she had a \u201csafety concern\u201d for the students she needed to spot and catch because she felt like she \u201cphysically couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d As noted in petitioner\u2019s affidavit, because of her inability to use her right arm and to spot, she was required to hire \u201can additional instructor to perform [her] duties,\u201d and returned to work as an instructor for \u201ctwo or three\u201d hours a day in \u201cmid December\u201d 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">The \u2019judge of compensation ruled for petitioner. He found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">Petitioner\u2019s testimony, and certification, were consistent and totally credible. The factual situation is quite simple as outlined above. The statute which controls <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-38) provides that temporary disability is to be paid if the petitioner is \u201cunable to continue to work by reason of the accident\u201d, and that the temporary disability continues until the petitioner is so far restored as the \u201cpermanent character of the injury will [permit]\u201d. Case law is clear that respondent is required to offer light duty, but if there is no light duty available, respondent is under the obligation to provide temporary disability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">The court finds based on the facts ... that petitioner during the time period in question was not able to perform her duties as a gymnastics instructor and that no light duty was available to her. Accordingly, she is entitled to temporary disability payments at $623 a week for 18 6/7 weeks (August 5-December 15, 2003) equalling $11,748.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">All Shore argues that because petitioner was able to do light work during the period in dispute, she was not entitled to temporary disability benefits under the workers\u2019 compensation statute. However, because the decision of the judge of compensation is supported by \u201csufficient credible evidence\u201d on the record, we affirm the judgment. <em>See Close v. Kordulak Bros., </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>589, 599, 210 A.2d 753 (1965) (quoting <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 162, 199 A.2d 809 (1964)). <em>See also DeAngelo v. Alsan Masons, Inc., </em>122 <em>N.J.Super. </em>88, 89-90, 299 A.2d 90 (App.Div.) (per curiam), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>581, 303 A.2d 883 (1973).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-9\">Temporary disability benefits are to be paid from \u201cthe day that the employee is first unable to continue at work by reason of the accident ... up to the first working day that the employee is able to resume work and continue permanently thereat,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-38, or until [the employee] \u201cis as far restored as the permanent character of the injury will permit-the determinant date being whichever of these events happens first.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-10\"><em>[Harbatuk v. S &amp; S Furniture Systems Insulation, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>614, 620-21, 512 A.2d 537 (App.Div.1986) (quoting <em>Tamecki v. Johns-Manville Products Corp., </em>125 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number><em>N.J.Super. </em>355, 358-59, 311 A.2d 20 (App.Div.1973), <em>certif. denied, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>495, 317 A.2d 707 (1974)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-6\"><em>See also Williams v. Topps Appliance City, </em>239 <em>N.J.Super. </em>528, 532, 571 A.2d 1311 (App.Div.1989). An employee\u2019s ability to do some light work is not a basis for denying benefits when the employee is trained in a skill which she cannot perform because of her injury or when her employer has no light work available. <em>Harbatuk, supra, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 621-24, 512 A.2d 537.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">In <em>Harbatuk, supra, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 628-29, 512 A.2d 537, we reversed the denial of temporary disability benefits although the employee was capable of doing light work, such as painting toys and repairing bicycles, while he was awaiting surgery for his occupational injury. We noted that the petitioner had been trained as a carpenter, that this was the only vocational skill he had, and that the employer had no light duty work available for him. <em>Id. </em>at 624, 512 A.2d 537. As Judge King observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-8\">Although <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-58 does not contemplate that an employee be physically capable of returning to the identical employment he was engaged in at the time of the accident, <em>Tamecki v. Johns-Manville, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 359, 311 A.2d 20, we think that the mere fact that petitioner might have been able to work a few hours at a time at light work should not be a sufficient basis for precluding an award of temporary disability benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 624, 512 A.2d 537.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">Similarly, in <em>Cleland v. Verona Radio, </em>130 <em>N.J.L. </em>588, 33 A.2d 712 (1943), discussed in <em>Harbatuk, </em>the former Supreme Court sustained a grant of continued disability payments to a salesman who subsequently purchased and managed his own chicken farm. While the petitioner was able to feed the chickens and clean the eggs, he was forced to hire an employee to do the work petitioner could not perform even though, as in this case, he was able to manage the business. <em>Id. </em>at 594, 33 A.2d 712. The court observed that the ability to do light or intermittent work \u201cis not inconsistent with total incapacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595-96, 33 A.2d 712. <em>See also Zabita v. Chatham Shop Rite, </em>208 <em>N.J.Super. </em>215, 221, 505 A.2d 194 (App.Div.), <em>certif. granted, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>45, 526 A.2d 136 (1986), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>139, 526 A.2d 202 (1987); <em>Electronic Associates Inc. v. Heisinger, </em>111 <em>NJ.Super. </em>15, 20, 266 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>A.2d 601 (App.Div.) (\u201cTemporary disability benefits within the intendment of workmens\u2019 compensation legislation represent a \u2018partial substitute for loss of current wages\u2019\u201d), <em>certif. denied, Heisinger v. Electronic Associates, Inc., </em>57 <em>N.J. </em>139, 270 A.2d 42 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\"><em>Tamecki v. Johns-Manville Products Corp., </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>355, 311 A.2d 20 (App.Div.1973), <em>certif. denied, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>495, 317 A.2d 707 (1974), on which All Shore relies, is distinguishable. In <em>Tamecki, </em>we reversed the grant of temporary benefits to a student injured during a summer job because, despite his injury, he was able to return to school full-time, \u201cas he intended\u201d to do before his injury, and would not have been \u201ctotally disabled\u201d if he had remained \u201cin the labor market.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 358-59, 311 A.2d 20.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">It may be that petitioner was able to perform, and actually performed, light duty but it was the type for which she was not paid as a salaried employee. As in <em>Harbatuk </em>and <em>Cleland, </em>here \u201c[t]he ability for light and intermittent or sedentary work is not inconsistent <em>per se </em>with total disability,\u201d <em>Harbatuk, supra, </em>211 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 624, 512 A.2d 537, and \u201cthe fact that an individual is capable of working a few hours at a time at light work does not affect the right to temporary total disability payments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 626, 512 A.2d 537. Although owner and president of All Shore, petitioner has been employed as a gymnastics instructor and was its most skilled and experienced instructor. While she was capable of doing work as president, she was paid only as instructor and was not paid for the period during which she could not perform her duties as an instructor. In essence, petitioner\u2019s specialized training and experience as an instructor established her value to the company and provided the justification for her pay. Moreover, another instructor was paid to replace her.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As the judge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>compensation found her credible, his findings support his conclusion that she was entitled to temporary benefits during the period in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Although it may be suggested that temporary benefits are designed to provide immediate protection for an employee while out of work due to a work-related accident or injury, and that the posting of a bond incident to a stay does not provide that protection at a critical time, the parties agree that disposition of the appeal renders the issue of a stay moot. Accordingly, we decline to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The judgment of the Division of Workers\u2019 Compensation is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b531-11\"> In her testimony, petitioner also testified that she is president of the corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b531-12\"> Petitioner was assaulted while on the job and was paid temporary disability benefits, without contest, from May 1, 2003 to August 5, 2003.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b531-13\"> In his report of August 5, 2003, Dr. Ferenz stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-14\">The patient has chronic shoulder pain. Most likely etiology is that of some degree of instability and possible labral injury. Unfortunately, we have reached the point where she has maximized conservative treatment measures. She seems to have residual subjective complaints of pain and discomfort and some objective findings of instability. Unfortunately, surgery is not particularly ideal for this type of situation. Due to her pathology and body habitus, stabilization of the shoulder is somewhat more difficult and could wind up with some residual functional deficits. For that reason, we are going to try to avoid the surgical procedure. The patient has reached the point of maximum medical improvement in regard to the conservative treatment of her injuries. She is agreeable with conservative home exercises. I will set a followup in two months for reevaluation to determine whether or not surgery is indicated at that time. Otherwise, no interval treatment is being provided. The patient states she is unable to perform her normal job duties and is therefore kept away from full duty status and is available for light duty.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b533-11\"> Note that paragraphs 37 and 39 were omitted from the stipulation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b533-12\"> Petitioner paid herself $30.00 for each half-hour of private instruction, whereas the other instructors were paid $15.00 per hour. \"[A]s the owner [she] took the full amount,\u201d and \"generally did two [private lessons] a day before regular classes started during the fall.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b536-7\"> Tamecki did receive a partial permanent disability award. <em>Id. </em>at 359, 311 <em>A. </em>2d 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b536-8\"> It is not argued that because petitioner was sole shareholder and president of All Shore, benefits had to be denied because she could have granted herself a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>salary for other services she rendered or saved expenses in order to increase profits.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
