On the day of trial, but before a jury was selected, defendant successfully moved to sever the contempt charge from the burglary and assault charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">In granting defendant\u2019s motion, the court ordered the State to try the burglary and aggravated assault charges first, followed thereafter by the contempt charge. In this first trial, the court precluded the State from introducing any evidence of the existence of a domestic violence temporary restraining order (TRO) issued against defendant. The jury would become aware of the TRO in the second phase of the trial involving the charge of contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">The State agreed that a bifurcated proceeding, separating the burglary and aggravated assault charges from the contempt charge, was necessary to avoid the potential for prejudice. It objected, however, to the court\u2019s order precluding the introduction of the TRO into evidence in the burglary trial. The State argued that, without evidence of the existence of the restraining order, it would be unable to prove an indispensable element of the crime of burglary, to wit, that defendant was not legally licensed or privileged to enter his former residence. The court overruled the State\u2019s objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">We granted the State\u2019s motion for leave to appeal and stayed the trial court proceeding pending our review of this matter. After considering the facts and applicable law, we agree with the State\u2019s position and reverse. For purposes of our discussion, we will accept the State\u2019s proffer as to what the evidence will show at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">Defendant, his longtime paramour Shirley,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and her two children lived together for several years in defendant\u2019s townhouse in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>the Borough of Raritan. On May 16, 2002, Shirley obtained a domestic violence TRO, alleging, as a predicate offense, that defendant harassed her at her place of employment. Among the relief granted in the TRO, Shirley was given exclusive possession of the Raritan townhouse, and defendant was restrained from having any contact with Shirley.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The State alleges that, two days after the issuance of the TRO, defendant entered the townhouse, argued with Shirley and punched her once in the face, causing injuries that required extensive medical treatment. Defendant, through counsel, has proffered an alibi defense, denying that he was ever at the townhouse anytime after the issuance of the TRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">We begin our analysis by reaffirming the applicable standard of review. The trial court is vested with the discretion to sever any count in an indictment, if joinder would unfairly prejudice a defendant or the State. <em>R. </em>3:15-2(b). We will thus reverse a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion to sever only if we are satisfied that it constitutes a mistaken exercise of that discretion. <em>State v. </em>Briley, 53 <em>N.J. </em>498, 503, 251 A.2d 442 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">In <em>State v. Chenique-Puey, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>334, 678 A.2d 694 (1996), the Supreme Court considered whether it was proper to try terroristic threats, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-3b, jointly with fourth-degree contempt of a domestic violence restraining order, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:25-29b(1). The facts in <em>Chenique-Puey </em>are similar to the facts here. An unmarried couple with a history of cohabitation eventually separated due to \u201cincessant arguing and fighting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337, 678 A.2d 694. Sometime thereafter, the woman in that relationship obtained a domestic violence restraining order alleging terroristic threats as the predicate offense. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">Four years after the initial separation, Chenique-Puey returned to his previous residence, and threatened to shoot his former paramour and her boyfriend. He was charged with fourth-degree contempt for violating the domestic violence restraints, third-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>degree terroristic threats and fourth-degree unlawful possession of a knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">At trial, Chenique-Puey unsuccessfully moved to sever the terroristic threats from the contempt charge, arguing that \u201cjoinder of this offense would prejudice him because evidence of the restraining order would convince the jury that he had in fact made the alleged terroristic threats against [his former paramour].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 339, 678 A.2d 694. The Supreme Court agreed with Chenique-Puey\u2019s position, because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">A jury could interpret the [domestic violence restraining] order as a judicial imprimatur on the victim\u2019s testimony. The order creates the inference that if a court found defendant guilty of domestic violence in a prior proceeding, that defendant is more likely guilty of the present terroristic-threat charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\"><em>[Id. </em>at 343, 678 A.2d 694.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">The Court directed trial courts to henceforth \u201ctry sequentially charges of contempt of a domestic-violence restraining order and of an underlying criminal offense when the charges arise from the same criminal episode.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The Court, however, affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence of the restraining order in the prosecution of the contempt charge, because <em>\u201cevidence of the domestic-violence restraining order was an essential element of the State\u2019s proofs.\u201d Id. </em>at 342, 678 A.2d 694 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">Here, by severing the fourth-degree contempt count from the burglary and aggravated assault counts, the trial court correctly applied the holding in <em>Chenique-Puey. </em>There is no question that defendant would be unduly prejudiced by trying these charges together, because, like in <em>Chenique-Puey, </em>the jury here may improperly conclude that defendant may have assaulted Shirley, based, in part, on a previous judicial finding of domestic violence. In fact, as previously noted, the State is not contesting the validity of this ruling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>The error in the trial court\u2019s ruling lies in its decision to preclude the State from offering any evidence of defendant\u2019s inability to enter lawfully his former residence, where the alleged burglary took place. In order to prove defendant guilty of third-degree burglary, the State must prove each of the following two elements beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) defendant entered a structure that he was not licensed or privileged to enter; (2) with the purpose of committing an offense therein. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:18-2a. Burglary becomes a second-degree crime if, in the course of committing the offense, defendant \u201cpurposely, knowingly or recklessly inflicts, attempts to inflict or threatens to inflict bodily injury on anyone.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:18-2b(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">When the Family Part issued the TRO, it deprived defendant of his previous \u201clicense or privilege\u201d to enter the townhouse that he exclusively owns and had shared with Shirley. Unless the State is permitted to present evidence of the existence of this legal disability, the State would be unable to prove an indispensable element of the crime of burglary. We recognize that defendant here is charged with second-degree burglary. By definition, in order to prove defendant committed this crime, the State must present evidence that defendant purposely, knowingly or recklessly inflicted, attempted to inflict or threatened to inflict bodily injury on Shirley. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:18-2b(1). Thus, the burglary and assault charges must be tided together.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The situation here is unlike the problem we confronted in <em>State v. Lozada, </em>357 <em>N.J.Super. </em>468, 815 A.2d 1002 (App.Div.2003). In <em>Lozada, </em>defendant was charged with stalking, elevated to a third-degree offense because the alleged criminal conduct occurred while defendant was subject to a domestic violence restraining order, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-10c, and fourth-degree contempt. We reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to sever, because \u201cthe jury\u2019s knowledge that there has been a restraining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>order is likely to prejudice defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial of the issue of whether he is guilty of conduct constituting stalking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 472, 815 A.2d 1002.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">To solve this problem, we endorsed the Supreme Court\u2019s Model Criminal Charges Committee\u2019s proposal to try the issue of the degree of the stalking offense sequentially before the same jury. Writing for the panel, Judge Pressler explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azj\">where the degree of the stalking offense is in question, the issue of whether there was stalking as defined by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:12-10b should be tried first without reference to any element, including a restraining order, that would elevate the fourth-degree crime to a third-degree crime. If the defendant is found guilty of stalking, then the trial court should \u201ctry the issue of degree before the same jury sequentially; first taking whatever additional proofs are necessary, then charging the jury\u201d appropriately as to the element elevating the crime to third degree. <em>[Ibid.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">A <em>Lozada-type </em>remedy is irrelevant here, because a third-degree burglary charge cannot be elevated to a second-degree crime by virtue of a contempt charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">We are satisfied that the correct approach here is to take a hybrid position, relative to the holding in <em>Chenique-Puey. </em>Because the State cannot meet its burden of proof as to burglary without the relief granted in the TRO, it must be permitted to present evidence to the jury that on May 18, 2002, Shirley had exclusive possession of the Raritan townhouse and defendant was not licensed or privileged to enter this structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">There is no need, however, for the jury to know the legal basis for the issuance of the restraints. In fact, to avoid any possibility for mischievous speculation, the trial court should instruct the jury, using clear and emphatic language, that they are not to engage in any conjecture as to the legal or factual basis for the restraints. The origin of these legal limitations is simply irrelevant to the question of whether the State has proven defendant guilty of burglary beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">Evidence of the restraints, therefore, must be presented to the jury in a sanitized fashion, stripped of any connection to any incident of domestic violence. Redacting the original TRO to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>delete any reference to a domestic violence incident is not practical, however. The form of order used by the Family Part is not susceptible to this type of modification.</p>\n<p id=\"AFK\">The alternative is for the judge presiding over the criminal trial to describe accurately for the jury, as a given fact, the existence and scope of the relevant restraints, while omitting any reference or link to a prior act of domestic violence. In so doing, the judge must also instruct the jury that the State remains obligated to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, each and every element of the crime of burglary. The goal is to afford the State a fair opportunity to present vital evidence to the jury, without causing prejudice to defendant. Permitting the State to admit into evidence the TRO, without these sanitizing measures, needlessly exposes defendant to the prejudice the Supreme Court sought to avoid in <em>Chenique-Puey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The trial court\u2019s order precluding the State from introducing any evidence attesting that defendant was not licensed or privileged to enter this structure is reversed. The matter is remanded for trial consistent with this decision.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-11\"> This is a fictitious name intended to protect the alleged victim's anonymity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b359-10\"> Ironically, on the return date of the TRO, the Family Part found insufficient evidence of defendant\u2019s purpose to harass, and vacated the restraints and dismissed the domestic violence complaint against him. This, of course, in no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>way vitiated the legal viability of the TRO at the time the State alleges defendant's criminal conduct took place.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
