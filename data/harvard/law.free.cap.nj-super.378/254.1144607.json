Jordan, with first-degree kidnapping, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:13-1b (count one); first-degree aggravated sexual assault upon E.B. during the commission or attempted commission of a robbery, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a (count two); first-degree aggravated sexual assault upon E.B. during the commission or attempted commission of a kidnapping, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a (count three); first-degree aggravated sexual assault upon E.B. during the commission or attempted commission of a burglary, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a (count four); second-degree robbery, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1 (count five); second-degree burglary, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:18-2 (count six); third-degree endangering the welfare of a child (fourteen-year-old E.B.), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a (count seven); third-degree aggravated criminal sexual contact with E.B., <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:14-3a (count eight); and third-degree terroristic threats, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:12-3a (count nine).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">As a result of an unsuccessful attempt to resolve this indictment, as well as a number of other unrelated indictments, by way of a negotiated plea agreement, this matter was given a trial date of June 3, 2002. On that date, defendant decided to enter pleas of guilty to all counts of the indictment. During the plea proceedings, the judge advised defendant that the State could request that he be sentenced as a persistent offender, which meant that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>could be sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. The judge accepted the pleas of guilty to counts two through nine, but advised that he would reserve judgment on count one until sentencing because he was not sure if defendant had provided an adequate factual basis as to that charge. Since the court was already in possession of a presentence report, which had been prepared in connection with the earlier negotiated plea agreement that was vacated on defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw, the sentence was scheduled for later in the week. That afternoon, the State prepared its motion to have defendant sentenced as a persistent offender and filed the motion papers with the court. The defendant was served with the motion papers the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">On June 6, 2002, after hearing the arguments of counsel, the court concluded there was no adequate factual basis to accept defendant\u2019s plea of guilty to the kidnapping charge (count one) and \u201cthe count dealing with the commission of an aggravated sexual assault during the commission of the kidnapping\u201d (count three). These counts were inactivated pending appeal. Prior to imposing sentence on the remaining counts, the court heard argument from counsel on the State\u2019s motion and concluded that defendant would be sentenced under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.1a, since he had been convicted of robbery on two prior occasions, <em>i.e., </em>first-degree in November 1988 and second-degree in January 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">After merging counts five, six, seven, eight and nine with counts two and four, the court sentenced defendant to an extended term of life imprisonment without parole on count two, a concurrent extended term of life imprisonment without parole on count four, and community supervision for life under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4a. In addition, defendant was ordered to comply with the registration and notification provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-3 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:7-7. All required fines and penalties were imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Because the sentencing judge had not been able to find legal authority for using a second-degree robbery conviction as a predicate offense for the sentence he had imposed, he went on to make findings \u201cregarding what the sentence of the defendant would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>have been had he not been eligible to be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.\u201d In this regard, and after reviewing defendant\u2019s record and making specific findings, the court stated it would have exercised discretion and sentenced defendant to \u201ca term of life imprisonment with a period of parole ineligibility of 25 years.\u201d <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.1b(1), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7a(1), and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7b. Defendant has not argued that this \u201calternative\u201d sentence is impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">On appeal, defendant raises the following argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-6\">POINT I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-7\">THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN SENTENCING MR. JORDAN TO A LIFE SENTENCE WITHOUT PAROLE PURSUANT TO <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:43-7.1a BECAUSE ONLY FIRST DEGREE CRIMES MAY BE THE PREDICATE OFFENSE FOR THIS EXTREME SENTENCE.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">After a review of the arguments advanced by counsel, as well as a review of the legislative history of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.1 and relevant case law, we concur with defendant\u2019s, position and vacate the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">Prior to enactment of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>20:43-7.1, Governor Whitman, in a conditional veto dated May 8, 1995, returned the proposed legislation to the Senate with her recommendations, including the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-10\">I am advised by the Attorney General that the provisions of this bill are . inconsistent with the grading structure for offenses in the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice (the \u201cCriminal Code\u201d). The bill punishes a person convicted of three fourth degree crimes (crimes graded as the least serious crimes in the Criminal Code) in the same manner as it punishes a person convicted of three first degree crimes (crimes graded as the most serious crimes in the Criminal Code). In effect, the bill is contrary to the legislative principle that criminal punishment should fit the seriousness of the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b292-11\">I recommend, therefore, that this bill be amended to establish a two-tier sentencing structure which comports to the grading structure for crimes in the Criminal Code. <em>Under the recommended two-tier sentencing structure, a person convicted on separate occasions of at least three first degree crimes listed in the first tier will be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. A person convicted on separate occasions of at least three second or third degree crimes </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number><em>listed in the second tier, or any combination of three crimes from the first and second tiers, will receive an extended term of imprisonment for the third crime.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">[Emphasis added].</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Thereafter, the Legislature made the recommended changes and the bill was signed into law, becoming effective on June 22, 1995. In her news release, the Governor noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">The legislation sets up a two-tier sentencing structure providing life without parole for persons who are convicted of <em>first degree </em>crimes on three separate occasions. Under the law, persons convicted of any three of the following crimes would be subject to life imprisonment: murder, aggravated manslaughter, certain aggravated sexual assaults, <em>armed robbery, </em>carjacking and kidnapping.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">A person convicted on separate occasions of at least three second or third degree crimes enumerated in the law, or a combination of crimes from the first and second tiers, will receive an extended term of imprisonment for the third crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">[Emphasis added].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-10\">The constitutionality of the Act was upheld in <em>State v. Oliver, </em>298 <em>N.J.Super. </em>538, 689 A.2d 876 (Law Div.1996), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>316 <em>N.J.Super. </em>592, 720 A.2d 1001 (App.Div.1998), <em>aff'd, </em>162 <em>N.J. </em>580, 745 A.2d 1165 (2000). Pertinent to our discussion, the trial court in <em>Oliver </em>noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-11\"><em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.1a refers simply to <em>N.J.S. </em>2C:15-1 without distinguishing between first and second degree robbery. For purposes of this decision, however, the court is satisfied that reference to <em>N.J.S. </em>2C:15-1 in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.1a was meant to apply only to first degree robbery. This conclusion follows from the fact that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7b(1) specifically refers to second degree robbery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-12\"><em>[Id. </em>at 564, n. 10, 689 A.2d 876.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">In <em>State v. Rhodes, </em>329 <em>N.J.Super. </em>536, 748 A.2d 625 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>165 <em>N.J. </em>487, 758 A.2d 647 (2000), the defendant had been sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. In support of its motion for the sentence, the State had relied upon a New York robbery conviction as one of the predicate offenses or \u201cstrikes.\u201d On appeal, we held that the New York conviction was not \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to the crime of robbery under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:15-1 and noted: (1) \u201cthe Legislature did not intend second degree robbery to be an offense which is comprehended by the Three Strikes Law\u201d; and (2) <em>\u201cN.J.SA </em>2C:43-7.1b(1) specifically refers to second degree robbery as an offense to be considered as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>one of the constituent crimes necessary for authorizing an extended term for repeat offenders.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543, 748 A.2d 625.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Subsequently, in <em>State v. Livingston, </em>172 <em>N.J. </em>209, 797 A.2d 153 (2002), the Supreme Court addressed whether a defendant could be sentenced to life imprisonment without parole when his two prior convictions for first-degree robbery were imposed in one proceeding, although the crimes had been committed almost two years apart. After discussing the legislative history of the Act, the Court applied the rule of lenity, which required it \u201cto construe penal statutes strictly and interpret ambiguous language in favor of a criminal defendant\u201d, and concluded that the Act was not applicable because it literally applied only to those defendants who had been convicted \u201cin two or more separate and distinct proceedings held on different dates, rather than one single continuous proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 218, 213, 797 A.2d 153. Finally, and particularly relevant to our discussion, the Court noted that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.1a \u201cmandates life imprisonment without parole for a person who has been convicted of first degree robbery on three \u2018separate occasions\u2019.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 217, 797 A.2d 153. To the extent this statement is deemed dictum, we note that we are \u201cbound by carefully considered dictum from the Supreme Court.\u201d <em>State v. Breitweiser, </em>373 <em>N.J.Super. </em>271, 282-83, 861 A.2d 176 (App.Div.2004), <em>certif. denied, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>628, 868 A.2d 1031 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">In direct response to <em>Livingston, </em>both the Assembly and Senate introduced a proposed amendment to the Act, which became effective on April 23, 2003. <em>L. </em>2003, c. 48, \u00a7 1. The separate statements accompanying both versions of the proposed amendment made it clear that the Act covered \u201cdefendants convicted of certain first degree crimes who have previously been convicted, on two separate occasions, <em>of those crimes </em>\u201d including <em>\u201crobbery in the first degree.\u201d Senate Judiciary Committee, Statement to S. 1733 </em>and <em>Assembly Judiciary Committee, Statement to A. 3051 </em>(enacted as <em>L. </em>2003, c. 48, \u00a7 1). (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">In these circumstances, and in line with the principle that criminal statutes are to be strictly construed, <em>see State v. Gallo</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number><em>way, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>631, 658-59, 628 A.2d 735 (1993), we are satisfied that the substantial penal consequences that flow from a sentence of life imprisonment without parole require a narrow construction of the statute consistent with the apparent legislative intent to limit the \u201cstrikes\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.1a to those crimes of the first degree enumerated therein or their substantial equivalent \u201cunder any similar statute of the United States, this State, or any other state____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">The sentence imposed is vacated and the matter is remanded for entry of a judgment of conviction consistent with the alternative sentence imposed on June 6, 2002.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
