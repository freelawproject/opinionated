After the agreement of sale it appears that the engine and boiler were sold by the sheriff on a vend. ex. as the property of one J. M. Krick, under the following circumstances: In September, 1894, two executions were issued against Krick, one by Hiram Messinger, on September 24, to November term, 1894, for $500. On this writ the sheriff levied on the boiler and engine. This writ was stayed before sale and nothing further was done under it. Another writ issued on September 25, by Jacob Wolf, to November term, 1894, for $1,200. The indorsements on these several writs appear in the opinion of the court. The boiler and engine, etc., in question were sold under the second writ, and possession delivered to the sheriff\u2019s vendee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>[At the trial the court refused to entertain the motion of the plaintiff to strike out the offers of the vend. ex. and fi. fas. as testimony in the case.] [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-5\">[It subsequently refused plaintiff\u2019s offer to prove by Milton B.

The sale of the engine and boiler under the vend, ex., to April term, 1897, No. 110, was not valid, for the reason that there was no levy on the fi. fa. issued to November term, 1894, on the engine and boiler, and as a consequence no title passed to the purchaser of it at said sheriff\u2019s sale, and defendants should not have given up possession of it. <em>Answer: </em>Our answer to the fifth point is that according to the law and the evidence, the records presented and admitted, the point is not sustained.] [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-11\">[6.

S. Napier, doing business as Westerhoff Bros. &amp; Napier, for the sum of $250, for property which he alleges he has sold to them for that price.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-6\">You remember the evidence shows there was some bargaining with reference to this property, and finally concluded that Mr. Weidman was to buy the property if the title was good, if he could get a good title to it. There appears to have been some controversy in regard to the fact at the time it was offered to these people; and the contract was finally they were to take it if the title was good at the price of $250.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-7\">They undertook to look about for the title themselves, on their own part to see whether it was good or not; and the- testimony is that it had not been for some time agreed upon between them, but it was finally sold for $250 provided that title was good, the condition of the sale. If the title was found to be not good it was not to be a sale, they were not to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-8\">Some of the evidence shows a man named Weidman, I believe, undertook to look after the title, and did make some effort. The plaintiff says, or some of his witnesses, that he said he would consult, or did consult Mr. Brown and Mr. Wolf; Wolf having at some prior time had a claim upon or owned this property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-9\">Mr. Weidman in his testimony says, he did not tell these people that he had seen Brown or Wolf, and that they had said it was good. He said he never told him so.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-10\">[The question here to be decided is but a single question whether or not he has satisfied this jury by the evidence presented that under the law his title is good.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-11\">It is said, and papers have been shown here which show it has been sold as the property of another, and, as I understand the evidence, taken away from the defendants in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-12\">If that would be so, it would not be such title as he undertook to give.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-13\">I believe the evidence shows that fact, I believe the papers I had yesterday show that to be the fact. If that be so then your verdict would have to be for the defendant.] [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-14\">[We now say to you in conclusion that having examined the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>points carefully, and finding the property has been sold as the property of another after these people purchased it from this man, it could not have been his at the time, and therefore your verdict will have to be in this case for the defendant.

Ogden, 185 Pa. 506, it was decided: The execution and delivery of an interpleader bond does not discharge the goods levied .upon from the lien of the execution, or substitute the bond for the goods, but merely operates as a transfer of the goods from the custody of the sheriff to that of the claimant pending the issue as to their oAvnership.\u201d</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b636-16\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"ABd\">Oblady, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b636-17\">The plaintiff sued to recover the sum of $250 which was the price of an engine, boiler, hangers and pulleys that had been sold and delivered by him to the defendants, who resisted payment on the ground that at the time of the alleged sale it Avas distinctly understood that unless the plaintiff had a clear title to the property they would not buy it at any price, and that it had been established afterwards that the plaintiff did not have any title thereto. On the trial it appeared that Hiram Mes-singer issued a writ of fieri facias to No. 46, November term, 1894, on a judgment he had against J. M. Krick. Jacob Wolf issued a writ of fieri facias to No. 47, November term, 1894, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>a judgment he had against the same defendant. The levy on fi. fa. No. 46, which was issued September 24, was indorsed on the writ as follows: \u201c September 24, 1894, on shafting and pulleys, one caramel cutter, stick, machine rollers, two fans, rock, six tables, seventeen trays on third floor, mixing tank, two milk tanks, engine and boiler, pump, shafting, etc., levied on as per property of J. M. Krick.\u201d On fi. fa. No. 47, which was issued September 25, the indorsement is \u201c levied September 27, 1894, on 42,500 cigars, 100 lbs. scrap, 1,000 Spanish, 150 pounds Little Dutch, 50 pounds binders, 18 pounds smoking tobacco, 1 lot chewing tobacco, 65 sets blocks, 2 presses, 1 heater, set harness, fly net, carriage, bunching machine, household and kitchen furniture, etc., levied as personal property of J. M. Krick.\u201d From these indorsements on the writs of fi. fa. it is clear that, at the time the sheriff indorsed his levy upon writ No. 47, he hadan actual levy on the engine and boiler by virtue of his seizure of these items under writ No. 46. A sheriff having two or more executions in his hands, seizes goods; this is the levy; he is not required to make a separate schedule for each. He may make the list on one execution and refer to it in his return on the others. The levy, however, all the time is on all the executions, if it is so made and so expressed to be at the time it was made : McCormick v. Miller, 3 P. &amp; W. 230. If a second fi. fa. be delivered to a sheriff after he has the defendant\u2019s goods in possession under the prior fi. fa. the goods are bound by the second execution, subject to the first from the date of the delivery of the last writ. In contemplation of law, he is deemed (unless it appears to be clearly otherwise) to have seized under the second writ, the same pi\u2019operty that was seized under the first, and not merely the surplus, from the time the second writ comes to his hands, or at any rate, from the time he indorses the seizure: Watmough v. Francis, 7 Pa. 206; Winegardner v. Hafer, 15 Pa. 144. When the sheriff levies on a specific article or articles, naming them, without more he will be confined to his levy; as for example where he levies on a horse, he will not be permitted to sell a cow, or other article of property. But not so when words are added as very plainly indicating his intention to include other property, although not specifically named or. enumerated ; and in this consists the distinction: Wilson Sieger &amp; Co.\u2019s Appeal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>13 Pa. 426. The language of the levy is sufficiently broad and comprehensive in the et ceteras, to have justified the sheriff in selling on writ No. 47, all of the defendant\u2019s personal property, not exempted by law : Schuylkill County\u2019s Appeal, 30 Pa. <em>358; </em>Weidersaul v. Reynolds, 49 Pa. 73 ; Dixon v. Sewing Machine Co., 128 Pa. 397; Sweet v. Williams, 162 Pa. 94. On September 29, Messinger gave notice to the sheriff in writing that \u201cthe engine, water tube boiler, fittings and pipings for the same, levied upon by virtue of fi. fa. No. 46, as the property of J. M. Krick was not the property of J. M. Krick at the time the execution and levy was made, but was at that time the property of the plaintiff, Hiram Messinger.\u201d The Messinger writ was stayed by order of the court, though the reason for this action is not given. On October 8, following, the sheriff presented his interpleader petition to the court of common pleas, praying for a rule on Messinger and Clementine L. Krick, who claimed certain household goods, to appear and maintain or relinquish their respective claims to the property on which he had levied. Messinger was served with\u201d this rule but did not appear and a writ of venditioni exponas, reciting the Wolf judgment, the levy on the engine, boiler, etc., the claim of Messinger to the property and his neglect to appear and maintain his claim, was then issued to No. 110, April term, 1897, on which writ, the property was sold by the sheriff and delivered to the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The only question in the case is the validity of the levy on the engine, boiler, etc., under writ No. 47, which was disposed of correctly by the learned trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">The fact that the earlier writ was stayed did not affect the levy on another writ which was at that time in the sheriff\u2019s hands and on which the levy was noted. It was complete as to each writ and was so recognized by the sheriff when he petitioned, under both writs, for an interpleader, and scheduled this identical property as having been levied upon by him as the property of Krick but claimed by Messinger. The sale under the vend. ex. divested the title of Krick, and, for the purpose of. this case, as effectually disposed of the claim of Messinger. The location of the property had not been changed from the time of the first levy, and Messinger\u2019s attempt to perpetuate his claim to it, through the name of the plaintiff, so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>as to sell it to the defendants cannot avail against them after they were obliged to surrender it to the sheriff\u2019s vendee.</p>\n<p id=\"APKG\">The several writs were properly received in evidence to show that Miller did not have title to the property when it was sold to the defendants. The notice to the sheriff was a suspicious item of proof for the purpose of showing Messinger\u2019s assertion of title to the same property, while he acted for the plaintiff in negotiating this sale. The exact condition of affairs is shown to have been known by Messinger. Through the plaintiff\u2019s failure to make good his title to the property, the defendants lost the fruit of their attempted purchase and when it was taken from them by the sheriff\u2019s vendee they had a complete defense to the plaintiff\u2019s claim for the purchase money.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
