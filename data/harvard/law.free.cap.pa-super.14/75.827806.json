This warrant of extradition was issued in the ordinary and regular course for the issuance of such papers, begun by a petition to the governor of Pennsylvania, with the approval of the district attorney of Allegheny county.' The criminal in this case had been indicted and convicted of the crime of per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>jury. Being under bail and before sentence, he fled to Canada. His bondsman was the moving spirit in the effort for his return. Upon his apprehension the criminal engaged able counsel and prepared for a vigorous resistance to the attempt for his removal. Goldfon, the person named in the warrant, engaged counsel to help secure the surrender of the criminal. He was finally surrendered to Goldfon, by him returned to Allegheny county, and by the court was sentenced and imprisoned. The county having refused to pay the bill presented by Goldfon for his expenses, and fees for the attorneys engaged by him, suit was brought. Of the attorneys\u2019 bill of $1,000, but $100 had been paid by Goldfon, leaving $900 still due. It was, however, agreed by the attorneys for the county that this bill should be treated as if paid, and the whole question be tried in the one case. The jury found for the attorneys $500, and for Goldfon for his expenses $687, subject to the question of law reserved by the court.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AsH\">July 26, 1900:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-5\">Verdict for plaintiff in which judgment was entered in favor of defendant non obstante veredicto.

L. 427. Assuming that a requisition by the governor, when enforced by the request of the federal government to the authorities of a foreign country, is a necessary part of the process referred to in the proviso to the section as \u201c issued on behalf of the commonwealth \u201d the law limits the cases in which the expenses \u201c shall be paid out of the treasury of the county where the offense is charged to have been committed,\u201d to \u201c transporting any person charged with having committed any offense in this state from another state into this state for trial, or for conveying any person after conviction to the penitentiary.\u201d The court below entered judgment for the defendant, non obstante veredicto, upon the ground that the fugitive was not transported from another state into this state within the meaning of the act, holding that \u201c the word state in the act clearly refers to states of the Union which have a right to deal with one another in such matters.\u201d In this view we fully concur. It is one of the primary rules of construction that the words of a statute are to be taken in their common and ordinary meaning, and no one reading this statute, without reference to a particular case, would for a moment imagine that the expression \u201c from another state,\u201d referred to any other than a state similar to this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">It is somewhat significant, as pointed out by the counsel for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>the appellant, that the word, commonwealth used in the preceding part of the section is changed here, but its significance is wholly due to the fact that there are among the states of the United States very few which style themselves commonwealths, but all are embraced in the general term states. Indeed, in the proviso itself commonwealth and state, as is generally the case, are used as synonymous. It is true that a definition of the word state may be found which'would embrace the government of Canada, but it is significant that not once in the pleadings in this case, or in the petition to the governor for a requisition or the certificate of the district attorney, is it called a state, but is always referred to as the dominion or province of Canada. If the legislature had intended to include foreign countries within the provisions of the act, it would undoubtedly have said so. It is easy to conceive of a case in which, in the interest of the public welfare and the due administration of justice, there should be authority to pay out of the county treasury the expenses of extradition from a foreign country and the county made liable for the payment of the same, but we cannot find either authority or liability to pay in the act of assembly referred to. The general authority of the county commissioners as the financial officers of the county to make a special contract for such services is not here involved. It may be that legislation upon this subject is necessary, but, if had, it should be carefully guarded, as the facts of this case clearly prove, and should be enacted by legislative and not judicial authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Having reached this conclusion, it is unnecessary to consider the other questions as to liability for attorneys\u2019 services in securing extradition. Believing that the court below properly interpreted the proviso to the first section of the criminal code of 1860, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
