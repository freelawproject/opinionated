FRIEDRICH, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This dispute arises from an interaction between the plaintiffs and a Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) police officer, William O'Brien (O'Brien). Before the Court is WMATA's Motion to Dismiss and Officer O'Brien's Partial Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint. Dkt. 14. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant WMATA's motion, and the Court will grant in part and deny in part O'Brien's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiffs, Mark Anthony Hawkins (Hawkins) and his four-year-old daughter Sparkle Hawkins (Sparkle), left the Verizon Center\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   at approximately 9:45 p.m. on February 17, 2017 after attending a performance of Disney on Ice. Am. Compl. \u00b6 10, Dkt. 13. The sidewalk was filled with children and parents leaving the show.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-11, 30. Hawkins carried Sparkle on his hip as they left.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Near the sidewalk where the pedestrians were leaving the stadium, O'Brien-an officer in WMATA's police force, the Metro Transit Police Department-drove a marked police vehicle.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 10-14. As O'Brien drove by the crowd, the side view mirror of his vehicle allegedly hit Sparkle's arm, and she began to cry.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-15. According to the complaint, O'Brien stopped, got out of his vehicle, and drew his gun which he pointed at Hawkins.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. While walking from his car to the crowd, O'Brien shouted at everyone-Hawkins, Sparkle, and other pedestrians-and \"seemed ready to use his weapon.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-17. Other police officers shouted at O'Brien, urging him \"to put away his weapon,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17, and at some point as the other officers approached the scene, O'Brien backed down, returned to his vehicle, and drove off,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18. After the incident, Hawkins and Sparkle allegedly \"continue to suffer\" from the \"emotional and psychological trauma,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20, and Hawkins fears the police will not protect him and might even harm him in the future,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 29, 2017, Hawkins and Sparkle filed their complaint in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia, alleging six counts against WMATA and O'Brien. Dkt. 1-2. The defendants removed the case to federal court,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Notice of Removal, Dkt. 1-5, and then moved to dismiss all claims against WMATA and to dismiss in part the claims against O'Brien pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Original Mot., Dkt. 6. Subsequently, in their brief in opposition to the defendants' motion to dismiss, the plaintiffs sought to amend their complaint. Pls.' Original Opp'n at 4, Dkt. 9-1 (\"Here Plaintiff seeks to amend his complaint and\n   bring suit[ ] on his own behalf and also Sparkle Hawkins who is a minor. We seek opportunity to file an Amended Complaint to that regard.\"). Even though the plaintiffs did not move to amend pursuant to Rule 15(a), the Court construed the plaintiffs' request as a motion for leave to amend, and granted the motion. Dkt. 12;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a). The plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on February 27, 2018. Dkt. 13.
