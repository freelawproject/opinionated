ROBART, United States District Judge\n   <strong>\n    I. INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the court are three motions to exclude filed by the parties: (1) Defendant Microsoft Corporation's (\"Microsoft\") motion to exclude Dr. Henry S. Farber's expert opinions (Farber Mot. (Dkt. # 362) ); (2) Plaintiffs Katherine Moussouris, Holly Muenchow, and Dana Piermarini's (collective, \"Plaintiffs\") motion to exclude certain expert opinions of Dr. Ali Saad (Saad Mot. (Dkt. # 364) ); and (3) Plaintiffs' motion to exclude Ms. Rhoma Young's expert opinions (Young Mot. (Dkt. ## 367 (sealed), 368 (redacted) ) ). The court has reviewed the parties' filings in support of and in opposition to the motions, the relevant portions of the record, and the applicable law. Being fully advised,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court DENIES Microsoft's motion to exclude Dr. Farber's opinions, GRANTS in part and DENIES in part Plaintiffs' motion to exclude Dr. Saad's opinions, and GRANTS Plaintiffs' motion to exclude Ms. Young's opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs filed this putative class action to challenge Microsoft's \"continuing policy, pattern, and practice of sex discrimination against female employees in technical and engineering roles ... with respect to performance evaluations, pay, promotions, and other terms and conditions of employment.\" (SAC (Dkt. # 55) \u00b6 1.) As a result of these alleged policies and practices, Plaintiffs claim that female technical employees \"receive less compensation and are promoted less frequently than their male counterparts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25 (\"Microsoft discriminates against female technical employees in (1) performance evaluations; (2) compensation; and (3) promotions.\").) Plaintiffs additionally allege that Microsoft \"retaliates against female technical employees who complain about this discrimination.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 27, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a motion to certify a proposed class of women employees in Stock Levels 59-67\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   who work in the Engineering and/or the I/T Operations Professions from September 16, 2012, to the present. (Mot. for Class Cert. (Dkt. ## 228 (sealed), 232 (redacted) ) at 1.) Specifically, Plaintiffs argue that Microsoft maintains a \"common, discriminatory pay and promotions process\"-the \"Calibration Process\" or \"People\n   Discussion Process\"-that results in lower pay and fewer promotions for women. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) To support their claim that gender-based differentials in pay and promotions result from Microsoft's Calibration Process, Plaintiffs rely upon the statistical analysis performed by Dr. Farber. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 5-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Microsoft opposes class certification. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Class Cert. Resp. (Dkt. ## 286 (sealed), 285 (redacted).) In its opposition, Microsoft relies on the statistical analysis performed by Dr. Saad to challenge Dr. Farber's conclusions and to establish that no significant gender-based disparity exists in either pay or promotion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21, 23-28.) Microsoft also relies on Ms. Young's evaluation of Microsoft's Employment Relations Investigation Team (\"ERIT\") to bolster the efficacy of ERIT as a tool Microsoft employs against discrimination. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Subsequently, both parties filed motions to exclude. Microsoft challenges the admissibility of Dr. Farber's opinions, and Plaintiffs challenge the admissibility of some of Dr. Saad's opinions and the entirety of Ms. Young's opinions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Farber Mot.; Saad Mot.; Young Mot.) The court summarizes the relevant portions of each expert's opinions in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Dr. Farber\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dr. Farber is the Hughes-Rogers Professor of Economics at Princeton University, where he has served on the faculty since 1991. (Farber Rep. \u00b6 1.) He received a Ph.D. in economics from Princeton University, a Master of Science in Industrial and Labor Relations from Cornell University, and a B.S. in economics from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Farber teaches the analysis of wages, hours, and other issues in labor economics, as well as econometrics, which is the application of statistics to economics problems. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Dr. Farber analyzed whether there is statistical evidence of discrimination in compensation or advancement rates between male and female technical employees in the relevant Stock Levels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) After analyzing various data on Microsoft employees from January 1, 2010, through May 31, 2016 (\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13), Dr. Farber concludes that female employees in the putative class \"are paid less than otherwise similar men, on average, and the average difference in pay is statistically significant.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) Dr. Farber further concludes that \"women in the class lag behind men in their rate of advancement at Microsoft.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To reach these conclusions, Dr. Farber utilized three main statistical techniques. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) First, Dr. Farber analyzed pay differentials using a multiple regression analysis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34.) A multiple regression analysis produces a numerical estimate, called a \"coefficient,\" which measures the relative impact various factors have on pay. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In other words, the multiple regression analysis can isolate the \"estimate of the difference in pay between women and men\" after controlling for other differences, such as work experience, type of work performed, geographic location, age, and performance reviews. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 34, 38.) The analysis also measures the likelihood that the difference occurred by chance, as measured by the t-statistic and the p-value. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) Larger absolute values of the t-statistic indicate that the estimated pay difference is less likely to have occurred by chance; in the same vein, lower p-values indicate a lower probability that the observed difference arose by chance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Dr. Farber's multiple regression analysis revealed that female technical employees earn 8.6% less than male technical employees, with a statistically significant t-statistic of -25.42. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.) After controlling for work experience, age, compensation year, and geographic location, the gender pay gap is reduced slightly to 7.4%, with a t-statistic of -25.62. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) Additionally controlling for performance review and Discipline-\"job families within a Profession ... that produce similar business results\"-narrows the gap to 6.3%. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54-55.) And finally, controlling for each worker's Standard Title, or their job title, shrinks the gender pay gap to 2.8% but remains statistically significant with a t-statistic of -21.73. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.) However, Dr. Farber cautions that including a worker's Standard Title may understate the true gender pay gap because women are \"systematically under-leveled relative to men.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In fact, Dr. Farber characterizes Standard Title, as well as Career Stage and Stock Level, as examples of \"tainted variables\"-variables that appear to reduce the pay gap but only because the factors themselves are correlated with gender and pay through potentially discriminatory employer decisions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 46, 58.) To demonstrate this, Dr. Farber performs an ordered probit analysis, which returned a statistically significant, negative coefficient to the female indicator variable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44, 60-61, 64.) This negative coefficient indicates that women are systematically assigned to lower Stock Levels and Career Stages, and thus, women are overrepresented in the lower levels but underrepresented in the higher levels. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 58-64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Lastly, Dr. Farber utilizes a probit analysis to assess the differences in the probability of advancement between men and women. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 65-77.) A probit analysis is used when the outcome can take on one of two discrete values-for instance, being promoted or not being promoted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) A probit analysis, like a multiple regression analysis, reveals the influence a factor has on the outcome and thus can estimate the difference between women and men in the probability of promotion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) Dr. Farber concludes that women are 2.1 percentage points less likely to advance from one Stock Level to the next and 2.6 percentage points less likely to advance from one Career Stage to the next. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71.) Both differences are statistically significant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Farber also calculates the differential in absolute terms by comparing the expected number of Stock Level advancements for women to the actual number of advancements. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 72.) He finds that in total, female technical employees in Stock Levels 60-64 were denied 518 advancements that should have been expected. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77, 82.) Put another way, Dr. Farber found a shortfall of advancements among women in Stock Levels 60 to 64, all of which were statistically significant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In his deposition, Dr. Farber made clear that he did not analyze the relationship between pay and promotion and any particular supervisors or managers. (Farber Dep. (Dkt. # 363-1) at 241:11-19.) Thus, he has no opinion on whether \"women working for different supervisors have higher or lower pay\" or were \"more or less likely to be promoted.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 242:4-15.) Nonetheless, in his rebuttal report, Dr. Farber calculated the pay differentials with regard to each Level 1 supervisor at\n   Microsoft\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and found that \"virtually all woman years (more than 99%) are worked under Level 1 supervisors under whom women earn less than men, on average, after controlling for the factors in the model.\" (Farber Rebuttal \u00b6 16.) Dr. Farber did not further disaggregate the data. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Farber Rep., Farber Rebuttal.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Dr. Saad\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Dr. Saad is the managing partner of Resolution Economics Group LLC, a firm that performs economic and statistical analyses in connection with litigation and consulting matters. (Saad Rep. (Dkt. ## 354-1 (sealed), 355-1 (redacted) ) \u00b6 2.) He holds a Ph.D. in economics from the University of Chicago and a B.A. in History and Economics from the University of Pennsylvania. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Prior to his consulting career, Dr. Saad was on the faculty of the economics and finance department at Baruch College of the City University of New York, where he taught labor economics, micro and macroeconomics, econometrics, and economic history. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Saad's work focuses on statistical analyses of systemic gender discrimination claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On February 16, 2018, Microsoft filed a second corrected version of Dr. Saad's report (the \"revised report\") pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(e). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Not. of Saad Revised Rep. (Dkt. # 355).) Microsoft asserts that the revised report rectifies several mathematical errors but makes no substantive changes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1.) In this revised report, as before, Dr. Saad criticizes Dr. Farber for \"aggregating all women together to gauge statistical significance overall\" rather than taking into account variation among supervisors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29, 30.) Dr. Saad analyzed how supervisors impact the inquiry by determining the number of supervisors under whom women earn what they are expected to earn under to Dr. Farber's model. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35.) In other words, Dr. Saad looked at what women should have been paid under Dr. Farber's model and analyzed how many supervisors oversaw women who were over or underpaid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Saad concludes that \"supervisors under whom more women earn significantly less as opposed to earning significantly more ... are in the minority.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Regarding promotions, Dr. Saad compared Dr. Farber's predicted number of promotions to the actual number of promotions for the Plaintiffs and their declarants. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 47-49.) In doing so, Dr. Saad assumes that \"a probability above 50% indicates a promotion is more likely than not to occur.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49.) Dr. Saad concludes that Plaintiffs and their declarants received more promotions than expected under Dr. Farber's model: \"Only once does [Dr. Farber's] model predict that a promotion should have occurred when it did not.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As a part of his promotions analysis, Dr. Saad draws a distinction between promotions that occurred at the annual end-of-the-year review (\"annual review\") and those that occurred at other times in the year, such as at a mid-year review (\"mid-year/other\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 102-07.) Dr. Saad finds that annual review promotions showed no gender difference, whereas the mid-year/other promotions show a statistically significant shortfall of promotions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.) To explain this difference, Dr. Saad opines that mid-year/other promotions are \"different in character\" than\n   annual review promotions because \"one sees business reasons cited more frequently\" as justifications for mid-year/other promotions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 107.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   To confirm this hypothesis, Dr. Saad read a sample of 1,000 promotion justifications\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and identified 229 \"different phrases that would indicate a promotion made for business reasons,\" such as \"there is a need,\" \"need:,\" and \"key to keeping Bing Ads Private Lab infastructure [sic] running.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 108-09;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Klein Decl. (Dkt. # 365) \u00b6 6, Ex. 2 (\"Business Need Index\").) He then searched for those 229 terms in all of the promotion justifications and concludes that business reasons were provided for 10.6% of the mid-year/other promotions as compared to only 7.2% of the annual review promotions. (Saad Rep. \u00b6 109.) Dr. Saad did not speak with anybody at Microsoft regarding what qualifies as a business need. (Klein Decl. \u00b6 5, Ex. 1 (\"Saad Dep.\") at 22:23-23:10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Also as a part of his promotions analysis, Dr. Saad utilized a Z-model rather than a probit model. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 116.) The Z-model analysis \"construct[s] presumed homogeneous pools with respect to the variables available for study, where employees within these pools are considered similar, except for their gender.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) For each pool, or \"strata,\" the proportion of female promotions should be roughly equal to the proportion of women in the group. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, the Z-model allows examination of the underlying strata while also allowing for aggregation across pools to obtain an overall result. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) For women working in the Engineering Profession, Dr. Saad's aggregated Z-model analysis shows a 2.21% shortfall in promotions that is statistically significant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 77.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   For women in the I/T Operations Profession, Dr. Saad finds a 0.65% surplus in promotions that is not statistically significant. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 78.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In conducting his Z-model analysis, Dr. Saad created close to 59,000 selection pools for women in Engineering and 5,000 selection pools for those in I/T Operations. (Farber Rebuttal \u00b6 47.) Nearly 60% of these pools in each profession had no female employees, and an additional 8% of the pools in Engineering and 12% of the pools in I/T Operations had only female employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, almost 70% of the pools in each profession comprised of only a single gender. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thirty-nine percent of the Engineering pools and 43% of the I/T Operations pools contained only one individual. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Dr. Saad acknowledges in his deposition that pools with only men or only women \"do not add to the analysis.\" (Saad Dep. at 204:16-205:3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Ms. Young\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Ms. Young is a Human Resources (\"HR\") consultant with over 35 years of HR management experience, dealing directly with employee and employer issues. (Young Rep. (Dkt. ## 395 (sealed), 394 (redacted) ) \u00b6 7).) Her consulting work focuses on designing and implementing policies and procedures to minimize possible discrimination, harassment, and retaliation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8.) Ms. Young has conducted over 300 HR audits, for a wide variety of organizations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) She holds a master's degree in management from Pepperdine University and an undergraduate degree from University of California, Los\n   Angeles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12.) She has also taught HR and operations management professionals on how to gather and analyze information, conduct investigations, and resolve employee complaints. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Ms. Young was asked to evaluate the HR complaint investigation process at Microsoft and how the ERIT investigation processes compare with the \"suggested management practices\" (\"SMPs\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-3.) To do so, Ms. Young reviewed the deposition testimony of ERIT investigators Melinda De Lanoy and Judy Mims; interviewed Ms. De Lanoy and Kimberly Meyers, the Manager of ERIT; looked over 18 out of 231 ERIT investigation case files; and analyzed the relevant Microsoft HR policies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 3; Shapiro Decl. (Dkt. ## 360-8 (sealed), 359-8 (redacted) ) \u00b6 5(h), Ex. 8 (\"Young Dep.\") at 135:12-15.) Ms. Young did not interview any complainants who underwent an ERIT investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 177:24-178:3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Ms. Young reviewed the case files to \"assess [ERIT's] communication style and investigation process.\" (Young Rep. \u00b6 5.) Plaintiffs' counsel identified some of the case files during the deposition of Ms. De Lanoy. (Young Dep. at 136:6-8.) Defense counsel selected the remainder of the cases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 136:24-137:18.)

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Farber Rep.) But Dr. Farber provides reasoned explanations for excluding these two factors. First, Dr. Farber explains that because Stock Level is a pay band, regressing compensation on Stock Level would \"simply be regressing pay on a proxy for pay, which is inappropriate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Farber Rebuttal \u00b6 59 (describing controlling for Stock Level as asking the \"meaningless\" question, \"after controlling for how much each worker earns, do women earn less than men?\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Second, and most importantly, Dr. Farber identifies both Stock Level and Standard Title as \"tainted\" variables, that is, both of these variables are themselves affected by gender bias.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 48, 58-64.) \"[I]llegitimate reasons-reasons themselves representative of the unlawful discrimination at issue-should be excluded from the regression (or otherwise dealt with) to avoid underestimating the significance of a disparity.\"\n   <em>\n    Morgan v.

Plaintiffs criticize Dr. Saad's word-search analysis-in which Dr. Saad personally identified words he believed to connote a \"business need\" and subsequently searched for those words in all of Microsoft's promotion justifications-as unscientific and unreliable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.)

Dr. Saad admits that, out of the hundreds of cases in which he served as an expert, this is the first time he has conducted a \"word search business need study\" like the one conducted here. (Saad Dep. at 25:6-13.) Moreover, Dr. Saad did not discuss the issue with the Microsoft HR department or anyone responsible for making promotion decisions at the company; indeed, Dr. Saad did not speak with anyone at Microsoft at all regarding what the company regards as a business need.

Thus, Dr. Saad's methodology seemingly boils down to reading the justifications and pulling out phrases that struck him or his staff as \"clearly\" having a business justification.

Nor does Microsoft provide this technique's known or potential error rate; in fact, Dr. Saad disclosed that whether his identification was over or under-exclusive \"didn't concern [him].\" (Saad Dep. at 51:23-25.) Nonetheless, Dr. Saad maintains \"with certainty\" that his conclusions \"would not be changed by any other sort\n   of search [Plaintiffs] would do.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52:4-8.) Dr. Saad supports this belief not with an indication of accuracy, but instead with his \"knowledge of how statistical processes and distributional properties work.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52:13-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The lack of reliability in Dr. Saad's methodology is highlighted in his final list of 229 identified terms. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Business Need Index.) Some terms are so specific that they are unlikely to appear in any other comments. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5 (identifying phrases such as \"azure notification hub is expanding,\" \"the need to have a strong senior ic band grows with it,\" and \"key to keeping Bing Ads Private Lab infrastructure [sic] running\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Farber Rebuttal \u00b6 40 (stating that nearly half of Dr. Saad's terms returns only one promotion justification-presumably the original justification from which the term was pulled-as relating to business need). Other terms are extremely general. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Business Need Index at 1 (identifying phrases such as \"we have asked,\" \"I could use,\" and \"new branch\").) The court focuses on these business-need terms not to rule on the correctness of Dr. Saad's identifications, but instead to illustrate how his identifications resemble the \"unsubstantiated speculation and subjective beliefs\" that do not pass muster under Rule 702 and\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .

Dr. Saad's \"business needs\" analysis falls into neither category. As discussed above, he does not have the expertise to determine what qualifies as a \"business need,\" and it is the employees or managers who have first-hand knowledge of the reason behind the promotions. Thus, it is inappropriate to present the \"business needs\" evidence with the imprimatur of an expert witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Microsoft also argues that Plaintiffs' criticisms regarding Dr. Saad's judgment \"at most go to weight and do not warrant exclusion.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) In doing so, Microsoft mischaracterizes Plaintiffs' objections. Plaintiffs are not simply challenging the accuracy of the final list of business-need terms at which Dr. Saad arrived; they question the methodology-or lack thereof-that Dr. Saad relied upon to arrive at that list.

Pools in Z-Model Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The court reaches a similar conclusion regarding Plaintiffs' challenge of Dr. Saad's disaggregation of the data while performing his Z-model analysis. Both parties recognize that a Z-model analysis, or the selection pool method, is a well-recognized statistical modeling technique that is often utilized to analyze disparities, especially those present in employment litigation cases. (Saad Resp. at 9-10; Saad Reply at 4.) Thus, the court finds that Dr. Saad utilized scientifically sound and widely accepted methodology while conducting his study.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Plaintiffs, instead, take issue with how Dr. Saad applied the selection pool method-specifically the number of pools into which Dr. Saad split the data and how many of those pools \"provide no useful information.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Saad Mot. at 4-5.) Plaintiffs are correct that Dr. Saad split the data into numerous pools and that a proportion of those pools contain no gender diversity and thus, as Dr. Saad admits, \"do not added to the analysis.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Saad Dep. 204:16-205:3.) But Microsoft emphasizes that a Z-model analysis must compare similarly situated employees, and thus, Dr. Saad's small pool sizes are merely \"a function of the highly differentiated work that employees ... perform.\" (Saad Resp. at 10.) Indeed, Dr. Saad observes that having some strata offer \"no useful information\" is \"a very common outcome in any aggregated selection model [where] you are using a number of factors to create the strata.\" (Saad Dep. at 206:15-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Plaintiffs' challenges qualify as \"objections to the inadequacies of [Dr. Saad's] study\"-the exact kind of concerns that \"go[ ] to the weight of the evidence rather than its admissibility.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hemmings v.

The court reaches the same conclusion here. Despite the \"inadequacies\" Plaintiffs indentify in Dr. Saad's analysis, Dr. Saad utilizes a scientifically sound method of analysis-one that requires him to disaggregate the data into pools containing individuals who are similar with respect to variables that influence promotions. Thus, any flaws that Plaintiffs identify may affect the weight afforded to Dr. Saad's study but do not warrant the study's exclusion.

Mathematical Errors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Plaintiffs lastly seek to exclude Dr. Saad's predictions of individual employees' pay because Plaintiffs allege that Dr. Saad made \"numerous mathematical and statistical errors.\" (Saad Mot. at 5.) Plaintiffs point out three errors: (1) assuming that all employees, regardless of Standard Title, receive the same average compensation; (2) incorrectly computing the standardized residual; and (3) omitting a mathematical component, called the \"smearing factor,\" when transforming a natural logarithm (\"log\") of total compensation into dollar terms. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The first two of these errors, as Plaintiffs concede, were corrected in Dr. Saad's revised report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Saad Mot. at 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Saad Rep.) The court has determined that this revised report is properly before the court,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 III.B.1, and thus, the only error that remains in dispute is the omission of the \"smearing factor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Plaintiffs' concern regarding the \"smearing factor\" does not render Dr. Saad's analysis unreliable. As Microsoft argues, there is evidence that the \"smearing factor\" is not required in all circumstances. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Saad Decl. \u00b6 Ex. C (\"Manning Article\") at 464 n.3 (noting other ways to \"get a consistent estimate of the smearing factors\").) Thus, Dr. Saad's decision to not utilize the \"smearing factor\" in this scenario-a choice within the bounds of statistical analysis-is another purported \"inadequacy\" that Plaintiffs may argue affords the opinion less weight.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hemmings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9448308\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/285/1174/#p1188\">\n    285 F.3d at 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It does not, however, warrant exclusion of the entire opinion. Because Dr. Saad's revised report corrected the first two errors, and the third, even if erroneous, does not warrant exclusion, the court denies this portion of Plaintiffs' motion to exclude Dr. Saad's opinions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In summary, the court grants Plaintiffs' motion as it pertains to Dr. Saad's \"business needs\" analysis and excludes paragraphs 106 to 110 as well as the graph on page 72 of Dr. Saad's revised report.

The court thus reasoned that the expert \"offer[ed] opinions without a full understanding or knowledge of the facts of this case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because the expert \"failed to sufficiently consider the relevant underlying facts necessary to support his opinions and conclusions,\" the court excluded the opinion as unreliable.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Here, the court finds several issues with the facts and data relied upon by Ms. Young. First, Ms. Young reviewed only 18 out of 231 gender complaints-or 7.79% of the gender complaints reviewed by ERIT. Plaintiffs' rebuttal expert, Dr. Caren Goldberg, observes that any sample \"that comprises less than 10% of the total population of cases raises questions about representativeness.\" (Goldberg Rep. (Dkt. ## 346 (sealed), 359-12 (redacted) \u00b6 15.) This is because \"[s]maller samples are more likely to be different from the population than are larger ones, so smaller samples have more sampling error.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Indeed, Ms. Young concedes that she reviewed only \"a small portion\" of the total number of complaints. (Young Dep. at 135:8-10.) Given the small sample size, the sampling error of the complaints is likely substantial. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Goldberg Rep. \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Second, the complaints reviewed by Ms. Young are not representative of all complaints. Representativeness is essential to the reliability of a study because to the extent that a sample \"systematically differs from the population, inferences about the population from the sample are misleading.\" (Goldberg Rep. \u00b6 16.) In other words, if the 18 complaints reviewed by\n   Ms. Young is not representative of all of the complaints processed by ERIT, Ms. Young's opinion regarding ERIT's efficacy would fail to meet the standards of Rule 702 and\n   <em>\n    Daubert\n   </em>\n   . Ms. Young did not randomly select the files to be considered. Instead, Ms. Young chose ten files that were attached to Plaintiffs' deposition of Ms. De Lanoy and asked Microsoft's counsel to \"add[ ] a few extra cases.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Young Dep. at 136:6-10.) The fact that some of the files were selected by defense counsel could suggest that \"the selection of which [files] were analyzed was subject to bias.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chen-Oster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363493\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/114/110/#p120\">\n    114 F.Supp.3d at 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, standing alone, selection of some files by defense counsel would likely not undermine the representativeness of the selected files.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arjangrad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201890372\">\n    2012 WL 1890372\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (recognizing \"courts generally permit\" the \"common practice for counsel to select a subset of documents to give to a potential expert\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The bigger problem is that Ms. Young admits the sample was not representative-and indeed, was not intended to be representative-of the larger universe of complaints reviewed by ERIT. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Young Dep. 139:8-140:10.) Ms. Young repeatedly conceded during her deposition that the sample she reviewed was not an attempt to be representative of the claims presented, the source of the complaints, or the years in which claims arose.

(\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 137:11-18.) Nor did Ms. Young, after she received the sample, take any additional steps to check or ensure that it is representative of how ERIT handles all of its complaints. (\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Young Rep.; Young Dep.) This lack of representativeness-combined with the sampling error resulting from the small sample size and potential selection bias stemming from choice of the files by defense counsel-suggests that the case files Ms. Young relied upon did not \"provide a complete picture of the relevant events.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Powell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%2012953439\">\n    2012 WL 12953439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. Thus, Ms. Young's methodology, based upon inferences drawn from the incomplete sample, is unreliable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Microsoft offers no evidence that the sample reviewed by Ms. Young met any measure of scientific representativeness. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Young Resp.) Instead, Microsoft baldly asserts-without any legal citation-that \"Ms. Young's approach was biased in\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs'\n   </em>\n   favor\" because ten of the files were identified by Plaintiffs in their deposition of Ms. De Lanoy. (Young Resp. at 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Young Dep. at 136:6-8.) But, as Plaintiffs aptly argue, Ms. Young's reliance\n   on a deposition only \"underscores the problem\" rather than resolves the issue. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Young Reply (Dkt. # 397) at 4.) Documents selected for use in a deposition are not designed to be representative of the overall universe of complaints. Tellingly, Microsoft offers no support for the notion that a sample is adequate simply because some of the files originated from Plaintiffs' deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Nor was the other data relied upon by Ms. Young sufficient. Ms. Young chose only to interview arguably the two most experienced members of the ERIT investigations team-Ms. De Lanoy, the investigator with the most years of experience, and Ms. Meyers, the manager of ERIT. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Young Dep. at 241:9-19, Ex. 6; Goldberg Rep. at \u00b6 12.) Moreover, Ms. Young chose to interview Ms. De Lanoy after already reviewing Ms. De Lanoy's deposition, which \"is not only superfluous, [but] results in an overweighting of that individual's perspective.\" (Goldberg Rep. \u00b6 12.) Ms. Young did not interview the least experienced member of the ERIT team. Indeed, when evaluating the experience of the ERIT team, Ms. Young omitted an inexperienced member from the list with no explanation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Young Rep. Ex. 6; Goldberg Rep. \u00b6 12.) Additionally, Ms. Young's choice to interview ERIT investigators suffers from \"a significant danger of reporting bias.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chen-Oster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363493\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/114/110/#p120\">\n    114 F.Supp.3d at 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ms. Young essentially sought information to evaluate a system from the very investigators whose work are being evaluated. Although the investigator's perspective may be a relevant piece of information, Ms. Young never sought to supplement that information by interviewing any complainant who initiated an ERIT investigation or any of the declarants in the present case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Young Rep. \u00b6 4.) The court therefore finds that Ms. Young's other data are likewise unrepresentative and thus insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   If only some of Ms. Young's underlying data was suspect, the court may well find that the problem did not undermine the study's overall reliability. However, here, the confluence of factors discussed above compels the court to conclude that Ms. Young's opinion is not based on sufficient facts or data, as is required under Rule 702.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Evid. 702. Accordingly, the court grants Plaintiffs' motion to exclude Ms. Young's opinion in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Even if Ms. Young relied on sufficient facts or data, the court is doubtful that she adequately specified the method by which she arrived at her conclusions. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Young Mot. at 9-11.) Experts that rely primarily on experience must explain \"how that experience leads to the conclusion reached, why that experience is a sufficient basis for the opinion, and how that experience is reliably applied to the facts.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 702, Advisory Committee Notes, 2000 Amendments. As applicable here, an expert cannot \"rel[y] on the mere fact of his experience with respect to human resources matters to support [his]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   conclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Parton v.

Ga. Aug. 2, 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   That seems to be exactly what Ms. Young does here. For example, Ms. Young comments that, based upon her experience, the number of complaints at Microsoft is not unusual for a company of Microsoft's size. (Young Rep. \u00b6 56.) But she proffers nothing more. She does not explain how her experience leads her to that conclusion or how her experience is applied specifically to the size of Microsoft or the number of complaints here. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%205974445\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) Nor does she provide any additional detail, such as the size of other comparable companies or the volume of complaints at those companies.
