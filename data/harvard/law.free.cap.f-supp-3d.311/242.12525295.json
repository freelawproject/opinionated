Dr. Cohen had been a tenured professor at UDC since 1976. Second Am. Compl., ECF No. 22 \u00b6 3. In August 2010, he was terminated for failing to submit teaching evaluations for academic years 2006-2007, 2007-2008, and 2008-2009.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-17. For about a year prior to his termination, Dr. Cohen and defendants had been in a dispute over these evaluations, resulting in warnings, suspension without pay, a final opportunity to submit the evaluations, and ultimately, termination. Letter from Provost Graeme Baxter (\"Baxter Letter\"), ECF No. 22-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 18, 2010, then-Provost Graeme Baxter sent Dr. Cohen a final notice of the missing evaluations, requesting a completed evaluation portfolio within twenty-one days and warning that failure to submit the portfolio would subject Dr. Cohen \"to additional disciplinary action which could include termination.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, Dr. Cohen was not aware of the letter and did not timely receive it. Second Am. Compl., ECF No. 22 \u00b6\u00b6 30-32; Letter Appealing Termination to President Sessoms (\"Appeal Letter\"), ECF No. 22-4. On August 5, 2010, having received no response, Provost Baxter sent Dr. Cohen a letter terminating him for cause pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement between UDC and its faculty, known as the \"Sixth Master Agreement.\" Second Am. Compl., ECF No. 22 \u00b6 17; Termination Statement of Cause Letter (\"Termination Letter\"), ECF No. 22-3. The letter provided Dr. Cohen with appeal instructions, also pursuant to the Sixth Master Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Dr. Cohen became aware of his termination about two weeks later. Second Am. Compl., ECF No. 22 \u00b6 18. He discovered that his office \"had been seized and all his possessions and university documents had been taken.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Additionally, Dr. Cohen's UDC email address was closed and he \"lost all his academic and administrative documents stored on UDC's system.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 1, 2010, Dr. Cohen appealed UDC's termination decision to then-UDC President Allen Sessoms, arguing in part that the Chairperson of his Department, Professor Vernise Steadman, did not submit one of his completed evaluations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23; Appeal Letter, ECF No. 22-4. UDC President Sessoms denied Dr. Cohen's appeal on September 8, 2010, finding it \"not credible\" that Dr. Cohen did not receive UDC's multiple communications. Denial Letter from President Sessoms (\"Denial Letter\"), ECF No. 22-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following the procedures set forth in the Sixth Master Agreement, Dr. Cohen then appealed President Sessoms' decision to his union-the UDC Faculty Association (\"the Association\")-for arbitration.

However, the Association \"refused to represent him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Rather than appealing the Association's refusal to arbitrate as an unfair labor practice to the Public Employee Relations Board (\"PERB\") pursuant to the Comprehensive Merit Personnel Act (\"CMPA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-605.02\">\n    D.C.

Because statutes of limitations issues often depend on contested questions of fact, \"a defendant is entitled to succeed\n   on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss brought on statutes of limitations grounds only if the facts that give rise to this affirmative defense are clear on the face of the plaintiff's complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Lattisaw v.

Mot., ECF No. 24 at 10-15. They reason that the statutes of limitations for his claims began to run when the claims accrued on September 10, 2010, the date that Dr. Cohen learned that President Sessoms had denied his termination appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358201\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/118/142/#p153\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   According to the defendants, the statutes of limitations ran through August 1, 2016, the date that Dr. Cohen filed his second amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-15. Because all of the claims are undisputedly subject to three-year statutes of limitations, the defendants argue that all of Dr. Cohen's claims have been filed about three years too late.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The defendants assert that the August 1, 2016 filing date is the date when the statutes of limitations were finally tolled because this Court dismissed Dr. Cohen's first amended complaint, which had been filed on April 2, 2014.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. That July 7, 2014 dismissal, according to the defendants, \"wiped out\" the prior complaint filing's tolling effect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ciralsky v.

Thus, the defendants reason that the three-year statutes of limitations started running from the time Dr. Cohen's claims accrued in 2010 and did not stop for six years-until Dr. Cohen filed his second amended complaint on August 1, 2016.

The D.C.

Dr. Cohen himself contradicts his argument when he admits that his claims \"relate[ ] to his removal ... from employment.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n, ECF No 25 at 12.

Dr. Cohen's contention that his claims are not \"grievances\" has some merit. The CMPA defines a \"grievance\" as \"any matter under the control of the District government which impairs or adversely affects the interest, concern, or welfare of employees, but does not include adverse actions resulting in removals.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-603.01\">\n    D.C.

First, the CMPA \"grievance\" definition goes on to specify that \"[t]his definition ... is not intended to restrict matters that may be subject to a negotiated grievance and arbitration procedure in a collective bargaining agreement between the District and a labor organization representing employees.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-603.01\">\n    D.C.

Bound by that exclusive grievance procedure, Dr. Cohen was required to exhaust it before filing suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Regardless, Dr. Cohen errs in arguing that the CMPA and the CMPA-sanctioned Sixth Master Agreement only apply to \"grievances\" as defined in the CMPA. A \"grievance\" is just one\n   <em>\n    type\n   </em>\n   of personnel issue that the CMPA addresses. \"Adverse actions,\" like removals, are another.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-616.52\">\n    D.C.

This argument is also unavailing because it does not appear to the Court that the inapplicability of the exempted subchapters have any bearing on Dr. Cohen's obligation to exhaust his removal-related claims. For example, Section 1-602.01 states that the CMPA \"shall apply to all employees of the District of Columbia\" unless \"specifically exempted.\" Section 1-602.03 subjects UDC educational employees to all of the CMPA except the subchapters concerning: (1) career service, subchapter VIII; (2) executive service, subchapter X; (3) incentive awards, subchapter XI; (4) employee development, subchapter XIII; (5) the voluntary leave transfer program, subchapter XIII-A; (6) incentive awards, subchapter XIX; and (7) reductions-in-force, subchapter XXIV. It also excludes UDC employees from the provisions of \u00a7 1-609.01, which \"relat[es] to the development of job descriptions.\" None of these exempted subchapters are relevant to Dr. Cohen's claims and none concern adverse action or grievance procedures. Thus, Dr. Cohen, as\n   a UDC employee, was obligated to exhaust his administrative remedies under the CMPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In sum, all of Dr. Cohen's tort claims were connected to his removal from employment such that they did not escape the grasp of the CMPA and the CMPA-sanctioned Sixth Master Agreement, to which Dr. Cohen was bound. His failure to exhaust the administrative remedies available to him, namely appealing the Association's refusal to arbitrate to the PERB before filing a lawsuit, warrants dismissal of those tort claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

They argue that Dr. Cohen received due process because he had notice of his termination and an opportunity to respond, \"the essential elements of a due process claim.\" Defs.'

Compl., ECF No. 22 \u00b6\u00b6 38-41. The Court understands Dr. Cohen's argument to be that his due process rights were violated in different ways by UDC and the individual defendants, respectively. First, he alleges that the Sixth Master Agreement, \"provided by\" the UDC Board of Trustees, is unconstitutional because no \"impartial judicial review is conducted at all when the third-party union elects not to represent the employee.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-602.03\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201-602.03\">\n    \u00b6 41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As the Court understands it, Dr. Cohen argues that the Sixth Master Agreement violates procedural due process because there is no substantive, independent review of UDC's termination decision if the PERB finds that the Association's refusal to arbitrate was not an unfair labor practice. Dr. Cohen's allegations against the individual defendants are less clear. He seems to argue that President Sessoms, Provost Baxter, and Professor Steadman violated his due process rights in three ways: (1) by implementing the unconstitutional Sixth Master Agreement; (2) by flouting the procedural requirements of the same policy; and (3) by \"target[ing]\" him for termination for \"invidious reasons.\"\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Second Am.
