Relevant Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   This dispute arises out of a planned electrical infrastructure project in Virginia, known as the Surry-Skiffes Creek-Whealton\n   Project (\"Project\"). The Project consists of three components: (1) a new 500kV overhead transmission line across the James River from Surry to Skiffes Creek, (2) a new electrical switching station at Skiffes Creek, and (3) a new overhead transmission line from Skiffes Creek to Whealton. Defendants posit that the project is essential in order to improve the electrical infrastructure and provide reliable electric service to the Hampton Roads region of Virginia. Plaintiff's interest in this case lies in the first component of the project, the river crossing, which involves approximately 7.92 miles of overhead transmission line. Approximately 4.11 miles of the line will cross the James River through, and in close proximity to, numerous historically significant sites dating back to the birth of our Nation: the Captain John Smith Trail, the Jamestown-Hog Island-Captain John Smith Trail Historic District, Jamestown Island, the Colonial Parkway, Colonial National Historical Park, and Carter's Grove National Historic Landmark. The river crossing will entail the construction of seventeen towers across the James River. Four of the towers will stand up to 295 feet tall, with the remaining 14 standing approximately 189 feet above the water level.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In early 2013, defendant-intervenor Dominion sought Corps approval for the Project. Dominion initially asked for approval under Nationwide Permit 12, which authorizes activities that cause minimal impact and would not require any individualized analysis under NEPA or the CWA. However, the Corps determined that a standard individual permit review was more appropriate and requested additional information on the Project from Dominion. After receiving additional information from Dominion on the contours of the Project and the need for electrical infrastructure in the region, the Corps issued a public notice in August 2013 initiating the permitting process and soliciting comments from the public, government agencies, and Native American tribes. The Notice indicated that \"[a]ny comments received will be considered by the Corps [ ] to determine whether to issue, modify, condition or deny a permit for this proposal.\" AR0149954. It further noted that comments would be \"used to assess impacts on endangered species, historic properties, water quality, general environmental effects,\" and other factors in order to prepare an EA and/or EIS.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20306107\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, the Corps stated that a preliminary review indicated that an EIS would not be required, though additional information might change their assessment. In response to the notice, the Corps received comments expressing concern with the Project's proximity to historic sites-including from the National Parks Service (\"NPS\"), a sister government agency. NPS, among others, believed that the impacts of the project would be significant and that an EIS was required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Following release of the initial public notice of the Project, the Corps undertook dual-track processes to evaluate the Project: (1) the consultation process required under Section 106 of the NHPA and a (2) NEPA process to determine the environmental impacts and feasible alternatives. Plaintiffs in these cases participated in the processes and provided the Corps with feedback and analysis throughout. At this point in the opinion, the Court will not detail each and every piece of feedback that the Corps received nor the measures that the Corps took to respond to the feedback. The Court will discuss the relevant details as necessary during its analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In May 2017, the Corps; Dominion; and the Acting Assistant Secretary of Interior for Fish, Wildlife, and Parks (on behalf of NPS), among other parties, signed a Memorandum of Agreement (\"MOA\"). The MOA, developed through the Section 106 consultation process, contained stipulations\n   to avoid, minimize, and mitigate adverse impacts to the historical sites in proximity to the proposed Project. In June 2017, the Corps signed and released a document entitled Memorandum for the Record (\"MFR\"). The MFR, a 111-page document, includes an Environmental Assessment (\"EA\") and a Finding of No Significant Impact (\"FONSI\") as required under NEPA, and a Section 404 Statement of Findings as required under the Clean Water Act (\"CWA\"). And on July 3, 2017, the Corps issued the permit to Dominion authorizing the portions of the Project under Corps jurisdiction, subject to compliance with the MOA (among other conditions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiffs, all non-profit organizations, subsequently brought suit in this Court and moved for preliminary injunctions on their claims. In one action, plaintiff NPCA alleges violations of NEPA and the CWA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   17-cv-1361. In the other action, plaintiffs National Trust for Historic Preservation in the United States and Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities allege violations of NEPA, the NHPA, and the CWA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   17-cv-1574. On September 20, 2017, the Court heard oral arguments on the Motions for Preliminary Injunction. The Court denied both motions, finding that the plaintiffs failed to establish a likelihood of irreparable harm prior to the cases being decided on the merits. The plaintiffs subsequently filed motions for summary judgment on their claims and defendants and defendant-intervenors filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The Court now considers those motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

For the sake of clarity, the Court buckets the plaintiffs' arguments into three main categories: (1) that the Corps erred in deciding to issue a FONSI and not an EIS; (2) that the Corps failed to adequately analyze less impactful feasible alternatives; and (3) that the Corps failed to provide the opportunity for public comment or meaningful involvement in the NEPA process.

The record is certainly replete with examples of NPS expressing its view that the project is highly controversial and that the Corps must undertake an EIS. From the Corps' first public notice of the Project in 2014, NPS raised concerns both about the level of impact that the Project would create and the methodologies employed by the Corps and Dominion in evaluating the Project. For instance, NPS noted that \"[t]he high degree of scientific/expert controversy and major impacts to nationally significant resources raised by this project must trigger preparation of an EIS.\" AR 6015. Along those lines, NPS expressed that \"[t]he visual impacts of the proposed project are already highly controversial as demonstrated by opposition from several stakeholder organizations in addition to strenuous opposition from NPS.\" AR 24094.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   NPS was not alone in its opposition to the project and its belief that an EIS was necessary under NEPA. The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (\"ACHP\") and CEQ independently raised concerns at various points over the years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   16-cv-1361, ECF No. 68-1 at 14-16. Moreover, Secretary of the Interior Jewell sent a letter to the Corps in January 2017-her final month in office before the change in administration-stating in no uncertain terms the Department of Interior's \"substantial concerns\" with the Project. AR5920. She noted that the Project \"introduce[s] a major intrusion into a landscape that has been largely unchanged since the earliest days of our Nation\" and that \"no mitigation measure can effectively offset the impact to the landscape that the presence of the transmission line would cause.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274679\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/255/101/#p127\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Secretary Jewell highlighted that \"[o]ther analyses conducted by NPS and outside stakeholders present legitimate questions about the project and identify the existence of viable alternatives\" and that \"NPS has also conducted assessments of socioeconomic impacts, landscape scale and viewshed impacts, and Dominion's mitigation proposal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274679\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/255/101/#p127\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   She noted that the Department concluded, based on that analysis, \"that an overhead power line is unsuitable at this location.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274679\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/255/101/#p127\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Secretary Jewell further stated that should the Corps still believe granting a permit is warranted, it should conduct an EIS beforehand.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274679\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/255/101/#p127\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Finally, a visual impact analysis expert from the Argonne National Laboratory also addressed what he viewed to be insufficient analysis performed by the Corps and Dominion. He noted that \"[n]o analysis of the aesthetic impacts of the proposed project has been conducted, thus the requirements of NEPA are unmet.\" AR 6074. According to the Argonne experts, the Corps improperly substituted a \"cultural resource analysis\" for a \"visual resource analysis\" and therefore improperly analyzed the impact from the Project. AR 6071-72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   These excerpts from the administrative record highlight the vociferous opposition to the Project. And the opposition was not limited to differences in opinion related to the level of impact from the Project. NPS, and others, raised methodological concerns with the Corps' and Dominion's analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Parks Conservation Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355663\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/177/1/#p33\">\n    177 F.Supp.3d at 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding that for a project to be \"highly controversial\" there must be identified flaws in the analysis and not merely disagreement as to the level of impact).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   But, the mere existence of those concerns does not mean that the Project is automatically \"highly controversial.\" The Court looks to whether the concerns went unaddressed or unanswered. The Corps was required to consider the objections of the NPS and the other voices expressing concern about the methodology, but the Corps, as the lead agency in this case, \"is entrusted with the responsibility of considering the various modes of scientific evaluation and theory and choosing the one appropriate for the given circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v.

Cir. 1991).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Here, the Court is convinced that the Corps considered the various methodological challenges raised by the interested parties and addressed their concerns appropriately. For instance, throughout the years, NPS challenged one of the key documents considered by the Corps-the visual effects assessment, entitled the Cultural Resources Effects Assessment (\"CREA\"). CREA-a more than 400 page document-contains photographs of the Project from key vantage points, line of sight analyses, and photo-simulations prepared by an expert consultant, Truescape, demonstrating how the River Crossing would appear to the human eye. AR 762.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   After the Corps made the document public, NPS submitted letters criticizing the methodology employed by Truescape. In a March 2016 letter, for example, NPS asserted that the \"visual simulation analysis\" was \"lacking\" because it failed to look at how the Project would impact a visitor travelling \"in close proximity to the proposed corridor where [the line] crosses the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail.\" AR 29990. In other words, NPS was concerned that while CREA's visual analysis captured what the electrical line would look like from historical vantage points on land, it would not capture the impact to a visitor traveling by boat in the river. In response, the \"Photosimulation Overview was updated in June 2016 to include nearly 80 pages of additional reference photographs and visual simulations depicting views from the river.\" 17-cv-1361, ECF No. 76-1 at 20. Moreover, the \"Photosimulation Overview was updated again in August of 2016 to include additional simulations based on a second round of photographs taken from the river.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522681,5681298\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/938/190/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing AR 23648, AR 26402-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Moreover, from a process perspective, the Corps held discussions with NPS regarding its methodological concerns and received an NPS guidance document on how to evaluate visual impact assessments. AR 28801. The Corps forwarded the document to Dominion, asking them to address whether the methods used were comparable and what the plan would be going forward.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522681,5681298\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/938/190/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; AR 30383. Dominion demonstrated that the methodology used followed NPS guidance and provide reliable simulations of how the Project would look. AR 28552-87. Upon considering the methodological concerns raised by NPS and reviewing Dominion's updated analysis, the Corps concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Dominion's simulations provided enough accuracy to sufficiently analyze effects to both historic properties and a visitor's experience ... While there are various methods for predicting visual impact it is not likely that employing further methods will result in substantively different views or information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   AR 751.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   NPS also argued that the Corps' analysis was flawed because they failed to perform a socio-economic impact analysis. AR 29991. As NPS put it, that type of analysis was critical because \"visual impacts affect visitors; visitors affect tourism; tourism affects local and regional economies, etc.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10522681,5681298\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/938/190/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But again the Corps did not ignore those concerns. The Corps considered a report on the impact that the Project would have on tourism and ultimately concluded-based on analysis of historic visitorship data-that construction and modern physical intrusions have no negative impact to visitorship. AR 694; AR 26215. Again it is not the conclusion that matters, but whether the Corps took the methodological concerns seriously.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Court also considers the timeline of events in determining that the Corps' decision to issue a permit was not \"highly controversial.\" It is true that NPS sent a detailed letter in January 2017-only a few months prior to NPS granting the permit-in which it pointed to \"fundamental flaws\" with the decisionmaking process that \"remain unresolved.\" 17-cv-1361, ECF No. 85 at 32 (citing AR6012). Again, NPS called out the flawed visual analysis and the inadequate socioeconomic analysis. AR6015-6016. But as the Court has already demonstrated, the Corps was not required to accept as true NPS's critiques. All that was required was a serious consideration. And the record reflects that is what transpired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The Corps also did not ignore that final letter. In response, senior staff at the Corps again met with the Interior Department officials to discuss the comments. In March 2017, the new Secretary of the Interior Zinkie, who ultimately presides over NPS, stated that the information that had been provided by the Corps reflected \"thoughtful and thorough consideration of the issues raised by my predecessor.\" AR 4335. Moreover, CEQ informed the Corps that it supported the efforts to complete an EA, AR 4228-29, and the Assistant Secretary for Fish, Wildlife, and Parks signed the MOA on behalf of NPS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Secretary Zinkie's letter effectively withdrew the Department of Interior's previous stance that an EIS was required. \"As we all know, elections have consequences\" and the Interior Department's shift in position demonstrates to the Court that there is no longer active disagreement between the Interior Department and the Corps.\n   <em>\n    Standing Rock Sioux Tribe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274679\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/255/101/#p127\">\n    255 F.Supp.3d at 119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, the Court is satisfied based on its review of the record that the Corps sufficiently addressed the methodological flaws identified by interested parties-that is the Corps carefully considered them, even though it ultimately did not agree with them. Accordingly, the\n   Court does not find the Corps' approval of the Project and issuance of the FONSI to be \"highly controversial\" so as to compel the production of an EIS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    b. Unique Characteristics of Geographic Area and Impacts to Historic Places\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiffs further contend that an EIS is necessary because the Project will cause significant impact to \"unique characteristics of the geographic area such as proximity to historic or cultural resources, park lands, prime farmlands, wetlands, wild and scenic rivers, or ecologically critical areas,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201508.27\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3), and \"will result in significant impacts to 'district, sites, highways, structures, or objects listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places....' \" 17-cv-1361, ECF No. 68-1 at 31 (\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201508.27\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(8) ). Plaintiffs highlight that the transmission line is planned to be \"constructed directly\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     in the James River\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   where the transmission line and its mammoth towers will cross an important segment of the Congressionally-designated Captain [John] Smith [Chesapeake National Historic Trail].\" 17-cv-1361, ECF No.68-1 at 28. According to plaintiff NPCA that fact \"alone compels the need for an EIS since nothing in the Corps' EA or FONSI remotely refutes the common sense understanding and expert agency opinion that this river crossing will fundamentally and permanently alter the historical, cultural, and visitor experience for those traversing the Captain Smith NHT.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201508.27\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201508.27\">\n    at 28-29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As plaintiffs National Trust and Preservation Virginia put it, \"[i]mpacts to a more unique geographic area are difficult to imagine.\" 17-cv-1574, ECF No. 53-1 at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   There is no doubt that the geographic area in question is unique and that the Project will impact historic places. The transmission line will cross a segment of the James River listed on the National River Inventory for outstanding values \"based on history\" and will be in the vicinity of numerous historical sites important to our nation's founding. AR 765.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact in the MFR, the Corps itself described the geographic area as a \"unique and highly scenic section of the James River.\" AR 762. But as federal defendants note, \"an EIS is not required for\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   project that may have an impact\" on a unique area or a historic site, but only when an action \"will cause\n   <em>\n    significant\n   </em>\n   impacts to those areas.\" 17-cv-1361, ECF No. 78-1 at 28. And the Court is convinced that the Corps reasonably concluded that the impacts would not be significant. In other words, its decision was not arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   As already discussed, the Corps extensively considered the potential impacts that the Project would have on the area. It reviewed the CREA, an over 400 page document, which included photo-simulations from several key observation points. AR 73812-4253. In response to feedback from NPS and Argonne Laboratories, the Corps also considered updated photo-simulations, including images from the perspective of boaters and kayakers along the river. AR 23684-735. Corps personnel \"travel[ed] the James River by boat and observ[ed] the river from the important vantage points ....\" AR 762. Following extensive analysis, the Corps concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   In many landward areas, such as the vast majority of Jamestown Island, the\n   project will not be visible due to existing tree cover and vegetation. Where the project will be visible, it is generally at such a distance that it is on the horizon (e.g., from Black Point on Jamestown Island). We note that from the vantage points closest to the project, (limited areas of Colonial Parkway, Grounds at Carters Grove, Jamestown Island-Hog Island-Captain John Smith Trail Historic District) the project will be a modern intrusion on the view, but we emphasize that it is not a blockage to viewing the river or the surroundings. Due to the distances from important vantage points, we conclude that the project will not dominate the view.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   AR 763. The Corps also studied historical data and found that \"there is no correlating variation in visitor ship when compared to past [infrastructure] events.\" AR 694.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The Court is further persuaded by the fact that boaters traveling along that segment of the river are already exposed to numerous modern intrusions on their view. As described by defendant-intervenor, a current day visitor to the area is greeted by \"large de-commissioned Navy ships comprising the Ghost Fleet, the water tower at Fort Eustis, the Surry nuclear power station, and several large modern houses along the shoreline. In addition, a person traveling by boat is likely to see barges and other modern commercial vessels operating on the river at numerous points along the way, as well as recreational boaters and water skiers from Kingsmill Resort.\" 17-cv-1361, ECF No. 76-1 at 47 (internal citations omitted). Plaintiffs respond that all of the existing land based intrusions are incomparable because they can be effectively screened by vegetation. But the analysis considered by the Corps did find that \"vegetation and topography\n   <em>\n    will\n   </em>\n   effectively obscure the towers from many key observation points visitors might travel or recreate-including points on the CAJO Trail.\" 17-cv-1361, ECF No. 88 at 11 (\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   AR 23690; 74028). And for the segments of the river where the Project will be unscreened, it will be similar in nature to the current modern intrusions along the river, such as the commercial ship and the Ghost Fleet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Ultimately, the Corps did enough. It engaged in a reasoned analysis, consulted experts, responded to criticisms of both its methodologies and conclusions, took a hard look at the potential impacts, and concluded that the impact of the Project would be \"moderate at most.\" AR 771. This may not satisfy the plaintiffs, but it is enough to satisfy the Court that the Corps had a rational basis for determining that the impacts would not be significant to the unique geographic area and historical places.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    c. Precedent and Cumulative Effects\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Plaintiff NPCA further contends that \"putting 'gargantuan steel towers' in a unique historic locale where none previously existed, AR 6017, also 'establish[es] a precedent for future action with significant effects,'\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201508.27\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(6), still another CEQ significance criterion.\" 17-cv-1361, ECF No. 68-1 at 32. Sustaining the permit on this Project, according to NPCA, will open the door to other similarly intrusive projects. The Corps addressed this concern in its MFR, finding \"that issuance of this permit will have no effect on the Corps' responsibility to comply with Federal law and regulation in its review of future projects and any future proposals will be fully subject to all necessary and appropriate review requirements based on case specific information.\" AR 687.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Corps further posited that the effect of the decision to grant the permit in this matter \"is purely speculative\" since \"commenters did not identify any future planned or reasonably foreseeable projects of concern.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201508.27\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court agrees.

Mitigation Measures\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Plaintiffs also advance a number of arguments to demonstrate that the Corps failed to properly address the topic of mitigation and was therefore arbitrary and capricious in issuing a FONSI. The mitigation measures are outlined in the MOA, signed by the Corps, Dominion, the Director of the Virginia Department of Historic Resources, the Executive Director of ACHP, the Acting Assistant Secretary of Interior for Fish, Wildlife and Parks (on behalf of NPS), and the Chief of the Chickahominy Tribe. The MOA recognized the signatories \"agreement ... as the resolution of the Project's adverse effects on the historic properties identified in Attachment C in compliance with Section 106 of the NHPA and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20800.6\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\" AR 3128. Federal defendants summarize the requirements of the MOA as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   With respect to the minimization and mitigation of adverse visual impacts to historic properties such as Carter's Grove, Colonial National Historic Park, and Jamestown National Historic Site, the MOA requires specific mitigation measures to decrease impacts. For example, the Project uses naturally weathered galvanized steel towers for visibility reduction, AR 3133; prohibits construction or placement of new transmission infrastructure, AR 3156; and requires Dominion to examine the ongoing electrical need for the Project every 10 years, and assess the feasibility of submerging the river crossing at the end of the 50-year lifespan of the Project,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20800.6\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   AR 741.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   In addition, the Corps has required compensatory mitigation outlined in the MOA, including interpretive signage, AR 3131-32; landscape documentation, AR 3132; a heritage tourism and visitor experience study, AR 3136-37; and site-specific projects that consulting parties must approve to ensure they \"enhance and/or contribute to preservation of the setting and feeling\" of historic sites.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   17-cv-1361, ECF No. 78-1 at 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Plaintiffs' primary argument challenging the mitigation plan is built on a false premise. They contend that the Corps prepared\n   a Mitigated FONSI and were therefore responsible for identifying \" 'specific mitigation measures which\n   <em>\n    completely compensate for any possible adverse environmental impacts stemming from the original proposal'\n   </em>\n   to ensure that 'the statutory threshold of significant environmental effects is not crossed and an EIS is not required.' \" 17-cv-1361, ECF No. 86 at 16 (citing\n   <em>\n    Cabinet Mountains Wilderness/Scotchman's Peak Grizzly Bears v. Peterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3634545,525708\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/685/678/\">\n    685 F.2d 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 682 (D.C. Cir. 1982). And since, according to the plaintiffs, the mitigation measures will certainly not \"completely compensate\" for the impacts of the Project, the Corps issuance of the permit based on a FONSI was arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   There are circumstances where an agency must prepare a Mitigated FONSI. Namely, agencies are required to undertake that work \"[i]f the action will not have such [significant] impact\n   <em>\n    because of\n   </em>\n   the agency's commitment to ensure the performance of mitigation measures ....\"\n   <em>\n    Standing Rock Sioux Tribe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12274679\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/255/101/#p127\">\n    255 F.Supp.3d at 113\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). But that is not what is happening here. The Corps found that the impacts of the Project, independent of any mitigation measures, were not significant.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   AR 688 (\"[t]he majority of environmental impacts associated with this [P]roject are minimal in nature\"); AR 694 (\"[w]hile properties within the projects view shed may experience some impact we expect it to be minimal\"); AR 695 (\"any impacts to water quality and marine life will be insignificant\"); AR 696 (\"[w]hile cumulative visual impacts will accumulate with past, present, and reasonable foreseeable actions, the incremental effect of the proposed project will not amplify the effects to a greater level\"); AR 733 (impacts on navigation are \"negligible\"); AR 739, 742 (\"the cumulative impacts are not considered to be significantly adverse\"); AR 771 (\"we conclude that the actual aesthetic effect of this project will be moderate at most\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   NPCA posits that the federal defendants, through their own words, concede that the Corps undertook a Mitigated FONSI. NPCA points to federal defendants' explanations that \"mitigation measures incorporated in the MOA would help compensate for harm to setting and feeling,\n   <em>\n    ensuring the Project's impact remains below the level of significance\n   </em>\n   \" and that \"while the proposed project may have\n   <em>\n    detrimental\n   </em>\n   aesthetic effects,\n   <em>\n    the proposed mitigation will balance those effects\n   </em>\n   [,] resulting in a net minimal effect.\" 17-cv-1361, ECF No. 86 at 15 (emphases in original) (citing ECF No. 78-1 at 35, 30). But both of those comments do not prove that federal defendants believed the harms were above the significance threshold absent the mitigation measures. Rather, they reinforce the notion that the mitigation measures will further reduce the impacts from \"moderate at most\" to something even lower. At no point in the record, as far as the Court is concerned, does the Corps represent that the impacts, absent mitigation measures, will be significant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Plaintiffs additional critiques can be bucketed into three categories: (1) that the dollar amount of the mitigation efforts (approximately $85 million) itself confirms that the impacts are significant; (17-cv-1361, ECF No. 85 at 17; 17-cv-1574, ECF No. 69 at 16-17); (2) that the mitigation plan does not adequately address the impacts of the project (17-cv-1361, ECF No. 85 at 17-22; 17-cv-1574, ECF No. 69 at 17); and (3) that the specific mitigation measures are uncertain and unenforceable (17-cv-1574, ECF No. 69 at 17-18). All three arguments are without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   First, it is entirely conjectural to argue that merely because Dominion plans to spend approximately $85 million in mitigation efforts that the impacts must be significant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The plaintiffs confound monetary value with what is legally significant. Nowhere in NEPA is that connection made and plaintiffs provide no authority for that supposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Plaintiffs' second argument is built on the false premise that the Court discussed above. Namely, that the mitigation plan is required in order to get the impact level below the significance threshold. But, the Corps made a \"convincing case\" why the impacts are \"moderate at most,\" meaning that mitigation efforts are not required to justify the decision to issue a FONSI. Even when an agency must discuss mitigation measures in the context of an EIS, it is only required to discuss mitigation \"in sufficient detail to ensure that environmental consequences have been fairly evaluated....\"\n   <em>\n    Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605709\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/332/#p350\">\n    490 U.S. 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 352,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605709\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/332/#p350\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"605709\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/490/332/#p350\">\n    104 L.Ed.2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989) ). The Corps met that standard in this case. It devoted considerable effort to studying mitigation measures.

Ultimately the MOA was signed by consulting parties, including leadership at DOI and ACHP, further supporting the Corps' finding that the impacts were below the significant level.

Plaintiffs National Trust and Preservation Virginia contend that \"neither MOA nor the MFR details the specific compensatory actions that must be taken\" and that the MOA does not require that all of the approximately $85 million be spent. 17-cv-1574, ECF No. 69 at 17-18.

The MFR includes an analysis of at least twenty-eight alternatives. AR 699-709. The Corps concluded that of those twenty-eight alternatives, only two were practicable in light of the project purpose-the permitted Project and the Chickahominy-Skiffes Creek alternative. Of those two, the Corps found the permitted Project to be the less environmentally impactful option. Plaintiffs, however, focus their critique not on that analysis and decision, but rather contest whether the other twenty-six alternatives should have been eliminated as impracticable. Plaintiffs highlight two sets of alternatives-underwater options and alternatives suggested by the engineers at Tabors (a firm retained by plaintiff National Trust)-that they believe the Corps arbitrarily and capriciously dismissed from consideration as viable alternatives. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The record indicates that the Corps adequately considered multiple variations of underwater transmission lines, including the possibility of an underwater line combined with additional transmission facilities-the alternative that plaintiffs believe would be feasible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   17-cv-1574, ECF No. 53-1 at 26-27. The Corps concluded that the \"option would only achieve electrical compliance with NERC Reliability Standards until 2032 (about ten years less than the proposed Project), be 'cost prohibitive,' take '5 years to construct,' and have greater aquatic resource impacts.\" 17-cv-1574, ECF No. 59 at 45 (\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   AR 4344; AR 691).

Despite plaintiffs' concerns, the Court is convinced that the Corps adequately analyzed the issue and came to a reasonable conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 4337 (\"[T]he Corps has independently evaluated information supplied by Dominion, as well as information on alternatives supplied through public, agency, and consulting party comments, including the latest input and proposed alternatives provided by [PERI] and [Tabors].\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   The Corps also considered the alternatives presented by Tabors and eliminated them on the basis that they would not be NERC compliant,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   another of the stated purposes of the Project. AR 702-03. The Corps carefully considered Tabors' perspective that the alternatives would not be costly and would be NERC compliant,\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   , AR 6212, but ultimately \"found Dominion's information in support of the preferred alternative compelling from a technical perspective,\" AR 5548-49, and concurred that \"the other alternatives, outside of Dominion's preferred, are either electrically unavailable or not practicable due to cost and/or logistics.\" AR 5549. In reaching its conclusion, the Corps also considered the analysis of a third-party, PJM, on the topic of NERC compliance. AR 6199. PJM reviewed the alternatives and \"completed a series of analyses consistent with RTEP procedures and found that none of the four proposed alternatives address all of the [NERC] reliability criteria violations that are being addressed by the Skiffes Creek 500kV project.\" AR 5132. On that basis, the Corps dismissed alternatives for failing to meet a critical purpose of the Project-NERC compliance. AR 702-03.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The Corps reasonably arrived at that conclusion, given its consideration of Dominion's, PJM's, and its own analysis. The Court will not second guess those findings, despite Tabors' and the plaintiffs' misgivings. All NEPA requires is for the agency to \"briefly discuss\" its reasons for eliminating an alternative. The Corps certainly met that burden here and did not act arbitrarily and capriciously in considering alternatives to the Project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3.

NEPA requires federal agencies to \"[m]ake diligent efforts to involve the public in preparing and implementing their NEPA procedures.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201506.6\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1506.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

The circumstances are: (i) The proposed action is, or is closely similar to, one which normally requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement under\n   the procedures adopted by the agency pursuant to \u00a7 1507.3, or (ii) The nature of the proposed action is one without precedent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201501.4\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1501.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2). The D.C.

Here, the Court finds that the Corps properly exercised its discretion in not circulating a draft of the EA and FONSI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   The first \"limited circumstance\" identified in the regulation above is whether the action is closely similar to one normally requiring an EIS under the agency's procedures.

This action is not without precedent, both within the region that the Project is proposed to be built and more broadly. As the Court has already discussed in detail, the geographic area at issue already contains numerous modern intrusions. Plaintiffs continue to contest that those intrusions pale in comparison to this Project, given that they are situated on land and are better screened. But the Court has already addressed that argument earlier in this opinion. The Corps demonstrated that a number of the modern intrusions can be seen from the river, including \"[t]he Highway 17 Bridge, Ft. Eustis, Surry Nuclear Plant, [and the] VDOT James River Ferry.\" AR 729-30. Therefore, it was reasonable for the Corps to conclude that the Project was not without precedent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    All. to Protect Nantucket Sound, Inc. v.

As the Court has already discussed, the Corps reasonably concluded that the impacts were moderate at best. The Corps weighed against those impacts the \"public safety and welfare implications of rolling blackouts and cascading electrical grid failures in the absence of the permitted Project on a peninsula that contains more than 590,000 citizens, several major military installations, an airport and military airfield, universities, industrial facilities, recreational facilities, deep-water shipping channels, and a port complex.\" 17-cv-1574, ECF No. 61-1 at 73 (\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   AR-672-675, 689-690, 727-729, 733-735).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Plaintiffs continue to stress the vociferous opposition voiced by NPS and others. For instance, NPS concluded that \"granting a permit would be contrary to the public interest given the severe environmental consequences of this project.\" AR 29992. But in performing a public interest review, \"the Corps is not bound to agree with the conclusions reached by these resource agencies, but simply required to listen to and consider their views in the decisionmaking process.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v.

And that is precisely what the Corps did here. In this case the \"Corps solicited the other federal and [ ] agencies' views, encouraged their participation in the [ ] process, and gave full consideration to their comments [ ], all of which is evident from the detailed responses that the Corps prepared in assessing those agencies' comments.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"306569\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/772/1043/#p1054\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As with the Corps obligations under NEPA, the Court will require no more because the CWA requires no more.

For reasons already discussed in the NEPA section of this Opinion, the Corps reasonably concluded that twenty-six of the twenty-eight alternatives were not practicable. Specifically, seventeen fail to meet the project's purpose because they are not NERC compliant, and nine were deemed not practicable given that they were either too costly, too time consuming, or not logistically feasible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR-706-707, 710, 715-716. Ultimately, the Corps took this responsibility seriously. It engaged in a multi-year analysis of alternatives and drew upon comments from other parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Plaintiffs counter by arguing that the Corps failed to\n   <em>\n    independently\n   </em>\n   determine that twenty-six of the twenty-eight alternatives were not practicable for reasons of NERC compliance, time, cost, and logistics.\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v.

Fla. 2009) (finding that the Corps failed to independently evaluate the practicability of alternatives). Plaintiffs assert that, as in\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club\n   </em>\n   , the Corps merely accepted Dominion's analysis without any independent evaluation. But this case is inapposite. The record is rife with evidence that the Corps did not blindly accept Dominion's analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   For example, the Corps independently authored white papers analyzing alternatives, AR 4337-45, AR 73302-09, and concluded that it \"considered all information supplied to date from both Dominion and the public. Additionally, Corps Electrical Engineers have evaluated the information for technical accuracy. In screening the various alternatives, the Corps focused on the ability to sustain sufficient power supply to meet current demand and predicted future growth, existing technology, implementation cost and ability to maintain/achieve compliance with federal laws.\" AR 73308. Moreover, the Corps' chief electrical engineer noted that he \"found Dominion's information in support of the preferred alternative compelling from a technical perspective and for the reasons elaborated upon in the White Paper concur with the preliminary conclusion that other alternatives, outside of Dominion's preferred, are either electrically unavailable or not practicable due to cost and/or logistics.\" AR 4567.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Given the extensive analysis conducted here, the Corps succeeded in rebutting the presumptions arising under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20230.10\">\n    40 C.F.R \u00a7 230.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). Under Section 230.10(a)(3), applicants that seek permits for non-water-dependent projects must rebut two presumptions: (1) that other \"practicable alternatives exist that do not involve special aquatic sites,\" and (2) that \"practicable alternatives ... which do not involve a discharge into a special aquatic site that\n   are presumed to have less adverse impact on the aquatic ecosystem.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20230.10\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3). The record of this case demonstrates that the Corps reasonably concluded that the only practicable alternative to the permitted Project-the Chickahominy-Skiffes Creek alternative-also requires crossing the James River. Since that alternative would have a greater overall impact, the Corps properly concluded that the proposed Project could be permitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Corps' Compliance with the NHPA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The Court turns to addressing whether the Corps met its obligations under the NHPA. Section 106 of the NHPA requires that agencies undertaking a project expected to adversely affect a public or private site listed on the National Register of Historic Places \"take into account the effect of the undertaking on any historic property.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20306108\">\n    54 U.S.C. \u00a7 306108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The ACHP has promulgated regulations governing the Section 106 consultative process, which the Corps carried out in the present case. Plaintiffs have not brought a challenge pursuant to Section 106. Rather, plaintiffs National Trust and Preservation Virginia assert that the Corps failed to meet its obligations under Section 110(f) of the NHPA, which applies to National Historic Landmarks (\"NHLs\"). Section 110(f) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   Prior to the approval of any Federal undertaking that may directly and adversely affect any National Historic Landmark, the head of the responsible Federal agency shall to the maximum extent possible undertake such planning and actions as may be necessary to minimize harm to the landmark.

The key question, though, is whether Carter's Grove will be\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   impacted. Defendants argue that the Corps was not required to comply with Section 110(f) because it applies only to actions that \"directly\" affect an NHL. And when the statute refers to \"direct\" effects, it refers to effects with a\n   <em>\n    physical\n   </em>\n   impact. Since the Project will not be built on the site of Carter's Grove, and because the closest visible tower will sit 1.76 miles from the main house at Carter's Grove, the impacts are strictly visual, not physical. Accordingly, Carter's Grove is\n   <em>\n    indirectly\n   </em>\n   affected, not\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   affected, as is required for Section 110(f) to be implicated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Plaintiffs, on the other hand, argue that the plain meaning of \"directly\" as used in the Section refers to whether the \"effects on Carter's Grove will be the direct result of the Project itself.\" 17-cv-1574, ECF No. 69 at 33. Since \"[t]here is no intervening cause,\" Carter's Grove is directly affected and Section 110(f) applies to this case. In other words, \"directly\" refers to causation rather than physicality, and NPS asserted during the consultative process that the Project would directly impact Carter's Grove.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The Court is aware of no case that speaks directly to the definition of \"directly\" in Section 110(f). But defendant-intervenor does highlight that the cases where courts have found Section 110(f) to be implicated all involved physical, not visual, impacts to NHLs. 17-cv-1361, ECF No. 87 at 33 (\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Presidio Historical Ass'n v.

In addition to the fact that every court that has found Section 110(f) to be implicated in a project dealt with physical effects, ACHP regulations outlining the Section 106 consultative process explain that an \"adverse effect is found when an undertaking may alter,\n   <em>\n    directly\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    indirectly\n   </em>\n   , any of the characteristics of a historic property.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20800.5\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphases added).

It makes sense to consider how ACHP guidance documents interpret the difference between \"direct\" and \"indirect\" when they speak directly to that issue.

That does not mean that there will never be a first, but this case is not it. \"Section 110 does not affirmatively mandate the preservation of historic buildings or other resources\" and only requires an agency \"to comply to the fullest extent possible with, and in the spirit of, the Section 106 consultation process ....\"\n   <em>\n    Oglala Sioux Tribe v.
