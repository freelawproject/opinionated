Timeliness/Judgment on the Pleadings under Rule 12\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   USCIT Rule 12 requires a defendant to either file an answer to a complaint or move to present certain defenses within the time allowed for a response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USCIT R. 12(a), (b). Rule 12 specifically provides that a motion asserting that a complaint fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted \"must be made before pleading if a responsive pleading is allowed.\" USCIT R. 12(b). Rather than filing a USCIT Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, GNSM chose to file its answer. The Government argues that having filed an answer, GNSM was time barred from filing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Government is technically correct; however, Rule 12 also provides that a party may move for judgment on the pleadings after the pleadings are closed, but early enough not to delay trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USCIT R. 12(c). When a court is confronted with a situation in which a party has filed a motion to dismiss after filing an answer, rather than denying the motion to dismiss as untimely, the court will treat the motion as one for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2-12 Milton I.

Furthermore, if the court considers Defendant's motion under Rule 12(c), the court must also determine whether Defendant's motion would improperly delay consideration of the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USCIT R. 12(c). Here GNSM filed its answer on July 26, 2017. One month later, the court issued a scheduling order governing further proceedings, including the filing of motions regarding the pleadings, discovery, and disposition on the merits by summary judgment or trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Scheduling Order. The deadline for motions regarding the pleadings was October 27, 2017, which was extended to November 6, 2017 pursuant to an order on an unopposed motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Consent Mot. for Extension of Time, ECF No. 16; Order, ECF No. 17. That motion and order did not change the May 2018 date for the closure of discovery nor the August 2018 due dates for dispositive motions or a request for trial. Defendant then filed its motion to dismiss on November 5, 2017. Based on these circumstances, the court concludes that Defendant's motion to dismiss was interposed prior to the deadline provided in the Scheduling Order and early enough in the life of this action so as not to delay the final disposition on the merits. Accordingly, the court will not deny GNSM's Rule 12(b)(6) motion as untimely and will instead consider the motion under Rule 12(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

This resulted in an inaccurate entered value for the subject merchandise.\" Compl. \u00b6 10. The complaint further alleges that GNSM's purported \"buying agents\" were, in fact, the foreign sellers themselves, who were listed on the commercial invoices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. The Government also claims that \"the commission payments were not bona fide buying commissions\" and the deduction of these improper buying commissions resulted in an actual loss of revenue of more than $300,000.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13, 33. The Government alleges that those payments are nothing more than additional monies given to the seller of the subject merchandise, and GNSM was not permitted to deduct the payments as non-dutiable commissions on the relevant entry documents. Therefore, the Government claims that labeling the payments made to the seller of the subject merchandise as a commission constitutes the material false statements, acts, or omissions at issue that are the result of GNSM's negligence prior to the June 2007 Notice and gross negligence thereafter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The complaint also pleads that Defendant's violations were grossly negligent because Customs expressly notified GNSM that its buying commissions would not be allowed as non-dutiable commissions because the purported agency agreements were not valid. Compl. \u00b6 23 (citing June 2007 Notice). The complaint also states how Customs provided additional information as to why those agreements were not valid. Despite this explicit warning, the complaint alleges that GNSM ignored Customs and continued to list those improper deductions on its entry forms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At the motion to dismiss stage, all the complaint must do is allege a false statement, act, or omission. This is what Plaintiff has done. Here the complaint states that GNSM improperly deducted, from the entered value of the subject merchandise, certain buying commissions that were based on non-bona fide agency relationships and determined as not allowable by Customs. The complaint characterizes the improper deduction of these buying commissions as the material false statements resulting from Defendant's negligence or gross negligence in violation of \u00a7 1592(a). Accordingly, the court denies GNSM's motion to dismiss, and holds that the Count II of the Government's complaint plausibly alleges a claim for a civil penalty for a violation of \u00a7 1592(a) and (b) based on GNSM's negligence and/or gross negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    B. \"Lawful\" Duties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"Judgment on the pleadings is proper when the moving party clearly establishes on the face of the pleadings that no material issue of fact remains to be resolved and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Hal Roach Studios, Inc. v.

The Federal Circuit did not hold, as Defendant argues, that once an entry is liquidated, additional duties on those entries may never be lawful.

Because the Federal Circuit held that those extensions were not justified, the entries were liquidated at the amounts asserted at entry, and the additional duties that Customs sought were unlawful. The court observed that the deprivation of lost duties was attributed to Customs' \"own delay in pursuing its fraud investigation\" (which caused the entries to be liquidated pursuant to statute), not any violation of \u00a7 1592(a).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3616237\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/497/1331/#p1336\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3616237\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/497/1331/#p1336\">\n    at 1339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Here the Government alleged that it was deprived of duties because GNSM improperly deducted a buyer's commission on the entry forms for the subject merchandise. The complaint further alleges that Customs relied on those improper deductions, with the entries liquidated at the incorrect rate as a result of GNSM's negligence and/or gross negligence. There is no claim in the complaint that Customs, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Ford Motor\n   </em>\n   , was aware of the incorrect duties that Defendant supplied, but liquidated those entries nonetheless, or that the entries were liquidated pursuant to \u00a7 1504 as a result of Customs' unjustified delay in conducting an investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As for\n   <em>\n    National Semiconductor\n   </em>\n   , that case did not involve the recovery of duties pursuant to \u00a7 1592(d) that were lost as a result of violations of \u00a7 1592(a). The Federal Circuit was not focused on the \"lawfulness\" of duties in excess of those listed on liquidated entry forms. Rather, the court resolved the question of whether it is proper for Customs to recover non-penal compensatory interest in an action to collect an interest penalty pursuant to \u00a7 1592(c), i.e., circumstances unrelated to this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   GNSM's argument also fails because it cannot be reconciled with the applicable statute. Section 1592(d) requires collection of any duty unpaid as a result of a violation of \u00a7 1592(a), \"notwithstanding section 1514 of this title, if the United States has been deprived of lawful duties, taxes, or fees as a result of a violation of subsection\n   (a) of this section, the Customs Service shall require that such lawful duties, taxes, and fees be restored, whether or not a monetary penalty is assessed.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201592\">\n    19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1592\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).
