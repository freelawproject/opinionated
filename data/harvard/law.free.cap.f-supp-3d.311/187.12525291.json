Threats to these systems are constantly expanding and evolving. Their security depends on the government's ability to act swiftly against perceived threats and to take preventive action to minimize vulnerabilities. These defensive actions may very well have adverse consequences for some third-parties. But that does not make them unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs in the two lawsuits discussed in this Opinion represent Kaspersky Lab, a large multinational cybersecurity company headquartered in Russia. At least until 2017, Kaspersky Lab's cybersecurity products were used to defend the networks and computer systems of a number of United States federal government agencies. Amid growing concerns in early 2017 about malicious Russian cyber activity against the United States, government officials and members of Congress began asking questions, and voicing concerns, about the presence of these products on government systems. These concerns were based on the risk that the use of Kaspersky Lab products to defend United States government computer systems could be exploited by Russia, either with or without Kaspersky Lab's consent, cooperation, or knowledge. The concerns were fueled, in very summary form, by some combination of the following facts: Kaspersky Lab products enjoy extremely broad access and elevated privileges within the computer systems on which they are installed; Kaspersky Lab is headquartered in Russia; Kaspersky Lab and its founder and Chief Executive Officer, Eugene Kaspersky, have close connections to the Russian government and intelligence services; Kaspersky Lab products cycle users' data to the company's servers that are based in (or accessible from) Russia; Kaspersky Lab is subject to Russian laws that allow the Russian government to request or compel assistance from Russian companies, and is also susceptible to non-legal forms of pressure from the Russian government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The apparent national security risk presented by federal government agencies using Kaspersky Lab products eventually proved intolerable to both Executive Branch officials and Congress. On September 13, 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") issued a Binding Operative Directive (\"BOD 17-01\") pursuant to the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014 (\"FISMA\"), that required all federal departments and agencies to identify and, ninety days later, remove Kaspersky Lab products from their systems. That directive was soon effectively superseded when Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018 (\"NDAA\"), which contains a provision entitled \"Prohibition on Use of Products and Services Developed or Provided by Kaspersky Lab.\" As its title suggests, that provision prohibits all elements of the federal government from using any Kaspersky Lab products or services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Shortly after BOD 17-01 was finalized and the NDAA was signed into law, Kaspersky Lab filed a lawsuit (17-cv-2697) claiming that the BOD violated the Administrative Procedures Act (\"APA\") and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution (hereinafter the \"BOD Lawsuit\"). The BOD Lawsuit did not challenge the legality of the NDAA's prohibition on the use of Kaspersky Lab products. Months later, after this omission became a point of contention regarding Plaintiffs' standing in the BOD Lawsuit, Plaintiffs filed a second lawsuit (18-cv-325) claiming that the NDAA's prohibition was an unconstitutional bill of attainder (hereinafter the \"NDAA Lawsuit\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   These lawsuits are separate and distinct, but both are pending before this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court is issuing this Opinion in both lawsuits, because there are motions pending in each that present overlapping and interrelated issues. Those motions include: Defendant's [10] Motion to Dismiss the Complaint in the NDAA Lawsuit, Plaintiffs' [19] Motion for Summary Judgment in the BOD Lawsuit, and Defendants' [21] Motion to Dismiss or Alternatively for Summary Judgment in the BOD Lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Having carefully reviewed the record, the pleadings,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the relevant authorities, the Court GRANTS Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the NDAA Lawsuit. Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that the NDAA constitutes a bill of attainder. A bill of attainder is \"a law that legislatively determines guilt and inflicts punishment upon an identifiable individual without provision of the protections of a judicial trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Nixon v. Adm'r of Gen. Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180181\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/433/425/#p468\">\n    433 U.S. 425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 468,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180181\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/433/425/#p468\">\n    97 S.Ct. 2777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180181\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/433/425/#p468\">\n    53 L.Ed.2d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977). The NDAA does not inflict \"punishment\" on Kaspersky Lab. It eliminates a perceived risk to the Nation's cybersecurity and, in so doing, has the secondary effect of foreclosing one small source of revenue for a large multinational corporation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Having carefully reviewed the record, the pleadings,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the relevant authorities, the Court also GRANTS Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the BOD Lawsuit for lack of standing. Plaintiffs allege that BOD 17-01 causes them harm by depriving them of the ability to sell to the United States federal government and by damaging their reputation. Even if the Court were to rule in Plaintiffs' favor in the BOD Lawsuit and order the rescission of BOD 17-01, these harms would continue. The NDAA would remain on the books, preventing any federal government agency from purchasing Kaspersky Lab products. It is true that the NDAA's prohibition does not become effective until October 1, 2018. However, government agencies have likely already removed all Kaspersky Lab products from their systems as a result of BOD 17-01 and they know that, regardless, all such products must be removed by the fast-approaching NDAA effective date. Under these circumstances, it is completely implausible that any government entity would purchase a Kaspersky Lab product before October 1st. Accordingly, the empty \"right\" to sell to the federal government for the short period before October 1st that Plaintiffs could stand to gain from success in the BOD Lawsuit lacks any concrete value. It is insufficient to confer standing. An order rescinding the BOD would also not redress the alleged harm to Plaintiffs' reputation as a cybersecurity\n   business because, according to Plaintiffs themselves, the NDAA independently causes, at least, that same harm. Plaintiffs attempted to avoid this jurisdictional roadblock by filing a separate lawsuit challenging the NDAA, but even if the later-filed NDAA Lawsuit had any relevance to Plaintiffs' standing in the BOD Lawsuit, that relevance has been eliminated by its dismissal. Because the BOD Lawsuit is dismissed for lack of standing, the Court need not reach the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Threat of Russian Cyber-Attacks\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   An important context of Plaintiffs' lawsuits, which neither party appears to dispute, is that it is the assessment of the United States government that cyber-attacks, especially from Russia, present a potent threat to critical United States infrastructure. As described by then-Director of National Intelligence James R. Clapper in a statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2015, \"[p]olitically motivated cyber-attacks are now a growing reality, and foreign actors are reconnoitering and developing access to US critical infrastructure systems, which might be quickly exploited for disruption if an adversary's intent became hostile.\" AR0106. \"[T]hose conducting cyber espionage are targeting US government, military, and commercial networks on a daily basis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180181\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/433/425/#p468\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As current Director of National Intelligence Daniel R.

The company was founded in 1997 by Eugene Kaspersky, who serves as the company's Chief Executive Officer.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11. Kaspersky Lab is a multinational corporation present in countries throughout the world, but the particular Plaintiffs in the two lawsuits discussed in this Opinion are Kaspersky Lab, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation that acts as the North American headquarters for Kaspersky Lab, and Kaspersky Lab Limited, a U.K.-based holding company for Kaspersky Lab entities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 9-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It is important to note that Kaspersky Lab does not sell its products exclusively to the United States federal government.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Far from it. To the contrary, \"[o]ver 400 million users-from governments to private individuals, commercial enterprise to critical infrastructure owners and operators alike-utilize Kaspersky Lab technologies.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Indeed, only a\n   <em>\n    tiny\n   </em>\n   fraction of Kaspersky Lab sales in the United States are to the federal government.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. \"Active licenses held by federal agencies in September 2017 had a total value (to Kaspersky Lab, Inc. and the Company as a whole) of less than $54,000-approximately 0.03% of Kaspersky Lab, Inc.'s annual U.S. sales at the time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Early Concerns Voiced About Kaspersky Lab Products\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Members of Congress and the Executive Branch began expressing concerns about\n   the government's use of Kaspersky Lab products-and acting on those concerns-in, at least, early 2017. For example, during a March 2017 Senate hearing on Russian cyber activities, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida cited a \"long history\" of open-source reporting connecting Kaspersky Lab to Russian security services, and asked a panel of cybersecurity experts if they would feel comfortable using Kaspersky Lab products on their devices. Although one of those experts noted that \"Kaspersky is not an arm of the Russian government,\" another responded \"no, I wouldn't, and I wouldn't recommend that you do it either.\"\n   <em>\n    Disinformation: A Primer in Russian Active Measures and Influence Campaigns, Panel II Before the S.

In April 2017, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence asked the Director of National Intelligence and the Attorney General to investigate Kaspersky Lab's ties to the Russian government.\n   <em>\n    See Bolstering the Government's Cybersecurity: Assessing the Risks of Kaspersky Lab Products to the Federal Government Before the H.

That same month, two Congressmen introduced a bill describing Kaspersky Lab as \"a company suspected of having ties with the Russian intelligence services and later caught up in a Russian espionage investigation.\" H.R. Con. Res. 47, 115th Cong. (2017). In May 2017, six United States intelligence directors, including the directors of the Central Intelligence Agency (\"CIA\") and the National Security Agency (\"NSA\"), told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that they would not be comfortable using Kaspersky Lab products on their computers.\n   <em>\n    See Hearing on Worldwide Threats Before the S.

NSA Director Michael Rogers said that he was \"personally involved\" in monitoring the Kaspersky Lab issue, and then-CIA Director Michael Pompeo acknowledged that concerns about Kaspersky Lab products \"ha[d] risen to the director\" level at the CIA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Throughout the summer of 2017, lawmakers continued to raise concerns about the presence of Kaspersky Lab products on federal government systems in at least three other committee hearings in the House and the Senate.\n   <em>\n    See Bolstering the Government's Cybersecurity: Lessons Learned from Wannacry Before H.

In July 2017, Congressman Lamar Smith, Chairman of the House Science Committee, sent a letter to various federal agencies requesting information about their use of Kaspersky Lab software and expressing concern that the company's products were \"susceptible to manipulation by the Russian government.\" AR0557-58. Also in July 2017, the General Services Administration (\"GSA\") removed Kaspersky Lab as a pre-approved vendor for contracts. AR0017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Communications Between Kaspersky Lab and DHS Prior to BOD 17-01\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On July 18, 2017, amidst this growing consensus that the use of Kaspersky Lab products to defend federal systems posed national security risks, Eugene Kaspersky wrote then-Secretary of Homeland Security John F. Kelly a letter \"offer[ing] any information or assistance we can provide\n   with regard to any Department investigation regarding the company, its operations, or its products.\" AR0749. The letter generally extolled Kaspersky Lab's integrity and sought to assure Secretary Kelly that the company had no ties with the Russian government and has not, and would not, assist any government with cyber-espionage efforts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Mr. Kaspersky offered to make himself available to DHS, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, or any other committees or agencies conducting any relevant investigations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   DHS responded by letter on August 14, 2017, thanking Mr. Kaspersky for offering to provide information, stating that DHS looked forward to communicating with him further, and indicating that DHS \"will be in touch again shortly.\" AR0940.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    E. BOD 17-01\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Much to Plaintiffs' dismay, the next they heard from DHS was on September 13, 2017, when, pursuant to her authority under FISMA, Acting DHS Secretary Elaine C. Duke issued BOD 17-01, entitled \"Removal of Kaspersky-Branded Products.\" AR0633-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A very brief explanation of BODs generally is necessary here. Pursuant to FISMA, federal agencies are required, under the supervision of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and the Secretary of Homeland Security, to establish and implement their own policies, principles, standards and guidelines on information security.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203554\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (\"Each agency shall develop, document, and implement an agency-wide information security program to provide information security for the information and information systems that support the operations and assets of the agency.\"). As particularly relevant to this case, FISMA provides that \"[t]he Secretary, in consultation with the Director, shall administer the implementation of agency information security policies and practices for information systems,\" including by \"developing and overseeing the implementation of binding operational directives to agencies.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). A binding operational directive, or BOD, is \"a compulsory direction to an agency that (A) is for purposes of safeguarding Federal information and information systems from a known or reasonably suspected information security threat, vulnerability, or risk; (B) shall be in accordance with policies, principles, standards, and guidelines issued by the Director; and (C) may be revised or repealed by the Director if the direction issued on behalf of the Director is not in accordance with policies and principles developed by the Director.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3552(b)(1). In other words, BODs are used to address suspected threats, vulnerabilities, or risks to federal information systems. In this way, the BOD is a tool that gives the DHS Secretary the ability to take swift action based on predictive judgments to address constantly evolving cyber-threats.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   BOD 17-01 in particular required all federal departments and agencies to take three actions: (1) within 30 days of the issuance of the BOD (October 13, 2017), all agencies were required to identify the use or presence of Kaspersky-branded products on all federal information systems and report this information to DHS; (2) within 60 days (November 12, 2017), all agencies were required to develop and provide to DHS a plan for removing and discontinuing present and future use of all Kaspersky-branded products beginning 90 days after the issuance of the BOD; and (3) within 90 days (December 12, 2017), unless otherwise directed, all agencies were required to begin implementing their plan and provide DHS a status report on that implementation every 30 days thereafter until full removal and discontinuance of Kaspersky-branded products was achieved. AR0634-35. \"Kaspersky-branded\n   products\" were defined as \"information security products, solutions, and services supplied, directly or indirectly, by AO Kaspersky Lab or any of its predecessors, successors, parents, subsidiaries, or affiliates.\" AR0634. BOD 17-01 exempted from its scope \"national security systems\" and certain other systems operated by the Department of Defense and the intelligence community. AR0633.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The BOD itself stated that \"DHS, in consultation with interagency partners, ha[d] determined that the risks presented by Kaspersky-branded products justif[ied] the issuance of\" the BOD, AR0633, and a \"Decision Memorandum\" accompanying the BOD explained the reasoning underlying that determination. The Acting Secretary stated that she had issued the BOD because, based on the evidence presented to her by the Assistant Secretary for Cyber Security and Communications, she had concluded that Kaspersky-branded products on federal information systems presented a known or reasonably suspected information security threat, vulnerability, and risk to federal information and information systems. AR0628-29. That conclusion was based primarily on the following factors: (1) Kaspersky-branded products were currently being used by federal agencies, and Kaspersky Lab intended to expand its sale of those products to federal agencies in the near future; (2) anti-virus products like Kaspersky Lab's enjoy broad access to files and elevated privileges on the systems on which they are used that can be exploited by malicious cyber-actors; (3) data of those using Kaspersky Lab products is transferred automatically from their computers to Kaspersky Lab servers (which are either located in Russia or accessible from Russia); (4) Russia has engaged in, and will likely continue to engage in, malicious cyber-activities against United States government information systems; (5) Kaspersky Lab and Kaspersky Lab officials have ties to the Russian government, and specifically to its intelligence services; and (6) Russian legal provisions allow Russian intelligence services to request or compel assistance from companies like Kaspersky Lab and to intercept communications transiting Russian networks. AR0629-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The BOD was not based on a determination that Kaspersky Lab was disloyal or guilty of any wrongdoing. Acting Secretary Duke explained that the \"crux\" of the threat addressed by the BOD was \"the ability of the Russian government, whether acting on its own or through Kaspersky, to capitalize on access to federal information and information systems provided by Kaspersky-branded products.\" AR0629. \"These risks,\" she noted, \"exist regardless of whether Kaspersky-branded products already have been used by Kaspersky or the Russian Government for malicious purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Her determination was supported by the unclassified information presented to her, although she noted that she had reviewed classified information as well that provided further support for her action. AR0631.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   BOD 17-01 was supported by a considerable administrative record. Most relevant for the purposes of this Opinion is a September 1, 2017, memorandum prepared for Acting Secretary Duke by the Assistant Secretary for Cyber Security and Communications, Jeanette Manfra, which outlined much of the publically available information underlying concerns about Kaspersky Lab products. AR0003-23. The memo stated that \"DHS cybersecurity experts in the National Protection and Programs Directorate, in consultation with interagency partners, agree that Kaspersky-branded products present known or reasonably suspected information security risks to federal information and information systems.\" AR0004. More specifically, the memo stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   BOD 17-01 is based on expert judgment about threats to U.S. national security. The danger stems in part from the inherent properties of anti-virus software, which operates with broad file access and elevated privileges. Such access and privileges can be exploited by a malicious cyber actor such as Russia, which has demonstrated the intent to target the U.S. government and the capability to exploit vulnerabilities in federal information systems. Kaspersky or the Russian government could use this software to engage in a wide range of malicious cyber activities against federal information and information systems, including exfiltrating files, modifying data, or installing malicious code, with potentially grave consequences for U.S. national security. These actions could take place because of a range of factors, including Russian laws that authorize the Russian Federal Security Service (\"FSB\") to compel Russian enterprises to assist the FSB in the execution of FSB duties, to second FSB agents to Russian enterprises (with the enterprise's consent), and to require Russian companies to include hardware or software needed by the FSB to engage in \"operational/technical measures.\" Kaspersky also relies on the FSB for needed business licenses and certificates, and the FSB could condition the granting of such approvals on Kaspersky's cooperation. Finally, Russian law allows the FSB to intercept all communications transiting Russian telecommunications and Internet Service Provider networks, which presumably includes data transmissions between Kaspersky and its U.S. government customers. Because of these known or reasonably suspected risks to federal information and information systems, which directly implicate U.S. national security, this memorandum recommends that you exercise your authority to issue BOD 17-01.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166718\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/363/603/#p614\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Assistant Secretary's memo goes on to explain these concerns in far more detail than the Court will recount in this Opinion. However, certain of her findings warrant emphasis. First, according to a report prepared by the National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center (\"NCCIC\"), anti-virus products generally, and Kaspersky Lab products specifically, present unique security risks. AR0007. Because these products are intended to\n   <em>\n    defend\n   </em>\n   against cyber-threats, they require the highest level of privileges and access on the systems on which they are installed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Those privileges may allow them to extract files and send them to company servers and may permit the interception of otherwise-encrypted communications.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, because these products are themselves supposed to defend the systems on which they are installed from malicious activities, they can be modified to intentionally\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   identify malicious files.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   They can also be used to install malicious code under the guise of a security update, extract a file of interest under the pretext that it needs to be inspected for malware, or simply decline to install security updates that are needed. AR0008. In other words, if compromised, cybersecurity products like Kaspersky Lab's could end up being the proverbial fox guarding the hen house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Also warranting brief mention here is the memorandum's analysis of Kaspersky Lab's ties to the Russian government and intelligence agencies (including Eugene Kaspersky's personal ties). These include, among other things, reports that Kaspersky Lab has certificates and licenses from the Federal Security Service (\"FSB\"), a Russian intelligence service, that suggest a close relationship between Kaspersky Lab and that organization, as well as reports that Eugene Kaspersky, who graduated from an institute that was sponsored by the KGB and previously worked for the\n   Russian Ministry of Defense, maintains close personal ties with Russian intelligence officers. AR0011-13. Other Kaspersky Lab leaders have similar pedigrees.

AR0631. She concluded that debarment would not be effective because \"debarment would affect only future contracts for a finite period; it would not require federal agencies to remove products previously purchased and installed on federal networks, and thus would not address current information security risks to federal information systems.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Debarment also would allow third parties to continue selling Kaspersky Lab products to the federal government, and would allow agencies to continue contracts in existence at the time the contractor was debarred.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For those reasons, the Acting Secretary determined that debarment would not remove the threat DHS (and others) had identified because it would not completely remove Kaspersky Lab products from federal information systems.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The BOD established an administrative process for the submission and consideration of comments on the removal of Kaspersky-branded products before that removal took place 90 days thereafter.

On the same day that BOD 17-01 was issued, Acting Secretary Duke also sent Eugene Kaspersky a letter informing him of the BOD and providing him \"an opportunity to provide [DHS] with any information that [he thought was] relevant to [her] ongoing deliberations concerning [Kaspersky Lab's] products and services.\" AR0637-38. The letter informed Mr. Kaspersky that he could initiate a review by DHS by providing the Department with a written response to the BOD and supporting evidence.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   DHS also published a notice in the Federal Register that explained the actions required by BOD 17-01, and gave any entity whose commercial interests were directly impacted by the BOD an opportunity to respond, provide additional information, and initiate a review by DHS.

In October 2017, the House Science Committee held investigative hearings on the federal government's use of Kaspersky Lab products, and the implementation of BOD 17-01.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., Bolstering the Government's Cybersecurity: Assessing the Risks of Kaspersky Lab Products to the Federal Government Before the H.

The submission argued, among other things, that Kaspersky Lab had no improper relationship with the Russian government; that there was no evidence that Kaspersky Lab had engaged in any wrongdoing or posed any more risk than similarly situated companies; that the BOD was based on uncorroborated and anonymous sources; that the administrative procedure surrounding the issuance of the BOD and for responding to the BOD was insufficient; and that the BOD violated Kaspersky Lab's equal protection and due process rights.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   No other entity submitted a response to the BOD.

She stated that the Department had \"closely reviewed the Kaspersky Submission,\" \"met with Kaspersky and its counsel,\" \"identified additional statements made by Kaspersky from public sources, obtained information from agencies pursuant to the BOD 17-01 reporting requirements, and received a report on relevant provisions of Russian law prepared by Professor Peter Maggs of the University of Illinois College of Law, as well as a supplemental Assessment from the [NCCIC].\" AR0935. Secretary Duke stated that \"the information obtained by DHS since issuance of the BOD [did] not meaningfully impact, and indeed further support[ed], the information security and national security determination that [she] made in issuing the BOD.\" AR0934. Accordingly-relying on the reasons explained in the preceding DHS memoranda-the Acting Secretary stated that her determination that Kaspersky-branded products presented a known or reasonably suspected information security threat, vulnerability, or risk to federal information and information systems remained unchanged,\n   and that she maintained BOD 17-01 without modification. AR0935. Acting Secretary Duke sent a letter to Mr. Kaspersky notifying him of her decision the day it was issued. AR0938.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The reasoning underlying the Final Decision was explained further in a memorandum from Assistant Secretary Manfra. AR0752-76. That memorandum indicated that fourteen federal government agencies had reported identifying Kaspersky-branded products on their information systems. AR0756. Some of those agencies had, on their own initiative, already removed those products prior to the 90-day deadline under BOD 17-01.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   This was done of the agencies' own accord, pursuant to their own agency risk management responsibilities under FISMA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   DHS did not advise those agencies to remove the products before the BOD's 90-day deadline.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   All other agencies had submitted plans to remove Kaspersky Lab products, but had not yet implemented them.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   This memorandum also discussed the report on Russian law prepared by Professor Peter Maggs. AR0756;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AR0777-821 (Report of Peter B. Maggs). Professor Maggs had prepared a report that, the memorandum indicated, supported DHS's view of Russian law and provided additional support for DHS's Russian law-related concerns (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that under Russian law, the FSB could use companies like Kaspersky Lab with or without their consent).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The memorandum also contained approximately 18 pages of detailed responses to the arguments in Kaspersky Lab's response to BOD 17-01, explaining why those arguments were not persuasive to DHS. AR0757-75. In conclusion, the Assistant Secretary stated that, \"the totality of the administrative record,\" including Kaspersky Lab's submission, \"presents a compelling picture of the various ways that the Russian Government, and particularly the FSB intelligence agency, can compel, request, and otherwise exploit the access provided by Kaspersky-branded products to the information and information systems of Kaspersky customers, including U.S. government customers.\" AR0775.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    I. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Almost immediately after the BOD was finalized, it was effectively superseded by an act of Congress. On the heels of DHS's proceedings, Congress passed, and President Donald J. Trump signed into law, the NDAA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   PL 115-91, 2017 HR 2810, PL 115-91, December 12, 2017, 131 Stat 1283. In very summary terms, the NDAA is a law that authorizes appropriations and sets policies for Department of Defense programs and activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The relevant portion of the NDAA for the purposes of this Opinion is Section 1634. Section 1634 falls within Subtitle C of the Act, entitled \"Cyberspace-Related Matters.\" Section 1634(c) requires the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with other agencies, to conduct a review of procedures for removing suspect products and services from federal information technology networks and to submit a report to Congress on the same. Section 1634(a) focuses on Kaspersky Lab products. It states that \"[n]o department, agency, organization, or other element of the Federal Government may use, whether directly or through work with or on behalf of another department, agency, organization, or element of the Federal Government, any hardware, software, or services developed or provided, in whole or in part, by-(1) Kaspersky Lab (or any successor entity); (2) any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with Kaspersky Lab; or (3) any entity of which Kaspersky Lab has majority ownership.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1634(a). Section 1634(b) sets October\n   1, 2018, as the effective date for the prohibition.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1634(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This prohibition is broader in scope than BOD 17-01 in two ways. First, it applies to all Kaspersky Lab products (hardware, software, and services), whereas the BOD only applied to a smaller subset of \"Kaspersky-branded products.\" Second, unlike BOD 17-01, the NDAA does not have any carve outs or exceptions for national security systems or other systems used by the Department of Defense or the intelligence community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As initially introduced, the NDAA did not contain a provision regarding Kaspersky Lab products. An amendment to the Act adding a prohibition on the use of Kaspersky Lab products was first introduced by Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire. A Senate Armed Services Committee executive summary described the amendment as a response to \"reports that the Moscow-based company might be vulnerable to Russian government influence.\" NDAA FY 2018, U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee, at 10, https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/FY18%20NDAA%20Summary6.pdf. Senator Shaheen's proposed prohibition appears to have attracted bipartisan support in Congress and grown broader before it was eventually passed into law as Section 1634.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiffs' lawsuits cite certain statements Senator Shaheen made to the public regarding the proposed prohibition and Kaspersky Lab generally around the time that the amendment was introduced and adopted. On September 4, 2017, the\n   <em>\n    New York Times\n   </em>\n   published an editorial authored by Senator Shaheen, in which she asserted that the use of Kaspersky Lab products by federal agencies created a \"threat\" of Russian cyber-interference, and that she was proposing an amendment to bar federal government use of those products \"to close this alarming national security vulnerability.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex. C, NDAA ECF No. 1-3. In addition, in a September 18, 2017, press release, issued after an amendment to the NDAA barring the use of Kaspersky Lab products passed in the Senate, Senator Shaheen stated that \"[t]he case against Kaspersky Lab is overwhelming.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., Ex. E, NDAA ECF No. 1-5. She continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   The strong ties between Kaspersky Lab and the Kremlin are alarming and well-documented. I'm very pleased that the Senate has acted in a bipartisan way on my amendment that removes a real vulnerability to our national security. I applaud the Trump administration for heeding my call to remove Kaspersky Lab software from all federal computers. It's important that this prohibition also be a part of statute and be expanded to the entire federal government, as my amendment would do. Considering the strong bipartisan, bicameral support for this proposal, I'm optimistic this will soon be signed into law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    J. Plaintiffs' Lawsuits and Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Plaintiffs Kaspersky Lab Inc. and Kaspersky Labs Limited have filed two related but separate lawsuits. One, the BOD Lawsuit, was filed on December 18, 2017, shortly after the BOD was finalized and the NDAA was signed into law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., BOD ECF No. 1.

Even assuming that the Bill of Attainder Clause applies to corporations in the abstract,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the fact that the legislation at issue here targets the products of a multinational corporation, instead of an individual, certainly distinguishes it from the \"historic work and employment bans.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BellSouth II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11805085,3666014\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/162/678/\">\n    162 F.3d at 684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]t is obvious that there are differences between a corporation and an individual under the law,\" and \"[t]hus, any analogy between prior cases that have involved individuals and this case, which involves a corporation, must necessarily take into account this difference.\");\n   <em>\n    ACORN v.

The effect on Kaspersky Lab of losing the United States federal government as a customer does not begin to compare to the effect of historically recognized \"employment bans\" on the targeted individuals. Those historically recognized bans have completely prevented individuals from being employed in certain positions or pursuing certain types of vocations. Kaspersky Lab is not prevented from operating as a cybersecurity business.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is prevented from seeking discretionary contracts from the United States federal government.

The NDAA lacks these characteristics. As Plaintiffs repeatedly emphasize, the law appears to have nothing to do with any finding that Kaspersky Lab has done anything wrong or disloyal. Instead, it is premised on the determination that the use of that company's products to defend federal government networks and computer systems presents a national security vulnerability because they could be used (whether with or without Kaspersky Lab's knowledge or consent) by the Russian government.

The importance of this goal in today's world can hardly be overstated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   On the other side of the scale is the burden to Kaspersky Lab which, while real, is exaggerated by Plaintiffs. The NDAA deprives Kaspersky Lab of one of its revenue streams. But, as discussed above, that revenue stream represents a tiny portion of the company's overall business. And, although the prohibition also may have a negative effect on Kaspersky Lab's reputation in the cybersecurity field, that reputational harm is not as great as Plaintiffs suggest. Plaintiffs compare this case to\n   <em>\n    Foretich\n   </em>\n   , but the comparison is a stretch. The reputational burden the D.C.

Through the NDAA, Congress has effectively declared that the use of Kaspersky Lab products by federal government agencies presents a security risk because those products could be used-whether with or without Kaspersky Lab's knowledge or consent-by the Russian government. This understandably will affect Kaspersky Lab's reputation as a cybersecurity business, but it does not, as Plaintiffs repeatedly argue, label them as disloyal or adjudge them guilty of any \"horrific crime.\" In sum, even considering the reduction in revenue and harm to reputation Plaintiffs allegedly suffered, this is not a case where \"[a] grave imbalance or disproportion between the burden and the purported nonpunitive purpose suggests punitiveness.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9054164,3720413\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/351/1198/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9054164,3720413\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/351/1198/\">\n    at 1222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, Plaintiffs argue that the punitive nature of the NDAA is demonstrated by the fact that it singles out Kaspersky Lab and no other cybersecurity vendors. Indeed, Plaintiffs at times go so far as to imply that the law is\n   <em>\n    inherently\n   </em>\n   a bill of attainder because it is not one of general applicability.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pls.'

Grappling with a real-time need to take action to protect the government's networks and computer systems from cyber-attacks, Congress opted to pass a law of general applicability that ordered the review of procedures for removing suspect products and services from federal systems going forward (Section 1634(c) ), and also immediately took action to stem a perceived risk caused by the government's use of one company's products in particular based on facts already known (Sections 1634(a) and (b) ). There was nothing improper about this course of action. The record indicates that no other cybersecurity vendor had the same set of characteristics that had caused concerns about Kaspersky Lab.

It was therefore reasonable for Congress to act only with respect to that company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that Sections 1634(a) and (b) of the NDAA do not have a legitimate nonpunitive function because Congress could have employed less burdensome alternatives and because the statute lacks \"safeguards\" for Kaspersky Lab's rights. Plaintiffs' considerable reliance on these points is misplaced. These are merely factors the Court may consider when determining whether a law had a nonpunitive purpose. They are not requirements. Neither the Supreme Court nor the D.C. Circuit has held that the Court may invalidate a law with a clear nonpunitive purpose that is rationally designed to further that purpose simply because it lacks \"safeguards\" for a class that is burdened by the law. Nor have those courts held that it is necessary, or appropriate, for the Court to apply a \"least restrictive means\n   test\" to laws challenged as bills of attainder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Additionally, the principal \"less burdensome alternative\" proffered by Plaintiffs-\"refer[ing] the matter to the executive branch to consider\" proceedings to debar Kaspersky Lab under the FAR, Pls.' Opp'n at 29-would not have accomplished Congress' nonpunitive goal.

The Court will not repeat that entire history here, but notes that concerns were raised at various committee hearings, and six United States intelligence directors, including the directors of the CIA and the NSA, told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that they would not be comfortable using Kaspersky Lab products on their computers.

C, NDAA ECF No. 1-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   These statements do not indicate that Congress' motivation was to punish Kaspersky Lab. As an initial matter, the overall emphasis of Senator Shaheen's statements was not that Congress should punish Kaspersky Lab for anything, but instead that the use of Kaspersky Lab products to defend federal government systems created a risk of Russian cyber-interference, and that action needed to be taken swiftly to address this vulnerability. It was the \"case\" for such action, according to Senator Shaheen, that was \"overwhelming.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Additionally, even if these statements could be interpreted as indicating that Senator Shaheen was motivated to punish Kaspersky Lab-and the Court does not interpret them that way-isolated statements of one legislator are not sufficient under the Motivational Test to demonstrate a punitive motivation. \" 'Several isolated statements' are not sufficient to evince punitive intent.\"\n   <em>\n    BellSouth II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11805085,3666014\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/162/678/\">\n    162 F.3d at 690\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Selective Serv.

In other words, even if\n   <em>\n    Senator Shaheen's\n   </em>\n   intention in passing the NDAA's prohibition on Kaspersky Lab products was to punish that company, as opposed to merely limit the risk of future Russian cyber-attacks, that intention of a sole senator is not sufficient to demonstrate that Congress as a whole was motivated to punish.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Also relevant to the Court's Motivational Test inquiry is that the NDAA was passed on the heels of actions by the Executive Branch addressing similar concerns about Kaspersky Lab products. Most importantly, Congress was considering the NDAA's prohibition on Kaspersky Lab products at the same time that DHS was in the midst of its BOD 17-01 proceedings. Congress even held hearings about those proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   By statute, BODs are used \"for purposes of safeguarding Federal information and information systems from a known or reasonably suspected information security threat, vulnerability, or risk\"-not to impose punishment based on any wrongdoing.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203552\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). The purpose of BOD 17-01 in particular was to stem the risk of Russian cyber-attacks, and DHS made clear that the action was not based on any assumption that Kaspersky Lab had done, or would do, anything wrong or worthy of punishment. AR0629. It is reasonable to assume that Congress had a similar motivation when, after overseeing the implementation of BOD 17-01, it passed a prohibition very similar to that BOD just days after it was finalized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Additionally, \"specific aspects of the text or structure\" of Section 1634, such as the provision's placement within the NDAA, indicate Congress' nonpunitive motivation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foretich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9054164,3720413\" index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/351/1198/\">\n    351 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1225 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BellSouth I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3714171,1306836\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/144/58/\">\n    144 F.3d at 66\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that a claim of punitive purpose can be undermined by a provision's placement within an Act). Section 1634 falls under a subtitle of the NDAA entitled \"Cyberspace-Related Matters.\" This section of the NDAA does not dole out punishments. It provides authorizations, sets policies, and requires reporting on various cyber-security issues. Section 1634(c), which follows immediately after the challenged sections, is one example: it requires agencies to conduct reviews of their procedures for removing suspect products or services from the information technology networks of the federal government. That the prohibition on Kaspersky Lab products falls within this section of the NDAA indicates that Congress viewed it as a similar cyber-security measure, not punishment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The text and effect of the statutory sections themselves also indicate Congress' nonpunitive motivation. The statute does not prohibit\n   <em>\n    purchases\n   </em>\n   from Kaspersky Lab, but instead the\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   of Kaspersky Lab products. This required the government to undergo a time-intensive and costly process of identifying and discontinuing the \"use\" of Kaspersky Lab products throughout the government. If Congress' purpose was simply to punish Kaspersky Lab for something, it could have accomplished that goal in a far easier and cheaper manner by simply barring any future purchases from that company. The fact that it declined that option and instead ordered that all \"use\" of Kaspersky Lab products be halted, and incurred the considerable cost to do so,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   suggests that the function of the law was to protect against prospective Russian cyber-threats, not to punish Kaspersky Lab.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   In sum, it was Plaintiffs' burden to plausibly allege facts that would suggest that Sections 1634(a) and (b) were punishment under the Motivational Test. Their inability to do so defeats their claim. In addition, the record-including congressional activity, administrative activity, and the nature of the statute itself-affirmatively indicates a\n   <em>\n    nonpunitive\n   </em>\n   motivation. Accordingly, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs cannot plausibly establish that the challenged provisions constitute legislative punishment under the Motivational Test.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Weighing all three tests for punishment together, the Court concludes that Sections 1634(a) and (b) of the NDAA clearly do not inflict punishment on Plaintiffs. The law does not impose any form of historically recognized legislative punishment. It\n   has an obvious and eminently reasonable nonpunitive purpose and, although the law has negative effects on Plaintiffs, those effects are not out of balance with the goal of protecting the Nation's cyber-security. Finally, there is no evidence that Congress acted with any motivation to punish Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The Court emphasizes that \"[i]n order to decide whether a statute impermissibly inflicts punishment, [the Court] consider[s] each case in 'its own highly particularized context.' \"\n   <em>\n    Patchak\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173146,4337061,12409791\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/828/995/\">\n    828 F.3d at 1006\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Selective Serv.

The NDAA requires that all federal agencies stop using all Kaspersky Lab products and services. In fact, the prohibition in the NDAA is broader than the prohibition in BOD 17-01, because it includes\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   Kaspersky Lab products and services (not just \"Kaspersky-branded\" products), and because it does not exempt any national security systems. The fact that the NDAA's prohibition does not technically become effective until October 1, 2018, does not change this analysis. There is no redressability unless a decision in Plaintiffs' favor would \"produce tangible, meaningful results in the real world.\"\n   <em>\n    Common Cause v.

Cir. 1983). No meaningful results would be produced\n   by lifting BOD 17-01's prohibition on Kaspersky Lab products for the few months before the NDAA's prohibition goes into effect. Under the NDAA, federal agencies must have identified and halted the use of all Kaspersky Lab products by October 1, 2018. This is not contingent on the outcome of any review process. It is a date certain by which all use must stop. Under these circumstances, it is highly implausible that, upon learning that BOD 17-01 was rescinded, any federal government agency would purchase a Kaspersky Lab product, obtain the necessary approval to use that product, install it, and begin using it, only to have to remove it again by October 1, 2018. To do so would not only defy common sense, it would also likely violate each federal agency's obligations under FISMA to reduce the risks to their information systems in a cost-effective manner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Defendants have provided the Court with a declaration from the Acting Federal Chief Information Security Officer at the OMB, Grant Schneider, attesting to these points. Mr. Schneider's job is to oversee the development of government-wide cybersecurity policy and Federal civilian agency implementation of cybersecurity laws and policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Grant Schneider, BOD ECF No. 13-1, \u00b6 1. In his declaration, he states that \"federal agencies are widely aware of the NDAA prohibition\" and that \"even if BOD 17-01 were rescinded before October 1, 2018, no federal agency would be likely to procure, test and install Kaspersky products, and then remove them, all before the October 1st NDAA effective date.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. He explains that \"each federal agency makes its own independent IT acquisition decisions as long as the agency complies with applicable law and executive branch policy,\" and the personnel involved in those decisions \"are acutely aware of the need to avoid use of IT products that increase risks to their information and information systems.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6. In particular, agencies are aware of their obligations under FISMA to reduce risks to their information systems in a cost-effective manner, and are separately required under Executive Order and OMB policy to implement information security and cybersecurity risk management plans and measures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   \"Rescinding the BOD would not eliminate the security concerns underlying the decision to issue the directive in the first place,\" Mr. Schneider attests, which had been raised by other lawmakers and intelligence officials, and which are also memorialized by the NDAA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. Even if the BOD were rescinded, these agencies would still have to confront these concerns. They would have to determine that using Kaspersky Lab software in the months before the NDAA officially takes effect is an acceptable risk to their networks, and that purchasing those products, acquiring the necessary authorizations to use them and taking the time and resources to test, install, and deploy them-only to then immediately remove them prior to October 1, 2018-would be cost-effective and not wasteful.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-10. Mr. Schneider finds it \"highly unlikely\" that any agency's Chief Information Officer would make these determinations and choose to use Kaspersky Lab products between now and October 1, 2018, if the BOD was rescinded.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. In fact, according to Mr. Schneider, purchasing these products could open an agency up to investigation for wasteful procurement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8, 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Plaintiffs do not seriously attempt to dispute these points. Instead, Plaintiffs respond to Defendants' standing argument by attempting to recast their alleged injury as being deprived of the \"\n   <em>\n    right\n   </em>\n   to sell to the government\" until October 1, 2018. Pls.' Reply and Opp'n at 5 (emphasis in original). Regardless of whether any United States government agency would purchase\n   their products, Plaintiffs argue, they stand to win back this \"right to sell.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   This asserted \"right\" is worthless. To \"sell\" requires another to \"buy.\" Because no government agency would buy Plaintiffs' product in the period before October 1, 2018, Plaintiffs' theoretical \"right\" to sell has no value at all in the real world. The asserted deprivation of this empty procedural right would not affect any substantive or concrete interest of the Plaintiffs, and therefore is not sufficient to confer standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Summers v.

Even assuming that Plaintiffs can demonstrate that BOD 17-01 caused the reputational harms they allege, there are \"circumstances in which governmental action is a substantial contributing factor in bringing about a specific harm, but the undoing of the governmental action will not undo the harm, because the new status quo is held in place by other forces.\"\n   <em>\n    Renal Physicians Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3487081,3563411\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/489/1267/\">\n    489 F.3d at 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is the case here. The NDAA would preserve the new\n   <em>\n    status quo\n   </em>\n   with respect to Plaintiffs' reputation even if BOD 17-01 was rescinded.

Reply and Opp'n at 10. Plaintiffs cannot make this showing. As has been discussed already at length, BOD 17-01 and Sections 1634(a) and (b) of the NDAA are roughly equivalent prohibitions on Kaspersky Lab products, based on approximately the same concerns about the company. For this reason, Plaintiffs allege that the NDAA, like BOD 17-01, causes them \"profound reputational injuries.\" Compl., NDAA ECF No. 1, \u00b6 45. If anything, the effect of the NDAA on Plaintiffs' reputation would be greater than the effect of the BOD, because the NDAA codifies the prohibition against Plaintiffs' products into law and is broader than BOD 17-01 (covering all Kaspersky Lab products and services and all federal information systems).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Whatever harm was caused by the BOD labelling Plaintiffs' products as risks would not be redressed if the BOD was rescinded, because the NDAA would remain in place, continuing to label Plaintiffs' products in exactly the same way. And to the extent there is some distinct incremental harm that the existence of the BOD could be said to have on Plaintiffs' reputation above and beyond the existence of the NDAA, and therefore could be at stake in this lawsuit, that theoretical harm is simply \"too vague and unsubstantiated\" to support standing.\n   <em>\n    McBryde v.

Cir. 2017) (finding no causation or redressability in case where petitioner challenged statutes labelling him a terrorist because, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Foretich\n   </em>\n   , petitioner presented no evidence that his reputational injury \"derive[d] directly\" from the challenged statutes, given that \"petitioner [would] remain designated as an enemy combatant and will continue to be detained as such even if the Court rules in his favor\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   In short, it is simply not plausible, let alone likely, that a favorable decision in the BOD Lawsuit ordering the rescission of that agency action on APA and procedural grounds would have any meaningful effect on Plaintiffs' reputation, where the same determinations about Kaspersky Lab products expressed by the BOD are codified in the NDAA and have also been expressed by numerous other government actors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The Court also notes that, for many of the same reasons discussed above with respect to the redressability element, Plaintiffs also cannot demonstrate the causation requirement of standing with respect to their alleged reputational harm. \"Courts are powerless to confer standing when the causal link is too tenuous.\"\n   <em>\n    Winpisinger v.

Cir. 1980). As discussed above, BOD 17-01 is but one of a number of congressional and Executive Branch actions that would presumably have the same type of alleged effects on Kaspersky Lab's reputation. Prior to the issuance of BOD 17-01, various congressional committees were investigating the company, six intelligence\n   directors had told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that they would not be comfortable using Kaspersky Lab products on their computers, and the GSA had removed the company as a vendor. All of these acts presumably had negative impacts on Plaintiffs' reputation. Plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that the BOD, and not these other acts, caused their reputational injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   For the reasons set out above, the Court will dismiss both Plaintiffs' NDAA Lawsuit and their BOD Lawsuit. The NDAA Lawsuit is dismissed for failure to state a claim, because Plaintiffs have not plausibly alleged that Sections 1634(a) and (b) of the NDAA constitute a bill of attainder. The BOD Lawsuit is dismissed for lack of standing because, even if Plaintiffs were to succeed in that lawsuit and the Court were to order the rescission of BOD 17-01, none of Plaintiffs' alleged harms would be redressed. They would continue in full force as a result of the NDAA. Because the BOD Lawsuit is dismissed for lack of standing, the Court need not reach the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. Appropriate Orders accompany this Memorandum Opinion in each lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-150\">\n    The Court's consideration has focused on the following documents and their attachments in the NDAA Lawsuit:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n    \u2022 Def.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 10-1 (\"Def.'s Mem.\");\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n    \u2022 Pls.'

There are certainly instances where such motions are necessary and appropriate to prevent an impending injury, but increasingly these \"emergency\" motions are being filed simply because the plaintiff is aggrieved by an agency decision and wants the Court to focus its attention on its claims immediately, at the expense of the claims of other litigants.
