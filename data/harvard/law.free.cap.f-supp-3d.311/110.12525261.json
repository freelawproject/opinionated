KELLY, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") runs a government program known as Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (\"CFATS\"). The purpose of CFATS is to identify chemical facilities that might be targeted by terrorists, and to promulgate and enforce standards for reducing the risks arising from potential terrorist attacks on those facilities. DHS requires facilities to submit information about certain chemicals they possess and, based on those submissions and other information (including information received from the broader intelligence community), determines which facilities pose a \"high risk\" of significant terrorism-related harm. Those high-risk facilities are required to implement various security measures. Alternatively, facilities may reduce their chemical holdings to levels that do not qualify them as high risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Greenpeace, Inc. (\"Greenpeace\") made a request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that DHS provide information regarding previously high-risk facilities that have reduced their chemical holdings. After a lengthy administrative process, DHS produced two heavily-redacted lists of facility names, withholding those names that might serve to identify a particular facility. DHS argues that the redacted information falls under FOIA's law-enforcement exemption, because releasing it would threaten public safety by increasing the risks to human life and health from terrorist attacks. Greenpeace disagrees, claiming that FOIA and DHS's own procedures require DHS to produce the records without redactions. Greenpeace has therefore brought suit against DHS and one of its components, the National Protection and Programs Directorate (\"NPPD,\" and together with DHS, \"Defendants\"). Greenpeace asserts claims under FOIA and the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20551\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and petitions the Court for a writ of mandamus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendants have filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment.

Greenpeace suggests that facilities that no longer have chemicals of interest at or above STQs are no more dangerous than \"thousands of other facilities that are unregulated by CFATS\" throughout the country. Orum Decl. \u00b6 14. It provides examples such as underground storage tanks (which are regulated by the EPA and also listed on many state government websites) and facilities like dairy farms, which can be easily located online. Hind Decl. \u00b6 17. Greenpeace further claims that\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   releasing the information would cause a safety risk: it would inhibit \"developing and publicizing knowledge of successful practices at facilities\" that have reduced their risk, and thereby \"perpetuate unnecessary terrorist targets of opportunity.\" Orum Decl. \u00b6 7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Poje Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Greenpeace also asserts that much of the redacted information is already available to the public, such that there is no justification for withholding it. Many chemical facilities are \"also regulated by other government agencies,\" which have made available lists of those facilities and the chemicals they store. Orum Decl. \u00b6 15. Greenpeace notes the EPA's Toxic Release Inventory (\"TRI\") program, which Congress created to \"provide the public with information about releases of toxic chemicals in their community.\" Poje Decl. \u00b6 10. Pursuant to the TRI program, facilities must make annual disclosures of certain chemicals they release or otherwise dispose\n   of.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Greenpeace also points to the EPA's Risk Management Plan (\"RMP\"), which requires facilities to report holdings of certain substances over threshold amounts.

First, it points out that CFATS overlaps only incompletely with these other sources of public information, meaning that revealing the redacted names will provide terrorists with a new source of potential targets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Falcon Reply Decl. \u00b6 10. Next, and perhaps more importantly, DHS asserts that the availability of public information about chemical facilities makes the redacted information more dangerous, not less dangerous. A terrorist could cross-check the already-public lists against the lists of facilities that are not \"high risk,\" using the former to identify facilities holding chemicals they want to exploit, and the latter to determine which of those facilities are soft targets.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Greenpeace also asserts that DHS has failed to satisfy FOIA's segregability requirement. Greenpeace claims that, to the extent some facilities have \"completely and permanently remov[ed] chemicals of interest from their operations,\" there is no threat to releasing those facilities' names. Orum Decl. \u00b6 8. Moreover, Greenpeace claims, DHS should be able to identify those facilities. By statute, DHS is required to \"document the basis\" for determining that a facility will no longer be subject to CFATS requirements.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20622\">\n    6 U.S.C. \u00a7 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(3)(A) ). Nonetheless, DHS has redacted those facilities' names.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   DHS responds that it cannot identify those facilities that have \"completely and permanently\" removed all chemicals of interest. First, the statutory provision Greenpeace relies on did not go into effect until 2015, just after DHS had made its December 2014 production of the documents at issue. Falcon Reply Decl. \u00b6 12. Before 2015, the CFATS program did not maintain information about why facilities were \"de-tiered\" in a \"searchable format.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20622\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In any event, DHS explains, it does not ask facilities whether they have \"completely and permanently\" removed chemicals of interest. Facilities are often de-tiered because they have reduced one particular chemical of interest below its STQ; therefore, the recorded \"reasons\" for de-tiering those facilities do not include whether\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of their chemicals of interest have been removed.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20622\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20622\">\n    \u00b6 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Greenpeace's theories about the effect of the agency process aside, this is a run-of-the-mill FOIA case involving a request that DHS turn over specific information it has withheld. Plainly, FOIA offers an \"adequate remedy\": it provides the exact relief that Greenpeace has requested-an order to turn over the requested information-if Greenpeace can show it is actually entitled to that relief. Greenpeace's argument is, in essence, that a FOIA claim is not an adequate remedy in this case because Greenpeace might fare worse under\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review than under the APA standard of review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. at 32.

It is also based on information received from the broader intelligence community about the threat to those facilities. Pl.'s Resp. SoMF \u00b6 3; Fuentes Decl. \u00b6 31. Accordingly, disclosing which facilities are considered \"high risk,\" and which are not, has the potential to reveal the government's thinking about which facilities are\n   <em>\n    likely\n   </em>\n   targets for terrorist attacks, and which are not. Revealing the names of \"de-tiered\" facilities would be dangerous in at least two respects. First, it would provide terrorists with valuable insight into how the United States government, including its intelligence services, assesses the risk of attacks on chemical facilities in this country. Making strategic insights about national security matters available to the general public (including our country's enemies) has the inherent potential to cause harm.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACLU v.

Cir. 2011) (discussing potential harm from providing terrorists with \"insight\" into \"the CIA's core mission of collecting and analyzing intelligence that reveals the plans, intentions and capabilities of the nation's enemies\"). Second, such revelations would effectively identify \"de-tiered\" facilities as \"soft targets\" for terrorists. DHS does not require \"de-tiered\" facilities to implement security measures under CFATS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Falcon Reply Decl. \u00b6 5. Releasing the lists would thus allow terrorists to adjust their aim to focus on the very facilities that the government has decided are unlikely to be targeted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Moreover, as Defendants point out, this single request cannot be viewed in isolation. If the lists of \"de-tiered\" facilities are not exempt, then nothing would stop FOIA requesters from seeking refreshed lists at different points in time. Defendants' affidavits confirm that facilities do, in fact, fluctuate into and out of \"high risk\" status as DHS's assessments change.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076968,3553786\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/628/612/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; Falcon Decl. \u00b6 7. And whenever facilities on an earlier version of the list disappear from a later version, that would mean those facilities are once again \"high risk,\" revealing the identity of the very facilities DHS is most determined to protect. Fuentes Decl. \u00b6 31. Greenpeace's response is that DHS could limit future releases to mitigate this risk. That is, DHS could \"redact or withhold the facilities that have previously been included and provide only the additions.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. at 24.

Nor can the Court conclude that Greenpeace has raised a genuine issue of material fact with its evidence (in the form of expert affidavits) that \"the more likely consequence of greater awareness of such reductions in inventories of dangerous chemicals is that, like other government programs involving hazardous chemicals where regulated facilities are publicly disclosed, disclosure creates an incentive for reductions, and more facilities will reduce their inventories of chemicals of interest, increasing safety.\" Pl.'s Br. at 23 (citing Poje Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 10-12; Orum Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 7, 12).
