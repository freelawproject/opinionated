To that end, in May 2014, they submitted a Citizen Petition to the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration requesting that three specific warnings be added to the standard informed-consent materials. When the FDA denied the Petition, Plaintiffs brought this one-count Administrative\n   Procedure Act suit against the current Commissioner, Scott Gottlieb. Defendant now moves to dismiss, contending that none of the Plaintiffs has standing, thus robbing the Court of subject-matter jurisdiction. For the reasons discussed below, the Court agrees and will grant the Motion, but permit Plaintiffs an opportunity to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Few understand the long and arduous road a new drug takes to finally come to market. After the drug is developed, researchers often test its safety on laboratory animals in preclinical trials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 91-92. If it can clear the preclinical stage, the drug sponsor submits an investigational new-drug application to the FDA, the agency responsible for regulating research on human subjects.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 88, 93. If approved, clinical research-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , testing conducted on humans rather than animals-begins. As part of its duty to protect human subjects, the FDA requires the drug sponsor to obtain \"legally effective informed consent\" for each participant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2050.20\">\n    21 C.F.R. \u00a7 50.20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The decision to allow testing of this drug on humans relies heavily on the presumption that animal tests predict human response. Due to differences between animals and humans, animal tests may not predict whether a drug is safe and/or effective for use in humans.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (10) Some participants in clinical trials in which other investigative drugs were tested have died or have been seriously injured by the drug that was tested.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (11) The drug you will be given may later prove to be either unsafe for humans or ineffective in treating the condition for which it is being tested. You should not assume the drug will treat a medical condition you may have, because a determination of efficacy in an animal study does not necessarily predict efficacy in humans.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Compl., Exh A at 7. On April 12, 2017, the FDA denied the Petition, stating that the\n   additional elements pertain to drug trials only, while the informed-consent regulations apply to all clinical trials. The Petition's warnings, therefore, \"raise[d] broader concerns that make them inappropriate for inclusion in FDA's existing informed consent regulations.\" Compl., Exh.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Contrary to what laypersons might generally believe, not every aggrieved person gets to have her day in court. To properly invoke the jurisdiction of federal courts, a plaintiff must demonstrate that she has a \"case\" or \"controversy\" within the parameters of Article III, a doctrine known as standing. At a minimum, standing requires the plaintiff to establish (1) an injury that is (2) traceable to the defendant's conduct and (3) likely redressable by the court.\n   <em>\n    Lujan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    504 U.S. at 560-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11730070\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/555/#p561\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In a suit for injunctive relief, \"past harm is not sufficient to establish an injury in fact.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Whistleblower Ctr. v.

The plaintiff, rather, must show \"a real and immediate-as opposed to merely conjectural or hypothetical-threat of future injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Res. Def. Council v. Pena\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715675,1358839\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/147/1012/\">\n    147 F.3d 1012\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1022 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (citation omitted). Defendant here argues that neither the individual Plaintiffs nor CRS meets the constitutional\n   requirements for standing. The Court addresses each separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Individuals\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The individual Plaintiffs allege that, because of the FDA's refusal to add their proposed informed-consent statements, they are either unable to participate in clinical trials or, in the case of Vokhgelt, fear that his children will need to participate in a trial without informed consent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 24, 207. Setting aside whether these are actually injuries in the Article III context, the individuals face a bigger standing obstacle: any future injury cannot be\n   <em>\n    traceable\n   </em>\n   to the FDA's action here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As a preliminary matter, any\n   <em>\n    past\n   </em>\n   injury-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , ill effects from previous trial participation-cannot be attributable to the FDA's denial of their Citizen Petition, which only occurred in April 2017. As to\n   <em>\n    future\n   </em>\n   injuries, what they claim harms them is a lack of information. Yet, they already have such information. As Defendant notes, because they \"already possess the information they claim they need to make informed decisions[,] ... any harm they might face in the future would result from their informed decision to participate in clinical drug trials and not FDA's denial of their citizen petition.\" Mot. at 13. Notably, the language Plaintiffs want added to the regulation is generic and would not change with each clinical trial. That is, there is no difference between what they already know and what they would see in informed-consent materials if the FDA approved the Petition. As a result, it is difficult to imagine a scenario in which\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   individual would have standing here. The Court, consequently, finds that all of the individual Plaintiffs lack standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    CRS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs next argue that CRS itself has standing to sue. Organizations can sue either on their own behalf (\"organizational standing\") or on behalf of their members (\"representational standing\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scenic Am., Inc. v.

Because CRS does not have any members, it may invoke only the former. To prevail, it must show the same three standing elements as any individual-(1) injury, (2) causation, and (3) redressability. The injury must be \" 'concrete and demonstrable ... with [a] consequent drain on [its] resources,' rather than 'simply a setback to [its] abstract social interests.' \"\n   <em>\n    People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, Inc.

[,] placing a significant drain on its limited resources, causing a diversion of its resources, and the frustration of its mission.\" Compl., \u00b6 209. Such broad allegations cannot suffice to allege standing, particularly where advocacy spending and detriment to its mission standing alone have been held not to constitute sufficient injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Food &amp; Water Watch, Inc. v. Vilsack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310324,4366222\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/808/905/\">\n    808 F.3d 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 919-21 (D.C. Cir. 2015). The Court needs to know how resources are being drained and from and to where they are being diverted. CRS conclusorily states that \"in the absence of the amended regulation, it would cost [it] a substantial sum of money to educate and protect the welfare of potential clinical trial participants nationwide about the issues with animal testing,\" Compl., \u00b6 210, but the Court, without more specifics, is unable to discern whether those outlays would be \"normally expended\" to carry out the organization's advocacy mission and the ways in which resources would otherwise be spent if the regulation were amended.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Ass'n of Home Builders\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3769742,3716054\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/667/6/\">\n    667 F.3d at 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Court notes that this is not a strenuous burden at the motion-to-dismiss stage, but a necessary one nonetheless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scenic America\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5754398\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/983/170/#p176\">\n    983 F.Supp.2d at 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding organization had standing based on declarations detailing \"[c]oncrete examples of the activities that [the organization] undertakes to oppose\" the challenged conduct);\n   <em>\n    PETA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4207724\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/7/1/#p8\">\n    7 F.Supp.3d at 8-9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding organization had standing based on \"two specific, programmatic harms\" alleged). Two sentences of general assertions just does not cut it. Given that CRS may well be able to clear this hurdle, the Court will not dismiss the entire case. Instead, it will only dismiss the Complaint and give Plaintiffs thirty days to file an amended one if they so choose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ciralsky v.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Because none of the Plaintiffs can satisfy the constitutional requirements for Article III standing, the Court will grant Defendant's Motion to Dismiss, while permitting leave to amend. An Order to that effect will issue this same day.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
