BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The operative complaint, filed by Lead Plaintiff Stratesis, LLC, asserts two causes of action: (1) violation of Sections 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act (the \"Act\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b) and Rule 10b-5,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .10b-5 ; and (2) violation of Section 20(a) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a). (Dkt. No. 94.) This case is based on two alleged theories of securities fraud: (1) \"UTi told investors that UTi's 1 View rollout [a new freight forwarding system] was going well, while its invoicing delays were in fact putting the company in mortal danger\" (the \"slow invoice theory\"); and (2) \"UTi told investors the company's internal controls over financial reporting [through its Oracle system] were functioning effectively, while they were actually suffering from a material weakness\" (the \"accounting problems theory\"). (Dkt. No. 72.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) requires that a proposed class satisfy the following four requirements for class certification: (1) numerosity; (2) commonality; (3) typicality; and (4) adequacy of representation. Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a). In addition, the proposed class must satisfy one of the three options under Rule 23(b)(1), (2) or (3). Here, Plaintiff relies on Rule 23(b)(3), which allows the Court to certify the class if following elements are satisfied: (1) questions of law or fact common to class members predominate over questions affecting only individual class members (i.e., predominance); and (2) the class action is superior to other available methods of adjudicating the controversy (i.e., superiority). Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Rule 23(a)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff submits evidence demonstrating Rule 23(a)'s numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation requirements are satisfied. Defendants do not dispute these requirements are met. Accordingly, the Court finds Rule 23(a)'s numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation requirements are satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Superiority\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiff submits evidence demonstrating Rule 23(b)(3)'s superiority requirement is satisfied.

Plaintiff's expert Jones conducted an event study to test whether the price of UTI common stock responded rapidly to new information. (Jones Report \u00b6 61.) Jones tested the difference between the number of significant abnormal returns on \"news days\" (4/36 = 11.1%) versus those on \"no-news days\" (5/194 = 2.6%) (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 74-76), and determined at the 5% level that four of the 36 news days observed (i.e., 11.1%) had statistically significant abnormal returns, and these four returns on \"news days\" are much higher than the two statistically significant abnormal returns (.05 x 36 = 1.8) that would be expected in a random sampling without any news days (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76). Jones opined it was four times more likely that a statistically significant abnormal return was observed on days when information about UTi entered the market (i.e., on a \"news day\") than on \"no-news days.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75, Ex. 13.) Jones also found the difference between the percentage of statistically significant abnormal returns on \"news days\" as compared to \"no-news days\" was 8.5%, and concluded the daily price returns demonstrated a significant difference in the occurrence of abnormal returns on \"new days\" as compared to \"no-news days\" \"at greater than 99 percent confidence.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78, Ex. 14.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Jones therefore opined new information concerning UTi was associated with significant changes in UTi's common stock prices and indicates the market for UTi stock was efficient during the Class Period because there is solid statistical evidence that UTi's stock price responded rapidly to new information and did not display significant price changes, overall, in the absence of news. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants contend the event study performed by Jones is unreliable, biased, and flawed for four reasons discussed below. Defendants argue without Jones's event study, Plaintiff lacks adequate evidence that UTi's stock traded on an efficient market during the Class Period, and therefore individual questions of reliance will predominate which precludes class certification because Plaintiff cannot invoke the presumption of reliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   First, Defendants argue Jones's event study is unreliable because Jones limited her news search to the Bloomberg archive. Defendants rely on the fact Jones has used other news sources for other cases, and Jones's deposition testimony that she chose Bloomberg because she had access to it on her computer, and does not have access to other news sources without paying a fee (Jones Depo. 58:24-59:5). Defendants cite to no relevant authority which supports their contention the use of one news search archive such as Bloomberg renders an event study unreliable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, Jones states in her rebuttal report that Bloomberg is a \"respected source relied upon in the industry,\" which \"provided a robust sample of news articles\" in this case so that Jones did not need to supplement her Bloomberg search with articles from other archives she has used in the past. (Jones Rebuttal Report \u00b6 32.) Accordingly, Jones's event study is not unreliable based on her use of Bloomberg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Second, Defendants argue Jones's event study is unreliable and flawed because it showed UTi stock had a statistically significant excess return on only 11.1% of news days, which Defendants contend is insufficient to support a finding of market efficiency. This fact alone does not render Jones's event study unreliable and flawed. As the Supreme Court has recognized, \"[d]ebates about the precise\n   <em>\n    degree\n   </em>\n   to which stock prices accurately reflect public information are ... largely beside the point.\"\n   <em>\n    Halliburton Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581622\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2398/#p2407\">\n    134 S.Ct. at 2410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting the presumption of reliance is based \"on the fairly modest premise that market professionals generally consider most publicly announced material statements about companies, thereby affecting stock market prices,\" and \"public information generally affects stock prices\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    F\u00f6rsta AP-Fonden,\n   </em>\n   312 F.R.D. at 522 (\"[R]equiring Lead Plaintiff to offer an event study, before certification, showing that a stock's price responded to news at some specific rate would ignore the Supreme Court's recognition that \"[d]ebates about the precise\n   <em>\n    degree\n   </em>\n   to which stock prices accurately reflect public information\" are \"largely beside the point.\") (quoting\n   <em>\n    Halliburton Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12581622\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/2398/#p2407\">\n    134 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2410 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Third, Defendants argue Jones's event study is unreliable because it does not test the market's response to \"new, relevant\" information.
