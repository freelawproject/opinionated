If the Department finds that subject merchandise is being sold at less-than-fair value, and if the U.S. International Trade Commission finds that these less-than-fair value imports materially injure a domestic industry, the Department issues an antidumping duty order imposing antidumping duties equivalent to \"the amount by which the normal value exceeds the export price (or the constructed export price) for the merchandise.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201973\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Generally, export price is defined as the price at which the subject merchandise is first sold in the United States, whereas the normal value represents the price at which the subject merchandise is sold in the exporting country.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201973\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 1677a(a), 1677b(b)(i).

Because the issue of whether Uttam Galva met the Department's two-prong test for a duty drawback adjustment did not appear in the pleadings or in a separate Rule 56.2 motion for judgment on the agency record, it is not properly before the court. Nevertheless, the court recognizes that sufficient\n   evidence exists on the record to support Commerce's application of its two-prong test to Uttam Galva. Plaintiff provided the relevant rules and explanations for each program under which it claimed an adjustment, and also demonstrated that it imported a sufficient amount of raw materials to merit a refund or exemption of duties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final IDM at 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Prelim.

Commerce's Methodology of Calculating the Duty Drawback Adjustment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The primary issue in dispute is whether Commerce reasonably calculated the duty drawback adjustment for Uttam Galva. The Department made its calculation by reducing the duty drawback adjustment to Uttam Galva's U.S. sales and allocating the duty exemptions and rebates claimed over total cost of production.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br. 17. Uttam Galva argues that the Department's calculation is inconsistent with the statute and the agency's alleged practice of computing exempted and rebated duties over total exports to the U.S.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mem. 10-11. Because the statute permits a drawback on duties that are rebated or exempted \"by reason of\" the exportation of the subject merchandise to the United States, Uttam Galva contends that Commerce's calculation of the duty drawback adjustment is contrary to the statute's plain language in that the chosen methodology ignores the statute's textual linkage between the adjustment and the act of exporting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. For the following reasons, the court finds that Commerce's calculation of the amount of duty drawback adjustment was not in accordance with the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   When determining the amount of a duty drawback adjustment, the Department has accepted the figures historically reported by a respondent for rebated or exempted duties in a given year, and divided it by the number of subject exports.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prelim. IDM at 14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Final IDM at 7. Commerce argues in this case that its prior methodology did not account properly for situations where a respondent utilizes inputs from both foreign and domestic sources.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prelim. IDM at 14; Final IDM at 8-9. As a result, the calculations using the Department's normal methodology would not produce \"the desired import duty neutrality\" for \"an equitable comparison of EP or CEP and NV.\" Final IDM at 7. The Department attempted to rectify this perceived imbalance by utilizing the following methodology:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   The amount of the duty drawback adjustment should be determined based on the import duty absorbed into, or imbedded in, the overall cost of producing the merchandise under consideration. That is, we assume for dumping purposes, that imported raw material and the domestically sourced raw material are proportionally consumed in producing the merchandise, whether sold domestically or exported .... Accordingly, in order to accurately determine an adjustment for 'the amount of import duties imposed ... which have been rebated, or which have not been collected, by reason of the exportation of the subject merchandise to the United States,\" the Department has made an upward adjustment to EP\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   and CEP based on the per unit amount of the import duty cost included in the COP for each CONNUM.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9 (footnote omitted). Commerce calculated Uttam Galva's duty drawback adjustment by taking the duty amount either rebated or not collected (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , exempted) and allocating it over the total cost of production of the subject merchandise for the relevant investigatory period, based on the cost of inputs during that time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prelim. IDM at 15; Final IDM at 9. The Government explains Commerce's chosen methodology using the following equations:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-42\">Total Duties Exempted Pursuant to AAP Exempted Duty Adjustment Rate = + <em>Total Duties Exempted Pursuant to DFIA</em> Total Cost of Zinc + Total Cost of Hot-Rolled Coil + Total Cost of Cold-Rolled Coil Paid Import Duties on Zinc + Paid Import Duties on Hot-Rolled Coil Rebated Duty Adjustment Rate = <em>+ Paid Import Duties on Cold-Rolled Coil</em> Total Cost of Zinc + Total Cost of Hot-Rolled Coil + Total Cost of Cold-Rolled Coil Exempted Duty Adjustment Amount = Exempted Duty Adjustment Rate x (Manufacturing Cost of Zinc + Manufacturing Cost of Hot-Rolled Coil + Manufacturing Cost of Cold-Rolled Coil) Rebated Duty Adjustment Amount = Exempted Duty Adjustment Rate x (Manufacturing Cost of Zinc + Manufacturing Cost of Hot-Rolled Coil + Manufacturing Cost of Cold-Rolled Coil) Total Duty Drawback Adjustment Amount = Exempted Duty Adjustment Amount + Rebated Duty Adjustment Amount</pre>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Def.'s Resp. 18-19.

Uttam Galva claims that Commerce's methodology improperly \"reduced the duty drawback adjustment to Uttam Galva's U.S. sales by allocating duty exemptions claimed over total production.\" Pl.'s Mem. 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendant contends that Commerce's methodology reflects the \"matching principle\" and \"duty-neutral framework\" espoused by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. 19-21. The court disagrees with Defendant's reading of the case. Unlike here, the duty drawback regime at issue in\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   was one based solely on exemptions. Because the duties in\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   were exempted, they were not recorded in the respondent company's books as an expense incurred. Commerce therefore increased the company's cost of production (\"COP\") and constructed value (\"CV\"), which are both part of the Department's normal value calculation, to account for the duties presumably paid on inputs for products sold in the domestic market. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit recognized that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [T]he entire purpose of increasing EP is to account for the fact that the import duty costs are reflected in NV (home market sales prices) but not in EP (sales prices in the United States). An import duty exemption granted only for exported merchandise has no effect on home market sales prices, so the duty exemption should have no effect on NV. Thus,\n   because COP and CV are used in the NV calculation, COP and CV should be calculated as if there had been no import duty exemption. It would be illogical to increase EP to account for import duties that are purportedly reflected in NV, while simultaneously calculating NV based on a COP and CV that do not reflect those import duties. Under the \"matching principle,\" EP, COP, and CV should be increased together, or not at all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051352\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/635/1335/#p1338\">\n    635 F.3d at 1342-43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because Commerce adjusted EP in the\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   case to account for the duty drawback adjustment received by the respondent company, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit concluded that the subsequent adjustment to NV to reflect the duties paid on inputs for products sold in the home market was proper. The \"matching principle\" relates, therefore, to an adjustment to normal value with respect to the particular facts, exemption program, and recordkeeping practices presented in\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   , and should not be expanded to encompass all duty drawback adjustment calculations made by Commerce. Here, the parties do not allege deficiencies in Uttam Galva's recordkeeping or in the normal value calculation to warrant application of the matching principle. When viewed in this context,\n   <em>\n    Saha Thai\n   </em>\n   's matching principle does not support Commerce's methodology in the instant matter before this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Commerce's upwards adjustment to EP, as mandated by the statute, itself creates the \"duty-neutral framework\" under which the agency can compare NV and EP. Section 1677a(c)(1)(B) contemplates an upward adjustment to EP, allowing for an increase in the export price or constructed export price by \"the amount of any import duties imposed by the country of exportation which have been rebated, or which have not been collected, by reason of the exportation of the subject merchandise to the United States.\" 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677a(c)(1)(B). The purpose of the adjustment is to correct an imbalance and prevent an inaccurately high dumping margin by increasing EP to the level it likely would be absent a duty drawback. Commerce's allocation of duties rebated and exempted over total cost of production in this case is inconsistent with the statute because allocating duty drawback to \"total cost of production\" encompasses home market sales, which could not earn a duty drawback since Uttam Galva did not receive any exemptions or rebates on foreign inputs utilized in products sold in the home market. Commerce's flawed methodology includes costs associated with manufacturing goods sold in the domestic market, lessens the upwards adjustment, and conceptually reintroduces an imbalance in the dumping margin calculation. It fails to adequately connect the adjustment to duties forgiven \"by reason of\" the products' exportation to the United States. Because Commerce's method of calculating Uttam Galva's duty drawback adjustment is inconsistent with the statute, the court rejects Defendant's argument and concludes that Commerce's methodology is unreasonable, is not in accordance with the law, and contravenes the plain language of section 1677a(c)(1)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Furthermore, the facts in the record do not support the Department's implementation of a new methodology in this case. Commerce cited the possible use of both foreign and domestically-sourced inputs as a primary factor in creating its new methodology.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prelim. IDM at 14; Final IDM at 8-9. Commerce's former methodology risked overstating the amount of duty\n   drawback adjustment that a respondent should receive, which could lead to an unusually high export price and the potential elimination of a dumping margin where there should be one. Uttam Galva counters that Commerce's observation alone \"is not indicative of unusual facts.\" Pl.'s Mem. 15. The court agrees that Commerce's reasoning is not enough to support its use of the new methodology in this case because the agency's perceived solution does not address the facts present in this case. Here, Uttam Galva was able to \"identif[y] the raw materials imported for which it paid an import duty, ... as well as worksheets linking the raw materials to production of merchandise under consideration.\" Prelim. IDM at 16-17. Evidence in the record shows that Uttam Galva was able to track what import duties were paid on domestic inputs, and thus the problem articulated by Commerce does not exist in this case. Moreover, Commerce has not historically required respondents to trace the imported inputs directly from importation into the home country through exportation to the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14. Commerce's solution is not reasonably connected, therefore, to the facts present in the instant matter and to a solution to the perceived overstatement of duty drawback adjustment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Uttam Galva also contests Commerce's calculation of the duty drawback adjustment on the premise that it contravenes the agency's past practice, and thus should have been subject to notice and comment rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court disagrees. Courts have recognized that agencies may deviate from past practice, as long as they provide a reasonable explanation for the change.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SKF USA Inc. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052677\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/1365/#p1373\">\n    630 F.3d 1365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1373 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (acknowledging that \"[w]hen an agency changes its practice, it is obligated to provide an adequate explanation for the change\");\n   <em>\n    NMB Singapore Ltd. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3382430\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/557/1316/#p1319\">\n    557 F.3d 1316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1319-20 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (stating that, \"while [Commerce's] explanations do not have to be perfect, the path of Commerce's decision must be reasonably discernable to a reviewing court.\"). The Department's choice of a new methodology did not require notice and comment rulemaking, but did mandate a well-reasoned explanation. Commerce stated that its previous methodology of \"[a]djusting EP/CEP for the full amount of duties imposed ... when some of the same inputs are domestically sourced, results in a larger adjustment to the EP/CEP than reflected in the NV, creating an imbalance.\" Prelim. IDM at 15. The Department decided to \"take these distortions into account\" by making \"an upward adjustment to EP and CEP ... by properly allocating the amount rebated or not collected to all production for the relevant period based on the costs of inputs during the POI. This ensures that the amount added to both sides of the dumping calculations is equal,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , duty neutral.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3382430\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/557/1316/#p1319\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Commerce based its new methodology on the \"only reasonable assumption\" that \"the imported raw materials and domestically sourced raw materials are consumed proportionally between the corresponding domestic sales and export sales, as then both the U.S. price and NV will be import duty inclusive.\" Final IDM at 9. As stated before, Commerce failed to provide a reasonable explanation because its new methodology overcompensated for any imbalances and erroneously took into account domestic home market sales, which in this case are not subject to duty drawback adjustments. Commerce's explanation does not justify why its new methodology\n   should include domestic home market sales that are not otherwise subject to duty drawback.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The court concludes that Commerce's calculation of the amount of Uttam Galva's duty drawback adjustment was unreasonable and not in accordance with the law. The court remands the Final Results for redetermination. On remand, the Department should recalculate Uttam Galva's duty drawback adjustment using a methodology that is consistent with this opinion.
