(Dkt. No. 37.) Plaintiffs Alexander Herd and A.G., by and through her guardian ad litem Amanda Addington, (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\"), filed an Opposition, (Dkt.

Plaintiffs allege that at approximately 8:00 a.m., Officer Brian Leyva and Officer Jason Perniciaro arrived at the Main Street Walmart parking lot in unmarked vehicles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) Plaintiffs state that upon arriving, the officers used their vehicles to \"box in\" a parked car. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The officers then approached the vehicle with their guns drawn. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that James Gleason was sitting in the driver's seat of the parked car and Plaintiff Herd was sitting in the front passenger seat. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) According to Plaintiffs, Officers Leyva and Perniciaro shot several times into the parked car, killing James Gleason and injuring Plaintiff Herd. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff A.G. is the minor daughter of and successor in interest to Mr. Gleason.

Motion for More Definite Statement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Under Rule 12(e), if a complaint is so vague or ambiguous that the opposing party cannot reasonably frame a responsive pleading, the party may move for a more definite statement before interposing a responsive pleading. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(e). \"A motion for a more definite statement is used to attack unintelligibility, not mere lack of detail, and a complaint is sufficient if it is specific enough to apprise the defendant of the substance of the claim asserted against him or her.\"\n   <em>\n    San Bernardino Pub.

Cal. 1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A motion for a more definite statement must be considered in light of Rule 8's liberal pleading standards in federal court.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bureerong v.

Hence, \"[m]otions for a more definite statement are viewed with disfavor and are rarely granted because of the minimal pleading requirements of the Federal Rules.\"\n   <em>\n    Sagan v.

Cal. 1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Defendants point to numerous alleged deficiencies in Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint (\"SAC\"). The Court addresses each in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Plaintiffs' SAC Provides Fair Notice to Defendants\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   First, Defendants complain that Plaintiffs' SAC fails \"to adequately apprise Defendants of the nature of the liability theories they face in this action.\" (Dkt. No. 37 (\"Mot.\") at 3.) Defendants argue that Plaintiffs repeat and re-allege all previous allegations in each count, which apparently prevents the Defendants from understanding \"who is suing whom, for what relief, on what theory, and with enough detail to guide discovery.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) Plaintiffs respond that their claims are clearly presented and state exactly which defendants the claim applies to. (Dkt. No. 38 (\"Opp'n\") at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants cite numerous cases where courts have dismissed a complaint on these grounds; however, these cases are largely distinguishable from the case at hand. For example, in\n   <em>\n    McHenry v. Renne\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit stated that the dismissed complaint was far from short and plain and instead was \"argumentative, prolix, replete with redundancy, and largely irrelevant.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1793548\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/84/1172/#p1177\">\n    84 F.3d 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1177 (9th Cir. 1996). The Court went on to explain that the complaint \"consist[ed] largely of immaterial background information\" that did not assist in the determination of who was being sued, for what relief, and on what theory.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1793548\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/84/1172/#p1177\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1793548\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/84/1172/#p1177\">\n    at 1178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Salazar v. County of Orange\n   </em>\n   , the court explained that it was unclear whether Plaintiff was bringing each claim against all or only some of the defendants, and instructed the Plaintiff to include the specific names of defendants in the header of each claim. No. SACV 11-1125 AG (MLGx),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%2012896364\">\n    2012 WL 12896364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (C.D. Cal. July 10, 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs' SAC is unlike those in\n   <em>\n    McHenry\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Salazar\n   </em>\n   . The background information is short and clearly lays out facts relevant to each claim for relief; no unnecessary or irrelevant information is included. Further, although Plaintiffs reincorporate previous allegations in each new claim, and reallege much of the background in each claim, the allegations are still clear.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs allege which defendant each claim applies to and whether Plaintiff A.G. asserts the claim in her individual or representative capacity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Applying Rule 8's liberal pleading standard, the Court finds Plaintiffs' allegations sufficiently apprise Defendants of the claims and their bases and is far from unintelligible. Moreover, other defendants have already answered the SAC, which tends to refute Defendants' contention that the SAC is too confusing to answer. Thus, Defendants' Motion for a More Definite Statement is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Plaintiff A.G. May Not Assert Claims for Excessive Force and Denial of Medical Care in her Individual Capacity\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Second, Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot assert her first and second claims for relief-excessive force and denial of medical care, respectfully-in her personal capacity. (Mot. at 6;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SAC \u00b6\u00b6 48, 61.) The United States Supreme Court has held that constitutional rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   are personal to the individual and may not be asserted by a third party.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alderman v.

Accordingly, Defendants ask the Court to dismiss Plaintiff A.G.'s individual claims for excessive force and denial of medical care, and strike her corresponding request for wrongful death damages. (Mot. at 7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs do not directly respond to Defendants' argument that Plaintiff A.G. may not bring these two claims in her individual capacity. Indeed, the case law is clear that Plaintiff A.G. may not bring these claims personally because she was not directly\n   subjected to excessive force or denied medical treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1716619\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/818/1411/#p1417\">\n    818 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1417 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rose v.

Cal. 1993) (dismissing claim with prejudice where the plaintiff attempted to recover on her own behalf for alleged excessive force imposed upon decedent). Accordingly, Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED with prejudice\n   </strong>\n   as to Plaintiff A.G.'s\n   <em>\n    individual\n   </em>\n   claims for excessive force and denial of medical treatment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Instead, Plaintiffs' Opposition focuses on Defendants' demand to strike Plaintiff A.G.'s corresponding request for wrongful death damages. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp'n at 10-11.) Essentially, Plaintiffs argue that it is improper to strike the reference to wrongful death damages because, according to Plaintiffs, some courts have allegedly recognized a claim under \u00a7 1983 for wrongful death. In response, Defendants argue that if Plaintiff A.G.'s individual claims are dismissed, she cannot pursue \"damages specific to an individual's loss, such as the 'wrongful death' damages alleged at Paragraphs 48 and 61 of the SAC.\" (Dkt. No. 40 (\"Reply\") at 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The court in\n   <em>\n    Estate of Lopez\n   </em>\n   considered similar arguments.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4359898\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/105/1148/#p1158\">\n    105 F.Supp.3d 1148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1158-59 (S.D. Cal. 2015). There, the plaintiff alleged an excessive force claim under \u00a7 1983\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   a separate claim for wrongful death under \u00a7 1983. The defendants moved to dismiss the latter on the grounds that wrongful death is a state law claim.

Thus, it is clear that Plaintiffs' cause of action is based on the alleged use of excessive force. If the underlying constitutional violation alleged is excessive force, then the \u00a7 1983 claim may not be brought as a wrongful death action to vindicate the rights of Plaintiff A.G. because Fourth Amendment rights are personal to the decedent. And here, Plaintiffs actually frame their first claim as an excessive force claim; the issue only arises because Plaintiffs later request wrongful death damages. To the extent Plaintiffs also allege a \u00a7 1983 wrongful death claim on behalf of Plaintiff A.G., that claim would be duplicative of Plaintiffs' excessive force claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiffs rely on\n   <em>\n    Mendoza v.

App. 2012) to support their position that a cause of action exists under \u00a7 1983 for wrongful death. There, the plaintiffs \"sought wrongful death damages through a civil rights cause of action under\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Mendoza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4253215\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/206/702/\">\n    206 Cal.

Therefore, the Court does not find that\n   <em>\n    Mendoza\n   </em>\n   supports the contention that a separate cause of action lies for excessive force and wrongful death under \u00a7 1983.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiffs also cite\n   <em>\n    Whittlestone, Inc. v.

There, the plaintiff sued for breach of contract and sought recovery of lost profits and consequential damages.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3776497\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/618/970/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3776497\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/618/970/\">\n    at 973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendant subsequently moved to strike the damages request, arguing that such damages were barred by the parties' contract. The lower court granted the defendant's motion to strike, finding that the contract clearly excluded the damages sought. The Ninth Circuit reversed, finding that the plaintiff's request for lost profits and consequential damages was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   (1) an insufficient defense, (2) redundant, (3) immaterial, (4) impertinent, or (5) scandalous, and therefore could not be stricken under Rule 12(f).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3776497\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/618/970/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3776497\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/618/970/\">\n    at 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court also noted that requesting the damages be stricken \"was really an attempt to have certain portions of Whittlestone's complaint dismissed or to obtain summary judgment against Whittlestone as to those portions of the suit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3776497\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/618/970/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    Whittlestone\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable from the case at hand. There, the defendants merely moved to strike the request for damages, which the court found to be an improper\n   attempt to dismiss certain of the plaintiff's claims. Here, however, Defendants also move to dismiss Plaintiff A.G.'s individual claim for excessive force or wrongful death under \u00a7 1983. Since the Court addressed the confusion surrounding this issue and determined that a claim lies under \u00a7 1983 for survivor actions only, it dismissed Plaintiff A.G.'s individual excessive force and denial of medical treatment claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   at p. 1164. Without individual claims, Plaintiff would not be entitled to damages for her own injury-in other words, Plaintiff would not be entitled to wrongful death damages on these claims. This is unlike the situation in\n   <em>\n    Whittlestone\n   </em>\n   where the Court merely considered whether the request should be stricken and did not consider whether the claim itself was subject to dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Further, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Whittlestone\n   </em>\n   found that the allegations at issue did not fall into any of the five categories of material that may be stricken under Rule 12(f). Based on the above analysis, the Court finds that the wrongful death allegations in paragraphs 43 and 61 are both immaterial and impertinent. They are immaterial because they have no relationship to \u00a7 1983 claims for excessive force or denial of medical treatment brought by a successor in interest, and are impertinent because they do not pertain to the issues raised by these claims which center on the\n   <em>\n    decedent's\n   </em>\n   injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whittlestone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3776497\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/618/970/\">\n    618 F.3d at 974\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Accordingly, the Court orders Plaintiffs' requests for wrongful death damages in paragraphs 43 and 61\n   <strong>\n    STRICKEN\n   </strong>\n   .

The SAC lacks factual allegations with respect to what the alleged unnamed \"policymaker\" knew about the situation or that he or she specifically approved of the decision and the basis for it. Here, Plaintiffs do not even allege that the policymaker found Defendant Perniciaro's conduct to be within policy, and the mere fact that he allegedly has not been disciplined for the decision is insufficient to establish ratification. Further, Plaintiffs fail to address Defendants' ripeness and survivor arguments. To the extent that Plaintiffs allege ratification has yet to occur, the claim is premature and must be dismissed on those grounds. To the extent Plaintiff A.G. alleges a claim for ratification as decedent's successor in interest, that claim also must fail. The Ninth Circuit has held that \u00a7 1983 does not provide a cause of action on behalf of a deceased person based upon an alleged violation of the decedent's civil rights which occurred after his death.\n   <em>\n    Guyton v.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, in their Reply, Defendants concede that the Ninth Circuit permits Plaintiffs to pursue damages under their federal claims for decedent's pain and suffering. (Reply at 13.) Thus, the only question is whether the references to decedent's pain and suffering should be stricken from Plaintiffs' state law claims.

The references to decedent's pain and suffering are not an insufficient defense, nor are they scandalous. Thus, the only grounds for striking the references are redundancy, immateriality, or impertinency. In a sense, the references are redundant because Plaintiffs allege the exact same sentence in every single claim, even under those claims to which Plaintiffs acknowledge no pain and suffering damages may be recovered. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31, 45, 58, 67, 84, 93, 104, 112, 127, 145, 164.) As to Plaintiffs' state law claims, the references to decedent's pain and suffering are also immaterial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fantasy, Inc. v.

Similarly, the references are impertinent as to Plaintiffs' state law claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519091\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/984/1524/#p1527\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"Impertinent matter consists of statements that do not pertain, and are not necessary, to the issues in question.\") The references to decedent's pain and suffering in Plaintiffs' state law claims do not pertain to the issues in question regarding liability. Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    STRIKES\n   </strong>\n   the references to decedent's pain and suffering from paragraphs 112, 127, and 145, which correspond to Plaintiffs' state law claims under which damages for pain and suffering may not be recovered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
