Despite THR's request for a hearing on same, the Court dispenses with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court, and argument would not aid in the decisional process.

Here, there is no dispute that the Subcontract evidences a transaction involving commerce.

Rather, Harbor argues that the ADR provision of Article 13 is invalid and unenforceable for three different reasons: (1) the provision is impermissibly vague; (2) it fails to comply with the Miller Act; and (3) it is illusory because there is no mutuality of obligation. Harbor also argues that, regardless of the provision's validity, THR has waived its right to elect arbitration at this stage.

Vagueness Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   First, Harbor argues that the ADR provision of Article 13 is unenforceable because it is \"impermissibly vague.\" Opp., ECF No. 19, \u00b6 7. Specifically, it argues that the use of the word \"may\" in the provision is vague or, in the alternative, makes the entire provision permissive requiring Harbor to consent to any ADR procedures even upon THR's \"election\" of same.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1952880\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/272/239/#p242\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    TM Delmarva Power, L.L.C. v.

The only difference in that case was that the arbitration provision allowed either party to compel arbitration; it was not unilateral as is the case here.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 120,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=557%20S.E.2d%20199\">\n    557 S.E.2d 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If any material dispute, disagreement or controversy concerning this Agreement is not settled in accordance with the procedures set forth [in a prior section] ... then\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     either Party may commence arbitration\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   hereunder by delivering to the other Party a notice of arbitration.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 120,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=557%20S.E.2d%20199\">\n    557 S.E.2d 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). NCP, the party seeking to avoid arbitration, argued that the use of the word \"may\" above means that the consent of the non-initiating party is required before arbitration can commence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 121,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=557%20S.E.2d%20199\">\n    557 S.E.2d 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the Virginia Supreme Court disagreed. It found that the use of the word \"may\" means \"that either party may invoke the dispute resolution procedures, but neither is compelled to invoke the procedures. Once a party invokes [them], the other party is bound to participate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 120,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=557%20S.E.2d%20199\">\n    557 S.E.2d 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court also reasoned that, if the entire arbitration provision were permissive, \"the provision would be rendered meaningless and unnecessary,\" which is not a permissible interpretation under contract law \"when a reasonable meaning can be given.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 121,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=557%20S.E.2d%20199\">\n    557 S.E.2d 199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Likewise, here, Harbor asks the Court to render the ADR provision of the Subcontract meaningless and unnecessary by interpreting it as requiring a mutual agreement to arbitrate.

However, Harbor must participate in such procedures once elected lest the provision be rendered meaningless. Accordingly, Harbor's vagueness argument is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Validity under the Miller Act\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Harbor next argues that Article 13 of the Subcontract is unenforceable because it \"unlawfully negates Harbor's Miller Act rights against the Surety.\" Opp., ECF No. 19, \u00b6 9. In support, it points to a provision in the Miller Act, which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   A waiver of the right to bring a civil action on a payment bond required under this subchapter is void unless the waiver is-(1) in writing; (2) signed by the person whose right is waived; and (3)\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     executed after the person whose right is waived has furnished labor or material for use in the performance of the contract\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203133\">\n    40 U.S.C. \u00a7 3133\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (emphasis added). Harbor argues that, because the parties executed the Subcontract before any labor or material was furnished in performance thereof, the ADR provision in Article 13 is void under the Miller Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   However, Harbor's reliance on the Miller Act is misplaced. THR does not argue that Harbor's Miller Act claim (Count I) is subject to the ADR provision in Article 13. Rather, THR argues that the Miller Act claim should be stayed pending arbitration of the contract dispute. That is a separate issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   discussion\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   Part IV. The arbitrability of the claim itself has not been raised. Therefore, Harbor's claim that the ADR provision is unenforceable pursuant to the Miller Act is unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    3. The Unilateral Nature of the ADR Provision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Third, Harbor argues that the ADR provision in the Subcontract is unenforceable because it requires only Harbor to submit to ADR procedures and thus is an \"illusory\" agreement. In support, Harbor cites to a case from the District of Maryland in which the district court held that a unilateral arbitration agreement requiring only the employee, not the employer, to submit to arbitration was invalid \"for want of consideration\" because it lacked \"mutuality of obligation.\"\n   <em>\n    Raglani v.

Md. 2013). However, the court in that case applied Maryland law, which is inapplicable here. The issue before this Court is whether a unilateral agreement to arbitrate is valid under Virginia law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Neither party has identified, nor is this Court aware, of any case in which a Virginia court has addressed the validity of unilateral arbitration agreements under Virginia law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, other jurisdictions, including North Carolina and West Virginia, have addressed the issue and departed from Maryland law on this point. The distinction turns on whether a mutual obligation to arbitrate is required if the contract as a whole is supported by adequate consideration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dan Ryan Builders, Inc. v.

However, the Fourth Circuit has held that a four-month delay between commencement of litigation and demanding arbitration, without more, is insufficient to show waiver.\n   <em>\n    Patten Grading &amp; Paving, Inc. v.

However, THR's Alternative Answer and Counterclaim were filed pursuant to court order and thus are not relevant to the waiver issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   n.1.

Therefore, the Court finds that THR has not waived its right to demand arbitration pursuant to Article 13 of the Subcontract and the FAA. Absent other challenges to the validity of the ADR provision of the parties' Subcontract,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court views such provision as\n   enforceable under Virginia law and therefore subject to the dictates of the Federal Arbitration Act.

Here, the common questions of fact with respect to all counts of Harbor's complaint and the possibility of inconsistent outcomes weigh strongly in favor of staying the entire action while Harbor and THR arbitrate their dispute over the Subcontract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The fact that Harbor has alleged a Miller Act claim does not tip the balance of interests against a stay as Harbor suggests. A case from the District of Maryland,\n   <em>\n    United States ex rel. MPA Construction, Inc. v.

The court explained that this concern \"ignores a long history of Miller Act cases which resolve the tension between the Miller Act and the Federal Arbitration Act by staying the Miller Act claim pending arbitration of the underlying dispute.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9169731\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/349/934/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    U.S. ex rel.

Prioritizing the FAA is also necessary: \"[I]f the Court were to deny defendants' motion to stay, the arbitration mandate ... in the subcontract would be rendered meaningless, and, in every public works project where the subcontractor agrees to a similar clause, the subcontractor could circumvent the arbitration provision by suing the surety.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11632224\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/38/1299/#p1304\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Tanner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11632224\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/38/1299/#p1304\">\n    38 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1306 ). The Court finds this reasoning compelling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   However, the Court also finds that the balance of interests in this case weighs in favor of a stay only if arbitration is used for dispute resolution, not as a delay tactic.
