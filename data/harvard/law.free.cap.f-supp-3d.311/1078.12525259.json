(Dkt. 8.) For the reasons addressed below, St. Jude's motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Niazi owns United States Patent No. 6,638,268 (the '268 Patent), which is titled \"Catheter to Cannulate the Coronary Sinus.\" The '268 Patent generally embodies an invention related to medical devices-namely, catheters of the type used to cannulate the coronary sinus. The '268 Patent includes 27 claims, but only claim 1 is expressly referenced in Niazi's complaint. Claim 1 is directed to a double catheter for cannulating the coronary sinus of a human heart.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In its complaint, Niazi alleges that St. Jude \"manufactures, sells and/or offers to sell ... a telescoping catheter system that it sells under the 'CPS' mark.\" According to Niazi, St. Jude's CPS catheter system (the accused product) directly infringes the '268 Patent. In addition, Niazi alleges that St. Jude has indirectly infringed the '268 Patent by inducing and contributorily causing its customers to infringe\n   the '268 Patent, and that St. Jude's infringement of the '268 Patent is willful. St. Jude moves to dismiss Niazi's claims of indirect and willful infringement, arguing that the complaint fails to state a claim on which relief can be granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A complaint must allege sufficient facts such that, when accepted as true, a facially plausible claim to relief is stated.\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

If a complaint fails to state a claim on which relief can be granted, dismissal is warranted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).

Although in\n   <em>\n    Halo\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court of the United States altered the legal standard under which a plaintiff must prove willful infringement, \"[k]nowledge of the patent alleged to be willfully infringed continues to be a prerequisite to enhanced damages.\"\n   <em>\n    WBIP, LLC v.

Notably, because \"[w]illfulness does not equate to fraud,\" a plaintiff need not satisfy \"the more stringent pleading standard of Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    Mitutoyo Corp. v.

For the same reasons addressed in Part I of this Order with respect to induced infringement and contributory infringement, St. Jude's contention that the complaint requires greater specificity as to St. Jude's pre-suit knowledge of the '268 Patent fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   St. Jude also argues that Niazi's willful-infringement claim must be dismissed because the complaint contains \"no assertion of any specific conduct by St. Jude\" that was willful, wanton, malicious, deliberate, or done in bad faith. In response, Niazi points to its allegations that, despite St. Jude's knowledge of both the '268 Patent\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   that use of the accused product would infringe the '268 Patent, St. Jude continued to infringe the '268 Patent, encourage end users of the accused product to infringe the '268 Patent, and contributorily caused its customers to infringe the '268 Patent. For these reasons, Niazi maintains that willful infringement is sufficiently pleaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As the parties have identified, district courts have taken different positions as to the level of detail required for a willful-infringement claim to survive a motion to dismiss. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Straight Path IP Group, Inc. v. Apple Inc.\n   </em>\n   , the district court concluded that the plaintiff's willful-infringement claim was adequately pleaded based on allegations in the complaint that the defendant, despite being aware both of the asserted patents and the defendant's infringement, continued to sell the accused products and to induce its customers to infringe. No. 16-03582,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203967864\">\n    2017 WL 3967864\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (N.D. Cal. Sept. 9, 2017). The district court rejected the defendant's argument that more detailed allegations were necessary, observing that such arguments are \"for summary judgment, not [judgment] on the pleadings\" and that a plaintiff need not \"prove willfulness at the pleading stage\" so long as the complaint alleges \"more than a one-sentence prayer for willfulness relief.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203967864\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Under the holding and\n   reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Straight Path\n   </em>\n   , Niazi has adequately pleaded willful infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   St. Jude cites several decisions that reach the opposite conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Finjan, Inc. v. Cisco Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-cv-72,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202462423\">\n    2017 WL 2462423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Cal. June 7, 2017) ;\n   <em>\n    CG Tech. Dev., LLC v.

Nev. Aug. 29, 2016) ;\n   <em>\n    Varian Med. Sys., Inc. v.

July 12, 2016). In\n   <em>\n    Finjan\n   </em>\n   , unlike here, the plaintiff had not alleged that the defendant had pre-suit knowledge of the patent.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202462423\">\n    2017 WL 2462423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. The court in\n   <em>\n    Finjan\n   </em>\n   also observed that the complaint lacked sufficient allegations of willful conduct because the complaint merely alleged that \"[d]espite knowledge of Finjan's\n   <em>\n    patent portfolio\n   </em>\n   , Defendant has sold and continues to sell the accused products and services.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%202462423\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). The pleadings here offer a marked contrast. Niazi does not allege that St. Jude had knowledge of a \"patent portfolio,\" but instead alleges that St. Jude had pre-suit knowledge of the specific patent-in-suit\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   knowledge that use of the accused product infringes the '268 Patent. Moreover, unlike the complaint at issue in\n   <em>\n    Finjan\n   </em>\n   , Niazi's complaint also alleges that St. Jude encouraged end users of the accused product to infringe the '268 Patent and contributorily caused its customers to infringe the '268 Patent. These facts distinguish this case from\n   <em>\n    Finjan\n   </em>\n   . And both\n   <em>\n    CG Technology\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Varian\n   </em>\n   are distinguishable on the same basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    CG Tech.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204521682\">\n    2016 WL 4521682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14 ;\n   <em>\n    Varian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203748772\">\n    2016 WL 3748772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Halo\n   </em>\n   observes that enhanced damages may not be awarded \"simply because the evidence shows that the infringer knew about the patent\n   <em>\n    and nothing more\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597516\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1923/#p1932\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Breyer, J., concurring). But the\n   <em>\n    Halo\n   </em>\n   decision, including the concurrence, does not support dismissal of Niazi's willful-infringement claim for at least two reasons. First, the\n   <em>\n    Halo\n   </em>\n   decision did not involve a motion to dismiss or address what factual allegations are necessary to adequately\n   <em>\n    plead\n   </em>\n   willful infringement. Here, at the pleading stage, the Court's analysis focuses on what facts are\n   <em>\n    alleged\n   </em>\n   , not what the evidence shows. Second, Niazi alleges more than St. Jude's knowledge that the '268 Patent exists. Niazi also alleges that St. Jude knew that use of the accused product was infringing and, despite this knowledge, St. Jude continued to use, manufacture, sell, and offer for sale the accused product, along with encouraging and contributorily causing its customers to infringe the '268 Patent. Whether Niazi can\n   <em>\n    prove\n   </em>\n   that St. Jude willfully infringed is not to be resolved on a motion to dismiss. The Court need only determine whether the allegations in Niazi's complaint, albeit minimal, are sufficient to avoid dismissal for failure to state a plausible claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) ;\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    550 U.S. at 570\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
