INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This matter comes before the Court on Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment\n   on all of Plaintiff's claims. Dkt. # 96. Plaintiff has alleged, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\" \u00a7 1981\") and the Washington Law against Discrimination (\"WLAD\"), that Defendant discriminated and retaliated against him on account of his race and national origin. Dkt. # 1 \u00b6 2. Defendant argues that Plaintiff's evidence cannot support a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation and, in any event, cannot show that Defendant did not have legitimate business reasons for its actions or that Defendant's reasons were merely a pretext for discrimination or retaliation. Dkt. # 96 at 2-3. Plaintiff argues that he has \"provided substantial evidence in support of his case and has disputed the material facts.\" Dkt. # 122-1 at 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   While Plaintiff has requested oral argument, the Court finds oral argument unnecessary to its resolution of Defendant's motion. Having considered the parties' briefing and the relevant record, and for the reasons set forth below, the Court grants Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Plaintiff was employed by Defendant, The Boeing Company, from February, 1986, until he was laid off as a part of a reduction in force in April, 2015. Dkt. # 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 18. At all relevant times, Plaintiff was a Systems and Data Analyst 4 (a \"BAMA-4\") working within Defendant's \"ENOVIA\" development team, a part of its IT group.

Following Management Changes, Mr. Garrity Becomes Plaintiff's New Manager\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   During 2014, Defendant reorganized its IT group, resulting in several management changes for Plaintiff. Dkt. # 99 at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5. Plaintiff began the year under the management of Mr. McClees who had previously managed Plaintiff for several years and who continued to manage Plaintiff and the ENOVIA team until April, 2014.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Management of the team was then transferred to Mr. Nelson from April to August because Defendant initially intended to maintain the ENOVIA team in Washington.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Defendant later decided to move its ENOVIA team to South Carolina and placed the team under the management of Mr. Garrity, who was located in South Carolina.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mr. Garrity was Plaintiff's manager from August until his termination on April 24, 2015.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiff did not believe that his new manager was qualified or effective as Mr. Garrity had \"only been with [Defendant] for approximately two years [and] ... had little to no IT experience, computer science experience, or software development experience.\" Dkt. # 122-2 at \u00b6 21.

During the course of the meeting, Plaintiff observed \"Mr. Garrity [become] visibly frustrated and hostile\" and Mr. Garrity \"angrily said to [Plaintiff] in a very aggressive tone: 'Where are you from?' and 'What is your nationality?' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    at \u00b6 27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In response, Plaintiff told Mr. Garrity: \"This has nothing to do with this conversation. I'm Iranian, and why you're [sic] asking about my nationality?\" Dkt. # 97-1 at 17-18. Mr. Garrity responded: \"What else do you have to complain about?\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   After Plaintiff responded that he had nothing else, Mr. Garrity \"stormed out of the conference room, abruptly terminating the meeting.\" Dkt. # 122-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 30-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiff's 2014 Performance Management Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Within Defendant's IT group, managers complete yearly Performance Management Reviews (\"PMs\") for their hourly employees based on their individual performance. Dkt. # 99 at \u00b6\u00b6 6, 8. Managers assign values on a variety of metrics within the areas of \"Business Goals and Objectives\" (\"B &amp; Os\") and \"Performance Values\" (\"PVs\") using the following scale: \"1 Does Not Meet,\" \"2 Met Some Expectations,\" \"3 Met Expectations,\" \"4 Exceeds Expectations,\" and \"5 Far Exceeds Expectations..\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    at \u00b6 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even though the PMs consider individual performance, there was a push, in mid-to-late 2014, for managers to force differentiation and have tough conversations in the review process by more closely applying rating criteria and utilizing the full rating scale. Dkt. # 97-4 at 3-4; Dkt. # 98 at \u00b6 5; Dkt. # 99 at \u00b6 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Central to his claims, Plaintiff alleges that under Mr. Garrity he received \"some of the worst and most unfair Performance Management and Job-Related Competencies evaluations he had received in his 29 years with [Defendant], despite 2014 being one of the most successful years of his career.\" Dkt. # 1 at \u00b6 16. Mr. Garrity, as Plaintiff's manager at the end of 2014, completed his PM for the year in November, 2014. Dkt. # 122-2 at \u00b6 43. Mr. Garrity gave Plaintiff an overall rating of \"(3) 'Met Expectations' \" in the B &amp; Os section and gave Plaintiff a mixture of \"3\"s and \"4\"s within the individual metrics of that section. Dkt. # 107-1 at 255-65. In the PVs section, Mr. Garrity gave Plaintiff \"3\"s on the individual metrics as well as an overall rating of \"(3) 'Met Expectations.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Mr. Garrity explained in the 2014 PM that Plaintiff's \"transition from 'exceeds' to 'mets' [sic] was not due to a decline in his performance, but due to [Mr. Garrity] working to provide more accurate feedback and metrics for the requirements that [Plaintiff] has in his position and level.\" Dkt. # 107-1 at 260.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Mr. Garrity's ratings were a departure from Plaintiff's 2013 PM, completed by Mr. McClees, and his mid-year 2014 PM, completed by Mr. Nelson, each of which rated Plaintiff \"(4) 'Exceeds Expectations' \" in both the B &amp; Os and PVs. Dkt. # 107-1 at 235-53. Further, the lower ranking was despite Plaintiff having successfully completed several projects in 2014, pleasing his internal customers and saving Defendant over 10 million dollars. Dkt. # 122-1 at 2-3; Dkt. # 122-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 38-40. Mr. Garrity knew of at least one of these successful projects before rating Plaintiff and considered those accomplishments in Plaintiff's 2014 PM ratings, rating him as exceeding expectations in relevant\n   subcategories. Dkt. # 109; Dkt. # 98 at \u00b6 16. While significant, the accomplishments were not unexpected for an employee of Plaintiff's level. Dkt. # 98 at \u00b6 15; Dkt. # 99 at \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On December 8, 2014, Plaintiff began an alternative dispute resolution process (\"ADR\") \"challenging the fairness, process, and scoring\" of his 2014 PM ratings. Dkt. # 122-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 62-63. Specifically, Plaintiff argued that the PM rating did not \"fairly reflect my actual performance, contributions, and accomplishments made during the year.\" Dkt. # 97-7 at 2. During a January 5, 2015 phone call, Mr. Garrity ordered Plaintiff to sign his 2014 PM rating and Plaintiff told Mr. Garrity that \"the way you graded me is discriminatory and biased, and I have to-I'm challenging you, and taking this to ADR.\" Dkt. # 122-2 at \u00b6 71-73. On the same date, Plaintiff signed his 2014 PM ratings and included a narrative disagreeing with the ratings but not indicating that he believed the review was discriminatory, motivated by racial animus, or retaliatory. Dkt. # 107-1 at 263-65.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The ADR process was supposed to have three steps. Plaintiff's ADR appeal proceeded through the first two steps, but Mr. Garrity-Defendant's representative-did not agree to change Plaintiff's ratings. Dkt. # 107-3 at 38; Dkt. # 107-1 at 53-61. The ADR process was terminated prior to the final step-a more involved Panel Review to determine whether the ratings were in line with Defendant's policies. Dkt. # 107-1 at 56-59. Scheduling difficulties did not allow the Panel Review to occur before Plaintiff's employment was terminated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

The Skill Captain and managers then assigned the job competencies weighted values to comprise 60% of the RIF assessment score and the 2014 PM scores made up the other 40% of the assessment score (20% B &amp; Os, 20% PVs).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Managers rated their individual BAMA-4s on the agreed job competencies, using a scale of 1 (Entry Level) to 5 (Expert).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    at \u00b6 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Dkt. # 97-8 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defendant similarly offers several legitimate reasons for Plaintiff's termination in the 2015 reduction in force. First, Defendant had conducted several reductions in force in the preceding years, leaving a pool of talented employees. Dkt. # 99 at \u00b6 9. Plaintiff was ultimately ranked 22nd out of 24 BAMA-4s working within the Puget Sound region and was terminated on that basis.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16. Second, Plaintiff was one of eight BAMA-4s who were identified as \"at risk\" and Mr. Garrity managed four of them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Dkt. # 98-4; Dkt. # 98 at \u00b6 11.

During that interaction, Mr. Garrity angrily asked: \"Where are you from?\" and \"What is your nationality?\" Plaintiff does not complain of any other discriminatory interaction while employed by Defendant. But these questions on their own do not demonstrate any animus and do not give rise to an inference that Mr. Garrity intentionally discriminated against Plaintiff. Only the circumstances in which the questions were asked can give rise to an inference of discriminatory animus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiff and Mr. Garrity were engaged in a heated meeting-their first-and Plaintiff testifies that he \"raised concerns about the status of some projects ...

Dkt. # 122-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 26-27; Dkt. # 122-1 at 4-5. As Plaintiff criticized Mr. Garrity's management of his new group, Mr. Garrity became \"visibly frustrated and hostile\" and posed the questions with an angry and aggressive tone. Dkt. # 122-2 at \u00b6 27. From these circumstances a reasonable jury may infer that Mr. Garrity believed Plaintiff was not from America and/or was not ethnically Caucasian and thereby may infer that Mr. Garrity believed that inquiring into Plaintiff's nationality would demean or embarrass Plaintiff and in some manner aid him in a heated encounter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Plaintiff argues that this gives rise to an inference of discrimination that on its own precludes summary judgment.

While the case only applies to Plaintiff's WLAD claims, the case also does not support Plaintiff's\n   argument that a so called \"stray remark\" about an employee's protected characteristic precludes summary judgment. While the court in\n   <em>\n    Scrivener\n   </em>\n   did reject a categorical exclusion of all \"stray remarks,\" it did not consider whether the stray remarks in that case could establish pretext on their own. Rather, the court found that the stray remarks were relevant evidence that, when combined with all of Ms. Scrivener's other evidence, would allow a reasonable jury to conclude that the decision to not hire her was made on account of her age.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   But Plaintiff's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Scrivener\n   </em>\n   fails because the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Scrivener\n   </em>\n   had much stronger evidence supporting an inference that the employer's reasons were a pretext for intentional discrimination. First, neither of the younger applicants that were hired over Ms. Scrivener satisfied all of the desired qualifications and requirements for the position-Ms. Scrivener did.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=334%20P.3d%20541\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=334%20P.3d%20541\">\n    at 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Third, the president directly mocked Ms. Scrivener with a \"younger reference\" and indicated he wanted candidates displaying \"youthfulness.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=334%20P.3d%20541\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=334%20P.3d%20541\">\n    at 545, 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The statements in\n   <em>\n    Scrivener\n   </em>\n   were directly indicative of a discriminatory animus toward Ms. Scrivener's protected class and were statements from which the jury could directly infer intent to discriminate against older applicants by not hiring them. Here, there is only one statement at issue and a reasonable jury could only infer racial animus by first using the surrounding circumstances to infer Mr. Garrity's state of mind and intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   However, Defendant's argument that the questions are \"stray remarks\" and legally insufficient to even create an inference of discrimination is also not correct and the cases cited by Defendant are distinguishable.

Rather, the questions-and more importantly the context in which they were posed-are slight evidence from which a reasonable jury could ultimately infer that Mr. Garrity harbors animus toward all non-American, non-European Caucasians. As a whole, this is slight evidence-a scintilla-to satisfy Plaintiff's burden of presenting specific and substantial evidence that Defendant intentionally discriminated against him on account of his race or national origin.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Plaintiff asserts that \"this is not the only evidence that [Mr.] Garrity harbored discriminatory intent toward [Plaintiff] because of his nationality.\" Dkt. # 122-1 at 20.

Plaintiff does not point to any other evidence that arguably establishes a racially discriminatory motive drove the otherwise legitimate business decisions.

To show that the ratings were a pretext, Plaintiff argues that he performed well in 2014, his internal customers were very happy, others had previously given him better ratings, and a jury could infer that Mr. Garrity had no basis for giving him a lower rating.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   To support his 2014 performance, Plaintiff points to successful projects resulting in significant savings of over 10 million dollars for Defendant. Dkt. # 122-1 at 19.

Here, Plaintiff establishes that his satisfied internal customers-Ms. Maisonet and Mr. Wilmore-would have provided him higher P &amp; V ratings than Mr. Garrity did and that this information was provided to Mr. Garrity. Dkt. # 107-1 at 267-73. But while the subjective impressions of internal customers working with Plaintiff on specific projects may be probative, they do not establish that Plaintiff's manager's overall performance rating of Plaintiff, as a BAMA-4 within the ENOVIA team, was a pretext. Plaintiff simply has not shown that his internal customers were in a position to know all of Plaintiff's responsibilities or how he compared to others in his job classification or within his team.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiff also believes that his prior managers-Mr. McClees and Mr. Nelson-reviewed him more fairly and that at least Mr. McClees would have provided him a higher 2014 PM rating. Plaintiff bases this off of Mr. McClees's testimony that, from a position outside the ENOVIA team, he believed Plaintiff's performance in 2014 was equivalent to his prior performance. Dkt. # 107-1 at 116-17. That Mr. McClees's subjective rating of Plaintiff stayed the same does not indicate that Mr. Garrity's subjective ratings, as Plaintiff's new manager, were pretextual. Plaintiff also relies on the positive ratings given him by Mr. Nelson in the mid-year 2014 PM. But, at least with regard to the B &amp; O section, Mr. Nelson scored Plaintiff similarly to Mr. Garrity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   More importantly, Mr. Nelson \"continues to believe that Mr. Garrity's ratings of Plaintiff were fair and reasonable.\" Dkt. # 99 at \u00b6 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   That Plaintiff received lower ratings in his 2014 PM review than those in 2013 does not establish that the ratings were pretextual. Decreased performance reviews can certainly be probative of pretext.\n   <em>\n    Yartzoff\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1643347\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/809/1371/#p1375\">\n    809 F.2d 1371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Winarto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9460061\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/274/1276/#p1284\">\n    274 F.3d 1276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But they are probative when there are unexplained drops in performance reviews. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Winarto\n   </em>\n   , the same supervisor had given the plaintiff positive ratings prior to the plaintiff making protected complaints and thereafter rated the plaintiff unjustifiably low.\n   <em>\n    Winarto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9460061\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/274/1276/#p1284\">\n    274 F.3d at 1287-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Conversely, in\n   <em>\n    Steiner v. Showboat Operating Co.\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit held that low performance reviews given by a new management team\n   did not establish retaliation.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10516575\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/25/1459/\">\n    25 F.3d 1459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 1994). This case is similar to\n   <em>\n    Steiner\n   </em>\n   . Mr. Garrity was Plaintiff's new manager and had not reviewed his work previously. Regardless of whether he was qualified to do so, he was tasked with managing the ENOVIA team and reviewing Plaintiff's work as well as the work of other BAMA-4s and employees on the team. That Mr. Garrity valued Plaintiff's contributions differently or had different ideas about what measures were important to the success of the ENOVIA team does not establish that the reviews were a pretext.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    c. 2015 RIF\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiff also fails to show that his 2015 RIF ratings were a pretext for intentional discrimination. Plaintiff argues that he has presented evidence showing that Mr. Garrity manipulated the process by intentionally rating Plaintiff poorly while intentionally rating a white employee artificially high. Dkt. # 122-1 at 22. But Plaintiff's arguments do not have adequate factual support and do not establish pretext.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Plaintiff first argues that Mr. Garrity demonstrated a willingness to \"work down\" Plaintiff's RIF ratings, showing that the ratings were a pretext. Dkt. # 122-1 at 22. Specifically, Plaintiff points to a January 27, 2015, exchange between Mr. Garrity and Ms. McCuen in which Mr. Garrity indicates: \"remember, I was one of 3 votes and I worked the numbers down greatly from what [Mr. McClees] and [Mr. Nelson] had. [I]f I were the only voting member, it would have been lower.\" Dkt. # 107-2 at 6-7. But this does not support an inference that Mr. Garrity was manipulating the numbers in order to discriminate. Rather, it supports an inference that different people had different views on the proper scoring of Plaintiff. That Mr. Garrity's judgment differed from Mr. McClees and Mr. Nelson does not show that Mr. Garrity's ratings were a pretext. Further, nowhere does Plaintiff establish what ratings Mr. McClees or Mr. Nelson would have actually assigned or whether those ratings would have been higher than those assigned by Mr. Garrity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Plaintiff further argues that Mr. Garrity expressed willingness to manipulate the RIF ratings of Mr. Hendry-a white Programmer Analyst 4 (\"BAMB-4\"). Dkt. # 122-1 at 22. But again this does not establish that Plaintiff's RIF ratings were manipulated or pretextual. First, Plaintiff does not present any evidence showing that this was done on account of Mr. Hendry's race or national origin or that it had any effect on Plaintiff as Mr. Hendry was considered, if at all, in the BAMB RIF.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor does Plaintiff present any evidence contesting Defendant's innocuous explanation that while Mr. Hendry was technically\n   listed in the BAMB node for the RIF, he had been exempted from the process by Defendant because he elected to take a position in South Carolina. Dkt. # 107-1 at 36-39. Plaintiff's argument grievously misrepresents the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Lastly, Plaintiff alleges that Mr. Garrity was unqualified to assess Plaintiff in the 2015 RIF and gave ratings that were objectively unsupported. Dkt. # 122-1 at 22. In support, Plaintiff cites to portions of the record showing that Ms. Maisonet was concerned about the impact Plaintiff's termination would have on her team's project. Dkt. # 107-2 at 72-80; Dkt. # 107-3 at 1-4. But the record shows the Ms. Maisonet was concerned about losing Plaintiff's historical knowledge of the project, not that she believed the ratings were a pretext for discrimination. In fact, as early as April 30, 2014,-well before Mr. Garrity became Plaintiff's manager and well before any indication that Plaintiff may be laid off-Ms. Maisonet expressed concern over losing any of the IT employees working with her team due to reorganization of the IT group.

But here, Plaintiff is unable to demonstrate that similarly situated employees outside of his protected class were treated more favorably.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the other employees within his job classification (BAMA-4) were not similarly situated comparators. Rather, Plaintiff argues that a proper class of comparators consists of \"Subject Matter Experts\" (\"SMEs\"), a group of employees doing \"equivalent work\" and with \"equivalent experience and skills.\" Dkt. # 122-1 at 19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Plaintiff must establish that comparators are similarly situated in \"all material respects.\"\n   <em>\n    Moran v.

Dkt. # 122-1 at 11. But other than including job descriptions, Plaintiff does not show the differences between the two positions, that he was performing other BAMB-4 functions, or that other BAMA-4s were not similarly performing \"programming.\" Dkt. # 122-1 at 11-12. Indeed, a portion of the record cited by Plaintiff also establishes that Mr. Johnson, another BAMA-4 who was terminated, was also a \"programmer\" yet Plaintiff does not include him as a comparator. Dkt. # 107-1 at 80-82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Further diminishing Plaintiff's argument that his similarly situated comparators were the SMEs, Plaintiff cites to no part of the record that supports SME as a designation within or used by Defendant's IT group. Construing the record in Plaintiff's favor, as the Court must, SME is an informal designation utilized by an internal customer of\n   Plaintiff's IT team. Plaintiff relies primarily upon the declaration of Ms. Maisonet, an Engineering Process Manager, whose Engineering team identified IT employees assigned to work on their Engineering projects, including Plaintiff, as \"Subject Matter Experts.\" Dkt. # 107-1 at 3-4, at \u00b6\u00b6 4-9. Ms. Maisonet's team considered SMEs to be \"team members who are critical to achieving program goals and ensuring a high-quality product is delivered on time.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5383270\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/447/748/#p755\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In fact, Ms. Maisonet's team appears to have considered all of the IT employees who had worked for the team and had institutional knowledge of her team's projects as SMEs. Dkt. # 107-1 at 4, at \u00b6 9; Dkt. # 107-1 at 278. Curiously, while Ms. Maisonet identifies Mr. Hendry as a SME, she apparently did not consider him a SME when he replaced Plaintiff on a specific project.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 107-1 at 4, \u00b6 9,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Dkt. # 107-1 at 8, at \u00b6 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Plaintiff's only support that the IT group used the SME designation internally is a citation to the deposition testimony of Mr. McClees, an IT manager, in which he agrees that several individuals identified in a document not identified in the record were listed as \"experts\" and that he agreed with that assessment. Dkt. # 107-1 at 125. Even putting aside the hearsay considerations and lack of context, the testimony does not support an inference that the IT group had a designation of \"Subject Matter Expert.\" In fact, Plaintiff's argument to this effect mischaracterizes the record as Plaintiff himself indicated that \"[t]hree of my teammates and I were recognized by the customers as SME and critical to the ENOVIA development project.\" Dkt. # 107-3 at 44. Plaintiff does not provide evidence allowing a reasonable jury to infer that he and the other BAMB-4s were similarly situated in all material respects. Therefore, the Court will consider Plaintiff similarly situated to the others within his job classification-BAMA-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    2014 PM Ratings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Plaintiff is unable to establish that he was treated differently than other similarly situated employees outside of his protected class with regard to his 2014 PM ratings. As noted above, IT managers had been encouraged to grade harder and force differentiation. Additionally, Defendant proves, and Plaintiff does not contest, that Mr. Garrity rated four BAMA-4s who were ultimately subject to the same 2015 RIF and that two of those four were rated lower in 2014 than in 2013. Dkt. # 97 at \u00b6 9.

Plaintiff, however, must present substantial evidence of pretext, not an inference of discrimination at the third stage.

Dkt. # 98 at \u00b6 11; Dkt. # 98-4.

Putting aside that Plaintiff does not cite to any case law supporting this argument or establish that his position was not actually eliminated-establishing that Defendant still needed his services-the fact is not material. That Plaintiff was laid off did not mean that his internal customers would no longer have a need for IT services. Nor is it probative that Defendant filled that need with remaining members of the ENOVIA team, other IT employees, and outside contractors who happened to be outside Plaintiff's protected class.

Plaintiff has not argued that Defendant lacked legitimate business reasons for the 2015 raise, the 2015 RIF ratings, or the subsequent termination. Likewise, Plaintiff has not argued that Defendant's stated reasons were a pretext for retaliation. Conversely, Defendant has established that it gave similar raises to similarly situated employees, honestly rated Plaintiff's job competencies in the 2015 RIF, and non-discriminatorily selected to terminate Plaintiff's employment. Plaintiff presents no evidence that Defendant's actions were actually driven by retaliatory intent. Instead, Plaintiff appears to rely on the same actions he argues establish pretext for intentional race and national origin discrimination. But the Court has already rejected those arguments as insufficient to establish pretext for Plaintiff's discrimination claims and they similarly fail with regard to his retaliation claims. Ultimately, a reasonable jury could not find in Plaintiff's favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Univ. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v.

Plaintiff seeks summary judgment with regard to many of the defenses included in Defendant's Answer and to establish facts under 56(g) which are not material to Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. Because the Court has determined that Defendant is entitled to summary judgment, the Court denies Plaintiff's Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

Dkts. ## 106-113. Several others of Plaintiff's supporting documents were filed in the early minutes of January 30, 2018. Dkts. ## 114-121. Subsequently, Plaintiff filed a Praecipe, indicating that several drafting errors existed in Plaintiff's Response and Plaintiff's Declaration and requesting that the Court consider corrected versions attached thereto. Dkt. # 122 at 1. Defendant notes that the corrections actually removed a substantive assertion. Dkt. # 123 at 4 n.4. Regardless, the Court has considered Plaintiff's corrected response, corrected declaration, and late filed documents.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    Plaintiff's briefing has left the Court to scour the record, unaided. Plaintiff completely fails to adequately cite to the record, with the exception of deposition testimony. Local Rule 10(e)(6) provides that \"the parties shall, insofar as possible, cite the page and line of any part of the transcript or record to which their pleadings, motions or other filings refer.\" LCR10(e)(6). Throughout, Plaintiff's response cites broadly to multi-page exhibits and multi-paragraph declarations-including Plaintiff's own 13 page, nearly 100 paragraph declaration. Plaintiff provides the court no assistance on locating the specific facts upon which he relies. The issue is exacerbated by Plaintiff's generous reading of the record. The Court has nevertheless extensively and carefully reviewed the record in concluding that the record as a whole does not present specific triable issues of fact sufficient to defeat summary judgment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Plaintiff also argues that three facts independently raise an inference of discrimination: (1) because his 2014 PM was lower than his 2013 PM; (2) because of Mr. Garrity's Oct. 30 questions; and (3) because he was \"replaced\" by white employees. Dkt. # 122-1 at 18-21. Because these arguments are not overly persuasive on their own and because the Court otherwise finds that Plaintiff has established a prima facie case, the Court will more thoroughly address these arguments with regard to pretext.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    Plaintiff's Complaint alleges that he suffered adverse employment actions when: (1) he was given negative performance evaluations, (2) he was denied a cash award, (3) he was not promoted, (4) he was not given more than a 2% raise, (5) his job classification was not corrected, and (6) he was given negative job competency evaluations, ultimately leading to him being laid off in the 2015 RIF. Dkt. # 1 at \u00b6 18. However, many of these would fail to establish a prima facie case because they are not sufficiently adverse or because Plaintiff cannot establish that similarly situated individuals received more favorable treatment. Because Plaintiff appears to abandon treating each as a basis for a prima facie case, and instead treats the totality as establishing an inference of discrimination or pretext, the Court will do the same. Dkt. # 122-1 at 17.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    Outside of those identified as \"at risk,\" two of 24 BAMA-4s evaluated within the Puget Sound region accepted voluntary layoff. Dkt. # 99 at \u00b6 17.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    Mr. Nelson gave Plaintiff seven \"4\"s and thirteen \"3\"s. Dkt. # 107-1 at 245-53. Mr. Garrity gave Plaintiff six \"4\"s and fourteen \"3\"s. Dkt. # 107-1 at 255-65.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    The Court notes, lastly, that Plaintiff appears to argue that the 2014 PMs were discriminatory because they put him at risk of layoff in the 2015 RIF. But Plaintiff does not support that assertion with evidence. In fact, Plaintiff does not show that Mr. Garrity was aware of the impending RIF at the time that he made the 2014 PM evaluation of Plaintiff. Plaintiff states he learned about the RIF in \"late 2014\" but does not specify when. Dkt. # 122-2 at \u00b6 41. This is not enough to support an inference that Mr. Garrity knew a low 2014 PM rating would put Plaintiff at risk. Further, Mr. Garrity had no way to know the ratings that other managers were giving their BAMA-4s. In the RIF, Plaintiff was considered against all BAMA-4s, whether rated by Mr. Garrity or not. Plaintiff's ratings certainly are not low enough that a reasonable jury could infer that Mr. Garrity assured Plaintiff would be comparably lower than the other BAMA-4s, especially when Mr. Garrity gave other BAMA-4s lower 2014 PM ratings. Dkt. # 97-8 at 2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    Indeed, Defendant establishes that Mr. Hendry was ultimately not considered in the RIF \"because he elected to transfer to Charleston, South Carolina, and thus was exempt from the Puget Sound RIF.\" Dkt. # 125 at \u00b6 5.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    Plaintiff alters his group of comparators with regard to the SME classification and pay raises. Dkt. # 122-1 at 8, 19. Plaintiff relies upon Mr. Crum to show that Plaintiff received a lower raise, but does not include Mr. Crum in his group of SME comparators, even though Mr. Crum is a BAMB-4 like the others selected by Plaintiff. Dkt. # 116.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    Plaintiff argues that he was incorrectly classified as a BAMA-4 and should have been a BAMB-4. Dkt. # 122-1 at 11-12. But Plaintiff does not contend that his incorrect job classification was due to Defendant's discrimination and indeed it preceded Mr. Garrity becoming his manager. Dkt. # 122-2 at \u00b6 76.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    The Court notes that this includes non-BAMA-4 employees, and therefore is not purely similarly situated individuals, but it is nevertheless evidence that Mr. Garrity rated employees lower than they had previously been rated by Mr. McClees or Mr. Nelson.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    Plaintiff's \u00a7 1981 claims may also fail because even a generous reading of the record does not support an inference of\n    <em>\n     racial\n    </em>\n    discrimination. \"[N]ational origin discrimination is not within the ambit of \u00a7 1981.\"\n    <em>\n     Fonseca v.

Mr. Garrity's questions do not raise an adequate inference of discrimination on the basis of Plaintiff's national origin, much less his race or ethnic characteristics.
