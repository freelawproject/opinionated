Plaintiff Radcliffe Walker, who was then 17 years old, was with his cousin when he was approached by four police officers in a cruiser near his home. The parties dispute whether Walker was trespassing on a construction site or standing on the sidewalk. The officers say (and Walker has not disputed) that they smelled burnt marijuana. One of the officers, defendant Frank Femino, asked the boys a question. Walker suddenly took off running. Femino got out of the car and began chasing him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Walker ran into the basement of a house, from which a woman emerged, screaming. Femino chased Walker into the basement. Walker alleges that he was punched and beaten by Femino and perhaps other officers. He was handcuffed, searched, and removed from the basement. No marijuana or other contraband was found. Shortly thereafter, Walker's mother informed the police that he lived at the house and was not trespassing. Walker was then released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Walker alleges that Femino violated his Fourth Amendment rights, falsely imprisoned him, intentionally inflicted emotional distress, assaulted him, and used excessive force in connection with his arrest. Femino has moved for partial summary judgment on the Fourth Amendment and false imprisonment claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   There are three basic components to this lawsuit, involving the legality of (1) the initial pursuit, (2) the subsequent arrest and searches, and (3) the use of force. Only the first two are the subject of the motion for summary judgment; defendant does not contend that he is entitled to summary judgment on the excessive-force claim. For the following reasons, the Court concludes that, under the circumstances, Femino's pursuit of Walker is protected by the doctrine of qualified immunity, and that he had probable cause to conduct the arrest and search. Accordingly, partial summary judgment will be granted in favor of Femino.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Unless otherwise indicated, the following facts are set forth in the light most favorable to plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Radcliffe Walker is an African-American teenager who lives with his mother at 16 Rockland Street in the Roxbury section of Boston. (Def. SMF Ex. 5; Pl. SMF Ex. 3 at 6:12-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Frank Femino is a Boston police officer. On October 12, 2012, Femino was on patrol\n   with three other officers, Douglas McGrath, Thomas Bernier, and Michael Paradis, in the same police car. (Def. SMF \u00b6 1;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1 at 12:5-13, 12:16-21;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2 at 25:5-16). Bernier was driving, and Femino was sitting in the front passenger side of the car. (Def. SMF Ex. 3 at 30:22-31:6). At least Femino and Paradis are white. (Pl. SMF Ex. 4 at Answer 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Around 6 or 7 p.m., the officers noticed Walker and another individual, his cousin Lester Walker, near a house that was under construction. (Def. SMF Ex. 2 at 43:19-44:3;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 3 at 37:5-9;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 5; Pl.

(Def. SMF Ex. 2 at 43:19-44:3;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 3 at 37:5-9; Pl. SMF Ex. 3 at 106:10-12;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 4 at Answer 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Bernier pulled the car up to Walker and Lester and stopped. There had been no discussion among the officers about the two boys, and Femino testified that he had no opinion as to why Bernier stopped the car in front of them. (Pl. SMF Ex. 1 at 32:7-18). Femino rolled his window down and addressed the boys. (Def. SMF Ex. 3 at 44:4-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The officers contend that they smelled burnt marijuana. (Def. SMF Ex. 1 at 52:10-17;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2 at 43:19-44:3;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20N.E.3d%201267\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 3 at 37:5-9;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 4 at 39:7-10).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   No officer contends that he saw either boy smoking marijuana. Only Femino testified that he saw \"smoke in the air.\" (Def. SMF Ex. 3 at 37:5-9). No marijuana was ever recovered, either from the boys or in the immediate area. (Def. SMF Ex. 1 at 52:21-23;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 3 at 81:1-6, 94:17-22). Plaintiff, however, has submitted no evidence disputing the existence of the marijuana smell.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Femino asked Walker at least one question, although the parties dispute what was said. Femino contends that he asked them if they lived at the house that they were standing next to, and that Walker answered, \"No.\" (Def. SMF Ex. 3 at 44:10-14;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 4 at 38:14-19). Paradis testified that Femino also asked Walker his name, and he answered, \"Zane.\" (Def. SMF Ex. 4 at 38:22-39:3;\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 3 at 78:13-14 (Femino testifying that he told Walker's mother that Walker had told him his name was \"Zane\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 5 (listing \"Zane\" as an alias of Walker) ). Walker, however, contends that the officer said something like, \"Don't you guys think you should be inside, wrong place?\" (Pl. SMF Ex. 4 at Answer 10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   According to Walker, he became scared and took off running home as soon as they\n   spoke to him. (Pl. SMF Ex. 3 at 107:14-18). Femino contends that Walker started running when he opened the door to the car to get out. (Pl. SMF Ex. 1 at 46:20-24;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def. SMF Ex. 4 at 39:14-19).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Lester did not run. (Def. SMF Ex. 4 at 42:14-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Femino testified that he had a suspicion that Walker had a weapon because \"[t]he way he ran it was an indication that he was in possession of a weapon.\" (Def. SMF Ex. 3 at 50:22-51:1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   He and Paradis pursued Walker on foot, while Bernier followed with the car and McGrath stayed with Lester. (Def. SMF Ex. 1 at 37:8-38:9;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 4 at 26:18-27:1, 42:21-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Walker ran into the backyard of a house at 16 Rockland Street. He then entered the basement. (Def. SMF Ex. 3 at 57:3-58:3; Pl. SMF Ex. 3 at 117:10-22). The basement is a separate apartment; Walker did not live there. (Def. SMF Ex. 6 at 45:13-24;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 8 at 16:15-20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Walker contends that while he was running into the yard, he was shouting back at the pursuing officers that it was his home. (Pl. SMF Ex. 3 at 117:10-11). Femino testified that he did not know that 16 Rockland Street was Walker's home at the time, and he suspected him of trespassing. (Def. SMF Ex. 3 at 50:10-14; Pl. SMF Ex. 1 at 60:15-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Immediately after Walker entered the basement, a woman ran out of the basement screaming. (Def. SMF Ex. 3 at 57:24-58:3;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 4 at 56:8-57:18). The woman did not return and was never identified by the officers. (Def. SMF Ex. 3 at 58:11-68:2;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 4 at 57:19-24).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Femino entered the basement in pursuit of Walker. (Pl. SMF Ex. 1 at 60:22-61:4). It was dark in the basement, and he had to get out his flashlight. (Pl. SMF Ex. 1 at 61:2-10; Def. SMF Ex. 7 at 9). At some point, Femino drew his weapon, a .40-caliber Glock 23 semi-automatic pistol. (Pl. SMF Ex. 1 at 61:15-20). He testified that at that time, his assessment of the situation was that it had \"escalated from a trespass and drug use to an individual with a weapon fleeing the scene and invading a house that he had no authority to.\" (Def. SMF Ex. 3 at 93:20-94:1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Walker contends that Femino punched him on the right side of the head and on the left jaw, and he fell to the ground. Femino then handcuffed him. (Pl. SMF Ex. 3 at 117:19-22, 127:5-128:11). Walker testified that the whole time he was telling the officer that this was his house. (Pl. SMF Ex. 3 at 117:10-13, 128:11-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Walker contends that after he was handcuffed, multiple officers punched him and hit him with their pistols in the basement and then kicked him while he was on the floor. (Pl. SMF Ex. 1 at 128:14-23; Def. SMF Ex. 7 at 131:5-20;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 9 at Answers 3, 7). He testified that at some point he was knocked unconscious and that it had shaken his memory. (Def. SMF Ex. 7 at 123:3-10, 161:15-18 (\"I'm not exactly sure because of me losing my memory that night. Not lose but, you know, my memory\n   being shaken by me getting knocked out unconscious ....\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Femino testified that he ordered Walker to get on the ground, but instead of complying, Walker turned around to face him. (Pl. SMF Ex. 1 at 65:12-66:2). Femino testified that he could see Walker's hands were empty, but \"[i]t appeared he was in a fighting stance.\" (Pl. SMF Ex. 1 at 66:1-7). He holstered his weapon, grabbed Walker's arms, and pulled him to the ground to handcuff him. (Def. SMF Ex. 3 at 66:5-69:2). According to Femino, during this time Walker was \"screaming repeatedly that he ha[d] PTSD\" and was pulling away and resisting. (Def. SMF Ex. 3 at 68:3-6, 69:11-15, 73:15-17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Femino \"did a quick search on\" Walker in the basement, but did not find a weapon, drugs, drug paraphernalia, or any other contraband. (Def. SMF Ex. 3 at 50:19-51:14, 72:24-73:4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   According to the officers, Paradis entered the basement after Walker was handcuffed, and helped him to his feet. (Def. SMF Ex. 3 at 70:8-12;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 4 at 59:12-18). Bernier then arrived. He stood at the end of the hallway and asked Paradis if they were \"all set.\" (Def. SMF \u00b6 28;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 3 at 70:3-7;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. 4 at 63:14-19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Femino escorted Walker from the basement into the backyard. (Pl. SMF Ex. 1 at 76:6-10). Femino did not remember whether the backyard was lit by artificial light, but he testified that he could see. (Pl. SMF Ex. 1 at 76:1-5). He searched Walker again, because he \"wanted to make sure he didn't have any contraband or weapons still,\" and again found nothing. (Pl. SMF Ex. 1 at 76:11-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Femino then noticed a woman, who turned out to be Walker's mother, Anne Marie Wynter, in the open first-floor window of 16 Rockland Street. (Def. SMF Ex. 3 at 77:3-78:7). According to Femino, she asked what was going on, and he asked her if she knew Walker. (Def. SMF Ex. 3 at 78:6-9). She answered, \"That's my son Marcus.\" (Def. SMF Ex. 3 at 78:9-10).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Femino told her that he had said his name was Zane, and she answered that that was his Facebook name, and again identified him as Marcus. (Def. SMF Ex. 3 at 78:13-16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Wynter told the officers that he was bipolar and off his medication, and assured the officers that she would get him back on his medication. (Def. SMF Ex. 3 at 81:14-17). Femino testified that he offered to call EMS for a psychiatric evaluation, but Walker's mother declined. (Def. SMF Ex. 3 82:8-10). He testified that he told Wynter that the reason he chased Walker was that they \"had reason to believe he was smoking marijuana in a driveway.\" (Def. SMF Ex. 3 at 82:19-24). Femino then took off Walker's handcuffs and the officers all left the scene about a minute later. (Def. SMF Ex. 3 at 81:14-82:5). A search of the path of flight revealed no discarded weapons or contraband. (Def. SMF Ex. 3 at 81:1-6, 94:17-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   According to Wynter, after she told an officer (probably Femino) that Walker was her son, the officer told her that Walker had seen them and ran, and the officer asked her why he had run. (Def. SMF Ex. 8 at 30:8-12). She told him that her son didn't bother anybody and the officer said that that didn't make sense and asked her again why he had run away. (Def. SMF Ex. 8 at 30:12-16). She testified that when she asked the officers what he had done, the officers \"said he run, so they want to know why he run.\" (Def. SMF Ex. 8 at 30:19-21). She told the officers that maybe\n   he hadn't taken his medication. (Def. SMF Ex. 8 at 31:3-8).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Wynter, before they left, the officers told her that she \"could call the ambulance and let him go to the hospital now because they roughed him up pretty bad.\" (Def. SMF Ex. 8 at 31:14-21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Walker was not charged with any crime. (Def. SMF Ex. 7 at 172:18-23). A \"Field Interrogation/Observation/Frisk And/Or Search Report,\" signed by Femino, identifies Radcliffe Walker as an 18-year-old black male with \"Alias/Nickname[s]\" of \"Zane\" and \"Marcus.\" (Def. SMF Ex. 5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   It lists the reasons for the original stop as \"Drug Invest/Tresspass [sic]\" and the \"Reasons for Interrogation, Observation, Frisk or Search\" as \"Trespassing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Walker filed this action in state court on October 9, 2015, against John Does 1-4. On April 27, 2016, he filed an amended complaint identifying the defendants as Sergeant Douglas McGrath, Officer Thomas Bernier, Officer Frank Femino, and Officer Michael Paradis. (Am. Compl. \u00b6 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The amended complaint includes eight counts. It asserts claims for (1) arrest without probable cause in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act; (2) search without probable cause or reasonable suspicion, in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act; (3) false imprisonment; (4) malicious prosecution; (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress; (6) invasion of privacy in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 214, \u00a7 1B ; (7) assault and battery; and (8) excessive force. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-51).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendants removed the action to federal court on June 1, 2016. On September 29, 2017, the parties stipulated to dismissal of Counts 4 and 6 as to all defendants and Counts 7 and 8 as to McGrath.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   McGrath, Bernier, and Paradis moved for summary judgment on all claims, and Femino moved for partial summary judgment on Counts 1, 2, and 3. Walker opposed Femino's motion, but stipulated to the dismissal of (1) all claims arising under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act and (2) all claims against defendants McGrath, Bernier, and Paradis. Thus, the only remaining defendant is Femino, and the only remaining claims are the \u00a7 1983 claims set forth in Counts 1 and 2, and the state-law tort claims set forth in Counts 3, 5, 7, and 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The role of summary judgment is to \"pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof in order to see whether there is a genuine need for trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Mesnick v.

Indeed, one reasonable interpretation of that statement is that Femino inferred that plaintiff had a weapon simply because he fled. In any event, taking the record in the light most favorable to plaintiff, Femino's statement does not bolster the case for reasonable suspicion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, all four officers testified that they smelled burnt marijuana.

The officers did not see plaintiff or Lester actually smoking-though Femino testified that he saw \"smoke in the air\"-and it is undisputed that neither boy was actually found with marijuana. (Pl.

SMF Ex. 4 at Answer 10). Thus, even taking the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the Court must accept as true the contention that the officers smelled marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   That issue is of course complicated by the recent decriminalization of marijuana under state law. The Supreme Judicial Court has held that because the possession of one ounce or less of marijuana has been a civil, not a criminal, offense under Massachusetts law since 2008, \"the odor of burnt marijuana alone cannot reasonably provide suspicion of criminal activity\" under Massachusetts law to justify ordering a passenger out of a car.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

The issue in this \u00a7 1983 action is whether the officer can be sued for damages for violating the Fourth Amendment, not Article 14. Possession of more than one ounce of marijuana is a federal misdemeanor, although possession of a \"personal use amount\" is a civil violation.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20802\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 802\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (6), 812 Schedule 1(c)(10), 844(a), 844a;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2076.2\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 76.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For purposes of the motion for summary judgment, the Court must assume that plaintiff and Lester were not trespassing in a driveway, but walking down the sidewalk. There is no evidence that defendant reasonably believed plaintiff might have been armed. All that remains are the smell of burnt marijuana and plaintiff's sudden flight in response to the officer's statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court need not, however, decide that thorny constitutional question, but instead will proceed directly to the qualified immunity inquiry. This is not a motion to suppress in a criminal case, but an action for money damages under \u00a7 1983. To recover damages under \u00a7 1983 against a police officer, the constitutional right in question must be \"clearly established.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   And while the right to be free from seizure by the police absent a reasonable articulable suspicion is \"clearly established,\" the application of the right under the factual scenario presented here is not. In 2012, it was not \"clearly established\" that the combination of a smell of burnt marijuana and sudden flight, taken together, would not support a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop. As noted, before 2012, the Supreme Court had held that sudden, unprovoked flight in a high-crime area can constitute reasonable suspicion.\n   <em>\n    Wardlow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/#p125\">\n    528 U.S. at 124-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476180\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/119/#p125\">\n    120 S.Ct. 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And the First Circuit had held that the smell of burnt marijuana is enough.\n   <em>\n    Staula\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7639064\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/80/596/#p602\">\n    80 F.3d at 602\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While the SJC's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   may have cast doubt on\n   <em>\n    Staula\n   </em>\n   , the interaction between a state's guidance on its own constitution and the proper interpretation of the U.S. Constitution is murky at best. Even after\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   , the smell of burnt marijuana remains a factor to be considered in the totality of the circumstances, and it was not clearly established that plaintiff's flight and the smell of marijuana together could not rise to reasonable suspicion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In short, even taking the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiff, any constitutional violation would have been the result of defendant's \"reasonable but mistaken judgment\" about the quantum of evidence necessary to support a reasonable suspicion. Therefore, even assuming a constitutional violation, defendant would be entitled to qualified immunity as to the claim based on the foot pursuit.

SMF Ex. 3 at 57:24-58:3;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11671277\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/157/9/#p18\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 4 at 56:8-57:16;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11671277\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/157/9/#p18\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 8 at 46:22-47:10). Witnessing a screaming woman come out of the basement is information sufficient to support a belief on the part of the police officer that plaintiff did not have the right to be in the basement and was trespassing, despite plaintiff's protestations that it was his home. It was reasonable for defendant to infer from the woman's actions that something frightening and unusual had happened, and therefore to distrust any statements from plaintiff that he lived at that address. Therefore, there was probable cause for plaintiff's handcuffing and detention.

The Supreme Court has held that even after a defendant has been searched at the scene of his arrest, a second warrantless search at the police station can still be a lawful search incident to arrest as long as the interests from which the exception derives are still present.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, plaintiff was subject to a \"quick\" search in the basement, in the dark; when he was removed from the basement, defendant searched him again, \"because [he] wanted to make sure he didn't have any contraband or weapons still.\" (Def.
