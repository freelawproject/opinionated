R. Civ. P. 56. (Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 59.) Defendants Super T. Transport, Inc. and Layne Walters (\"Opposing Defendants\") filed a Response. (Defs.' Resp., ECF No. 60.) Plaintiff did not respond to Moving Defendants' Motion. For reasons explained below, I will not consider Opposing Defendants' Response on its merits. After consideration of the Motion, all proper related pleadings, and the case file, I grant Moving Defendants' Motion for the reasons set forth below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This action arises out of an accident involving three commercial motor vehicles on Interstate 25 near Highway 66. (Second Am. Compl., ECF No. 41 at 3-4; ECF No. 59 at 2-3; Ex. D to Reply to Mot. Summ. J., ECF No. 61-3 at 2-3.) For the purposes of Moving Defendants' Motion, the following facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On a snowy day with limited visibility, all three vehicles were traveling northbound\n   when Opposing Defendants' vehicle rear-ended Plaintiff's vehicle. (ECF No. 59 at 3; ECF No. 61-3 at 3-5.) Plaintiff avers in his Amended Complaint that Opposing Defendant Walter \"slammed into the rear of Plaintiff's vehicle,\" but Plaintiff does not detail Moving Defendants' role in the accident which caused Plaintiff's alleged harm. (ECF No. 41 at 4.) Moving Defendants' vehicle subsequently rear-ended Opposing Defendants' vehicle. (ECF No. 61-3 at 4.) Moving Defendants' vehicle did not make contact with Plaintiff's vehicle. (Ex. B to Mot. Summ. J., ECF 59-2 at 144:24-145:1.) The force from the impact between Moving Defendants' and Opposing Defendants' vehicles did not cause a secondary impact between Plaintiff's and Opposing Defendants' vehicles. (ECF No. 59-2 142:6-9; ECF No. 61-3 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

However, many district courts have addressed the issue, to which there have been myriad outcomes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    D.F. by &amp; through Amador v.

Cal. Oct. 30, 2017) (collecting cases). The court in\n   <em>\n    D.F.\n   </em>\n   summarized that the courts not allowing an opposing co-defendant to respond \"have relied on the idea that forcing a plaintiff to prosecute a trial, against that plaintiff's wishes, is 'contrary to the principle of Rule 56 that trials (or portions thereof) should be avoided when appropriate.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *11 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Blonder v.

Feb. 19, 2015) (\"the better rule allows defendants to oppose motions for summary judgment if they could be aggrieved by the outcome of the decision.\"). After review of those cases, I find that the dispositive question on this issue is whether the Opposing Defendants would be adversely affected were I to grant Moving Defendants' Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   To this point, I find that Opposing Defendants would not be adversely affected. In\n   <em>\n    Wood v.

Colo. 2015) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Scott v. Matlack, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9400162\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/39/1160/#p1166\">\n    39 P.3d 1160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1166 (Colo. 2002). \"When a party engages in the statute's proscribed conduct, the violation constitutes negligence per se if (1) a party is injured by the statutory violation, (2) the injury was of the type intended to be prevented by the statute, and (3) the injured party was one of the class meant to be protected by the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    Coosewoon v. Meridian Oil Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10513882\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/25/920/#p925\">\n    25 F.3d 920\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 925-26 (10th Cir. 1994).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Moving Defendants point to Plaintiff's deposition, where Plaintiff states that he has no evidence that: (1) Defendant Hamelin acted negligently; (2) Plaintiff's injuries were a result of the way Defendant Hamelin operated his vehicle; and (3) Defendant Hamelin violated any law in the operation of his vehicle. (ECF No. 59-2 at 145:2-18.) These assertions have not been rebutted by Plaintiff, and no evidence presented shows that there is a genuine dispute regarding these statements. Thus, summary judgment is appropriate for this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Defendant Manewiler's Alleged Vicarious Liability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In his Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that since Defendant Hamelin is an employee of Defendant Manewiler, that Defendant Manewiler is responsible for the \"injuries, damages, and losses suffered by Plaintiff [ ] as a result of the conduct of Defendant Hamelin.\" (ECF No. 41 at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"Under the respondeat superior doctrine, an employer is liable for torts of an employee acting within the scope of employment.\"\n   <em>\n    Stokes v. Denver Newspaper Agency, LLP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8306837\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/159/691/#p693\">\n    159 P.3d 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 693 (Colo. App. 2006). However, in this case, I have found that Plaintiff's claims against Defendant Hamelin are appropriate for summary judgment against Plaintiff. Thus, there is nothing to impute onto Defendant Manewiler and summary judgment is appropriate for this claim as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, IT IS ORDERED that Defendants Hamelin and Manewiler's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 59) is GRANTED, these Defendants are DISMISSED from this action, costs to be awarded to these Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Dated: April 30, 2018 in Denver, Colorado.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
