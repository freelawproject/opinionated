Sullivan, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs-seventy-one African-American current or former employees or applicants\n   for employment at defendant National Railroad Passenger Corporation (\"Amtrak\")-allege that Amtrak engaged in racial discrimination in its hiring, promotion, and disciplinary practices and created a hostile work environment. Plaintiffs bring this lawsuit on behalf of themselves and more than 11,000 African-American unionized Amtrak employees, former employees, and applicants for employment at Amtrak.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Pending before the Court are plaintiffs' motion for class certification, Amtrak's motions to exclude a number of plaintiffs' experts, Amtrak's motion to strike portions of the declarations filed by plaintiffs in support of class certification, Amtrak's motion to strike portions of plaintiffs' reply in support of their motion for class certification, and Amtrak's motion for partial summary judgement. As explained more fully below, because plaintiffs' class definitions make membership in plaintiffs' proposed class contingent on individualized merits determinations, and because plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden to establish that the claims of all class members are susceptible to common proof, plaintiffs' motion for class certification is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   . In addition, Amtrak's motion to exclude Jay Finkelman's expert report and testimony is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   , Amtrak's motion to exclude Thomas Roth's expert report and testimony is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   , Amtrak's motion to exclude Edwin Bradley and Liesl Fox's expert report and testimony is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   , Amtrak's motion to strike portions of plaintiffs' declarations is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part\n   </strong>\n   , Amtrak's motion to strike portions of plaintiffs' reply brief is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED in part and DENIED in part\n   </strong>\n   , and Amtrak's partial motion for summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In Part I of this opinion, the Court sets forth the procedural history of this litigation. Part II sets forth factual background regarding Amtrak's structure, hiring and promotions decisions, disciplinary system, and work environment. In Parts III and IV, the Court analyzes the admissibility of various experts and other evidence offered in support of plaintiffs' motion for class certification. Part V discusses whether class certification is warranted in this case and, finally, Part VI resolves Amtrak's partial motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs' disparate-impact claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Court Adjudicates A Series Of Dispositive Motions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The first round of dispositive motions was filed in May 2000 in response to the amended complaint. Although a number of labor-union defendants answered the amended complaint, a few moved to dismiss on the ground that the labor unions were not \"indispensable parties\" to the litigation and would be better joined in the liability phase of the lawsuit if plaintiffs prevailed on their discrimination claims against Amtrak.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Union Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 40; Union Defs.' Mot. to\n   Dismiss, ECF No. 48. Amtrak also moved to dismiss plaintiffs' class claims, arguing that no amount of discovery would render plaintiffs' proposed classes certifiable under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 47. Amtrak moved separately to dismiss the individual claims of plaintiffs on a variety of grounds or, in the alternative, for a more definite statement of those claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Shortly after those motions were briefed, plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction in order to enjoin Amtrak from \"discriminating, disciplining, intimidating, or in any other way retaliating\" against plaintiffs and class members.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Mot. for TRO/PI, ECF No. 51. The Court denied the request for temporary injunctive relief on June 12, 2000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, ECF No. 62. Thereafter, the Court granted the motions of the union defendants to be dismissed from the case, subject to their being rejoined in the event plaintiffs are successful on their liability claims and the union defendants are necessary to the finalization of an appropriate remedy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, ECF No. 63; Order, ECF No. 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A second amended complaint, filed August 22, 2000, added one named plaintiff and eliminated the labor-union defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Am.

The Court determined that dismissal of the class claims was premature given the early stage of the proceedings, particularly because additional discovery could permit plaintiffs to correct any fatal flaws in their class definition.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Later that year, the Court denied Amtrak's motion to dismiss plaintiffs' individual claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Campbell v.

The Court granted in part, however, Amtrak's motion for a more definite statement, ordering \"plaintiffs to include dates of alleged events, to the extent possible, in an amended complaint\" and \"to amend their pleading to include a more appropriate term to define the class, so as to exclude from the class definition the salaried managerial and professional positions that were included within the scope of the\n   <em>\n    McLaurin\n   </em>\n   class action discrimination case against Amtrak.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    at 28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint on January 3, 2002 to address the concerns set forth in the Court's dismissal Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Third Am.

Amtrak's Structure\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Amtrak provides passenger rail service through forty-six states and the District of Columbia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report of Drs. Edwin L. Bradley and Liesl M. Fox (\"Bradley/Fox Rep.\"), ECF No. 304-1 at 3. In the period after its inception in 1971, Amtrak was \"basically a centrally managed corporation in D.C.\" Dep. of Gilbert Mallery (\"Mallery Dep.\"), ECF No. 323-7 at 4. In 1994, Amtrak began creating \"strategic business units\" or \"SBUs\" with the goal of organizing the business \"around the services that existed\" as opposed to around a corporate headquarters. Dep. of Lee W. Bullock (\"Bullock Dep.\"), ECF No. 323-1 at 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Mallery Dep., ECF No. 323-7 at 4 (explaining that the SBUs were created \"to decentralize decision making\" and \"to move decision making in the corporation closer to the customers\"). While decisions relating to Amtrak's \"financial targets\" and \"ultimate strategy\" for the collective-bargaining process were still centered in Amtrak's corporate headquarters in the District of Columbia, other decisions, like those related to budgets and marketing, were delegated to the SBUs. Bullock Dep., ECF No. 323-1 at 9. For example, although the SBUs followed the \"broad\" human-resources policies set at the corporate level, each SBU had its own human-resource director and decisions with respect to \"hiring and firing\" employees were made at the SBU level. Mallery Dep., ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   No. 323-7 at 4-5. Thus, while Amtrak's corporate headquarters endeavored to ensure that any \"federal and company-wide mandates were complied with,\" \"the day-to-day decisions were delegated to the HR professionals in the business units\" who \"basically enforced, monitored, controlled to make sure those corporate policies were followed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The SBUs were disbanded in 2002, and Amtrak returned to a more traditional structure under which it was organized by functional department at the corporate level and by operating division at the field level. Decl. of Patricia Kerins (\"Kerins Decl.\"), ECF No. 328-7 \u00b6 28; Dep. of Edward Valentine Walker, III (\"Walker Dep.\"), ECF No. 309-4 at 3. Although Amtrak has eighteen departments, plaintiffs' expert Thomas Roth postulates that approximately ninety-seven percent of Amtrak's unionized workforce resides in one of five departments. Decl. and Expert Rep. of Thomas R. Roth (\"Roth Rep.\"), ECF No. 304-2 \u00b6\u00b6 8, 15. According to Mr. Roth, these five departments coincide with five functional categories-or \"craft\" groups-that are useful \"for analytical purposes\": operating, equipment maintenance, maintenance of way, clerical/on-board services, and security.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.

If the scores of each panel member vary, a consensus form may be used to reach a final score.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Unless the applicant has a very low score in a key competency, the applicant with the highest total score is usually recommended for the position.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In other cases, panel members may simply take notes during the interview to record their opinions about applicants' responses. Kerins Decl., ECF No. 328-7 \u00b6 15.

Discipline\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The collective-bargaining agreements usually contain rules governing the discipline process. Decl. of Charles E. Woodcock, III (\"Woodcock Decl.\"), ECF No. 322-7 \u00b6 23. The discipline process at Amtrak generally progresses as follows: (1) verbal warning; (2) written warning; (3) disciplinary hearing if a formal charge is filed; (4) a second disciplinary hearing if a formal charge is filed; and (5) a third disciplinary hearing if a formal charge is filed, which may in turn lead to termination.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20. Discipline decisions are generally made by and subject to the discretion of a local manager.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. The final decision to terminate an individual currently rests with the vice-president of human resources. Walker Dep., ECF No. 309-4 at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   This basic disciplinary process is similar for employees across all labor unions, though there are some limited differences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dep. of LaVerne Miller, ECF No. 308-6 at 34-35 (Amtrak corporate designee testifying that the claims and grievance procedures across craft groups are \"equal across the board\"); Woodcock Decl., ECF No. 322-7 \u00b6 23; Roth Rep., ECF No. 304-2 \u00b6 31. For example, each collective-bargaining agreement has \"just cause\" type provisions that afford employees the right to file an appeal of any disciplinary charges. Woodcock Decl., ECF No. 322-7 \u00b6 23;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Roth Rep., ECF No. 304-2 \u00b6 32 (explaining that the language of the grievance procedures vary between collective-bargaining agreements but that they all \"embody the principles of just cause, fair and impartial investigation, timeliness and [ ] other due process elements\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Despite these broad similarities, rules governing employee conduct may vary by position. Woodcock Decl., ECF No. 322-7 \u00b6 21. For example, passenger engineers are subject to certain federal regulations and operating rules that other employees are not.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21. Likewise, there may be different expectations for ticket clerks, who deal with customers on a daily basis, than for other employees whose jobs do\n   not require interaction with the public.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Dr. Bradley and Dr. Fox compared the rates of disciplinary charges between African-American and non-African-American unionized employees at Amtrak. Bradley/Fox Rep., ECF No. 304-1 at 16. They found that, of the 24,136 disciplinary charges issued to Amtrak employees during the analysis time period, 10,651 charges were brought against African-American employees, even though one would have expected only 8,924 charges to be brought against African-American employees during that same period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Notably, Dr. Bradley and Dr. Fox did not make these comparisons among employees that were similarly situated-for example, Dr. Bradley explained that his analysis did not consider the specific position or union to which the employee belonged, an employee's previous disciplinary history, the severity of the offense and discipline issued, or the employee's tenure at Amtrak.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bradley Dep., ECF No. 331-3 at 65-67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

Those observations consist of twenty bullet points that point out various problematic human-resources practices purportedly found at Amtrak.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-24. Nine of those bullets are summaries of testimony of Amtrak managers provided to Dr. Finkelman by plaintiffs' counsel in a document titled \"Selection Roulette,\" coupled with Dr. Finkelman's observations about the hiring practices described in those summaries.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-23,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Finkelman Dep. Ex. 7, ECF No. 319-3 at 130-136. Based on his review of the summaries, Dr. Finkelman concludes that Amtrak's employment policies and practices failed to accomplish the \"dual\" goals of human-resource management: to protect employees from discrimination, harassment, and retaliation while \"also protecting the organization[ ] from liability associated with improper policies and practices.\" Finkelman Rep., ECF No. 304-3 at 18. According to Dr. Finkelman, this failure is attributable to the fact (1) that Amtrak has \"few if any controls against intentional or inadvertent bias\" and (2) that Amtrak's hiring, promotional, and discipline policies are \"not consistent with generally accepted Human Resource Management practices nor with the professional requirements of Industrial-Organizational Psychology.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Finkelman Dep., ECF No. 319-3 at 4-5 (opining that, although Amtrak had overarching policies in place governing hiring, promotion, and employee discipline, individual managers departed from those policies in a manner that \"allowed for subjectivity and the potential for bias or discrimination\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2.

For example, although Dr. Finkelman purports to opine about the human-resource management practices at Amtrak, he testified that he did not review information critical to those opinions, including the depositions of any human-resource managers,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Finkelman Dep., ECF No. 319-3 at 5; documents related to any job-selection decisions by any Amtrak manager,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 23; personnel files or documents related to any discipline decision made by Amtrak,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   ; or Amtrak's discrimination complaint procedures or anti-discrimination training,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Likewise, although he agreed that the collective-bargaining agreements applicable to plaintiffs \"would have [an] impact\" on Amtrak's hiring, promotion, and disciplinary policies,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Finkelman Dep., ECF No. 319-3 at 25, he did not review those agreements prior to forming his opinions,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23. Dr. Finkelman also testified that, although he \"assume[s]\" that the consent decrees imposed in previous employment-discrimination litigation involving Amtrak had an impact \"on the hiring, promotional, or discipline policies at Amtrak,\" he \"didn't read the consent decrees\" and therefore did not \"know the exact changes that may have been made\" by Amtrak in response to the decrees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25. Rather, Dr. Finkelman testified that he only considered limited \"facts\" in forming his opinion that Amtrak's practices and policies were inconsistent with the goals of good human-resource management practices:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Q. You say \"Amtrak has not accomplished either objective, in my opinion.\" What's the basis for that statement?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   A. Well, the basis is the allegations that have been leveled by both the plaintiffs and perhaps other class members. In this matter, my review of the statements by supervisors as to how it is that they engage in selection or promotion. And I suppose also by the $16 million that Amtrak had to pay in one of the earlier phases of litigation, which seemed to suggest that there is a problem and some wrongdoing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Finkelman Dep., ECF No. 319-3 at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Even in his consideration of these limited \"facts,\" Dr. Finkelman did little to confirm their accuracy. For example, although he offers opinions on the selection process used by supervisors in hiring and promoting employees, Dr. Finkelman did not read the deposition testimony of any supervisors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Finkelman Dep., ECF No. 319-2 at 31. Instead, Dr. Finkelman relied on a document titled \"Selection Roulette\" in which plaintiffs' counsel \"summed up\" the testimony of select supervisors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5\n   (\"The information from managers came from the depositions that had taken place by managers. And I got that information through, I think, a document that's referred to as a \"selection roulette\" or something like that.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 28 (affirming that he relied on the document titled \"selection roulette\" for management testimony). Dr. Finkelman conceded that he took no steps to verify the accuracy or the representativeness of the information in the \"Selection Roulette\" document.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29. Indeed, Dr. Finkelman acknowledged that, \"to figure out what really took place\" at Amtrak, he would likely need to \"get into more detail.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29. For purposes of the report, Dr. Finkelman explained\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   From the descriptions that were given [in the \"Selection Roulette\" document],\n   <em>\n    assuming that they are reasonably accurate\n   </em>\n   , they are so far off in acceptable norm that I didn't need any more at this point. I will look more carefully, and if-if the roulette has misrepresented any of those issues or approaches, and if it didn't accurately characterize what managers said, you know, that would be a different story. But there are specific citations that are included, and yes, I will be looking at those.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Dr. Finkelman simply \"assum[ed]\" that plaintiffs' counsel \"accurately characterize[d]\" the testimony of Amtrak managers regarding their hiring practices instead of independently reviewing that testimony himself-and, critically, proceeded to formulate the opinions set forth in his expert report based, in part, on that unverified testimony. Such blind reliance on \"facts\" provided by plaintiffs' counsel-combined with his failure to review other sources of information that he conceded could have affected Amtrak's hiring, promotion, and disciplinary practices-renders his expert report unreliable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Parsi v.

Rather, when asked how he prepared his report, Dr. Finkelman testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   The process I use, which is the way I normally do it is, I go through all the documents initially to get a sense of it, and I tend to do that rapidly.

Instead, Amtrak argues that the Court should not consider Dr. Bradley and Dr. Fox's expert report and testimony because their opinions are unreliable. Amtrak's argument focuses on Dr. Bradley and Dr. Fox's use of extrapolated benchmarks to assess racial disparities in Amtrak's hiring and promotional decisions. Def.'s Mem. in Supp. Mot. to Exclude Bradley and Fox (Def.'s Bradley/Fox Mem.\"), ECF No. 331-1 at 26-32. Specifically, Amtrak argues that, before extrapolating benchmarks for African-American hiring and promotion from the applicant flow data, Dr. Bradley and Dr. Fox were required to ensure that the applicant flow data was representative of the applicant pool to which the extrapolated benchmarks would apply.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-29. Amtrak also argues that Dr. Bradley and Dr. Fox did not assess whether the sample size was sufficient to extrapolate the benchmarks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29. Finally, Amtrak contends that Dr. Bradley and Dr. Fox erred by treating each benchmark as an \"exact, known value\" rather than \"a sample estimate within a margin of error.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   While Amtrak points to potential problems with Dr. Bradley and Dr. Fox's extrapolation techniques, it fails to establish that these experts used a methodology so unreliable as to warrant exclusion of their report. There is no evidence that Dr. Bradley and Dr. Fox cherry-picked the data points in constructing the benchmarks for African-American availability where that data was not kept in the regular course by Amtrak. It is, of course, clear that the experts' extrapolated benchmarks in areas where no applicant flow data was available is less precise than Amtrak's actual applicant flow data. It is also clear, however, that plaintiffs may rely on reliable estimates when actual data is unavailable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    General Elec. Co. v.

For one, the declarations demonstrate that, although some supervisors exercised discretion in a discriminatory manner, others did not.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g\n   </em>\n   , Decl. of Garner Willis, ECF No. 304-8 at 297, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8 (attesting that one white manager \"screamed at [him] .... using racially charged language\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   but that his white supervisor removed the manager from the crew and sent him to training upon learning of the behavior). Moreover, the declarations establish that members of plaintiffs' putative subclasses experienced discrimination based on a number of different policies or practices. For example, plaintiffs submit four declarations from Amtrak employees in the engineering craft groups. As evidence of racial discrimination at Amtrak, one of those employees, Marcus Brunswick, points to the fact that he and another African-American applicant failed the \"subjective visual\" portion of a test required for an electrical traction position, whereas several white applicants took the test and passed. Decl. of Marcus Brunswick, ECF No. 304-8 at 282, \u00b6 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Brunswick also claims that it took him longer to be promoted than his white peers, who \"were promoted faster because of their race and because they received training and mentorship from white supervisors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 12. Another employee in the engineering craft group, Alfred Jones, states in his declaration that a supervisor retaliated against him after he complained to his union representative about the supervisor's racist comments. Decl. of Albert Jones, ECF No. 304-8 at 290, \u00b6\u00b6 6-8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Mr. Jones avers that his supervisor denied him higher pay rates, asked him to complete additional work, and eventually terminated him based on an insubordination charge.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-11. Although Mr. Jones was eventually reinstated after filing a claim for race discrimination, he continued to experience retaliatory conduct in the form of lower overtime pay, being forced to bid into lower-paying positions, and unfavorable job assignments that should have been given to less-senior white employees.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 14-18. As the declarations of Mr. Brunswick and Mr. Jones demonstrate, even employees in the same craft groups experienced discrimination in different ways at the hands of different individuals. Accordingly, the declarations suffer from the same defects as plaintiffs' statistical evidence-i.e., they do not establish that the putative class members are \"victim[s] of\n   <em>\n    one common\n   </em>\n   discriminatory practice.\"\n   <em>\n    Dukes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"244\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    564 U.S. at 345\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"245\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     4.

Class Cert. Mem., ECF No. 303 at 29. Ms. Hightower testified that her efforts to ensure appropriate consequences were meted out for egregious instances of racial discrimination were met with resistance, that Amtrak's Chief Executive Officer George Warrington asked her to \"slow the pace down\" and suggested she stop making \"aggressive\n   recommendations\" with respect to discipline, and that she was abruptly fired when she refused to comply with those suggestions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hightower Dep., ECF No. 309-9 at 11-15, 18, 34-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Ms. Hightower's testimony provides forceful evidence that, at least for the period during which Ms. Hightower was employed at Amtrak, Amtrak's leadership-and, in particular, Mr. Warrington-did not support Amtrak's corporate policy prohibiting racial discrimination. As compelling as Ms. Hightower's testimony is in this regard, it nonetheless fails to tie together the many discretionary employment decisions to which the putative class members were subject over the class period. For one, the testimony of one former employee who worked at Amtrak for less than two years does not reasonably raise an inference that Amtrak \"operated under a general policy of discrimination\" over the entire sixteen-year class period. Moreover, even for the period during which Ms. Hightower was employed at Amtrak, Ms. Hightower's testimony does not show that the disciplinary decisions of most supervisors at Amtrak were discriminatory. According to plaintiffs' experts, there were 24,136 charges for disciplinary charges over the 152-month period that was analyzed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Bradley/Fox Rep., ECF No. 304-1 at 29. Accordingly, during Ms. Hightower's 22-month tenure, approximately 3,500 disciplinary charges would have been brought on average. Ms. Hightower testified, however, that there were only twenty-five cases during her time at Amtrak where she \"felt that supervisors or managers had engaged in some kind of discriminatory or retaliatory activity\" that \"was not adequately addressed.\" Hightower Dep., ECF No. 309-9 at 33. Thus, Ms. Hightower's testimony does not provide \"significant proof\" that Amtrak operated under a general policy of discrimination.\n   <em>\n    Dukes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"246\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    564 U.S. at 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"247\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   The cases cited by plaintiffs in which courts have certified employment-discrimination classes confirm the Court's conclusions.

Plaintiffs claim that, aside from the disqualifying discipline criteria, these practices are components of Amtrak's \"overall selection process\" and cannot be separated for two reasons: (1) the practices are so \"interwoven\" that no single practice is \"determinative\" of the disparate outcomes; and (2) Amtrak failed to keep adequate records to permit analysis of particular practices.

J. Reply (\"Def.'s Summ. J. Reply\"), ECF No. 356 at 11. Amtrak further argues that plaintiffs have not met their burden to show that the incapable-of-separation exception should apply based on the paucity of data.

As an initial matter, although the parties used a joint database to avoid an \"intractable debate\" over how to merge Amtrak's various sources of employment data, there does not appear to be any serious dispute that the database alone did not contain sufficient information to engage in a statistical analysis of specific employment policies for disparate impact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

Pls.' Summ. J. Opp., ECF No. 343 at 15; Deere Rep., ECF No. 331-5 at 21. Some of these files include\n   applicant questionnaires, pre-employment tests and surveys, interviewer report forms, and interview questions. Deere Rep., ECF No. 331-5 at 21. As such, the data from these job files could have been used to evaluate the effect of a specific practice-for example, whether the use of a pre-employment test or ratings forms increased the likelihood that an African-American individual would not be selected for the position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   Plaintiffs respond that these job files could not be used to analyze different employment practices because the \"contents of each file were inconsistent and varied.\" Pls.' Summ. J. Opp., ECF No. 343 at 16 (providing examples of the inconsistency in documents contained in each file). Nonetheless, plaintiffs have not sufficiently shown that this information could not have meaningfully been used to evaluate different employment practices. For example, plaintiffs do not offer any testimony from their statistical experts that the files do not contain adequate data to conduct a reliable analysis. Indeed, plaintiffs' statistical expert acknowledged that the racial identity of thirty-five percent of the applicants in the applicant flow data was \"unknown,\" but argued that, from a methodological perspective, the missing information was not an insurmountable obstacle to his analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Expert Rebuttal Rep. of Edwin L. Bradley, ECF No. 342-6 at 18. Dr. Bradley did not provide any similar analysis or opinion with respect to the purportedly missing job file data. Accordingly, the Court finds that plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden to show that Amtrak's selection procedures are \"not capable of separation for analysis.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   Likewise, plaintiffs have not identified any specific disciplinary practices that they claim led to a disparate impact. Indeed, Dr. Bradley conceded that he did not attempt to study particular forms of discipline used at Amtrak:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-248\">\n   Q.

Because the Court does not rely on the portions of the declarations to which Amtrak objects, the Court does not address Amtrak's objections at this time. As for Amtrak's first argument, the Court finds that, to the extent plaintiffs' raised any purportedly new arguments in their reply, Amtrak sufficiently addressed those arguments in its motion to strike. Accordingly, because Amtrak will not be prejudiced by the Court's consideration of plaintiffs' reply memorandum, it denies Amtrak's motion to strike any \"new\" arguments.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-271\">\n    In any event, Dr. Finkelman's report and testimony do not show that managers or others at Amtrak applied their discretion in any common way that caused racial disparities.
