McFADDEN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Plaintiff in this case, Daniel DeFraia, seeks specific records under the Freedom of Information Act related to the Central Intelligence Agency's former detention and interrogation program. The requested records have been separated into two categories, and both parties have moved for partial summary judgment on the first category, as the CIA continues to process and produce records from the second. I conclude that the CIA is entitled to partial summary judgment, because the parties have agreed to narrow the FOIA requests at issue to specified contracts and the records \"cited in\" a specified Senate committee report, and the CIA has produced all of the required records in those agreed-upon sets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In December 2014, Mr. DeFraia sent the CIA a FOIA request seeking \"a) all CIA contracts with Bruce Jessen, b) all CIA contracts with James Mitchell, c) contract information between Jessen and Mitchell, d) contracts between the CIA and Mitchell, Jessen[,] and AMP Associates, and e) [ ] all information related to [ ] Jessen and [ ] Mitchell and their interaction with detainees including interrogation.\" Compl. 4; Decl. of Antoinette Shiner, Def.'s Mot.

In May 2015, Mr. DeFraia sent another request asking for five categories of records that had been \"cited in\" or \"stated in\" the declassified portion of the report of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on that program.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The CIA contends that it has fully complied with its pertinent FOIA obligations, supported by a declaration from Ms. Antoinette Shiner, the Information Review Officer for the CIA's Litigation Information Review Office. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 1 (Shiner Decl.). But Mr. DeFraia argues that the CIA's description of its search methodology is legally inadequate, and that the CIA has failed \"to follow-up on clear leads indicating the existence of additional [responsive] agency records.\" Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. at 9; Supp. Decl. of Daniel DeFraia, Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. (Supp. DeFraia Decl).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also asks for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review to verify that the CIA has properly invoked two FOIA exemptions. Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. at 13-15. Based on the governing language of Mr. DeFraia's requests, I conclude that the CIA has provided every legally required record, and that no basis exists for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the CIA's work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The CIA Has Produced the \"Contracts\" Listed in the 2014 Request\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The parties have expressly agreed, in a document signed by attorneys for both sides, that the scope of the first portion of Mr. DeFraia's 2014 Request is limited to \"contracts between (1) the CIA and (2) Bruce Jessen and/or James Mitchell and/or Mitchell Jessen &amp; Associates from 2001-2009 that relate to the CIA's rendition, detention, and interrogation program,\" with specific, agreed-upon redactions. Joint Status Report at 2. Immediately after the parties agreed to this narrowed scope, the CIA produced all of the CIA contracts at issue. Shiner Decl. \u00b6 22. The contracts were redacted as specified in the Joint Status Report, and the CIA invoked no additional exemptions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1267816,3518669\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/656/724/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mr. DeFraia still wants to enforce the scope of his original 2014 Request, which was somewhat broader, and he therefore demands \"additional documents\" to which the contracts \"directly refer.\" Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. at 10 (\"[t]he portion of the ... 2014 Request at issue herein sought \"\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   contract information\"). But it is the Joint Status Report, not Mr. DeFraia's original request, that controls.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4)(A)(viii)(II)(bb), (6)(B)(ii) (both referring to a FOIA requestor's ability to later \"limit the scope of the request\");\n   <em>\n    Gilman v.

Under the plain language of the agreement, that right does not extend beyond the specified contracts. The Joint Status Report defines the \"scope of the [2014] Request\" as specific \"contracts,\" and immediately explains that certain information will be redacted from those \"records ... with the understanding that Plaintiff does not waive the right to seek copies of these records that may include some of the redacted information in the agency's subsequent record releases or in this action.\" Joint Status Report at 2. The agreement goes on to say that the CIA will produce \"\n   <em>\n    records\n   </em>\n   responsive to this category,\" and \"[a]fter reviewing\n   <em>\n    those records\n   </em>\n   in their redacted form, Plaintiff reserves the right to request that CIA produce certain redacted material.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325782\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/32/1/#p22\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325782\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/32/1/#p22\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphases added). The only reasonable interpretation of this language is that Mr. DeFraia has retained a right to ask the CIA to produce materials redacted from the listed contracts-the \"records\" to which the agreement repeatedly refers-and nothing further. In other words, we are only dealing with specified \"contracts.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325782\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/32/1/#p22\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325782\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/32/1/#p22\">\n    at 2-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Because Mr. DeFraia has already narrowed the scope of his FOIA request, his assertion that the CIA failed \"to follow-up on clear leads indicating the existence of additional agency records\" must fail.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. at 9. Mr. DeFraia points to five sets of documents referenced in the CIA contracts, which he says are illustrative of \"obvious indications that [the] CIA omitted responsive records.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325782\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/32/1/#p22\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325782\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/32/1/#p22\">\n    at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But none of those documents constitute a contract-or part of a contract-that the CIA has failed to produce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   A contract, in simple terms, consists of mutually agreed-upon words that create obligations.\n   <em>\n    See Contract,\n   </em>\n   Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (\"An agreement between two or more parties creating obligations that are enforceable or otherwise recognizable at law ... [or] [t]he writing that sets forth such an agreement.\"). In Mr. DeFraia's first example, he points to 11 \"applicable documents\" listed in a 2005 \"Statement of Work,\" which he claims \"were to be integral outlines and guides of contract performance.\" Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. at 11;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325782\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/32/1/#p22\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. 2 at 6. But the \"Applicable Documents\" that the contract lists amount to independent rules and guidebooks for working for the CIA, not part of the obligation-creating contract language itself. Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. Ex. 2 at 6 (listing, among other things, a \"Contractor Classification Guide,\" a \"National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual,\" and a CIA \"Directive\" on \"Protecting Sensitive Compartmented Information with Information Systems.\"). The 2005 Statement of Work also listed various deliverables that the contractors would provide, including \"six reports or categories of reports,\" a \"Management Plan,\" a \"Concept of Operations,\" \"quarterly technical reports,\" and \"monthly financial reports.\" Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. at 11-12. Mr. DeFraia also thinks these deliverables should have been produced. But deliverables are the fruit of an obligation, not obligation creators themselves, and are therefore distinct from the contract as such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Mr. DeFraia's second example does include actual contract language, but the CIA has already produced it. He points to \"a Statement of Work from the CIA Contracting Officer to Dr. James Mitchell, dated 8 August 2001,\" Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. at 12, which states that the CIA in \"Appendix A\" will \"provide a list of specific variables to be included\" in completing Project Objective Task I (an assessment of \"methods and strategies\" for conducting psychological assessments in difficult situations). Supp. DeFraia Decl. Ex. 4 at 2;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply at 5 (claiming that \"at least\" this document counts as part of a contract, under a contracts-only reading of the Joint Status Report). On April 3, 2018, I issued\n   an order requiring the CIA to produce Appendix A or explain why release was not required. Order, ECF No. 33. On April 18, 2018, the CIA filed a Notice of Compliance with this Order, explaining that Appendix A had already been produced, and providing a copy to the Court. ECF No. 35. Thus, Mr. DeFraia's objections regarding the 2001 Statement of Work have been satisfied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Mr. DeFraia's third, fourth, and fifth examples all point to \"deliverables\" that these contracts required. Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. at 12-13. But a party can produce a contract for apples, in full, without handing over a single apple, because the deliverables are not part of the contract itself. Accordingly, the CIA has produced all the records that Mr. DeFraia requested under the first part of his 2014 Request, fully complying with its obligations under FOIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The CIA Has Produced the Required Records From the 2015 Request\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The result in the 2015 Request is similarly controlled by the language of Mr. DeFraia's request. That request sought five categories of records that had been \"cited in\" or \"stated in\" a certain Senate Report. Shiner Decl. Ex. H at 40. The CIA has identified 13 documents in those five categories, withholding one document in full and producing the remaining 12 with redactions under several claimed FOIA exemptions. Shiner Decl. \u00b6 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mr. DeFraia argues that the CIA ignored \"clear leads that additional documents exist,\" pointing to specific language in the fourth sub-heading of his 2015 Request. Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. at 10. But the language does not back up his claim. In that request, Mr. DeFraia sought \"[a]ll emails, letters, and reports, and other sources of information cited in footnote 1029, 1030, and 1031 of the Senate ... [R]eport[,] especially information related to the July 25, 2006 'Justification For Other Than Full and Open Competition, Contractor.' \" Shiner Decl. Ex. H. Mr. DeFraia emphasizes that he sought \"all ... sources of information cited\" in the three footnotes, \"especially information related\" to the 2006 \"Justification\" document. Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. at 10. On this basis, Mr. DeFraia would have the CIA produce information that was\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   specifically cited in the footnotes, undertaking \"follow-up search actions to locate the relevant records and files associated with [the] Justification.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325782\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/32/1/#p22\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But to look for information not cited would go beyond the request, which sought \"[a]ll emails, letters, and reports, and other sources of information\n   <em>\n    cited\n   </em>\n   in\" three specific footnotes. Shiner Decl. Ex. H. It is true that Mr. DeFraia \"especially\" requested information related to the Justification, but \"especially\" modified his \"request\" for \"sources of information ...\n   <em>\n    cited.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325782\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/32/1/#p22\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).
