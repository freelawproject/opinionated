The Court has carefully reviewed said Motions, the entire court file and is otherwise fully advised in the premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In the above-styled cause, Plaintiff Hamilton Group Funding, Inc. (hereinafter \"Plaintiff\") alleges that Defendant Gerard Anthony Basel (hereinafter \"Defendant\") disclosed Plaintiff's internal communications, to non-party Daniel Lucas (hereinafter \"Lucas\") and his counsel for use in his state court action against Plaintiff and others. Based on this belief about Defendant's involvement in Lucas's possession of these documents, Plaintiff asserts two remaining counts against Defendant, Count I, for violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Count\n   II, for violation of the Electronic Communications Privacy Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202510\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , pursuant to its provision of a private cause of action at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202520\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2520\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and also for violation of the Stored Communications Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , pursuant to its provision of a private cause of action at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202707\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Stored Communications Act is contained within the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff is a mortgage lending firm offering residential mortgage products.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant was hired by Plaintiff as an IT consultant in January of 2014 and promoted in April of 2015 to Assistant Vice President, Director of Information Systems, a position he retained until his resignation on May 5, 2016. Lucas was a co-founder of Plaintiff and served as the CFO and President until his April, 2014 termination. Following his termination, Lucas initiated a lawsuit, currently pending in the Circuit Court of the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit, in and for Broward County, Florida, against Plaintiff and Plaintiff's officers and managers (hereinafter \"Lucas lawsuit\"). In the course of this state court action, Defendant assisted Plaintiff's attorneys with discovery, executed an affidavit, and sat for a deposition on April 6, 2016. On April 18, 2016, during Lucas's deposition of Plaintiff's CEO Mark Korell, one of the defendants in that lawsuit, seven exhibits were marked with dates subsequent to Lucas's termination and which Plaintiff had not produced to Lucas in discovery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 32-7 (hereinafter \"Korell Exhibits\"). One of these documents is an offer letter to Michael Clark; the others consist of emails, frequently involving Mr. Korell and at times discussing Lucas. The precise nature of these communications and their relevance to the claims at issue in Lucas's lawsuit are not material to the resolution of the issues at stake in the above-styled cause, and thus the Court will not further describe their contents. But, the surfacing of these documents led to Plaintiff's investigation of a potential security breach related to these exhibits and ultimately to its request that Defendant attend a meeting. Defendant agreed to attend this meeting, but on the evening before the meeting, he resigned with no prior notice on May 5, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff uses the Microsoft 365 platform to run its computer systems, including e-mails and daily activities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prior to his resignation, Defendant had full and complete global administrative rights to Plaintiff's computer systems and servers. During Defendant's employment with Plaintiff, he received two versions of an Employee Handbook. Some relevant portions in the 2014 Employee Handbook (DE 32-4) from\n   the section \"Use of Communications &amp; Computer Systems &amp; Information Security,\" state in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Hamilton Group Funding, Inc. has provided these computer and communications systems to help conduct business. Although limited personal use of the Company's systems is allowed to the extent it does not violate any Company policy or interfere with job performance, no use of these systems should ever conflict with the primary business purpose for which they have been provided, with the Company's ethical responsibilities or with applicable laws and regulations. Each user is personally responsible to ensure that these guidelines are followed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   No employee may access, or attempt to obtain access to another employee's computer systems without appropriate authorization.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   DE 32-4, pp. 25-26. The revised 2015 Employee Handbook (DE 32-5) included some of the exact same language, which will be quoted here again, as well as some additional sections. Under the section, \"Technology Use and Privacy,\" in language virtually identical to that appearing in the 2014 Employee Handbook, this revised version states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   HGF has provided these computer and communications systems to help conduct business. Although limited personal use of the Company's systems is allowed to the extent it does not violate any Company policy or interfere with job performance, no use of these systems should ever conflict with the primary business purpose for which they have been provided, with the Company's ethical responsibilities or with applicable laws and regulations.

Tuley (hereinafter \"Tuley\") of Net Evidence, Inc., to perform a computer forensic investigation as to whether there had been a security breach in Plaintiff's systems. The Parties are greatly at odds over the interpretation of Tuley's findings, but not with the findings themselves. Thus, the Court sets forth statements within his Expert Witness Report (DE 32-3) which the Court deems relevant to its analysis of the instant Motions (DE Nos. 31 &amp; 33). Tuley concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   The only location the Korell Exhibits were found was inside the mailbox of Mr. Korell. This indicated they were not at that time saved or forwarded to another mailbox or user drive space of [Plaintiff]. Additionally, I reviewed audit and log data from the Office 365 system and Mark Korell's system to identify any accessing of his files or system. The log data did not show any access from other user accounts to Mark Korell's information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   DE 32-3, \u00b6 9. During his review of users of Plaintiff's system, Tuley located a user, Keri Ochs (hereinafter \"Ochs\"), Plaintiff's former Vice President and Head of Information Systems, whose employment ended in April of 2014, but who, nevertheless, at the time of his investigation in April of 2016, still retained full and complete global administrative rights to Plaintiff's systems. Tuley's report observes that these credentials remaining active presented an \"unsecure 'open door' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202707\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202707\">\n    at \u00b6 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and he notes that an unidentified party using her username and credentials accessed her mailbox\n   on June 9, 2015, and, again, as recently as February 9, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202707\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202707\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 16, 19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Tuley also analyzed Defendant's laptop and included several paragraphs about his related findings:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   My forensic inspection of [Defendant]'s laptop revealed that, prior to returning the laptop, [Defendant], or someone acting on his behalf, had deleted the \"user directory\" and his personal profile from the computer. Additionally, I determined that on or about April 22, 2016, between the hours of 10:00 pm and 11:59 pm (based on the clock settings in the laptop), [Defendant], or someone acting on his behalf, deleted a number of files (including documents and other data) from the laptop's hard drive while at the same time multiple USB Removable Flash Drives were connected to the laptop.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Specifically, a SanDisk Cruzer Glide USB Flash Drive and a Silicon Power USB Drive were plugged into on the laptop between 10:00 p.m. and 11:59 p.m. on April 22, 2016, i.e., during the time files were being deleted from the laptop hard drive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   I was not able to recover any of the files deleted from the laptop's hard drive or to determine what may have been downloaded to any of the USB flash drives.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   DE 32-3, \u00b6\u00b6 30-32. Finally, while Tuley was not able to arrive at any definitive conclusions about the security breach, he provides this assessment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   Based on my investigation, it is my determination that someone using Ochs' credentials accessed Ochs' OneDrive and mailbox on [Plaintiff]'s computer system well after Ochs' resignation from [Plaintiff]. Whoever logged into [Plaintiff]'s computer system using Ochs' credentials would have had access to all of the emails of any [Plaintiff] employee, including Mark Korell, Mike Clark, and John Kantor, as well as full access to any other documents or information [Plaintiff] maintained within [Plaintiff]'s Microsoft 365 account.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [Defendant] with his credentials could have accessed the entire email system or could have used Ochs' credentials such that use of Ochs' credentials to access [Plaintiff]'s computer system is not the only method by which someone with global administrative access credentials could have obtained the Korell Exhibits.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202707\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202707\">\n    at \u00b6\u00b6 36-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Though Defendant was deposed, he frequently asserted his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself. U.S. Const. amend. V. As noted above, both the CFAA and SCA are primarily criminal statutes, which also include the private civil causes of action asserted in the above-styled cause. The Court will discuss below the appropriate inference to be drawn as to Defendant's answers, but includes in this description of the factual basis for the instant Motions (DE Nos. 31 &amp; 33) a few citations to Defendant's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Tuley's report, as quoted above, included some findings explaining how Defendant's user profile and some files had been deleted. At his deposition, Defendant was asked whether those actions were taken \"in order to hide any trace of [his] providing [Lucas] with confidential [Plaintiff] documents in order to assist him [Lucas] with the prosecution of his lawsuit against [Plaintiff]?\" and he answered, \"No.\" DE 32-1, p. 55, ll. 13-18. He stated that he did not recall what documents he downloaded to the USB drives and that he also did not recall what documents he deleted on April 22, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202707\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ll. 21-25. Defendant was asked several detailed and several broad and overarching questions to which he asserted his Fifth Amendment right. Some examples include: \"Then why did you decide to provide documents to [Lucas\n   ] in secret outside of the formal discovery process in the state court action?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , p. 70, ll. 4-9); \"Did you provide [Lucas], Mr. Karns, Mr. Shrouder [Lucas's counsel in his state court case, as well as Defendant's counsel in this case], anyone at Spink &amp; Associates [counsels' firm] or any third party, with either copies of those documents [the Korell Exhibits], or enough information about those documents so that they would be able to so specifically request that they be produced at a hearing in the state court action?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   p. 114, ll. 18-24). The Court includes these examples merely as an indication of the types of questions to which Defendant asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. He provided this answer to numerous substantive and specific questions about his involvement with the Korell Exhibits. Further, Defendant responded \"No.\" to the question, \"Did anyone in senior management, Mr. Korell, Mr. Clark, Mr. Kantor, Karen Loney, anyone you considered a senior executive in the company or senior management in the company, did anyone ever authorize you to provide documents to [Lucas] outside of the formal discovery process in the state court action after the lawsuit was initiated?\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202707\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202707\">\n    , p. 74\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , l. 20-p. 75, l. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(a), summary judgment is appropriate \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" The party seeking summary judgment\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   always bears the initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, which it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

This principle is clearly applicable to the claims in this case because they have been brought under criminal statutes, which also provide for civil claims. Though an individual does not lose the Fifth Amendment right in the civil context, the Supreme Court declined to extend a prior holding in\n   <em>\n    Griffin v. California\n   </em>\n   , that no inference of guilt must be drawn in a criminal case based on the defendant's decision not to testify, to testimony in civil cases.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 316-19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6176514\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/425/308/#p316\">\n    96 S.Ct. 1551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1524757\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/380/609/\">\n    380 U.S. 609\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1524757\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/380/609/\">\n    85 S.Ct. 1229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1524757\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/380/609/\">\n    14 L.Ed.2d 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1965) ).

The Eleventh Circuit has described the permissible response in cases such as that of the Defendant's invocation of his Fifth Amendment right, at his deposition and in response to discovery requests in the above-styled cause, as permitting the inference \"that the answers to the questions would not have been favorable to the [individual] asserting the privilege.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

An adverse inference based on Defendant's decision not to answer questions put to him at his deposition is permissible. The Court will thus infer that the answers to questions to which Defendant invoked his right not to testify against himself would not be favorable to Defendant. But, the Court is not permitted and will not rest any findings against Defendant on the fact of his assertion of his privilege alone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Court must take up additional legal issues raised by the Parties' instant Motions (DE Nos. 31 &amp; 33) before examining whether all the evidence, including the adverse inference drawn against Defendant for his assertion of his Fifth Amendment right, yields a finding of liability for Plaintiff on its CFAA and SCA claims. First among these issues, the Court will address one of the bases for summary judgment Defendant raises in his Motion (DE 33), which the Court finds has been recently and indisputably resolved by binding authority from the Eleventh Circuit. As noted above, the CFAA defines loss in \u00a7 1030(e)(11). Prior to the decision in\n   <em>\n    Brown Jordan Int'l, Inc. v. Carmicle\n   </em>\n   , courts struggled to ascertain the precise parameters of the loss definition quoted above. Noting that the interpretation of this definition was an issue of first impression in the Eleventh Circuit, the court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   The plain language of the statutory definition includes two separate types of loss: (1) reasonable costs incurred in connection with such activities as responding to a violation, assessing the damage done, and restoring the affected data, program system, or information to its condition prior to the violation; and (2) any revenue lost, cost incurred, or other consequential damages incurred because of interruption of service. The statute is written in the disjunctive, making the first type of loss independent of an interruption of service.... \"Loss\" includes the direct costs of responding to the violation in the first portion of the definition, and consequential damages resulting from interruption of service in the second. Thus, under a plain reading of the statute, [the plaintiff's] loss from [defendant's] violation of the CFAA does not need to be related to an interruption of service in order to be compensable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12140250\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/1167/#p1173\">\n    846 F.3d 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1173-74 (11th Cir. 2017) (\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(11) (further citation omitted). Thus the type of loss claimed by Plaintiff, for example, for services\n   such as those performed by Tuley, whether or not an interruption of service occurred, is the type of loss that is covered by the CFAA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The next interpretative question plaguing the analysis of CFAA elements also requires the Court to apply a seminal Eleventh Circuit opinion to the issue. A violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(C) requires the violator to either \"intentionally access[ ] a computer without authorization\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   [to] exceed[ ] authorized access, and thereby obtain[ ] ... information from a protected computer.\" (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1030 (e)(6) (defining exceeds authorized access, as quoted\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ). With respect to Defendant, the relevant portion relates to his allegedly exceeding authorized access because he could not be said to have accessed without authorization since the Parties agree that he had global administrative rights to access Plaintiff's system at the time in his employment at which the alleged violations occurred. In\n   <em>\n    Enhanced Recovery Co., LLC v. Frady\n   </em>\n   , the court aptly described the conundrum in which courts have been placed in attempting to correctly apply this definition when it explained the competing views of this term:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   [A]pplication of this term and its definition have bedeviled the courts. Some have interpreted the definition broadly, reading into it a theory of agency, such that an employee's authorization is revoked, and thus she \"exceeds authorized access,\" whenever she obtains information with a subjective intent that is unlawful or contrary to her employer's interests, even though the employee actually had authorization to access the information.... Other courts, including the majority of district courts in this Circuit that have considered the question, have adopted a narrower definition of \"exceeds authorized access.\" ... Under the narrow interpretation, an employer who has actually been granted access to information does not \"exceed authorized access\" by virtue of the employee's subjective intent or by subsequently violating computer policies on the use of the information.... The Court finds the reasoning in favor of the narrow interpretation significantly more persuasive.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   No. 3:13-cv-1262-J-34JBT,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201470852\">\n    2015 WL 1470852\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (S.D.

Va. 2009) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The question which remains for the Court is whether Plaintiff has provided undisputed evidence to meet its burden with respect to its CFAA claim and its SCA claim. As to the four elements of the CFAA claim, Plaintiff must establish that Defendant: \"(1) intentionally 'accessed' a computer, (2) lacked authorization or exceeded his authorized access to the computer, (3) obtained information from the computer, and (4) caused a loss of at least $5,000.00 to [Plaintiff].\"\n   <em>\n    Clarity Services, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3927459\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/698/1309/#p1313\">\n    698 F.Supp.2d at 1313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (M.D. Fla. 2010) (\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201030\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g); (a)(2)(C) ). The Court recognizes that Plaintiff has sought summary judgment only as to liability and not as to the amount of loss. However, the fourth element of this claim requires, at this summary judgment stage, that there be no material dispute of fact about that fact that Plaintiff has suffered at least $5,000.00 of loss. As noted above, the type of loss Plaintiff is claiming has been found in this Circuit to be a type contemplated by this statute. Certainly, Plaintiff's Complaint alleges that Defendant's conduct has cost it damages in at least this amount.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 1, \u00b6\u00b6 85, 94. And, Defendant duly denies the allegations set forth in these paragraphs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 20, \u00b6 1. And, there the story ends. Neither Party has said aught else about the amount of loss in the summary judgment pleadings. Rather, Plaintiff has stated no facts and offered no evidence of its damages. The Court is thus compelled to find that there is a material dispute of fact about element four in that Plaintiff has not met its burden of offering any proof by which the Court could ascertain that its loss in relation to Defendant's conduct has been at least $5,000.00. Plaintiff has plead this loss amount. Defendant has denied it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   But, the Court will examine the other three elements of Plaintiff's CFAA claim in order to determine if any disputes\n   of material fact would prevent the Court from ruling in favor of either Plaintiff or Defendant at this stage on these other factors. Defendant contends that Plaintiff's argument at summary judgment rests only on the fact that the Court must infer that the answers to questions, such as those cited above, at his deposition, are unfavorable to him due to the fact that he refused to answer and instead asserted his right against self-incrimination pursuant to the Fifth Amendment. The Court does, as it must, draw this adverse inference against Defendant. He has refused to answer questions about whether he has given the Korell Exhibits to Lucas or to Lucas's lawyers. Under\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   , in this Circuit, this conduct, which would contravene existing computer policies of Plaintiff, as cited above, would thus exceed his authorized access.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   I. Such conduct is intentional access of a computer, and would constitute obtaining information from a computer. But, Defendant is incorrect that Plaintiff's only evidence is the adverse inferences drawn against him. Other undisputed facts in this case support the conclusion to which the adverse inference against Defendant leads. First, there is no dispute as to what happened at the Korell deposition. The Korell Exhibits were introduced, and Defendant does not dispute the fact that they were never given to Lucas in discovery. He appears to argue that they\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   have been given to Lucas in that state court proceeding, but that is a question about which this Court need offer no opinion as it has no bearing upon the issues which must be decided here. No one disputes that these Korell Exhibits consist of documents, as previously noted, many of which are emails, which are internal documents of Plaintiff with no public source that any Party has brought to the attention of the Court or even suggested. Plaintiff also provides the investigation of Tuley who attempted to determine the source of the leak of these internal documents. Defendant does not dispute Tuley's findings. He does not offer a competing expert who calls into question any of these findings. He focuses the Court's attention on certain paragraphs, believing that some isolated statements support Plaintiff's inability to pinpoint with complete certainty how the leak of its internal documents has occurred. And, the Court would agree with Defendant that, apart from the adverse inference it is required to draw against him, the information Plaintiff learned about possible sources of the leak would not be sufficient to meet its burden. But, all of these facts taken together permit the Court to find that there are no disputed facts as to all elements-except for the element that the damages are $5,000.00 or more-which Plaintiff is required to prove to establish liability under the CFAA. Additionally, as to liability under the SCA, in that statute a damage amount is not an element of the claim. As cited above, the elements of this violation are contained in the statute and require that Defendant \"intentionally accesses without authorization a facility through with an electronic communication service is provided\" or \"intentionally exceeds authorization to access that facility\" \"and thereby obtains, alters, or prevents authorized access to a wire or electronic communication while it is in electronic storage in such system.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202701\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The Eleventh Circuit has unequivocally stated that Microsoft 365, a cloud-based service, through which emails are sent and received, and which was the system Plaintiff used, \"is a facility through which an electronic communication service is provided,\" for the purposes of the SCA.\n   <em>\n    Brown Jordan Int'l, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12140250\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/846/1167/#p1173\">\n    846 F.3d 1167\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1177 n.4 (11th Cir. 2017).

The Court has not only relied on the adverse inference pursuant to Defendant's exercise of his Fifth Amendment Right not to incriminate himself, but has considered all of the evidence in conjunction with the presumption the Court is required to draw against him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   DE 92, p. 17 (\"But, the Court is not permitted and will not rest any findings against Defendant on the fact of his assertion of his privilege alone.\"). Defendant cannot now be heard to assert arguments which no evidence in the record supports, and the conclusion of the related ongoing state case, discussed in more detail in the Court's prior Order (DE 92), cannot change Defendant's failure to offer that evidence in this case. The Court has already set forth in detail its legal conclusions regarding binding precedent in this Circuit, as well as its interpretation of said precedent.
