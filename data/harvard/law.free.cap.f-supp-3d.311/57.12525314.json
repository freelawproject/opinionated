Introduction\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Barry Farm is a historic public housing property located east of the Anacostia River in Southeast District of Columbia (\"D.C.\"). The property was purchased in 1867 and developed as one of the first communities for African-American homeowners after the Civil War. In 2006, the D.C. Council approved a redevelopment plan to transform Barry Farm from a public housing property into a mixed-income, mixed-use community. Pursuant to the redevelopment plan, the existing 444 Barry Farm units will be demolished and over 1,000 mixed-use, mixed-income units will be built in their place. The D.C. Housing Authority (\"DCHA\") hired private developers Preservation of Affordable Housing (\"POAH\") and A &amp; R Development (\"A &amp; R\") to implement the approved plan (collectively, \"defendants\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiffs are individuals who will be displaced and organizations that will be affected by the redevelopment plan. The plaintiffs' four-count complaint alleges that the defendants' redevelopment plan discriminates against Barry Farm tenants based on their familial status in violation of: (1) the Fair Housing Act (\"FHA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203601\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; and (2) the D.C.

Their allegations that the defendants designed, begun implementing, and adopted a redevelopment plan that discriminates against them are belied by both the July 2014 letter and the Zoning Commission's Order approving the first-stage PUD application. Thus, their allegations are not supported by the very facts that they reference. While the plaintiffs are deservedly anxious about their ability to return to their community, the unit mix is clearly not final; it has neither been proposed to the Zoning Commission, nor adopted by it. As stated in the July 2014 letter, \"[t]he bedroom count for the 344 Barry Farm/Wade Road replacement public housing units ...\n   <em>\n    will be\n   </em>\n   determined by the bedroom needs of the returning DCHA households.\" 2014 Letter, Compl.

Unlike the defendants' plan in\n   <em>\n    Mt. Holly\n   </em>\n   , it is merely speculative that the possible unit mix described in the July 2014 letter will be proposed or adopted. Although the defendants have taken concrete steps to implement the redevelopment plan by, for example, submitting the PUD application for approval, the plaintiffs are not challenging as discriminatory the redevelopment plan in general.

Therefore, the Court considers which specific provisions in Section 1437p could conceivably give rise to an enforceable constructive demolition claim. There are two subsections in Section 1437p potentially relevant to plaintiffs' claims. Subsection (a)(1)(A) and Subsection (a)(3) provide in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   [U]pon receiving an application by a public housing agency for authorization, with or without financial assistance under this subchapter, to demolish ... a public housing project ... the Secretary shall approve the application, if the [PHA] certifies-(1) in the case of-(A) an application proposing demolition of a public housing project..., that-(i) the project ... is obsolete as to physical condition, location, or other factors, making it unsuitable for housing purposes; and (ii) no reasonable program of modification is cost-effective to return the public housing project ... to useful life; and ... (3) that the [PHA] has specifically authorized the demolition or disposition in the public housing agency plan, and has certified that the actions contemplated in the public housing agency plan comply with this section[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1437p(a). Subsection (b) requires that the HUD Secretary reject an application if it lacks any of the necessary certifications. \u00a7 1437p(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Section 1437p(a)(1)(A) and (a)(3) are directed at the HUD Secretary, mandating that the Secretary approve a PHA's demolition application if the PHA makes the required certifications. These subsections, unlike subsection (a)(4), which was analyzed in detail in\n   <em>\n    Arroyo\n   </em>\n   , lack the \"right-creating\" language critical to demonstrating unambiguous congressional intent to create an enforceable right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gonzaga\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254550\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/273/#p283\">\n    536 U.S. at 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1254550\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/536/273/#p283\">\n    122 S.Ct. 2268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
