Background\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this antitrust action, Plaintiffs Steward Health Care System, LLC, Blackstone Medical Center, Inc., f/k/a Steward Medical Holding Subsidiary Four, Inc., and Blackstone Rehabilitation Hospital, Inc. (collectively, \"Steward\") claim Defendant Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Rhode Island (\"Blue Cross\") unlawfully blocked Steward from entering the Rhode Island health care and health insurance markets, by thwarting its attempt to purchase a failing community hospital in receivership, Landmark Medical Center (\"Landmark\"), in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. (Pls.' Corrected Statement of Disputed Facts (\"SDF\") \u00b6 49, ECF No. 171-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This is a complicated case, and the area of antitrust law governing the claims is, to put it kindly, confused and opaque. As explained in detail below, the Court's view on the outcome of this motion has changed as a result of careful and complete review of the record and the law; and without question, this is a close case-one that highlights the difficulty of applying less-than-clear antitrust doctrines and precedents to one of the most complicated and volatile sectors of the national economy. In the end, the analysis below has convinced the Court that a trial is required on all counts of Steward's Amended Complaint (ECF No. 90), and therefore Blue Cross's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 157) will be denied in full (Counts I-XVIII).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A. Landmark\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Landmark Medical Center (\"Landmark\") is a \"community based\" hospital\n   that has served northern Rhode Island since 1988.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Landmark Medical Center,\n   <em>\n    History\n   </em>\n   , https://www.landmarkmedical.org/About-Us/History.aspx (last visited Apr. 16, 2018). In 2008, facing increasingly difficult financial straits, Landmark entered receivership under the supervision of the Rhode Island Superior Court. (SDF \u00b6\u00b6 53, 62.) After entering receivership, Landmark operated under a court-appointed Special Master. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62.) Justice Michael Silverstein of the Rhode Island Superior Court oversaw the receivership proceedings and appointed attorney Jonathan Savage as Special Master. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63.) Special Master Savage solicited bids for Landmark from prospective buyers, including hospital systems Lifespan, Prime, and Steward. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As early as 1996, Lifespan sought to potentially acquire Landmark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65.) Lifespan's interest resurfaced in the context of Landmark's receivership proceedings in April 2009 when the Special Master requested that Maria Montanaro, then-CEO of Thundermist Health Center (\"Thundermist\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"outline a plan for how health services would be delivered in Woonsocket in the event that Landmark were to close.\" (SDF \u00b6 66; Dep. of Maria Montanaro (\"Montanaro Dep.\") at 38-39, SDF Ex. 27, ECF No. 206-27.) The plan devised by Montanaro \"called for the elimination of inpatient acute care at Landmark, and for the facility to provide primarily urgent care, emergency services, and outpatient surgery.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67; SDF Ex. 101, ECF No. 210-13; Dep. of Mary Wakefield (\"Wakefield Dep.\") at 31:1-6, SDF Ex. 30, ECF No. 206-30; Montanaro Dep. at 42:1-45:3, SDF Ex. 27; Dep. of George Vecchione (\"Vecchione Dep.\") at 14:8-14:14, SDF Ex. 29, ECF No. 206-29.) Underlying the plan was the idea that \"a viable way to sustain Landmark hospital given its current financial and operational burdens [did] not appear to exist.\" (SDF \u00b6 69.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   B. The Steward Model\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Steward is a for-profit hospital system,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   which owns and operates multiple hospitals in neighboring Massachusetts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 11.) In its contracts with Massachusetts health insurance companies, Steward receives compensation on a per-member-per-month (\"PMPM\") basis rather than a fee based on individual service(s) performed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) As Steward describes it, this is a \"risk-based\" model, in which Steward shoulders \"some amount of financial risk of providing healthcare services to the health insurers' members.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) To be\n   successful, such a relationship requires a \"working, constructive business relationship that involves the sharing of information and other cooperation\" between health insurers and Steward.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) Moreover, the success of Steward's healthcare vision requires that \"the payer and provider must together develop a system for sharing the health-care and health-expense history of the insured patient population, also develop an analytic for total medical expense ('TME') of that population, and agree on reasonable grounds for reducing TME and improving the quality of care.\" (Pls.' Statement of Additional Undisputed Facts (\"SAUF\") \u00b6 196, ECF No. 177-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Steward's vision was to offer a new, atypical health-care-provider model to Rhode Island. (SDF \u00b6 35.) This model was premised on \"(1) right-siting care, such that community-based, routine services are performed in community settings, whether hospitals, urgent care centers, ambulatory services centers, or physicians' offices; (2) improving the quality of care provided in the community; [and] (3) negotiating on behalf of an integrated network of physicians and hospitals to drive lower premiums.\" (SDF \u00b6 40.) In exchange for participation in its own \"narrow network,\" Steward would accept lower reimbursement rates. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As a part of Steward's vision, its executives believed it could turn around the quality problems Landmark faced; indeed, \"that was the fundamental premise of Steward's turnaround plan for the hospital.\" (SDF \u00b6 54.) \"Landmark quality of care is generally good, although it has room for improvement.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Steward's long term goals extended beyond Landmark; it wanted to acquire more hospitals in Rhode Island. (SDF \u00b6 28.) To this end, Steward petitioned the state legislature to amend the Rhode Island Hospital Conversion Act \"to eliminate a three-year waiting period between hospital acquisitions by for-profit hospitals, which would have allowed Steward to buy more than one Rhode Island Hospital in a three year period.\" (SAUF \u00b6 139.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   C. The Caritas and Steward Bid To Acquire Landmark\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In August 2010, over one year after the receivership commenced, Caritas, Steward's predecessor, submitted a bid to acquire Landmark.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (SDF \u00b6 76.) A contract with Blue Cross was a precondition to Caritas's proposed Asset Purchase Agreement (\"APA\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77.) Feeling that it lacked the essential partners, including Blue Cross, for a successful transaction over Landmark, Caritas withdrew its bid in December 2010. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78.) In a press release following the failed transaction, the Special Master \"indicated critical discussions related to reimbursement rates with Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Rhode Island did not produce tangible results.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He added, \"To date, this has been our biggest hurdle. Unfortunately, attempts to address our inadequate reimbursement rates with Blue Cross were not productive and in fact stalled our negotiations with Caritas.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In May 2011, Steward submitted a new bid to acquire Landmark. (SDF \u00b6 79.) An APA was proposed, and although amended fifteen times, this mostly extended the closing deadlines. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 79, 81, 82.) While the various APA versions included numerous conditions, \"[n]ot all important matters were included as conditions in the APA,\n   nor were all conditions in the APA clearly 'important.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.) Rather than rigid requirements, Steward considered the conditions to be \"flexible leverage points for negotiations,\" or even \"window dressing.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 79, 82.) Indeed, after realizing certain conditions could not be met, Steward nevertheless plowed ahead in attempting to acquire Landmark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 79.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   For example, the APA submitted in March 2012 included the following conditions: \"An agreement to purchase 100% of Rhode Island Specialty Hospital\" (\"RISH\"); a Memorandum of Understanding (\"MOU\") with Thundermist; and \"[a]n agreement to purchase the interest of 21st Century Oncology ('21st Century') in Southern New England Regional Cancer Center ('SNERCC'), a cancer treatment facility owned jointly by 21st Century and Landmark.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (SDF \u00b6 81.) Steward made clear that it would consider waiving the Thundermist and SNERCC conditions if and when it became necessary, if that meant Steward would successfully acquire Landmark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82.) (\"You know, at the end of the day, it's us and Blue Cross that need to come to an agreement.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The key to Steward's effort to acquire Landmark was an acceptable arrangement with Blue Cross on reimbursement rates, because, as with all Rhode Island hospitals, this was the primary source of income for services rendered at Landmark. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98; SAUF \u00b6 173.) For about a year from September 2011 to September 2012, with the assistance of various facilitators, Steward and Blue Cross exchanged numerous and detailed reimbursement-rate proposals for Landmark. (SDF \u00b6 86.) Over the course of these negotiations, Steward saw Blue Cross as \"moving backwards\" because its offers of rate increases always included \"quality targets that were unrealistic, given Landmark's condition.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Blue Cross would not discuss modifying these targets, even though it had done so for other providers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.) In one of the last mediation sessions the parties had with the Rhode Island Attorney General, the Attorney General informed Steward executives that Blue Cross \"just do[es]n't want you to do business in this state.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Steward believed Blue Cross's proposed quality metrics (a part of Blue Cross's Standard Quality Program) were unattainable, so over the long course of negotiations, it proposed quality metrics different than those Blue Cross advanced, but which it believed to be achievable. (SDF \u00b6 100.) For example, in September 2011, Steward introduced a proposal for quality metrics \"based on year-over-year improvement at Landmark, as opposed to targets based on national averages.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) At every turn, Blue Cross rejected Steward's proposals and refused to stray from its Quality Program's methodology.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Beyond the financial issues, Steward needed and wanted Blue Cross to be a \" 'willing partner.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.) After all, the viability of Steward's proposed model turned on a \"non-hostile relationship\" with Blue Cross. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Although not expressly set out as an APA condition, everyone involved understood that an agreement with Blue Cross was essential for a successful\n   contract over Landmark. (SDF \u00b6 112.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On August 6, 2012, negotiations being facilitated by the Attorney General came to an acrimonious stop when Steward's team walked away in response to what it viewed as an unproductive, obstinate negotiating approach by Blue Cross. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.) Steward's decision to walk away was met with considerable anger because at the time, some viewed Steward as petulantly abandoning a process that so many people had invested in deeply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nonetheless, with some prodding, the parties reengaged. (SDF \u00b6 87.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On September 4, 2012, Steward sent a letter to Justice Silverstein that offered two, alternative paths to finalizing the Landmark acquisition. (SDF \u00b6 114.) One path consisted of \"satisfying the three conditions, with or without an agreement with Blue Cross.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The other required an agreement with Blue Cross but waived the RISH and Thundermist conditions, and allowed Steward to \"deal with SNERCC later.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) A final mediation session with retired Chief Justice Frank Williams of the Rhode Island Supreme Court occurred on September 12, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 89.) Alas, this mediation too was unsuccessful. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) Steward publicly announced its decision to withdraw its Landmark bid on September 27, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Steward announced,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   In order to move forward with Steward's model of care several conditions needed to be met. These conditions were clearly spelled out in the Asset Purchase Agreement and accepted by the Court. These conditions have not been met. When we were notified that these conditions could not be met, we presented a second path by which we would waive two of these conditions. This alternate condition was also not met.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 117.) The difference between Steward's and Blue Cross's rate proposals is the subject of considerable dispute, but, as calculated by Steward, was $3 million. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SDF \u00b6 97.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   D. The \"Red Team\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Blue Cross's Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\") Michael Hudson, an individual involved in Steward negotiations from August to September 2012, spearheaded what Blue Cross called the \"Red Team\" in July 2012. (SDF \u00b6 87.) The Red Team was a group of Blue Cross employees charged with identifying and analyzing potential competitive threats. (SDF \u00b6 87; SAUF \u00b6 142.) One of those employees was Linda Winfrey, an Assistant Vice President at Blue Cross responsible for gauging \"risks to the enterprise up to and including disruption of services.\" (SDF \u00b6 87.) AVP Winfrey had been considering these issues for Blue Cross since at least May 2012, when she circulated (and later presented at an executive leadership meeting) a document that highlighted Blue Cross's most pressing threats; at the top of that list was the \"potential of new competitors entering the market including Accountable Care Organizations (ACO),\" which could \"result in significant enrollment losses and could negatively affect our long term viability as a health plan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In a similar presentation in July 2012, \"Competition in the Post-PPACA World,\" \"ACO: Supplier Leverage\" and \"Limited Network Carrier (Steward/Fallon?)\" were pinpointed as \"new threats\" with a high \"likelihood of entry to RI market\" and a substantial \"adverse impact on BCBSRI.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) AVP Winfrey also approved the idea of analyzing Steward's\n   prospective threat in the first round of the Red Team's analysis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In that analysis, the Red Team included \"a map to show just how well positioned [Steward is] in the southeast part of MA ... they have St. Anne's, Good Sam's, Morton, Norwood ... they basically have RI bordered. Then Landmark would be the tip of the spear.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Blue Cross expressed concern about ACOs and risk-based contracting, which could strip some or all of an insurance company's traditional functions, and the profits associated with insurance companies bearing risk. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , SAUF \u00b6 146; SAUF Ex. 35, ECF No. 177-36 at 12 (\"[T]he possibility exists for the ACO to develop a level of integration that makes an outside insurer redundant\"); Dep. of Dorothy Coleman (\"Coleman Dep.\") at 435:3-13, 437:18-438:5, SAUF Ex. 7, ECF No. 214-7 (highlighting risk that ACO might team up with an insurance company, which could severely test Blue Cross's relevance) ). Blue Cross viewed these issues, referred to as \"disintermediation,\" and the process of \"providers becoming payers,\" as existential threats. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAUF \u00b6 146.) Blue Cross CEO Peter Andruszkiewicz testified in his deposition that \"disintermediation,\" i.e., \"providers becoming payers\" and \"eliminat[ing] the intermediary known as the payer\" \"was a concern among my team, me, and every health insurance executive in the United States at this time frame.\" (Dep. of Peter Andruszkiewicz (\"Andruszkiewicz Dep.\") at 93, SAUF Ex. 6, ECF No. 214-6.) Likewise, Mark Waggoner, a member of Blue Cross's Executive Leadership Team (\"ELT\") and a key participant in Caritas discussions, recalled \"discussion at Blue Cross at about this same time about the possibility that the ACO model or integrated delivery system could in some sense replace a conventional insurance company\" because \"you saw some of that happening in some parts of the country\" and disintermediation was the \"trend in [nationwide] conversations at that point in time.\" (Dep. of Mark Waggoner (\"Waggoner Dep.\") at 298, SAUF Ex. 11, ECF No. 214-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Red Team also analyzed other prospective scenarios, including one in which Prime entered Rhode Island. (SAUF \u00b6 147; SAUF Ex. 37, ECF No. 177-38; SAUF Ex. 38, ECF No. 177-39.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   E. Blue Cross's Contract with Landmark\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Under the twelfth amendment to Landmark's Hospital Participation Agreement with Blue Cross, the Landmark-Blue Cross contract was set to expire July 16, 2012. (SDF \u00b6 102.) With negotiations faltering, on May 21, 2012, Blue Cross filed an application for a material modification with the Rhode Island Department of Health (\"DOH\"), which included draft notice letters informing Blue Cross's subscribers and providers that Landmark might go \"out of network.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 104.) Upon receipt of Blue Cross's material-modification application, the DOH informed Blue Cross that it should send \"revised member and physician notification letters\" detailing \"that until the Department completes its review of this potential change and issues its determination, members will be able to continue to receive covered services at [Landmark and RHRI] at the in-network benefit level, if [the material modification] is not approved prior to the termination of the contract.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 105.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This material modification request sent shock waves through the receivership players. On July 2, 2012, Special Master Savage, noting the critical stage of negotiations between Steward and Blue Cross, sought a temporary restraining order (\"TRO\") from Justice Silverstein to stop Blue Cross from putting Landmark out of network and distributing the letters to subscribers and providers. The Superior\n   Court denied the TRO on July 6, 2012; and on July 9, 2012, Blue Cross mailed letters to providers and subscribers explaining that Landmark might soon be \"out of network.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 107-08.) On July 16, 2012, Blue Cross's contract with Landmark terminated; thereafter Blue Cross compensated subscribers directly for healthcare services provided at Landmark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 109.) Landmark remained out of network until August 31, 2012, when Blue Cross and Landmark agreed to extend the terms of their participation contract until three months after a buyer acquired the hospital. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 110.) In agreeing to extend the Landmark contract with Blue Cross as part of a settlement approved by Justice Silverstein, the Special Master felt he had no choice but to bend to Blue Cross's will given the hospital's precarious condition. With court approval, on September 12, 2012, Landmark was officially back in network. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In June 2012, Blue Cross's contracting group considered the risks facing Blue Cross if it chose not to renew any of its contracts with various community hospitals, including Landmark. (SAUF \u00b6 179.) Blue Cross knew that removing a hospital from its network could substantially cost Blue Cross because it would force its subscribers to access other, more expensive, in-network hospitals (such as Rhode Island Hospital, Miriam Hospital, or Women's &amp; Infants Hospital). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Blue Cross also knew that without a contract, Landmark might be forced to close. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Steward suggests, and Court accepts as true for purposes of this motion, that \"Blue Cross knew that the material modification process typically took 4-6 months, and that the cost of being out of contract with [Landmark/]Steward in advance of DOH approval would cost Blue Cross an estimated $3 million per month.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 180.) Even without contemplating this cost, Steward adds, it would cost Blue Cross much more to remove Landmark from its network than \"what Steward was then seeking in terms of reimbursement rate increases.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 181.) Nevertheless, in spite of knowing full well the short term costs of its decision, Blue Cross concluded that the \"path forward for Landmark was to 'hold our position since the material modification ha[d] already been filed.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Steward states: \"Despite the financial risk to Blue Cross of pursuing the material modification, Blue Cross' demands in exchange for a swift resolution on the material modification were those that it believed were necessary to end Steward's bid for the hospital. As Mike Hudson, Blue Cross' CFO and then lead negotiator with Steward explained, he was not going to even talk further with Steward until he learned whether Landmark accepted Blue Cross' terms, since those terms '[c]ould force Steward's hand-if they [Landmark] agreed to the contract,\n   <em>\n    then Steward is likely out\n   </em>\n   .\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 184.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   F. Blue Cross Reaches a Deal with Prime over Landmark\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Once Steward withdrew from the process, Prime\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   submitted a proposed APA for Landmark to the Special Master on\n   September 26, 2012.

The quality program Blue Cross reached with Prime included provisions that it would not accept when presented by Steward, namely evaluating Landmark \"based on improvement in Landmark's performance against past performance\" rather than national averages.

Although Prime has succeeded to some degree in righting the ship for Landmark by increasing patient volume and revenue, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SDF \u00b6 127), it is hotly disputed whether Prime brought efficiency and innovation to Rhode Island through Landmark.

On July 15, 2013, Blue Cross moved to dismiss Steward's complaint (ECF No. 16); this Court denied Blue Cross's motion on February 19, 2014 (ECF No. 34);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Steward Health Care Sys., LLC v.

In essence, a unilateral refusal to deal is prima facie exclusionary if there is evidence of\n   <em>\n    harm\n   </em>\n   to the competitive process; a valid business justification requires proof of countervailing\n   <em>\n    benefits\n   </em>\n   to the competitive process.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530360\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/36/1147/#p1183\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Blue Cross has not structured its summary judgment argument to correspond to the\n   <em>\n    Data General\n   </em>\n   burden shifting rubric; it has instead directed its argument almost exclusively at Steward's theory at the prima-facie stage, while peppering its argument here and there with legitimate business reasons for its behavior.

The evidence suggests that Blue Cross terminated a longstanding, presumably profitable course of dealing with Landmark in order to block Steward. It is of no consequence\n   that Blue Cross did not have or terminate a prior course of dealing directly with Steward at Landmark, for the reasons discussed above; the critical question is how Blue Cross dealt with Landmark in the context of the effort by Steward to purchase it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   It is undisputed that Blue Cross and Landmark entered into a hospital-participation agreement in 2006, which had been routinely extended multiple times. (SDF \u00b6 57.) That all ended when Blue Cross allowed its contract with Landmark to expire on July 16, 2012. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 102, 109.) In May 2012, while in the midst of difficult negotiations with Steward in connection with Steward's bid to acquire Landmark through the receivership, Blue Cross filed the necessary papers with the DOH for a \"material modification\"-i.e., official permission to remove Landmark from its provider network. (SDF \u00b6 104; SDF Ex. 202, ECF No. 212-45.) This step was not necessarily unusual, as Blue Cross had, on other occasions, taken steps to institute the material modification process with the DOH when negotiations with other hospitals stalled. (SAUF \u00b6 175.) Blue Cross, however, did not stop there. Although it had not yet received DOH approval, on July 9, 2012, Blue Cross informed subscribers via letter that the Landmark contract would expire on July 16, and \"[i]f the [DOH] approves the network change, Landmark Medical Center will be considered out of network on August 1, 2012 ....\" (SAUF Ex. 84 at 2, ECF No. 215-9.) Blue Cross added, \"Despite our continued efforts to resolve the current situation, we feel it's important to notify our members that a resolution is doubtful at this time.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Never before had Blue Cross mailed a letter to doctors and subscribers notifying them of the immediate and impending removal of a member hospital from its network. To be clear, it was not just the notification that was remarkable; never before or since has Blue Cross kept true to its initial material modification application promise by actually allowing a hospital to go \"out of network.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The consequences of Blue Cross permitting a hospital to-for the first time ever-go \"nonparticipating,\" and of sending a letter to members about it were significant; so significant, in fact, that the Special Master tried to put a halt to it and to extend Blue Cross's contract with Landmark. (SDF \u00b6 103; SDF Ex. 90, ECF No. 210-2; SDF Ex. 219, ECF No. 213-14.) On July 2, 2012, the Special Master moved for\n   an emergency TRO \"to preserve the\n   <em>\n    status quo\n   </em>\n   by restraining Blue Cross ... from notifying subscribers or the public that it has filed a request for material modification of health insurance plans in order to remove Landmark Medical Center ... from its provider network.\" (SAUF \u00b6 177; SAUF Ex. 83 at 3, ECF No. 215-8.) In that filing, the Special Master argued that, \"[s]ending a letter to subscribers and providers notifying them that LMC and RHRI will be out-of-network providers after August 6, 2012 is premature and very likely misleading and inaccurate.... [g]iven the hurdles that Blue Cross must overcome to obtain DOH approval and such additional federal approvals that may be needed.\" (SAUF Ex. 83 at 5-6.) He added, \"Injunctive relief is further warranted to protect Landmark, patients and physicians from the chaos and confusion that will result from a letter that incorrectly advises them that [Landmark] and RHRI will be out-of-network providers as of August 6, 2012.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Blue Cross's conduct in removing Landmark from its network and prematurely notifying subscribers about such a possibility strayed far from its ordinary course of dealing with Landmark, or any other hospital for that matter. A reasonable jury could conclude that Blue Cross's uniquely hard-core approach with respect to Landmark, just as negotiations with Steward were at a critical stage, was not a legitimate business decision, but was designed to kill the Steward acquisition. Indeed, Blue Cross itself implicitly recognized this in its application for material modification to the DOH: \"Despite our best efforts to provide Steward with a fair and reasonable rate ... we are concerned that we may not be able to come to an agreement with Steward .... If we are not able to come to agreement with Steward by [July 16, 2012], Landmark will then become nonparticipating in the BCBSRI network.\" (SDF Ex. 202 at 2.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is undisputed that Landmark remained out of network until August 31, 2012, at which point the Special Master and Blue Cross agreed to extend the terms of the hospital participation contract until three months after a buyer acquired Landmark. (SDF \u00b6 110.) The Special Master agreed to this settlement, however, only because Landmark's condition once removed from network left him no other choice but to accept whatever terms Blue Cross demanded. (SDF Ex. 205 at 3, 4, ECF No. 204-8 (in Special Master's emergency petition to superior court for instructions on September 6, 2012, explaining that Landmark going out of network caused \"the cash receipts of Landmark\" to \"decline[ ] precipitously\" and \"a substantial loss of patients\" and \"The Special Master believes that the very survival of Landmark and RHRI is at stake and that he had no other alternative but to execute the MOU on the conditions imposed by Blue Cross ....\"); Dep. of Jonathan N. Savage at 143:4-5, SDF Ex. 28, ECF No. 206-28 (Special Master describing his agreement to Blue Cross's\n   MOU as \"an absolute and total capitulation\" to Blue Cross's terms) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Blue Cross knew how its demands could impact Steward. As Blue Cross CFO (and then-lead negotiator) Mike Hudson made clear in an email leading up to Landmark moving back in network and in the midst of the Blue Cross-Steward negotiations: \"Landmark asked the judge to have us pay them instead of the member and was willing to accept the prior contracted rates.... Could force Steward's hand-if [Landmark] agree[s] to the contract,\n   <em>\n    then Steward is likely out\n   </em>\n   .\" (SDF Ex. 91, ECF No. 210-3.) And it appears that's precisely what happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Next, and perhaps most importantly, Steward presents plethora evidence that Blue Cross sacrificed short-term profits for the longer-term benefit of eradicating potential competition from Steward. For example, in June 2012, Blue Cross conducted a \"Contract Renewal Risk Analysis &amp; Strategic Assessment,\" in which it \"identif[ied] and weigh[ed] the risks to BCBSRI and [its] members associated with the failure to reach agreement [with] four community hospitals currently in negotiation\" including Landmark.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   (SAUF Ex. 71 at 2-3, ECF No. 214-71.) Blue Cross identified a number of financial \"risks\" in the event of non-renewal or termination of a community-hospital contract, including \"[f]inancial exposure of non-participation status and flow of services to other entities.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) These financial exposure risks included: (1) \"payment to full charge exposure upon non-participation,\" i.e., having to pay hospitals at regular, undiscounted rates for patients who still used the now out-of-network hospital; and (2) the cost of \"moving services to higher cost hospitals,\" i.e., having to pay higher reimbursement rates at the other in-contract hospitals where subscribers would now seek care because Blue Cross removed their previous top-choice hospital from the network. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This latter category was most potentially impactful because, Blue Cross recognized, \"[a]ll\" of the four community hospitals with contracts set to expire in 2012 (including Landmark) \"are in dire financial trouble and all are likely to fail if their BCBSRI agreement is not renewed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In its internal analysis, Blue Cross calculated exactly how much it would cost to pay the reimbursement rate increases Steward was seeking (i.e., the \"[p]osition [v]ariance based on current [negotiation] positions\") and compared it to how much it would cost to allow Landmark to go out of network, and likely shut its doors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) Blue Cross estimated that Landmark going out of network and/or closing would cost Blue Cross $9.8 million. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) This exceeded by over $4 million the amount Blue Cross estimated it would lose if it accepted the rate increases proposed by Steward for Landmark, which would cost $5.4 million.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In one presentation slide titled \"Risk Factors Integrated View,\" Blue Cross uses a graphic to assess and value the various \"risk factors\" for each of the four community\n   hospitals, assigning each risk factor a value between one and four points. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) In the \"Financial Impact\" category evaluated by Blue Cross, Landmark was the only hospital of the four to receive a full four points. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) With respect to the three other community hospitals, Blue Cross assessed that \"[b]ecause of [the] significant risk,\" it would consider additional rate increases and work toward achieving contracts to keep these hospitals in network. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.) Despite identifying an out of contract or closed Landmark as its most serious risk, Blue Cross elected to stay the course: \"We recommend that we continue to hold our position with Landmark since the material modification has already been filed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Blue Cross had on occasion before filed papers to initiate material modification for negotiation leverage when discussions with other hospitals lagged, but in those instances Blue Cross always reached an agreement before taking the extreme and unusual step of announcing to its members that a hospital would be out-of-network and allowing a contract to terminate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAUF \u00b6 175; Hudson Dep. at 146:21-148:16, SAUF Ex. 9; Donahue Dep. 310:2-13, SAUF Ex. 8 (\"There's been contentious negotiations adversarial, but they generally get resolved before they get to this phase.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   This evidence more than suffices to create a trial-worthy issue as to whether Blue Cross sacrificed short-term profits (by letting the Landmark contract lapse) for the long-term benefit of keeping Steward out of Rhode Island. And if more were needed, which it is not, Steward's experts confirm this point. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAUF \u00b6 182; Expert Report of Professor Leemore Dafny, SAUF Ex. 22 at 13, ECF No. 214-22 (\"[T]hese analyses corroborate BCBSRI's contemporary analyses showing that rejecting Steward's offers was costly to BCBSRI.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Steward also presents evidence to suggest that the proposals made and rejected by Blue Cross amounted to a refusal to deal, because Blue Cross negotiated in bad-faith. This evidence is complicated in light of what both parties acknowledge is the \"complex and highly differentiated\" aspect of hospital services, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Def.'s Mem.\") 29, ECF No. 157); Pl.'s Resp. in Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. (\"Pls.' Resp.\") 32, ECF No. 172-1); but Blue Cross cannot hide behind this complexity to escape the material factual disputes that Steward has effectively uncovered. For present purposes, the Court need not decide the proper methodology to assess appropriate hospital reimbursement rates (indeed, both parties have different takes on this subject, which itself suggests it is a matter for trial). It is sufficient that Steward has sufficiently created a factual dispute as to whether Blue Cross refused to deal with Steward over Landmark by proposing rates below the averages it paid to other Rhode Island hospitals, and rejecting proposals consistent with what it accepted for other hospitals, essentially negotiating in bad faith with Steward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The evidence Steward sets forth is as follows. It is not disputed that Blue Cross pays a range of reimbursement rates to various hospitals in Rhode Island. In 2010 when Caritas (Steward's predecessor) first attempted to acquire Landmark, an OHIC study titled \"Variations in Hospital Payment Rates by Commercial Insurers in Rhode Island\" reported that the rates paid to Landmark were twenty-two percent below the average for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   Rhode Island hospitals, and even farther below the rates that some Lifespan and CNE-affiliated hospitals received. (SDF Ex. 67 at 16 &amp; Fig. 10, ECF No. 208-11.) Steward argues the highest rate increase it proposed to Blue Cross (in May 2012) was for Landmark to be reimbursed at ninety-five percent of the average Blue Cross paid to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   hospitals in Rhode Island, with an option to receive an\n   additional five percent based on quality, which practically amounted to about a fifteen percent rate increase.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAUF Ex. 106, ECF No. 215-31; SAUF \u00b6 203.) What is important is that Steward has produced evidence that it proposed reimbursement rates for Landmark at a level lower than what Blue Cross was paying other hospitals (based on averaging the rates).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Blue Cross argues that \"the undisputed evidence shows that the rates Blue Cross offered Steward at Landmark were\n   <em>\n    higher\n   </em>\n   than the rates Blue Cross paid\n   <em>\n    comparable\n   </em>\n   hospitals for\n   <em>\n    comparable\n   </em>\n   services.\" (Def.'s Mem. 29-30.) At summary judgment this Court need not accept at face value what Blue Cross contends are the appropriate hospital comparators. Indeed, Blue Cross undermines its own position on this point in its brief: after suggesting what the proper hospital-rate comparison should be, i.e., which hospitals Landmark can and cannot be compared to for calculating reimbursement rates, in other parts of its brief it argues that because hospital services are so different, no two hospitals can really be compared for these purposes at all. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ) Then, remarkably, Blue Cross pivots again to argue that the appropriate comparison is actually between Steward and Prime, the entity that ultimately acquired Landmark.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Regardless of what it now asserts for purposes of this motion, Blue Cross's own evidence and analysis supports the premise that Blue Cross had been comparing Landmark to other hospitals-including Lifespan and CNE hospitals that Blue Cross more generously reimbursed-because patients would be leaving Landmark for those hospitals upon Landmark's closure. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , SAUF Ex. 71.) The upshot is that, at trial, Steward and Blue Cross will have the opportunity to argue which hospitals Landmark should and should not properly be compared to for rate-increase purposes. While Blue Cross's view of this world of rate setting may ultimately persuade a jury that it was operating in good faith and not refusing to deal, summary judgment is not appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Although the Court is satisfied that the above discussion explains why Steward's refusal-to-deal claim must advance to trial, Blue Cross has raised several additional arguments to rebut Steward's Section 2 claim. None of these arguments change the outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   First, Blue Cross argues that it could not have refused to deal because \"it was Steward that walked away from negotiations and refused to deal.\" (Def.'s Mem. 17.) As a matter of law, it does not matter that Steward \"walked away\" from the negotiating table, if Blue Cross made an offer that it knew could not be accepted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MetroNet Servs. Corp. v. Qwest Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9213136\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/383/1124/#p1132\">\n    383 F.3d 1124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1132-33 (9th Cir. 2004) (\"An offer to deal with a competitor only on unreasonable terms and conditions can amount to a practical refusal to deal.\"). Blue Cross's own belief in its good faith and its suggestion that it invested \"enormous effort to try to get a deal done with Steward at Landmark,\" (Def.'s Mem. 20), is not dispositive at summary judgment; the record contains sufficient evidence from which a reasonable juror could conclude otherwise, i.e., that Blue Cross was moving backwards in negotiations with\n   Steward, including imposing knowingly unattainable quality metrics on Steward. Specifically, Steward contends that Blue Cross responded to Steward's proposals with counter-proposals that moved backwards then requested a response, effectively attempting to force Steward to bargain against itself. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , SDF Ex. 155, ECF No. 211-12; SDF Ex. 179, ECF No. 212-22; SDF Ex. 180, ECF No. 212-23;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Rich Dep. 193:24-194:6, SDF Ex. 11, ECF No. 206-11 (\"I think this is part of the fundamental problem in Mark [Waggoner's] email, his last sentence.... 'We welcome a proposal.' We had already bid. They gave us a bid that was effectively lower, and they're asking us for a counter, what we believe to be [bargaining] against ourselves.\"). Next, Steward cites comments by Andruszkiewicz in an August 6, 2012 Providence Business News article, indicating that Blue Cross might offer a \"limited-network\" product that could exclude certain hospitals, including Landmark. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SDF Ex. 181, ECF No. 212-24.) And finally, Steward points to an email from Mark Hudson of Blue Cross to Mark Rich of Steward-both lead negotiators for the respective entities-in which Hudson writes,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   You reiterated your demand that Landmark be included in all BCBSRI products, including those that may have a limited or tiered network. In the event BCBSRI offers products with tiers in the future, the tiers will be determined based on cost and quality. Granting preferred status to providers who otherwise wouldn't qualify would impair the quality of any tiered product, especially when granting such status was made to an organization that refuses to participate in quality improvement initiatives.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   (SDF Ex. 182 at 3, ECF No. 212-25.) A jury will have to decide if this was, as Steward contends, bad faith, backward negotiations, or as Blue Cross says, just good business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Next, Blue Cross argues that in order for Steward's claim to move forward, this Court must \"impose on a state-regulated insurer a novel antitrust duty to purchase hospital services.\" (Def.'s Mem. 34.) In suggesting that Steward's legal theory is \"unprecedented,\" Blue Cross argues that \"Steward asks this Court to find that Blue Cross had an\n   <em>\n    antitrust\n   </em>\n   duty to accept\n   <em>\n    particular\n   </em>\n   reimbursement rates proposed by the acquirer of a failing Rhode Island hospital.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35.) This is melodrama, as are Blue Cross's unsubstantiated assertions that to allow Steward's claim to clear summary judgment requires the Court to \"assum[e] the role of a regulator of health insurer provider networks,\" and thus \"upset the delicate balance that OHIC and Blue Cross strike when fulfilling their public interest missions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-36.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   It is simply incorrect to say that to recognize the possibility of a refusal-to-deal by Blue Cross requires the Court to impose a \"novel antitrust duty\" by requiring that Blue Cross accept the reimbursement rates that Steward proposed. The law does not impose, and this Court may not dictate, the precise terms that Blue Cross must accept; but the law does impose a duty on Blue Cross to compete fairly, and specifically to not forego short term profits for the purpose of blocking competition and maintaining a monopoly. And in order to enforce this duty, the Court-in fact the jury-must consider the parties' conduct in the context of the particular markets at issue.\n   <em>\n    Town of Concord v. Bos. Edison Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530026\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/915/17/#p22\">\n    915 F.2d 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 22 (1st Cir. 1990) (Breyer, C.J.) (\"[A]ntitrust analysis must sensitively recognize and reflect the distinctive economic legal setting of the regulated industry to which it applies.\" (internal quotations and citations omitted) ). If the jury finds in favor of Steward, it will need to consider the question of damages (discussed below), but none of this equates to the result Blue Cross purportedly fears.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In addition, Blue Cross overstates the role of OHIC regulations and the supposed \"delicate balance\" that enforcing the antitrust laws would upset in this case. Indeed, the meager regulatory context at play here is far different from what the Supreme Court recognized-and underscored-in\n   <em>\n    Trinko\n   </em>\n   .

The first concerns \"conspiracy.\" Blue Cross tries hard to raise the bar on Steward, suggesting that an illicit \"agreement\" requires explicit evidence that minds have met. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. 42-45.) This is not correct.

In marshalling the evidence, Steward highlights four separate but related episodes: (1) the \"treat-and-transfer\" model developed by Lifespan and Thundermist, with Blue Cross's encouragement, for a failed Landmark; (2) rate concessions offered by Lifespan to Blue Cross in exchange for additional patient volume; and Thundermist's decisions to (3) shift OB patients and (4) reject an MOU with Steward (including a proposal that\n   Thundermist itself had proposed). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. 43-67.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   First, a reasonable juror could conclude that part of the agreement between Blue Cross, Lifespan, and Thundermist to block Steward from Rhode Island was premised on the treat-and-transfer plan proposed as an alternative to Steward acquiring Landmark. The treat-and-transfer model, which sought to make Landmark \"less than a full-service, acute-care hospital,\" (Wakefield Dep. at 32:1-6, SDF Ex. 30), was conceived in April of 2009 by Maria Montanaro, then-CEO of Thundermist, in a letter to Special Master Savage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SDF Ex. 101). Landmark was placed in receivership in 2008, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SDF \u00b6 62), around the same time Caritas emerged as a prospective acquirer of the hospital. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SDF Ex. 102 at 4-5, ECF No. 210-14.) In May 2009 in a letter to Justice Silverstein, Montanaro detailed her concerns regarding Landmark's \"possible affiliation with Caritas Christi.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She wrote,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   To me, this should not be about the survival of an institution, but rather about how to best deliver the highest quality, most cost-effective care in northern RI. It is possible, that the most sustainable model of high quality, cost effective care would be one that does not include a full service, licensed hospital.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The evidence also supports the inference that Blue Cross was in on the plan for treat-and-transfer as\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   alternative to a Caritas/Steward-owned Landmark. In the fall of 2010, Caritas took part in discussions and meetings with Blue Cross over acquiring Landmark. (SDF Ex. 108, ECF No. 210-20; SDF Ex. 109, ECF No. 210-21.) On November 18, 2010, Mark Waggoner of Blue Cross reported to Blue Cross's ELT that then-Blue Cross CEO Jim Purcell wanted Blue Cross to occupy a greater role over Landmark's future. He stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   Jim Purcell called me earlier this week to chat about Caritas/Landmark. He seems to be leaning more towards to wanting to step off of the sideline and play more of a broker role in a local solution to Landmark. Apparently, he had a conversation earlier in the week with M. Montan[a]ro of Thundermist ... that may have influenced his thinking a bit about the role we might play.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   (SDF Ex. 105 at 2, ECF No. 210-17.) Before getting back to Caritas, Purcell touched base with Lifespan and Thundermist to convey his reaction to the Caritas proposal and a plan for Lifespan and Thundermist to meet with Justice Silverstein to discuss treat-and-transfer: \"Maria [Montanaro (Thundermist) ] and George [Vecchione (Lifespan) ] know we'll send our letters this Wednesday [the rejection letter to Caritas and the Special Master], and they will ask for a meeting with the Judge.\" (SDF Ex. 107 at 2, ECF No. 210-19.) Lifespan and Thundermist conferred about how to keep Blue Cross happy and on board: \"It is important to BCBSRI to head in this direction [integrated service delivery networks], and would give them further reasons to support our work together on the model we are proposing.\" (SDF Ex. 111 at 3, ECF No. 210-23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Before meeting with the judge, Blue Cross first huddled with Lifespan and Thundermist. (SDF Ex. 113 at 2, ECF No. 210-25.) Notes from that meeting indicate that discussion topics included: (1) undermining Caritas's efforts to acquire Landmark; and (2) underscoring treat and\n   transfer as the preferred alternative. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SDF Ex. 117 at 2, ECF No. 210-29.) In 2012, CEO Peter Andruszkiewicz of Blue Cross (Purcell's successor) and CEO George Vecchione of Lifespan discussed the treat-and-transfer plan in the context of Andruszkiewicz's calculation that Landmark would not go to Steward. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SDF Ex. 118, ECF No. 210-30.) Montanaro, who by then had left Thundermist to become a Blue Cross consultant, reported to Chuck Jones, her successor as Thundermist CEO:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   Peter [Andruszkiewicz] tells me that he believes Steward will fail to acquire here in RI. He has no intention of giving into their demands. He has talked with George [Vecchione], who has told him \"with as much certainty as he has ever heard George use\" that Lifespan WILL step in and take over the hospital, following the model we developed with them years ago. Peter wants to see Care NE then do the OB piece. He talked with George and his leadership about this yesterday.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   (SDF Ex. 118 at 2.) Montanaro concluded her email with a prediction about Landmark: \"Peter thinks it will be Lifespan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) An internal Lifespan email, sent a few weeks later adds more. Lifespan's new CEO Timothy Babineau (Vecchione's successor) wrote to his leadership team:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   Peter [Andruszkiewicz] called me yesterday to update me on a 5 hour meeting he had on Monday with the AG, Steward (Ralph himself!) and George Nee trying to mediate an agreement. At the end of the day, BCBSRI put an offer on the table that Peter described as still being within OHIC's guidelines. He did not elaborate and I did not ask.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   They are meeting again next Monday (5 hours scheduled) during which Steward is supposed to react/accept/counter BCBSRI most recent offer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   The real reason for the phone call was for Peter to let me know that he told the AG that it was his (Peter A's) understanding that Lifespan would be willing/interested to re-engage in discussions with Landmark should Steward pull out. He indicated the AG heard that but seemed (in Peter's words) \"underwhelmed\". I affirmed that this was still our position but offered no specifics.\n   <strong>\n    Question\n   </strong>\n   -is it worth a call to the AG to re-affirm our position, or should we remain on the sidelines at this point?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   (SDF Ex. 120 at 2, ECF No. 210-32.) Lifespan's CFO clarified, \"Peter's saying, you know, there's another alternative; you don't have to come so hard after me.\" (Wakefield Dep. 181:13-15. SDF Ex. 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The above evidence, when stitched together, makes clear that a reasonable juror could conclude that the treat-and-transfer model for Landmark was one part of an understanding between Blue Cross, Lifespan, and Thundermist aimed at keeping Steward out of Rhode Island.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The next conspiratorial \"episode\" cited by Steward concerns the link between rate concessions for Blue Cross by Lifespan in exchange for increased patient volume, which presumably would come from Landmark. Steward concedes that Thundermist is not directly implicated in this chapter of the conspiracy saga.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   First, Steward offers evidence to make sense of why Lifespan would suddenly retreat from what had been otherwise highly contentious negotiations with Blue Cross. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAUF Ex. 77, ECF No. 215-2; SAUF \u00b6 170 (Lifespan demanding rate increases in excess of six percent and adjusting its position only nominally over several months) ). Lifespan informed Blue Cross that it would only back down on its rate demands in exchange for additional patients: \"Lifespan is willing to consider more substantive reductions to their position only if Blue Cross can provide additional service volume.\" (SAUF Ex. 78 at 5, ECF No. 215-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Now, Steward asks, where might Blue Cross come up with more patient volume to satisfy Lifespan? A reasonable juror could conclude that the answer was Landmark. It was no secret that Lifespan would be the primary beneficiary of a weakened or defeated Landmark. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SAUF Ex. 75 at 9, ECF No. 182-15 (Blue Cross noting subscribers in vicinity of Landmark used Lifespan hospitals, Miriam and RIH); (SAUF Ex. 71 at 6) (evaluating effect of Blue Cross's failure to renew Landmark contract: \"Rhode Island and Miriam would see an influx of the majority of medical/surgical and outpatient services\"); SAUF Ex. 22 at Fig. 35 (predicting Landmark going \"out of network\" would cause nearly forty-five percent of previous-Landmark patients to use a Lifespan hospital). Indeed, Lifespan mapped out Landmark's impact on RIH and Miriam, whether it thrived under Steward's ownership or failed if \"Steward bails.\" (SAUF Ex. 69, ECF No. 214-69.) Unsurprisingly, Lifespan predicted a vast financial reward in the event that Landmark went under, and it forecasted a significant financial blow if Steward acquired Landmark. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   But that's not all. Steward also cites the June 2012 Blue Cross Contract Analysis in which Blue Cross identified the hefty cost of failing to renew community hospitals like Landmark because patients dispersing to costlier hospitals came with an added financial sting to Blue Cross. In this context, Blue Cross's analysis recommended \"[w]ith Lifespan and CNE facilities as a primary recipient of the service migration, we would engage discussions with these systems to establish a longer term plan to develop service capacity at\n   <em>\n    favorable payment levels\n   </em>\n   .\" (SAUF Ex. 71 at 9 (emphasis added) ). Blue Cross added, \"[b]y doing so, we would be in a better position to manage the impact to the network and more strategically leverage options that currently do not exist.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In an update to that same July 2012 presentation, Blue Cross added that \"in order to address the potential movement of services to other hospitals in the future, we have initiated discussions with Lifespan on opportunities involving additional volume and the impact on payment levels.\" (SAUF Ex. 76 at 7, ECF No. 215-1.) In August 2012, Blue Cross documented that \"Lifespan is willing to consider more substantive reductions to their position only if Blue Cross can provide additional service volume.\" (SAUF Ex. 78 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Seemingly out of the blue, in September 2012, at the same time negotiations with Steward were cratering, Lifespan's rate demands declined to 4.8% for commercial. (SAUF Ex. 79 at 3, ECF No. 215-4) (email summarizing Lifespan's proposal). According to Blue Cross documents, Steward asserts, this pivot saved Blue Cross nearly $12 million, and was in stark contrast to the ordinary course of highly contentious Lifespan-Blue Cross negotiations that preceded it. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   SAUF Ex. 80, ECF No. 215-5 (showing total savings (loss) with respect to Lifespan as \"$11,862,139\");\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   SAUF Ex. 81, ECF No. 215-6 (email from Blue Cross CFO Coleman to Andruszkiewicz and Waggoner regarding 2011 Lifespan negotiations) (\"BCBSRI\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   achieved (almost) Lifespan's original request of $24 [million] in additional revenue. Just a friendly reminder of how much we gave to the cause.\"). A reasonable juror could conclude that Blue Cross secured rate concessions from Lifespan in exchange for added patient volume, which could only come from Landmark, once Steward was removed from the picture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The next chapter of Steward's conspiracy claim colors the alleged role played by Thundermist. Steward contends that Thundermist's decisions to (1) move OB patient referrals from Landmark to Women &amp; Infants Hospital in 2011 and (2) to not sign an MOU to be an affiliated provider with Steward/Landmark were similarly motivated by exclusionary goals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   With respect to Thundermist's shift of OB patients, a reasonable juror could conclude that it was one piece of the larger plan to exclude Steward. First, in November 2011, Jones of Thundermist sought \"for Lifespan to commit to support publicly our shared vision of health care in Northern Rhode Island in the face of a threatened or actual Steward departure.\" (SDF Ex. 125, ECF No. 210-37.) In other words, before pulling the trigger on a shift of patients, Jones needed cover and support from Lifespan:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   I remain inclined to move Thundermist's OB service to [Women &amp; Infants hospital, part of Care New England]. I therefore need to take Jon Savage and Steward at their words and prepare to defend my decision against a Steward announcement to abandon Landmark and publicly blame Thundermist for the decision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   In this context it will be important for me to be able to point to Lifespan's interest in developing an appropriate care model for Northern Rhode Island. Given the timeframe involved, I believe a letter to me (or press release if you prefer) describing the model of care Lifespan would be willing to support publicly, with Thundermist, in Northern Rhode Island.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Remarkably, in spite of the fact that Thundermist's patients would be sent to CNE-Lifespan's primary competitor- Lifespan agreed to annually pay Thundermist $150,000, which replaced annual payments from Landmark that would cease upon terminating the Landmark arrangement. (SDF Ex. 125; Jones Dep. at 109:7-110:14, 115:7-18, SDF Ex. 24, ECF No. 206-24 (\"Q. Okay. So because the Women and Infants deal wasn't going to include Thundermist being paid for that, you told Lifespan that by moving to Women and Infants, you were going to lose the $135,000 that you were getting from Landmark and you wanted their help in making that up? A. Yes.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The explanations provided by Thundermist and Lifespan do little to clear the air about this strange payment. In his deposition, Jones suggested that this \"[f]inancial support\" was \"to support development of these more closely integrated networks of care.\" (SDF Ex. 125.) Lifespan's George Vecchione in turn said: \"It wasn't just to fill a loss, a gaping hole, and no prospects for benefit. Frankly, I viewed it as an investment.\" (Vecchione Dep. 140:4-12, SDF Ex. 29.) And, as noted above, in an email to Jones, Montanaro wrote that Blue Cross's Peter Andruszkiewicz \"want[ed] to see Care NE then do the OB piece.\" (SDF Ex. 118 at 2.) These explanations raise more questions than answers, and at least give the appearance of Blue Cross acting as a puppet-master distributing the spoils. And the payment persisted for six consecutive years. (Wakefield Dep. 172-174, SDF Ex. 30.) In her deposition, CFO Wakefield could not pinpoint another circumstance, with the exception of unions, where Lifespan \"supported\" an organization to the tune of $150,000. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 174.\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   Vecchione Dep. 139-140, SDF Ex. 29 (recalling\n   two grants from Lifespan, one to Thundermist and another to Providence Health, but noting, \"There's not many of them\") ). Curiously, Lifespan did not keep track nor inquire of what purpose Thundermist put the $150,000, and there were no real conditions imposed on how Thundermist disbursed Lifespan's generous donation. CEO Jones testified that the payment had no strings attached:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   Q. And under this agreement, besides reporting and keeping track of things, what is Thundermist required to do in return under the public health grant agreement?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   A. Continue to provide charity care for our community.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   Q. Do you do the same things you had to do anyways?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   A. Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   Q. So there's no new obligations imposed by this?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   Q.

Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   Q. And was reporting to Lifespan required?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   Q. And did you do any reporting to Lifespan about what you did with the money?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   A. No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   (Jones Dep. at 127:19-128:16, SDF Ex. 24.) And Lifespan CEO George Vecchione testified consistently:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   Q. And did she [Montanaro], in fact, put some of the money to that use, to your knowledge?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   A. I don't ... recall. What she did with the money, I don't know. It's not that I don't recall, I don't know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   Q. Meaning that you don't think you ever knew?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   A. Correct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   Q. Part of the grant process is not some sort of followup by the recipient to say, Gosh, here's the great things we do with your money?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-143\">\n   A. Correct. Um-hm.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-144\">\n   Q. Can you-I take it you can't point to some particular thing that Thundermist did thanks to the grant money that you were providing, or can you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-145\">\n   A. I can't.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   (Vecchione Dep. at 141:3-19, SDF Ex. 29.) Although early on in the Lifespan-Thundermist negotiations, Lifespan's grant had been incorporated into the two entities' Partnership Model, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   SDF Ex. 128, ECF No. 210-40), the funds were later buried in a different \"Public Health Grant Agreement,\" which unlike the former, was never disclosed to the DOH. (Jones Dep. at 129-130, SDF Ex. 24.) Moreover, in the context of anticipating Thundermist's prospective relationship with Steward if it acquired Landmark, Jones detailed how he saw the interplay between OB patients and a Steward presence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   I think if they stay, whether or not we move OB, our relationship with Steward becomes more complicated .... If they stay and we don't want to cooperate with them, I believe they could do some damage or at least make life difficult for us to do anything but cooperate. So although I wouldn't be happy about the scenario where we move OB and Steward decides to stay, I don't think it's that much different from the scenario where we do nothing, and they decide to stay. Either way, Thundermist's ability to make independent decisions in the best interests of our patients could be compromised by a Steward presence. That threat only goes away entirely if we move OB.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   (SDF Ex. 126, ECF No. 210-38.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   And what role did Blue Cross play in all of this? In addition to Lifespan, Jones looked to Blue Cross to provide assurances\n   that they too would stand behind his decision to shift patients. Prior to making the OB-patient-shift announcement, Jones intended to \"set up [a] meeting between Peter A [of Blue Cross] and George [of Lifespan] to get commitments on a common communications plan.\" (SDF Ex. 129, ECF No. 210-41.) Soon-to-be consultant for Blue Cross and former CEO of Thundermist, Montanaro, offered a helping hand to Thundermist. (SDF Ex. 130, ECF No. 210-42 (\"Nice talk with Peter A. He thinks you should walk away from Landmark and let them close. He said [to] call him and he will talk to you about it, if you want.\";\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Andruszkiewicz Dep. at 270:4-5, SDF Ex. 12, ECF No. 206-12 (\"I supported his decision.\") ). This was the support Jones wanted and needed to move forward with the shift-and Blue Cross delivered. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SDF Ex. 131, ECF No. 210-43 (\"Chuck felt supported by Peter's earlier call.\") ). At the end of the day, rather than an \"independent\" decision by Thundermist, a reasonable juror could conclude that Thundermist's shift of OB patients from Landmark to Women &amp; Infants, and the concomitant payment from Lifespan, was all part of an understanding to keep Steward out of Rhode Island.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   The final, and perhaps most glaring part of Steward's conspiracy story concerns Thundermist's abrupt rejection of an MOU with Steward. Throughout the time period that treat and transfer and OB patient shifting was being discussed, Thundermist was also in talks with Steward. Jones had been working with Steward on an MOU that considered, among other things, patient referrals and certain areas of exclusivity with Steward/Landmark. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SDF Ex. 133, ECF No. 210-45; SDF Ex. 134, ECF No. 210-46.) Although Thundermist and Steward traded various MOU proposals, on May 11, 2012, Jones met with Steward and indicated that he was no longer willing to enter any agreement. Perhaps most illuminating, Jones would not even sign the April 30 proposal that he had himself proposed to Steward.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   And indeed, the evidence indicates that Jones did not come to this epiphany on his own; behind the scenes, Jones surveyed a wide range of opinions in approaching his talks with Steward. He \"talked with Peter A (BCBSRI) and Dennis Keefe (CNE). These conversations, and discussions with just about every other health leader in RI, have helped me clarify a bit.\" (SDF Ex. 135, ECF No. 210-47.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   But it was Blue Cross that had Jones all eyes and ears. Jones's follow-up notes from the May 11 meeting with Steward recount why he did not sign the MOU: \"[y]ou're asking me to give up participation with an organization that has 70% market share?\" (SDF Ex. 139, ECF No. 210-51.) Jones's reaction to Blue Cross's apparent pressure is even more peculiar given the few commercially insured patients Thundermist had, and the fact that Thundermist's capacity would not have been affected by either version of the proposed MOU. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jones Dep. at 292, SDF Ex. 24 (\"Q. [I]s there anything that the agreement would have prevented you from doing with an insurer that you've now done? A. No, I don't think so. I can't think of anything.\"). Later, Jones erased any doubt about Blue Cross's influence on his approach to an MOU with Steward. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058365\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/33/#p46\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at. 216:2-13 (\"Q. 'You have no market share in Rhode Island. You're asking me to give up participation with an organization that has 70 percent market share?' That's a reference to Blue Cross. Correct? A. Yes. Q. And that was the concern that the deal with Steward would give you-give up your opportunity to have participation with Blue Cross. Correct? A. As an example of the-yes, of what could happen.\"). In the aftermath of his Steward meeting, Jones calculated how he would-and would not-broach the subject with the press: \"If we respond, we cannot avoid\n   the statement that we have not reached agreement with Steward. I wouldn't even say that 'we have not yet reached agreement' because that infers an agreement is possible.\" (SDF Ex. 140, ECF No. 210-52.) He added, \"[o]ur close partners know what our position is and inferring in a public statement that there's still hope for an agreement seems disingenuous.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Jones's \"close partners,\" namely Blue Cross by way of Montanaro, also played a role in making sure Jones was prepared for his Steward meeting. (SDF Ex. 141 at 3, ECF No. 210-53 (Interoffice Memorandum from Montanaro to Blue Cross executives) (\"Chuck Jones continues to seek m[y] advice on issues with Steward Healthcare.\"). And when Jones offered to pay Montanaro for the \"long meeting\" in which she helped Jones craft \"talking points,\" she insisted that would not be necessary: \"No need to bill you I was on BCBS's dime and spent the time with their full support. They think very highly of you and were happy to contribute me to the cause today.\" (SAUF Ex. 51 at 2, ECF No. 214-51;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058365\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/720/33/#p46\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (email from Montanaro to Jones) \"Nice job taking it in and pushing some of the points. I am impressed. I thanked Peter [Andruszkiewicz] for you in hosting the meeting at BCBS today. He said he ran into Constantino,\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   who was saying he thinks the 'air is coming out of Steward[']s balloon.' \"). Montanaro even drafted a proposed letter to be sent from Jones to Steward with a list of reasons to resist Steward. (SAUF Ex. 55, ECF No. 214-55.) She instructed Jones: \"As groups line up and pick sides, so will Thundermist need to do the same .... This will be true as you deepen your relationship with payers and with some,\n   <em>\n    but not all\n   </em>\n   of the hospitals with which you currently have referral relationships.\" (emphasis added). Jones heard the message loud and clear, which explains his eventual refusal to sign any version of a Steward MOU, including the version he had crafted. (SDF Ex. 139.) A reasonable juror could conclude that, instead of an independent action by Thundermist, Jones's choice was to align with Blue Cross (and Lifespan) to keep Steward out of Rhode Island.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Finally, in cases where acts against self-interest are not fully explained, traditional evidence of conspiracy, i.e., conversations, assurances, and swapping value among the alleged conspirators, prove instructive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.M. Packer Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4030147\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/635/571/#p575\">\n    635 F.3d at 583\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And as the aforementioned evidence makes clear, the indicators pointing to a conspiracy are numerous in this case. The record is replete with assurances, conversations, and exchanges of value. Ultimately, Steward has provided more than enough evidence that tends to exclude the inference of independent conduct; and a reasonable juror could conclude that the conduct of the players here amounted to an illicit agreement to keep Steward out of Rhode Island. For these reasons, Blue Cross's motion with respect to Steward's conspiracy claims must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   2.

Steward's evidence sufficiently calls into question whether each or any of these conditions were requirements, or more akin to bargaining chips in Steward's quest to reach an acceptable agreement with Blue Cross over Landmark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Just a sample of Steward's evidence makes the point: Steward highlights extensive testimony that reaching a deal with Blue Cross was the only dispositive condition for Steward.

[W]e, Steward, abandoned the Landmark deal because of the Blue Cross rates, not because of the cancer center.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   As to the first two conditions (RISH and Thundermist), Steward set forth, for instance, a letter to Justice Silverstein on September 4, 2012, in which Steward informed the court that, \"progress on the three conditions has been fleeting\" and \"as an alternative, [Steward] proposed that if BCBSRI is able to execute a participation agreement with Steward, Steward Health Care will waive conditions (i) [MOU with Thundermist] and (ii) [100% interest in RISH] ....\" (SDF Ex. 144 at 3, ECF No. 210-56.) Similarly, Steward sets forth evidence that it was willing to waive the SNERCC condition. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , de La Torre Dep. at 122-123, SDF Ex. 1 (\"Q. ...

As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   the OHIC regulations themselves and communications by OHIC belies Blue Cross's rigid reading of the regulations. Blue Cross reluctantly acknowledges this when it states, \"[u]nder certain narrow circumstances, OHIC considered waivers from these regulations from other insurers.\" (Def.'s Mem. 66.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   It is not dispositive (even if true, which Blue Cross can attempt to show at trial) that Steward \"never discussed any such exception with OHIC.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Steward advances sufficient evidence to suggest it was Blue Cross-and not Steward-that had the burden to raise such exceptions with OHIC. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SDF Ex. 43 at 2, ECF No. 206-43 (\"Issuers [insurers] are encouraged to file such requests [for exceptions].\") ). After all, as discussed above, OHIC regulates health insurers-not hospitals and doctors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   Moreover, the facts suggest that Blue Cross never viewed the OHIC regulations as inflexible as it now casts them, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. 66.), and that Steward did in fact raise the issue of approaching OHIC for an exception, in the context of bundling rate increases and quality metrics with Steward's other hospitals in Massachusetts and Landmark. Steward proposed \"bundling\" reimbursement agreements for Landmark, St. Anne's, and Morton whereby\n   Steward would accept a lower increase for St. Anne's and Morton hospitals to achieve higher rates at Landmark, while still satisfying OHIC. And Blue Cross recognized the potential viability of this approach in spite of OHIC. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , BCBSRI/Steward Proposal Summary August 5, 2012 3, SDF Ex. 186, ECF No. 212-29 (\"BCBSRI agrees with Steward's proposed concept of bundling several of its hospitals in a way that creates value and will allow BCBSRI to justify additional increases at Landmark for 2012; while aligning with the OHIC Hospital Contracting Conditions.\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Moreover, Steward's evidence refutes, or at least creates a factual dispute, with respect to Blue Cross's suggestion that \"[t]he other major insurers in Rhode Island-Tufts and United\" understood too that \"the OHIC regulations were binding.\" (Def.'s Mem. 66;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   2011 OHIC Standards 16, SDF Ex. 44 (\"Too much prescriptiveness may encourage an excessive focus on compliance and discourage the kind of payment reform and innovation which was intended.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (suggesting OHIC approved contracts involving United and Tufts where OHIC conditions were not fully complied with); Dep. of Todd Whitecross at 120, SDF Ex. 31, ECF No. 206-31 (suggesting Tufts offered rate increases above OHIC cap because at that time, it \"didn't have a formal relationship with [Prime]\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   It will be for the jury to decide the extent OHIC regulations entered into the parties' negotiations calculus and whether they or something else caused Steward's alleged injury. This is not simply a question, as Blue Cross suggests, of \"interpreting regulatory text in light of government purposes,\" a matter of law reserved for this Court, (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. 66 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Kolbe v.

Harm to Competition\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Blue Cross claims summary judgment should also enter because there is no evidence that Blue Cross's alleged conduct harmed competition. It argues: (1) merely swapping out one potential buyer (Steward) for another actual buyer (Prime) is of no inherent consequence under the antitrust laws; and (2) Prime's acquisition of Landmark benefited consumers (and thus competition) because Prime charges lower prices than those Steward would have charged. This argument is a silver bullet aimed at the wrong target.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   To create a jury question on harm to competition in this circuit, \"evidence of actual, present competition is not necessary as long as the evidence shows that the potential for competition exists.\"\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530504\" index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/34/1091/#p1103\">\n    34 F.3d at 1100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   court's discussion of harm to competition is particularly instructive.

In other words, there is a difference, Steward contends, in a \"Steward Landmark\" and a \"Prime Landmark,\" and this affects the legal parameters for assessing harm to competition. Blue Cross's own assessments acknowledge that Steward offered something new and different to Rhode Island. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Andruszkiewicz Dep. at 297:9-13, SAUF Ex. 6 (\"The other, which actually is a positive in terms of Steward's acquisition of Landmark, was that we knew that they did bring some innovation, a different kind of model for the way care was delivered, and we thought that was a good thing.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 27:11-27:8, 39:9-39:12 (\"[Dr. de la Torre and Steward] have their model and I think it's an advancement over, you know, what's been happening in Massachusetts\" \"because it's moving away from sort of the siloed sort of approach by providers and the fee for service only, you know, methodology of providers getting paid.\") ). The same was true of Thundermist's early assessments of the Steward model. In a September 28, 2011 email to Montanaro, Jones writes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-179\">\n   met with Steward ...

Even assuming that the calculus is as narrow at Blue Cross suggests, Steward presents evidence that a Steward-owned Landmark would have saved Blue Cross (and therefore consumers) money. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , SAUF Ex. 86 at 6, ECF No. 215-11 (\"Redirection of care to lower cost, non-network community hospital would have tremendous impact on lowering healthcare costs.\"); Eisenstadt Rep. \u00b6 58, SDF Ex. 39, ECF No. 206-39 (\"Steward would not have needed to achieve any volume growth at Landmark relative to 2011 for BCBSRI and its employer accounts to have been financially better off in 2015.\").\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   Noether Rep. \u00b6\u00b6 203-12, SDF Ex. 40, ECF No. 206-40 (Blue Cross's expert concluding Blue Cross saved money with Prime) ).

Like the boy who kills his parents and then pleads for mercy as an orphan, Blue Cross's argument is the height of chutzpah. Steward cannot be faulted for having no direct evidence of the competitive benefits that it could have brought to Rhode Island when the barricade was erected by Blue Cross's allegedly exclusionary conduct.

Blue Cross asserts that Steward could have mitigated all but $800,000 of its damages by accepting Blue Cross's proposed reimbursement rates. This\n   <em>\n    factual\n   </em>\n   assertion essentially acknowledges that summary judgment is not appropriate. In reality, this part of Blue Cross's motion amounts to a motion in limine to restrict the evidence of damages at trial. It asks the Court to shun Steward's liability case as a matter of law. However it is characterized, the argument is rejected. Blue Cross suggests that Steward-in the midst of intense and seemingly ongoing, good-faith negotiations-was required to step back, identify a breach, i.e., an antitrust violation, and then accept Blue Cross's latest offer (having determined it was in bad faith), because not doing so would neglect its duty to mitigate. This is nonsensical, and, not surprisingly, finds no support in the law, in antitrust or otherwise.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Kellett Aircraft Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1225991\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/186/197/#p198\">\n    186 F.2d 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 198-99 (3d Cir. 1950) (\"The rule of mitigation of damages may not be invoked by a contract breaker as a basis for hypercritical examination of the conduct of the injured party, or merely for the purpose of showing that the injured person might have taken steps which seemed wiser or would have been more advantageous ....\");\n   <em>\n    Koby v.

The offer Blue Cross says Steward should have accepted is part and parcel of Blue Cross's alleged anticompetitive conduct; it cannot be said that, as a matter of law, the duty to mitigate required Steward to accept Blue Cross's arguably bad faith offers in order to mitigate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   As to Blue Cross's suggestion that Steward's damages model is based in part on Blue Cross's failure to participate in a\n   \"collaborative relationship\" with Steward and that holding Blue Cross responsible for failing to engage in such a relationship exceeds the law's proscription with respect to \"lawful\" conduct, Blue Cross can make this argument at trial. For now, Steward has created a genuine dispute of material fact that Blue Cross would, if it had acted in good faith, implemented a rate agreement with Steward that included a collaborative, risk-based agreement in year three, which is consistent with an antitrust approach to calculating damages: \"an expert may construct a reasonable offense-free world as a yardstick for measuring what, hypothetically, would have happened 'but for' the defendant's unlawful activities.\"\n   <em>\n    LePage's Inc. v. 3M\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2160839\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/324/141/#p165\">\n    324 F.3d 141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 165 (3d Cir. 2003). Part of the world Steward constructs as the reality but for Blue Cross's refusal to deal with Steward embraces a \"cooperative\" business relationship between Steward and Blue Cross-not because the antitrust laws required such a relationship, rather because the parties projected such an arrangement through their course of dealing. In other words, Steward's expert simply details what is implicit in every contract: the duty of good faith and fair dealing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dovenmuehle Mortg., Inc. v.

It is premature to conclude, as Blue Cross does, that accepting Steward's damages model fails to distinguish between lawful and unlawful conduct. Unlike the many cases Blue Cross cites in which conduct had already been deemed lawful or unlawful, here there is no previously adjudicated, lawful conduct to filter out from Steward's model.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    MCI Commc'ns Corp. v.

This too is complicated, but in summary, Blue Cross proposed shifting patients who used St. Anne's and Morton to the \"BlueCard\" program, which allowed Blue Cross to pay the reimbursement rates negotiated between Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts (\"BCBSMA\") and Steward, rather than renegotiating new contracts with new rates with these hospitals. Blue Cross forecasted that this move would annually save it $3.2 million. But it would lose about half of that because the BlueCard Program imposed a hefty administrative fee. (SAUF Ex. 89 at 4; SAUF Ex. 90.) So Steward offered Blue Cross a better deal: a new direct contract with St. Anne's at the same rates paid by BCBSMA, but without the administrative fee. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    SDF \u00b6 136.) Steward's proposal offered Blue Cross the added benefit that its Medicare Advantage program subscribers could continue to access these hospitals, whereas under the BlueCard program, they could not. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    SAUF Ex. 89; SAUF \u00b6 187.)
