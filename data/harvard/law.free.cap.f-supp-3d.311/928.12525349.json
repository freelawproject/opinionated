KENNELLY, District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   John Cloutier has sued his former employer, GoJet Airlines, for alleged violations of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) (counts 1-8, 10-11) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (count 12). GoJet has moved for summary judgment on all of Cloutier's claims. For the reasons stated below, the Court grants GoJet's motion in part and denies it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   GoJet is a commercial airline that operates flights on behalf of United Airlines\n   and Delta Airlines. Cloutier began working as a pilot for GoJet in 2008, and he became a full-time captain in 2009. On May 31, 2014, Cloutier visited his primary care physician, Dr. Camelia Pop; Cloutier believed he might have diabetes because he was thirsty and losing weight. On June 2, 2014, Dr. Pop confirmed that Cloutier did, in fact, have diabetes mellitus. She instructed Cloutier to start taking Metformin that same day and told him that he should not fly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Cloutier testified during his deposition that he participated in simulator training from June 3 through June 9. He also testified that he contacted Dr. Kitslaar, the FAA medical examiner, after learning of his diabetes diagnosis. Dr. Kitslaar e-mailed Cloutier the FAA protocol for pilots who have been newly prescribed Metformin for diabetes. Under this protocol, Cloutier was required to undergo testing by an Aviation Medical Examiner after taking Metformin for sixty days. He was prohibited from flying until the FAA evaluated his test results and approved the special issuance of a first class medical certificate (Cloutier was required to hold an up-to-date first class medical certificate in order to fly). Cloutier testified during his deposition that he \"probably\" contacted Dr. Kitslaar about his diagnosis on June 3, when he first learned of it. Def.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (Def.'s SUMF), Ex. B (Cloutier Dep.) at 96:22. Cloutier later stated, however, that he might not have called Dr. Kitslaar until after his June 10 appointment with Dr. Pop, after he finished training in the simulator.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 97:17-98:13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Cloutier was scheduled to fly starting on June 11. On June 10, he called the crew scheduling department to inform them that he could not fly because he had begun taking Metformin and would need to undergo testing before the FAA issued him a new medical certificate. On June 12, Cloutier e-mailed Tracey Ryan, GoJet's Chicago Base Manager, to let her know that it looked like he would need to go on short-term disability leave. He explained that he would need to be on Metformin for sixty days and then send his blood tests to the FAA before he could be cleared to fly. Cloutier sent the email from his misterata@aol.com e-mail address. Ryan responded by e-mail the same day. She told Cloutier to \"fill out the FMLA paperwork and have your doctor fax it over to me by Tues of next week,\" which was June 17. Cloutier Dep., Ex. 6. Ryan directed Cloutier to obtain the necessary FMLA forms from the GoJet Intranet. Cloutier testified that he probably read Ryan's e-mail on June 17-the day she stated the FMLA paperwork was due-so he \"rushed to get the stuff back to her.\" Cloutier Dep. at 118:5-118:15. Cloutier obtained the necessary certification from Dr. Pop and submitted it, along with the other required forms, to GoJet. Dr. Pop's certification estimated that Cloutier would be unable to work from May 31, 2014 to July 31, 2014. Cloutier Dep., Ex. 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On the evening of June 17, Ryan sent Cloutier an e-mail to another one of his e-mail addresses-John@jcloutierlaw.com-confirming that she received his completed FMLA paperwork. It is undisputed that either Steve Briner, GoJet's director of operations at the time, or then-Chief Pilot Randy Bratcher dictated the contents of the email to Ryan. The e-mail said, \"I will have your schedule updated for FMLA leave from 6/11/14-7/31/14\" Pl.'s Resp. in Opp. to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. (Pl.'s Resp.), Ex. 5. The e-mail went on to state \"[b]ecause you are on FAA regulatory medication and Pursuant to Section 22.A of the GoJet Pilot Collective Bargaining Agreement, due to GoJet's concern about your fitness to fly, you are required to submit for a medical examination at the office of Dr. Matthew Miriani for your\n   return.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Cloutier responded by e-mail that same evening. In his response, Cloutier quoted Section 22.A of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) as follows: \"A Pilot will not be required to submit to a medical examination in addition to those required by the FAA unless the Company believes that the Pilot's medical condition is impaired and believes the Pilot may not be fit to fly as a result thereof.\" Cloutier Dep., Ex. 9 at 3. Cloutier then stated the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   In order to require me to go to the company's examiner the Company would have to believe that my medical condition is impaired after the FAA has cleared me. It would also have to believe that I may not be fit to fly as a result of that medical condition. Since you are telling me now that I will be required to submit for a medical examination, in what way does the company believe that I am impaired? Who has told you that they feel that my medical condition is impaired? What evidence is there that I am at all impaired?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Obviously the company could not believe that my medical condition is impaired when we are 2 months from me even coming back to work. Thus, paragraph 22.A of the CBA could not apply and I will not be going to the company doctor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Airlines were the biggest abuser of medical exams in order to discriminate against people, mainly in an attempt to keep their future medical costs down...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At Briner's direction, Ryan responded to Cloutier by e-mail the following day and asked him, \"Are you going to see Dr. Miriani as directed, prior to your return from FMLA on 8/1/14? Yes, or No?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Briner was cc'ed on the e-mail. On June 23, Briner himself e-mailed Cloutier. Briner explained that Ryan was on vacation and he had not seen a response from Cloutier; he instructed Cloutier to \"[p]lease respond to me by Close of Business on 6/25/14 with a yes, you will comply or no, you have elected not to comply.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On June 25, after receiving a call from Bratcher about his failure to respond to Briner, Cloutier e-mailed Briner from his misterata@aol.com e-mail account, but he did not state whether or not he would see Dr. Miriani. Instead, Cloutier reiterated \"[m]y condition grounds me from flying until the FAA approves my return\" and detailed the steps that would need to be taken before he obtained FAA approval.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2. Cloutier then noted that he would be happy to help with any of GoJet's pilot recruiting efforts that might be coming up. Briner responded by e-mail later that evening to inform Cloutier that he failed to respond to his question by the deadline. On the morning of June 26, Briner appears to have forwarded Cloutier's June 25 e-mail to Ryan and Bratcher, along with the following message:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   I do not want you to reach out to this man again either via phone or e-mail. Let Randy [Bratcher] know the instant you are back in the office if he calls or sends an e-mail, so we can all discuss. After his FML ends, our intent is to terminate his employment for noncompliance with the law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Pl.'s Resp., Ex. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Cloutier wrote back to Briner via e-mail on June 26. He stated that he had \"no problem at all following what the contract says in paragraph 22A.\" Cloutier Dep., Ex. 9 at 1. Cloutier went on to state that the issue was \"premature\"; he could not return to work on August 1 because he needed to be on the Metformin for at least sixty days before he could get the necessary testing, and the results would have to be evaluated by the FAA Aerospace Medical Certification Division before an FAA medical examiner could issue him a first class medical certificate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Cloutier estimated that the process would take \"about 2 more months\n   minimum,\" and stated that only once that process was complete would it be time to consider the application of Section 22A of the CBA.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   At the end of July, crew scheduling contacted Cloutier regarding whether he would be able to fly as of August 1. Cloutier told them he would not be able to get his first class medical certificate until the end of August or early September. On July 31, Cloutier e-mailed Ryan from his misterata@aol.com address to confirm that he hoped to be back near the end of August. Cloutier testified that, around 5:00 p.m. on August 1, he checked his misterata@aol.com inbox for a response from Ryan, but he did not see one. Approximately an hour and a half later, Ryan sent a response to Cloutier's misterata@aol.com address. In this e-mail, Ryan explained to Cloutier that, \"[b]ecause you are requesting an extension of your FMLA, we will need re-certification FMLA paperwork to approve the extension.\" Cloutier Dep., Ex. 10. She requested that Cloutier provide her with the FMLA re-certification paperwork \"no later than 5 p.m. CST on August 15, 2014.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Cloutier did not submit his FMLA re-certification paperwork by August 15. He testified that he did not see or read Ryan's e-mail until August 19 and that he did not remember checking his misterata@aol.com inbox at any time between around 5:00 p.m. on August 1 and August 19. Cloutier explained that he went for long periods of time without checking that e-mail address \"because it's all junk mail. It's usually nothing significant.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cloutier Dep. at 163:10-163:12. On August 19, Cloutier responded to Ryan's e-mail, explaining that he \"just saw\" it and he would get her the requested documents in a few minutes. Cloutier Dep., Ex. 11. On August 21, Cloutier e-mailed Ryan again to let her know that he was still waiting for his doctor to fill out the FMLA recertification paperwork; he also noted that the FAA had all his testing results and that he did not think it would be long before the agency approved his medical certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Cloutier submitted his FMLA recertification paperwork to GoJet on August 25, 2014. By then, it was too late. Bratcher sent out a \"termination notification\" regarding Cloutier on August 16; he changed it to a \"resignation notification\" on August 17. Pl.'s Resp., Exs. 26-27. An employee status form dated August 18, 2014 reports that GoJet considered Cloutier to have resigned on August 15 due to his failure to return from FMLA leave. Def.'s SUMF, Ex. A (Bratcher Dep.), Ex. 4 at GO JET 000129. And, in an August 22, 2014 letter, Bratcher finally informed Cloutier, \"Your voluntary resignation without notice from employment with GoJet Airlines was processed on August 15, 2014 for failure to return from leave.\" Bratcher Dep., Ex. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Cloutier filed an EEOC charge in September 2014. He alleged that GoJet discriminated against him on the basis of age and disability (diabetes) and retaliated against him for engaging in protected activity. He also filed a union grievance against GoJet in October 2014, alleging violations of the CBA, the FMLA, and the ADA. In November 2015, Cloutier filed suit against GoJet and its holding company, Trans States Holdings, Inc.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois, alleging the following violations of the FMLA (counts 1-11), ADA (count 12), and\n   Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) (count 13). The complaint describes these as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   1. FMLA interference-by terminating plaintiff from his job\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   2. FMLA interference-by only authorizing FMLA requested leave in an amount less than the minimum time that would be required before Cloutier could legally return to work\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   3. FMLA interference-by requiring medical certification sooner than the minimum allotted time under the law\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   4.

GoJet removed the case to federal court in January 2016, and counts 9 and 13 of the complaint have since been dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cloutier v. Trans States Holdings, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20Cow.%201146\">\n    16 C 1146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203181708\">\n    2016 WL 3181708\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D. Ill. June 8, 2016) ; dkt. no. 97 (Stipulation of Dismissal of Count XIII without Prejudice).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   GoJet has moved for summary judgment on the remaining counts. GoJet argues that Cloutier's ADA discrimination claim fails because (1) he cannot establish that he is a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of the ADA, (2) he cannot show that his disability was a but-for cause of his termination, and (3) he failed to participate in an interactive process with GoJet to find a reasonable accommodation for him while he was grounded from flying. GoJet also contends that Cloutier's FMLA claims fail as a matter of law because he was unable to return to work twelve weeks after his FMLA leave began; according to GoJet, this means Cloutier is not protected under the FMLA. Additionally, GoJet argues that summary judgment is warranted on Cloutier's FMLA interference claims because he did not provide GoJet with adequate notice of his need to take FMLA leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   GoJet also makes a number of arguments specific to particular counts in the complaint. First, GoJet asserts that counts 1 and 10 (FMLA interference and retaliation claims based on Cloutier's termination) should be dismissed because Cloutier was terminated for failure to submit his FMLA recertification paperwork by August 15, 2014 or return to work; GoJet\n   argues that Cloutier cannot establish that his termination constituted interference or retaliation under the FMLA. Next, GoJet contends that summary judgment is warranted on count 11 (cancellation of Cloutier's medical insurance as of July 31, 2014) because Cloutier's protected leave ended on that date, due to his failure to timely submit an FMLA recertification form. Additionally, GoJet asserts that the Court should grant summary judgment on counts 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 because Cloutier was not prejudiced by those alleged procedural violations of the FMLA. Finally, GoJet argues that counts 2 and 6 (relating to GoJet's request that Cloutier obtain FMLA recertification to extend his leave beyond July 31, 2014) fail as a matter of law because GoJet was entitled to rely on Dr. Pop's initial FMLA certification, which indicated Cloutier would be incapacitated only through July 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Although Cloutier did not move for summary judgment on any of his claims, he argues in his response to GoJet's motion that the Court can and should grant summary judgment in his favor on the remaining FMLA interference claims (counts 1-8 and 11) as well as the ADA failure-to-accommodate claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court declines Cloutier's invitation to grant summary judgment in his favor; as should be evident from the discussion below, a grant of summary judgment in favor of Cloutier on either claim is unwarranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Summary judgment is warranted \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

To defeat summary judgment on an ADA discrimination claim that alleges disparate treatment, a plaintiff must point to evidence sufficient to establish that (1) he is a qualified individual with a disability within the meaning of the ADA; (2) he is qualified to perform the\n   essential functions of the job with or without reasonable accommodation; and (3) he suffered an adverse employment decision as a result of his disability.\n   <em>\n    Guzman v.

GoJet first argues that Cloutier cannot show that he is a qualified individual with a disability because he experienced only thirst and weight loss as symptoms of untreated diabetes before his diagnosis, and his diabetes has been \"well-controlled and without complications\" since he began taking Metformin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Def.'s Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J. (Def.'s Mem.) at 7. According to GoJet, this means that Cloutier's diabetes does not substantially limit any major life activities and thus does not qualify as a disability under the ADA. GoJet also points out that Cloutier's diabetes itself did not impair his ability to work as a pilot; instead, it was the FAA's requirement that pilots taking Metformin obtain a new medical certificate after being on the medication for sixty days that prevented him from flying. GoJet further argues that, to the extent that Cloutier's diabetes indirectly rendered him unable to work as a commercial airline pilot, his inability to work was only temporary, and he was only limited in his ability to perform that specific job-it did not substantially limit his ability to work in general.

GoJet's attempt to divorce Cloutier's temporary inability to fly from his diabetes is unavailing. In any case, Cloutier need not show that his diabetes substantially interferes with his ability to work in order to establish that he has a disability within the meaning of the ADA; he may show that it substantially\n   interferes with another major life activity, such as the functioning of his endocrine system.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Powell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201135551\">\n    2018 WL 1135551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6. It is undisputed that Cloutier was diagnosed with diabetes in June 2014 and that he was prescribed Metformin to treat this condition. It is likewise undisputed that, prior to starting the Metformin, Cloutier experienced thirst and weight loss. The Court concludes that a rational trier of fact could find that Cloutier's symptoms-though certainly not the most severe symptoms associated with uncontrolled diabetes-nonetheless serve as an indication that his endocrine function is substantially limited by his diabetes. Because the ADAAA defines \"major life activity\" to include endocrine function, it follows that a reasonable jury could find that Cloutier's diabetes constitutes a disability within the meaning of the ADA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   GoJet's argument to the contrary relies almost exclusively on cases that either predate the ADAAA or apply the more restrictive pre-ADAAA disability determination standards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Price v.

ADA failure to accommodate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   GoJet argues that even if Cloutier can show that he is a qualified individual with a disability for ADA purposes, summary judgment is warranted on his failure-to-accommodate claim because he failed to engage in an interactive process with GoJet to explore the possibility of accommodating him while he was grounded from flying.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, GoJet contends that it was willing to provide Cloutier with additional leave but his refusal to see the company doctor (or at least to confirm that he\n   would do so) and his failure to timely respond to e-mails or return his FMLA recertification paperwork resulted in a breakdown in the interactive process. Cloutier disputes that he was responsible for the breakdown in communication and instead contends that GoJet never attempted to discuss possible accommodations with him. According to Cloutier, had this breakdown in communication not occurred, the parties would have been able to identify a number of reasonable accommodations for him, to include (1) granting him additional leave after his initial period of FMLA leave expired; (2) allowing him to help with pilot recruiting; and (3) allowing him to help with pilot training.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The burden of exploring possible reasonable accommodations for an employee with a disability typically lies with the employer.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

This process should identify the precise limitations resulting from the disability and potential reasonable accommodations that could overcome those limitations.\"). If, however, the employee does not attempt to engage in the interactive process or is responsible for a breakdown in that process, the employee may not later claim that his employer failed to accommodate him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ekstrand v.

On the one hand, Cloutier was undoubtedly slow in responding to e-mails from Briner and Ryan, and he did not submit his FMLA recertification paperwork by the deadline GoJet set for him. Additionally, he indicated to Ryan and Briner that he would be unwilling to see the company doctor when they requested that he do so prior to resuming his flying duties. On the other hand, Cloutier's statement in this regard reasonably could be read as simply indicating that it was premature to discuss this point some two months in advance. And Cloutier informed both Briner and Ryan that he would not be able to resume his pilot duties on August 1 because he was still waiting for the FAA approval, and he did offer to assist with pilot recruiting in the meantime. GoJet does not appear to have considered this suggested accommodation-no one responded to Cloutier's offer. In fact, just one day after Cloutier made that offer, Briner instructed Ryan and Bratcher not to contact Cloutier again (though Ryan did, in fact, continue to have contact with Cloutier, to include contacting him to find out if he would be returning to work on August 1 and requesting that he fill out FMLA recertification paperwork). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Cloutier, a reasonable jury could find that the fault for this breakdown in communication lies with GoJet. Because there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding responsibility for the breakdown of the interactive process, the Court denies GoJet's motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    EEOC v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8944161\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/417/789/#p808\">\n    417 F.3d 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 808 (7th Cir. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In its reply brief, GoJet raises at least three new arguments concerning Cloutier's failure-to-accommodate claim. First, it contends that the accommodations proposed by Cloutier-temporary placement in a non-flying position as a pilot\n   trainer or recruiter and additional (non-FMLA) leave-are unreasonable because they would violate the collective bargaining agreement. GoJet alternatively suggests that, because the Court would have to interpret the relevant provisions of the CBA in order to determine whether the proposed accommodations violate the agreement, the Railway Labor Act precludes Cloutier from bringing an ADA claim based on those proposed accommodations. GoJet also argues for the first time in its reply brief that it reasonably accommodated Cloutier by granting him FMLA leave through July 31, 2014 and that Cloutier has not met his burden to prove that a further reasonable accommodation was, in fact available, because he has not produced evidence that he was qualified for a non-flying position or that any such position was vacant at the time in question. GoJet forfeited these arguments for purposes of summary judgment by failing to assert them in its motion for summary judgment and opening brief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Narducci v.

ADA disparate treatment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   GoJet also has moved for summary judgment on Cloutier's ADA disparate treatment claim on the ground that he lacks sufficient evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that his diabetes was a but-for cause of his termination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   GoJet contends that Cloutier was fired because he failed to return to work after the expiration of his FMLA leave or return the FMLA recertification paperwork in a timely manner and because of his apparent unwillingness to cooperate with GoJet's request that he see the company's own medical examiner before returning to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   GoJet also makes much of the fact that Cloutier stated he believed he was terminated because Briner was angry that he was refusing to see the company doctor and because GoJet was concerned about potentially high medical costs Cloutier could cause the company to incur. GoJet contends that his testimony reveals that even Cloutier does not believe that he was terminated because of his disability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 10; Def.'s Reply at 9.

As explained further in Sections B.2.a and B.2.c of this opinion, there are genuine factual disputes regarding whether Cloutier would have been terminated or remained ineligible to fly beyond twelve weeks if GoJet had given him fifteen days to submit his original FMLA certification form and provided him with a FMLA designation sheet informing him of the amount of leave he had been granted, as the law required. The Court therefore overrules GoJet's argument that summary judgment is warranted on all of Cloutier's FMLA interference claims simply because he was not able to resume flying until shortly after his twelve weeks of FMLA leave would have expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

According to GoJet, the temporal proximity between Cloutier's FMLA leave and his termination, along with Cloutier's unsupported claim that GoJet also terminated another employee for use of FMLA leave, is insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact. Cloutier counters that Briner's June 26 e-mail expressing an\n   intent to fire Cloutier once his FMLA leave was up is direct evidence of his retaliatory intent. Cloutier also argues, once again, that a reasonable factfinder could conclude that GoJet's given reasons for his termination are pretextual because they are inconsistent and have shifted over time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   To survive summary judgment on a claim of retaliation under the FMLA, a plaintiff must point to evidence that supports a reasonable inference that he was fired because he requested or took protected leave.\n   <em>\n    Tibbs v.

GoJet further contends that approximately twenty pilots took FMLA leave \"without issue or termination,\" Def.'s SUMF \u00b6 7, but Cloutier disputes that number and notes that at least two pilots have filed lawsuits against GoJet for alleged FMLA violations that occurred during the same period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s SUMF \u00b6 7. As for GoJet's proffered justifications for terminating Cloutier, they are not, as Cloutier suggests, internally inconsistent. Nonetheless, in light of Briner's June 26 e-mail and the way Cloutier's separation was actually characterized when it took place a month and a half later, for the reasons already outlined in the Court's discussion of Cloutier's ADA disparate impact claim, a rational trier of fact could conclude that these justifications are pretextual. Cloutier first informed GoJet of his need to take leave on June 10, and he submitted his FMLA leave paperwork on June 17. On June 25, Cloutier indicated in an e-mail to Briner that he would not be able to fly until the FAA approved his return, which implied that he would either need FMLA leave beyond July 31 or another reasonable accommodation while he was unable to fly. On June 26, apparently in reaction to Cloutier's June 25 e-mail, Briner sent the e-mail to Ryan and Bratcher expressing his intent to fire Cloutier after his FMLA leave ended. Viewing the evidence as a whole in the light most favorable to Cloutier, just as Briner's e-mail could be interpreted as evidence of discrimination in the ADA disparate treatment context, it likewise could support a reasonable inference that he decided to terminate Cloutier in retaliation for exercising his right to take FMLA leave. Accordingly, summary judgment is not warranted on Cloutier's FMLA retaliation claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

It is undisputed that Dr. Pop informed Cloutier of his diabetes diagnosis and prescribed him Metformin on June 2, 2014. It is also undisputed that Dr. Pop told Cloutier on June 2 that he should not fly. What is not clear, however, is whether Cloutier understood on June 2 that FAA regulations prohibited him from flying for the first sixty days he was taking Metformin. As previously explained, Cloutier testified during his deposition that he contacted Dr. Kitslaar, the FAA medical examiner, after learning of his diabetes diagnosis and that Dr. Kitslaar e-mailed him the FAA protocol for pilots taking Metformin.

Cloutier was not harmed by GoJet's alleged failure to notify him in writing of the possible consequences of failing to timely return the initial FMLA certification paperwork: he returned the paperwork by the deadline, and GoJet granted him FMLA leave, backdated to June 11, 2014. Nor was Cloutier prejudiced by GoJet's failure to give him at least fifteen days to submit the FMLA recertification paperwork. It is undisputed that Ryan e-mailed Cloutier the request for FMLA recertification on August 1, 2014. It is also undisputed that Cloutier did not read that e-mail until August 19. Even if GoJet had given Cloutier the full fifteen days to return the recertification, he still would have been required to return it before August 19. Cloutier would not have done so, given the fact that he did not read the e-mail requesting recertification until that date. The same goes for any failure to notify Cloutier of the consequences of failing to timely return his recertification-it would not have made any difference, because Cloutier did not become aware of GoJet's recertification request until after the deadline to return the paperwork had passed. The Court therefore grants GoJet's motion for summary judgment on counts 4, 7, and 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Counts 3 (failure to provide a minimum of fifteen days to return requested FMLA certification) and 5 (failure to provide required FMLA designation and eligibility notices) are not as straightforward. GoJet argues that Cloutier did not suffer any prejudice from being given less than fifteen days to submit his initial FMLA certification because he still managed to submit it by the deadline, and his leave was approved. Cloutier alleges that he was harmed because if he had been given the full fifteen days to submit his initial certification, he might have reviewed the certification more carefully and had Dr. Pop adjust his anticipated return-to-work date beyond July 31, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Although the FMLA certification form did state that \"[y]our employer must give you at least 15 calendar days to return this form,\" in Ryan's June 12 e-mail to Cloutier, she requested that he return the certification just five days later, by June 17.

Specifically, Cloutier testified that as soon as he received the completed certification form, he sent it on to Ryan. He said that if he had reviewed the form before sending it to her, he possibly would have had the July 31, 2014 date extended to \"better reflect\" the timetable for the FAA testing and clearance process.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20825.305\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20825.305\">\n    at 120:14-120:19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Cloutier argues that GoJet would have approved an initial period of FMLA leave into late August if that was what his certification sought, and that if GoJet had approved his leave through late August, it is not likely that the company would have terminated him in mid-August. This is sufficient to permit a reasonable jury to find that Cloutier was prejudiced by being given less than fifteen days to review and submit his FMLA certification paperwork. Accordingly, the Court denies summary judgment on count 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   With respect to count 5, Cloutier argues that because GoJet never provided him with an FMLA designation notice for his first period of leave, he believed that leave had been approved for a period extending until he received a new FAA medical certificate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp., Ex. 2 at 268:18-268:20. An FMLA designation notice states whether an employee's FMLA leave has been approved and specifically informs the employee of amount of leave that that will be counted against his FMLA leave entitlement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Cloutier Dep., Ex. 5 at GO JET 000514. GoJet concedes that it never sent Cloutier a designation notice. Nonetheless, it is GoJet's position that Cloutier knew or should have known that his FMLA leave had only been approved through July 31, 2014 because Ryan's June 17 e-mail to Cloutier specifically stated \"I will have your schedule updated for FMLA leave from 6/11/14-7/31/14.\" Pl.'s Resp., Ex. 5. Cloutier testified that he understood that e-mail to mean only that Ryan had updated his schedule through the end of July to reflect that he was out on FMLA leave-not that his FMLA leave was approved only through July 31.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp., Ex. 2 at 267:2-267:5, 268:18-268:22. Thus, Cloutier argues that he was \"operating based on an incorrect timeline due to a lack of information.\" Pl.'s Resp. at 25. Cloutier contends that if he had been provided with sufficient notice as to when he was expected to return to work, he would have made sure to complete the FAA medical certification process earlier. GoJet responds that this is unsupported speculation; it asserts that Cloutier would not have been able to speed up the FAA's process. Cloutier testified, however, that he \"probably could have had some of [the required] tests done a few days earlier and gotten the paperwork a few days earlier to the FAA.\" Pl.'s Resp., Ex. 2 at 196:11-196:15. He further stated that because he \"did not know of any limitations from the FMLA or what the requirements were, ... [he] did not put a rush on things.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20825.305\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20825.305\">\n    196:16-196:18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Cloutier received his new FAA medical certificate on September 9, 2014, less than a week after his twelve weeks of FMLA leave would have run out if he had been granted the full twelve weeks of leave in the first place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Court notes that Ryan's June 18 e-mail to Cloutier further indicated that his FMLA leave was not approved beyond July 31, 2014, because it asked \"[a]re you going to see Dr. Miriani as directed,\n   <em>\n    prior to your return from FMLA on 8/1/14\n   </em>\n   ?\" Cloutier Dep., Ex. 9 at 3 (emphasis added). Nonetheless, drawing all reasonable inferences in Cloutier's favor, the Court concludes that on this claim, too, he has-if\n   perhaps just barely-presented sufficient evidence to create a genuine factual dispute on the question of prejudice. A reasonable factfinder could conclude that if Cloutier had received the required FMLA designation notice, he would have understood that GoJet had only granted him FMLA leave through July 31, 2014, he would have sent his tests and paperwork to the FAA sooner, and he would have received his new medical certificate prior to September 3, 2014. The Court therefore denies summary judgment on count 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Counts 2 and 6\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   GoJet contends that summary judgment is warranted on counts 2 (authorizing less FMLA leave than the minimum amount of time Cloutier needed to complete the FAA clearance process) and 6 (requiring FMLA recertification despite knowledge that Cloutier's status remained the same) because it was entitled to rely on Dr. Pop's certification, which indicated Cloutier would need leave only through July 31, 2014.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20825.305\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (an employer may require that FMLA leave be supported by a certification issued by the employee's health care provider). After that date, GoJet was entitled to request recertification before approving additional FMLA leave.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20825.308\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (\"If the medical certification indicates that the minimum duration of the condition is more than 30 days, an employer must wait until that minimum duration expires before requesting a recertification ....\"). The Court agrees-and Cloutier does not appear to contest-that summary judgment is warranted on these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Counts 1 and 11\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Finally, GoJet argues that summary judgment is warranted on count 11 (cancellation of Cloutier's medical insurance as of July 31, 2014) because, in light of Cloutier's failure to timely submit an FMLA recertification, he did not have protected leave after July 31. GoJet also contends that summary judgment is warranted on count 1 of Cloutier's complaint (termination as FMLA interference) because, as previously explained, the FMLA does not require an employer to reinstate an employee to his former position if that employee is unable to return to work after twelve weeks of FMLA leave.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Breneisen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3831599\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/701/\">\n    656 F.3d at 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   If termination of his job and health care were the only FMLA violations claimed by Cloutier, the Court would be more inclined to agree with GoJet. But in this case, as the Court has discussed, Cloutier has alleged that he would have been able to obtain his FAA medical certificate and return to work before twelve weeks elapsed and that he would not have been terminated if GoJet had not committed a number of additional FMLA violations prior to his termination. The Court has determined that Cloutier has presented sufficient evidence to survive summary judgment on three of those claims (counts 3, 5, and 10). Because the propriety of Cloutier's termination and the cancellation of his health care coverage is necessarily tied to those three claims, all of which present issues of fact that must be decided by a jury, the Court denies summary judgment on counts 1 and 11 as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants defendant's motion for summary judgment on counts 2, 4, 6, 7, and 8, but denies summary judgment on counts 1, 3, 5, 10, 11, and 12 [dkt. no. 100].
