Currently before the Court are Petitioner's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion [1] to vacate, set aside, or correct his conviction and sentence pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"habeas petition\") and motion [14] for leave to amend pursuant to Rule 15(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. For the reasons stated below, the Court grants Petitioner's motion for leave to amend [14] and grants in part and denies in part Petitioner's motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his conviction and sentence [1]. Specifically, based on a clear error in regard to the computation of Petitioner's criminal history that went unnoticed by trial counsel, appellate counsel, the Government, and the Court and that prejudiced Petitioner going forward, both at his original sentencing and his re-sentencing following a retroactive amendment to the Guidelines, the Court reduces Petitioner's sentence from 168 months to 151 months in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In April and May 2009 and June 2011, Petitioner sold crack cocaine to a government informant known as \"Poochie Man.\" Petitioner was arrested following the June 2011 transaction. At the time of his arrest, Petitioner confessed to Special Agent (\"SA\") Christopher Labno of conducting extensive drug sales since April 2009. According to SA Labno, Petitioner confessed that he had been selling Poochie Man\n   crack for several years and had done approximately ten to twelve transactions with him since 2009, with two transactions for 63 grams and the rest of either an ounce (28.35 grams) or an \"8-ball\" (3.5 grams). R. 107 at 25-28. According to Agent Labno, Petitioner also confessed that from 2009 until the time of his arrest, he \"overall on average\" sold between 63 and 125 grams of crack every 3 to 4 days, for a total drug volume of approximate 11 kilograms (11,000 grams).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at 37-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Petitioner was charged with three counts of distributing crack cocaine, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20841\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). See R. 12. Petitioner pled not guilty. Petitioner also moved to suppress the incriminating statements he had made following his arrest, on the ground that he was so intoxicated that he could not validly have waived his Fifth Amendment rights to remain silent and to have counsel present during questioning. See R. 36. At the suppression hearing, Petitioner testified that he had exaggerated the amount of drugs he sold in order to make himself more valuable to the Government as a potential confidential informant. See R. 107 at 154. The Court \"credited the agents' testimony that [Petitioner] had appeared calm and lucid, said nothing about being intoxicated, talked at length about multiple drug deals, and even tried to negotiate with the agents.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Clay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=562%20Fed.%20Appx.%20531\">\n    562 Fed.Appx. 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 532-33 (7th Cir. 2014). The Court therefore concluded that Petitioner's plea was knowing and voluntary and denied his motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following the denial of his motion to suppress, Petitioner entered a change of plea. See R. 81. Petitioner signed a plea declaration stating that he distributed between 112 and 196 grams of cocaine base between April 11, 2009 and June 9, 2009 and, after a hiatus, distributed between 28 and 112 grams of cocaine base. R. 82. at 7. The plea declaration contained an anticipated advisory Sentencing Guidelines range of 70-87 months' imprisonment, subject to a ten-year mandatory minimum of 120 months, which was based on an anticipated criminal history category of III and an anticipated three-level reduction in offense level for acceptance of responsibility. In the plea declaration, Petitioner acknowledged that he understood the advisory Guidelines calculations were \"preliminary in nature and ... non-binding predictions\"; that \"the Court ultimately determines the facts and law relevant to sentencing\"; that \"the validity of [his] [d]eclaration [wa]s not contingent upon ... the Court's concurrence with the ... calculations\"; and that he would \"not have a right to withdraw his plea on the basis of the Court's rejection of the[ ] calculations.\" R. 82 at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the February 28, 2013 change of plea hearing, Petitioner acknowledged that he had read the plea declaration and reviewed it with his attorney before signing. Petitioner also stated that he understood that he faced a sentence of between 10 years (the mandatory minimum) and life. The Government informed Petitioner and the Court that, at sentencing, it would seek a 2-level enhancement for obstruction of justice and was reserving its right to object to a three-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility. R. 108 at 15-16. The Government took the position that it was a \"close call whether [Petitioner] should be given acceptance if he continues to dispute his own statements to the agents when he has admitted the vast majority of that statement is in fact true,\" and \"the only statements he is not admitting in the statement are the ones exposing him to such a massive sentenc[e] under the Guidelines.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15. Petitioner's attorney took the position that Petitioner should receive the three-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before accepting Petitioner's plea, the Court asked Petitioner if he understood that, \"at sentencing, I will make a final determination as to what Guideline range should apply to this case.\" R 108 at 18. Petitioner responded, \"Yes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court also asked Petitioner, \"if it turns out that the sentence is more severe than you were hoping for or than you expected, do you understand that you still would be bound by your plea and would have no right to withdraw it?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Petitioner responded, \"Yes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Further, the Court asked Petitioner, \"do you understand that the final decision as to what your sentence will be rests with the court?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. Petitioner responded, \"Yes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Petitioner then entered his guilty plea.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court sentenced Petitioner on July 15, 2013. See R. 92. At the sentencing hearing, the Government took the position that Petitioner was responsible for 11 kilograms of cocaine. Petitioner took the position that he should be sentenced based on less than 200 grams. The Court found that Petitioner was responsible for between 280 and 840 grams of crack cocaine. R. 109 at 28, 43-45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court also found that Petitioner had obstructed justice by testifying falsely at the suppression hearing, and gave him a two-point sentencing enhancement. The Court explained, \"that's not mere accident and it's not mere misremembering or not remembering, but there was a lack of credibility that ... suggests a contrived aspect to it rather than accidental or memory loss, and that's really where the court of appeals draws the line on obstruction of justice ... the story he told just doesn't hold together in too many ways with too much detail for it not to have been an attempt to obstruct justice.\" R. 109 at 46-47. The Court also declined to give Petitioner the three-point acceptance of responsibility reduction that he sought. According to the Court, \"with the obstruction [enhancement], as a Guideline matter it would be very difficult\" to also obtain a reduction for acceptance of responsibility, but noted that \"there are circumstances in which you could get both an obstruction and an acceptance.\" R. 109 at 69. \"[I]n any event,\" the Court concluded, Petitioner's acceptance was not as \"robust as you need to\" get the three-point reduction, because Petitioner \"accepted some things and not others[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 70. Nonetheless, the Court gave Petitioner partial credit for acceptance of responsibility by taking it into consideration under Section 3553(a).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49; see also 18 U.S.C.\u00a7 3553(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Court determined that Petitioner's final offense level was 34, his criminal history category was IV, and that the Guidelines range was 210 to 262 months imprisonment. R. 109 at 42. As to the criminal history category, the Court accepted Probation's calculation, which included 3 criminal history points for Petitioner's 2003 AUUW conviction. See R. 84 at 16 (assigning 3 points to conviction). In total, Petitioner was assigned 8 criminal history points, for a criminal history category of IV. See R. 109, at 42, 68 (transcript of sentencing hearing); see also R. 84 at 19 (presentence investigation report showing total of 8 points for criminal history category of IV). Petitioner's attorney did not object to these calculations. The Court gave Petitioner a below-Guidelines sentence of 192 months, \"in part\" because of Petitioner's partial acceptance of responsibility. R. 109 at 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Petitioner filed a notice of appeal to the Seventh Circuit. See\n   <em>\n    United States v. Clay\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=562%20Fed.%20Appx.%20531\">\n    562 Fed. Appx. 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2014). His appellate counsel filed an\n   <em>\n    Anders\n   </em>\n   brief asserting that the appeal was frivolous and seeking to withdraw as counsel.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=562%20Fed.%20Appx.%20531\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=562%20Fed.%20Appx.%20531\">\n    at 532\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

See R. 124, 126.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Petitioner now seeks to vacate, set aside, or correct his conviction and sentence pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Petitioner's motion raises five issues, which are discussed in turn below. Petitioner also seeks leave to amend to add a sixth issue, which is discussed in conjunction with the first, related, issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Petitioner seeks\n   <em>\n    habeas\n   </em>\n   relief under Section 2255. A Section 2255 motion to vacate to set aside or correct a sentence will be granted only if the petitioner establishes that \"the sentence was imposed in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose such sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Seventh Circuit has stressed that \"relief under \u00a7 2255 is an extraordinary remedy because it asks the district court essentially to reopen the criminal process to a person who already has had an opportunity for full process.\"\n   <em>\n    Almonacid v.

A Section 2255 motion is not a substitute for a direct criminal appeal. See\n   <em>\n    Varela v.

Rule 15(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that \"courts should grant leave to amend freely only 'when justice so requires.' \"\n   <em>\n    Vitrano v.

The Court has \"wide discretion\" in deciding whether to grant leave to amend, and typically justice does not require leave to amend where there is \"undue delay, bad faith, or dilatory motive\" or amendment would be futile.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755441\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/721/802/#p806\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5755441\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/721/802/#p806\">\n    at 806, 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In this case, Petitioner filed his motion for leave to amend less than three months after filing his original petition, and less than a month after the Government's brief alerted him of the deficiency in his original motion. See [9] at 13. There are no allegations that Petitioner acted in bad faith or with dilatory motive. Further, as discussed below, the Court concludes that the argument is not futile. Given Petitioner's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   status and the Court's ability to allow amendment where justice requires, the Court concludes that Petitioner should be allowed to amend his habeas petition to assert an ineffective assistance claim based on his counsel's failure to argue that Petitioner should not have been assigned criminal history points for his AUUW conviction.

In\n   <em>\n    Daniels\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that, with the sole exception of convictions obtained in violation of the right to counsel, a Section 2255 petition is not an appropriate vehicle for determining whether a conviction later used to enhance a federal sentence was unconstitutionally obtained.\n   <em>\n    Daniels\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301278\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/374/\">\n    532 U.S. at 382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301278\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/374/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Daniels\n   </em>\n   , however, Petitioner in this case is not using his Section 2255 petition to obtain a determination that his underlying AUUW conviction was unconstitutional. Instead, Petitioner is arguing, based on\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   and an application note to the Sentencing Guidelines, that the AUUW conviction should never have been included in the calculation of his criminal history points because the AUUW was declared unconstitutional and was\n   <em>\n    void ab initio\n   </em>\n   at the time Petitioner was sentenced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Like Petitioner here, the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   had been assigned three criminal history points in his federal sentencing based on his earlier conviction under Illinois' AUUW statute.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920767\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/1092/\">\n    772 F.3d at 1094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Seventh Circuit held on direct appeal that this was error.

The court concluded that the second requirement was met, as well, because \"Jenkins was sentenced after both\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Aguilar\n   </em>\n   were decided:\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   predated Jenkins's sentencing by ten months, and\n   <em>\n    Aguilar\n   </em>\n   by one month,\" and \"\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Aguilar\n   </em>\n   are both, therefore, prior cases.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1098.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Court recognizes that Petitioner was unsuccessful in his attempt to have the Illinois state courts vacate his underlying AUUW conviction.

However,\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   does not require a defendant's underlying conviction to be vacated in order for the conviction to be excluded from the calculation of the defendant's criminal history points. In\n   <em>\n    Jenkins\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit rejected the government's argument that the \"prior case\" requirement meant that the \"defendant's sentence [must] have been ruled constitutionally invalid\n   <em>\n    by the specific court that imposed the sentence\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5920767\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/772/1092/\">\n    772 F.3d at 1098\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).

If the 3 criminal history points for Petitioner's AUUW conviction had not been included in the calculation of the applicable Guidelines range, then Petitioner's criminal history category would have been III under the version of the Guidelines in effect at the time of sentencing, rather than IV.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Guidelines range for a final offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of III was 188-235 months at that time. Petitioner received a 192 month sentence-which was below the range of 210 to 262 months that was calculated using the incorrect criminal history category of IV, but within the range that would have applied if the correct criminal history category of III had been used.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Government argues that even if the wrong criminal history category was used, Petitioner was not prejudiced because the sentence he received was within the Guidelines range that would apply if the correct criminal history category had been used. Further, Petitioner's sentence was subsequently reduced-to 168 months-due to an amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines in 2015 that lowered the base offense level applicable to narcotics offenses. But it is fairly easy to see how this case would have unfolded differently had anyone spotted the error in calculating Petitioner's applicable advisory Guideline range at his original sentencing. A three point reduction in Petitioner's criminal history points based on the exclusion of the 2003 AUUW conviction would have shifted Petitioner's criminal history category from IV to III. The corresponding adjustment in the advisory Guideline range would have reduced the range from 210 to 262 months to 188 to 235 months. Because sentencing is more art than science, it is impossible for the Court to say almost five years after the fact precisely what sentence it would have imposed. Nevertheless, the Court can say with confidence that it would have imposed a sentence below the low end of the properly calculated range-most likely in the neighborhood of 170 to 174 months, which would have been proportionally a similar reduction off the low end of the range as the sentence actually imposed (192 months on a range of 210 to 262 months).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Then, in 2015, when Petitioner sought a further reduction to the low end of the newly-applicable range following the Guidelines amendment, the properly calculated range at that time should have been 151 to 188 months based on a total offense level of 32 and a criminal history category of III, instead of 168 to 210 months using the (still incorrect and uncorrected) criminal history category IV. At that time, the Government took the position, based on: (i) a consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, (ii) defendant's offense conduct and criminal history; and (iii) the absence of any substantial misconduct while incarcerated, that the Court should reduce Petitioner's sentence to the bottom of the revised applicable advisory Guideline range of 168 months. R. 124 at 7-8. The Court accepted that recommendation and resentenced Petitioner accordingly. There is no reason to think that both the Government and the Court would not have taken the same approach to resentencing Petitioner-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , recommended and adopted a sentence at the low end of the (properly calculated) revised applicable Guideline range-had the Guidelines been properly calculated from the start. The upshot of this analysis is that Petitioner is entitled to relief under\n   the applicable cause and prejudice standard, and the Court therefore reduces his sentence to 151 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Whether Petitioner's trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by (1) allegedly representing to Petitioner prior to his plea that he would receive a 3-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility and (2) not moving to withdraw Petitioner's guilty plea\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Petitioner argues that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance at the plea phase by allegedly telling him that he would receive a three-point sentencing reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Petitioner asserts that this was clearly erroneous because defendants virtually never receive the reduction when they have been found to have obstructed justice. Relatedly, Petitioner argues that his trial counsel was ineffective because he did not move to withdraw Petitioner's guilty plea as Petitioner requested prior to his sentencing. An email attached to Petitioner's brief shows that trial counsel told Petitioner that he could not withdraw his plea based on his unhappiness with the presentencing investigation report, because \"there is language in the Plea Agreement to that effect.\" [3] at 35. As to acceptance of responsibility, counsel also told Petitioner that he \"wouldn't worry about it because I think the Judge will rule in your favor on the 3 points.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%208209106\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Petitioner asserts that he could have withdrawn his plea for the \"fair and just\" reason that he did not understand until after entering his plea that \"his counsel's pre-plea colloquy representation that an obstruction enhancement does not lead to a loss of acceptance of responsibility credit was likely a misstatement of law.\" [17] at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court concludes that Petitioner is not entitled to habeas relief on either ground. As an initial matter, Petitioner offers no support for his underlying premise that defendants virtually never receive a sentencing reduction for acceptance of responsibility when they have been found to have obstructed justice. While the Court stated at sentencing that it may be \"very difficult\" to obtain a reduction for acceptance of responsibility after being found to have obstructed justice, it nonetheless recognized that \"there are circumstances in which you could get both an obstruction [enhancement] and an acceptance [deduction].\" R. 109 at 69. Thus, Petitioner has not satisfied\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   's performance prong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Petitioner cannot satisfy\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   's prejudice prong, either. Petitioner was informed prior to entering his plea that the Government was going to seek an enhancement for obstruction of justice and was reserving its right to object to the three-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility. Petitioner therefore knew his potential sentencing exposure before pleading guilty and cannot blame his decision to do so on his counsel's advice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Even if Petitioner had not been warned about the specific sentencing consequences that he complains about now, his habeas claim still would fail because, prior to pleading guilty, he was advised and acknowledged that his sentence could be \"more severe than [he was] hoping for or ... expected,\" that he would \"have no right to withdraw it,\" and that the Court would make the final determinations as to the applicable Guideline range and his final sentence. R. 108 at 18. \"It is well-established that a district court's explanation of the sentencing process to a defendant during the defendant's plea colloquy removes any possible prejudice of counsel's [advice] on the sentencing consequences.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    Harrington v.

Thus, \"[e]ven if we assume that counsel's advice regarding the plea was objectively unreasonable,\" Petitioner cannot show under the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   prejudice prong that, \"absent counsel's erroneous advice, he would not have pled guilty but would have insisted on going to trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Bethel v.

In this case, the Court concludes that trial counsel's decision not to move to withdraw Petitioner's guilty plea was not deficient because Petitioner cannot show that there was a fair and just reason for allowing him to withdraw his plea. Prior to entering his plea, Petitioner knew that the Government was seeking the obstruction enhancement and might object to the acceptance reduction, and more generally knew the sentencing range he faced and that ultimately it was the Court that would determine his sentence. Therefore, Petitioner is not entitled to habeas relief based on counsel's decision not to move to withdraw his guilty plea. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Ill. 2005). Notably, Petitioner does not argue that there was no potential benefit to his testifying at the suppression hearing, or that he was sure to lose the motion. At the time of his arrest, Petitioner admitted to selling large quantities of drugs. If Petitioner's motion to suppress had been successful, it would have prevented Petitioner's damaging admissions from being used against him and made it more difficult for the Government to establish the relevant drug quantity. The fact that Petitioner's testimony ultimately may have harmed him during sentencing is irrelevant, because his attorney's performance must be evaluated as of the time it was made, not in hindsight. See\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cieslowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8951061\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/410/353/#p360\">\n    410 F.3d 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 360 (7th Cir. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Further, Petitioner does not claim that his attorney counseled him to lie to the Court, exposing him to an obstruction enhancement. To the contrary, Petitioner was placed under oath at the suppression hearing and his attorney reminded him that he had \"been sworn to tell the truth.\" R. 107 at 131. And to the extent that Petitioner might fault his attorney for failing to warn him not to lie, \"an attorney's failure to explicitly inform his client of the necessity to tell the truth does not constitute the deficient performance necessary for a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel,\" because \"the obligation to be\n   honest with federal court personnel is an obvious duty and responsibility of all.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Petitioner's counsel argued that Petitioner should receive credit, but the Court was not convinced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court therefore turns to the second part of Petitioner's argument, that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by convincing him to admit to distributing 300 grams of crack cocaine, with the understanding he would receive full credit for acceptance of responsibility. Petitioner asserts that, without this admission, the Government could not have satisfied its burden to support the finding that Petitioner was responsible for the distribution of 300 grams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court concludes that Petitioner has not demonstrated that trial counsel's performance was deficient as to drug quantity. The Government presented evidence-Petitioner's own admission following his arrest-that Petitioner should be held responsible for distributing approximately 11 kilograms of cocaine. Petitioner's attorney's advocacy resulted in the Court rejecting the Government's position. Instead, at sentencing, the Court determined that that drug quantity was \"between 280 and 840,\" the amount Petitioner \"admits to and what Poochie Man says he did.\" [109] at 70. Petitioner's attorney's advocacy-including his advice to Petitioner to admit to the 300 grams-also resulted in the Court awarding him a partial reduction for acceptance of responsibility and sentencing him below the advisory Guidelines range.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   For the reasons explained above, the Court grants Petitioner's motion for leave to amend [14] and grants in part and denies in part Petitioner's motion to vacate, set aside, or correct his conviction and sentence [1].
