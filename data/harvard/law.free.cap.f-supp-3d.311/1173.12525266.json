BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The CFTC alleges the following facts. Monex, located in Newport Beach, California, offers retail customers two type of transactions. (Compl., Docket No. 1 \u00b6\u00b6 14, 24.) Through the first type, which is not at issue in this case, retail customers pay full price for precious metals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) Through the second type, called the Atlas program, Monex offers precious metals on a leveraged, margined, or financed basis: retail customers purchase precious metals by only paying a portion of the purchase price, and the balance is financed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Customers with Atlas trading accounts may take open positions in precious metals, but the trading does not take place on a regulated exchange or board of trade. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) Monex acts as the counterparty to every transaction and sets the price for every trade. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25, 34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When Atlas customers trade \"on leverage\" or \"on margin,\" Monex finances a portion of their trading positions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) Monex requires that Atlas customers deposit funds to serve as margin for open trading positions in their trading accounts, generally 22-25% of the value of the trading account's open positions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) If equity in a customer's trading account declines to Monex's \"call\" level, Monex can issue a margin call and require its customer to immediately deposit additional funds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31.) Monex can change its margin requirements at any time in its sole discretion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Trading positions can be liquidated without notice in \"forced liquidations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) Monex automatically liquidates trading positions if a customer's account equity falls to 7% and can also liquidate a customer's trading position at any time in its sole discretion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Atlas customers must sign an Atlas account agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.) Atlas\n   customers with open trading positions do not take physical delivery of the metals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.) The metals are stored in depositories, subject to contracts between Monex and the depositories. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Atlas customers may only get physical possession of the metal if they make full payment, request actual delivery of specific physical metals, and have Monex ship the metals to them, a pick-up location, or the customer's agent. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40.) When an Atlas customer opens a long position, Monex transfers the customer ownership of all the metals underlying his position. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41.) The CFTC asserts that this transfer is just a book-entry in Monex's records because it can close out the customer's position at any time in its sole discretion, at a price of its choosing, and without notice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) When customers open a short position, Monex claims that it loans the customer metals that the customer immediately sells back to Monex. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42.) The CFTC also argues that this purported transfer is just a book-entry in Monex's records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The CFTC filed suit against Defendants alleging four causes of action for (1) off-exchange transactions in violation of CEA \u00a7 4(a),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; (2) fraud in violation of CEA \u00a7 4b(a)(2)(A), 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6b(a)(2)(A), (C) ; (3) fraud in violation of CEA \u00a7 6(c)(1) and Regulation 180.1(a)(1)-(3),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209\">\n    7 U.S.C. \u00a7 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20180\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)-(3); and (4) violation of CEA \u00a7 4d, 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6d, for failure to register with respect to financed transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

First, the Court must accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true, but \"[t]hreadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice.\"\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, assuming the veracity of well-pleaded factual allegations, the Court must \"determine whether they plausibly give rise to an entitlement to relief.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    at 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This determination is\n   context-specific, requiring the Court to draw on its experience and common sense, but there is no plausibility \"where the well-pleaded facts do not permit the court to infer more than the mere possibility of misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For purposes of ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, the court must \"accept factual allegations in the complaint as true and construe the pleadings in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Manzarekv.St.PaulFire&amp;MarineIns.Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3552352\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/519/1025/#p1031\">\n    519 F.3d 1025\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1031 (9th Cir. 2008).

Instead, the court assessed whether the defendants could take advantage of the cash forward exclusion to the CEA. Second, the court found that the defendants' contracts did not contemplate \"actual delivery\" of the purchased metals because they merely transferred title to the metals.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7415452\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/67/766/#p772\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Though not discussed by the Ninth Circuit, Defendants did not have enough metals on hand to satisfy their delivery obligations.

Even if this Court were to apply the definition of \"delivery\" applicable to the cash forward contract exclusion, Monex's contracts differ from the\n   <em>\n    NobleMetals\n   </em>\n   defendants' contracts. Regardless, the Court is not persuaded that the definition of \"delivery\" applicable to the cash forward contract exclusion similarly applies to the Actual Delivery Exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Moreover, the legislative history of Dodd-Frank supports the Court's conclusion that Congress did not intend to exclude the sort of conduct the CFTC alleges Monex engaged in from the ambit of the Actual Delivery Exception. The Senate adopted an earlier version of \u00a7 2(c)(2)(D) that excluded from the definition of \"actual delivery\" any \"delivery to a third party in a financed transaction in which the commodity is held as collateral.\" H.R. 4173, 111th Cong., 2nd Sess. \u00a7 742(2)(D)(v) (May 20, 2010). The final bill omits this exclusion. \"As a general canon of statutory construction, where the final version of a statute deletes language contained in an earlier draft, a court may presume that the earlier draft is inconsistent with ultimate congressional intentions.\"\n   <em>\n    InreTown&amp;CountryHomeNursingServs.,Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11306360\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/963/1146/#p1151\">\n    963 F.2d 1146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1151 (9th Cir. 1991). The Court therefore presumes that Congress did not intend to exclude the conduct alleged against Monex-the actual delivery of precious metals in financed transactions where the metals are held as collateral by a depository-from the definition of \"actual delivery.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In sum, the Court finds that, based on the Eleventh Circuit's construction of \"actual delivery\" in\n   <em>\n    HunterWise\n   </em>\n   , the CFTC's own final interpretation, and the legislative history of the Dodd-Frank amendments to the CEA, Monex's alleged practices of delivering precious metals to independent depositories within 28-days of their purchase by retail customers on margin falls within the Actual Delivery Exception to the CFTC's authority.

Senator Cantwell introduced \u00a7 6(c)(1) as an amendment to the Senate's version of Dodd-Frank. 156 Cong. Rec. S3099-100 (daily\n   ed. May 4, 2010). Introducing the amendment, Senator Cantwell emphasized that current law made it very difficult for the CFTC to prosecute market manipulation cases because it required the CFTC to prove \"specific intent\" to manipulate. (RJN, Docket No. 172-1, Ex. 4 at S3348.) She noted that the CFTC had only successfully prosecuted a single case of manipulation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Senator Cantwell explained that the amendment would give the CFTC the same \"antimanipulation standard\" as the Securities Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), which only requires a showing of recklessness. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) She noted that the language of \u00a7 6(c)(1) closely tracks \u00a7 10(b) because \"Federal case law is clear that when the Congress uses language identical to that used in another statute, Congress intended for the courts and the Commission to interpret the new authority in a similar manner.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) However, she went on to note that the SEC's manipulation authority is only intended to cause \"those who attempt to affect the market or prices by artificial means unrelated to the natural forces of supply and demand.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) And she noted that Congress recently granted the same anti-manipulation authority to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\") \"as a result of the Enron market manipulation,\" which FERC had used to bring \"enforcement actions against manipulation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Consistent with Senator Cantwell's remarks, Senator Lincoln, then-Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, explained that \u00a7 753 \"adds a new anti-manipulation provision to the [CEA] addressing fraud-based manipulation\" and that the \"new enforcement authority being provided to the CFTC supplements, and does not supplant, its existing anti-manipulation authority.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (RJN, Docket No. 181-1, Ex. 2 at S5920.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Nowhere does the legislative history contemplate extending CFTC's authority under \u00a7 6(c)(1) to allow it to combat fraud absent market manipulation. Senator Cantwell's references to \u00a7 10(b) make clear that Congress only intended to lower the scienter standard to recklessness, not adopt wholesale the full scope of enforcement available under \u00a7 10(b). (RJN, Docket No. 172-1, Ex. 4 at S3348.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Because \u00a7 6(c)(1) unambiguously forecloses the CFTC's interpretation, the Court owes no deference to its interpretation of the statute. However, the CFTC's interpretation of the statute and its regulations is not entirely inconsistent with the Court's construction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prohibition on the Employment, or Attempted Employment, of Manipulative and Deceptive Devices and Prohibition on Price Manipulation,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"156\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041398\">\n    76 Fed. Reg. 41398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (July 14, 2011). The CFTC focuses on footnote 37 in the interpretation, which provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   By way of non-exclusive example, if an entity employed a deceptive device to sell precious metals to customers as a way for the customers to speculate on the value of such commodities, or if an entity employed a deceptive device to sell an agricultural commodity to persons seeking to hedge price risk in that commodity, depending on the facts and circumstances, the Commission would exercise its authority against the entity\n   under Section 6(c)(1) and final Rule 180.1.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041398\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 41401 n. 37. Though the footnote, read in isolation, seems to cover the conduct alleged against Monex, read in context, it is clear that the CFTC only intended for the example to apply in instances of market manipulation. Footnote 37 appends the following sentence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   And although CEA section 6(c)(1) and final Rule 180.1 give the Commission broad enforcement authority to prohibit fraud and manipulation in connection with a contract of sale for any commodity in interstate commerce, the Commission expects to exercise its authority under 6(c)(1) to cover transactions related to the futures or swaps markets, or prices of commodities in interstate commerce, or\n   <em>\n    where the fraud or manipulation has the potential to affect cash commodity, futures, or swaps markets or participants in these markets\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041398\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=76%20Fed.%20Reg.%2041398\">\n    at 41401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Though the Atlas account agreement is not attached to the Complaint or the motion to dismiss, it is attached to the motion for preliminary injunction. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Declaration of Jeffrey Gomberg (\"Gomberg Decl.\"), Docket No. 8-2, Ex. 14.) Monex filed an evidentiary objection to the agreement based on the Declarant's purported failure to authenticate the agreement in the declaration, but did not otherwise contest the authenticity of the agreement. (Docket No. 171 \u00b6 3.) Therefore, the Court can consider the agreement without converting the motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The agreement provides that \"Borrower hereby grants to [Monex Credit Company ('MCC') ] a security interest in: (a) all commodities belonging to Borrower and held for Borrower by Farmers and Merchants Bank of Long Beach, California, Delaware Depository Service Company, LLC, Wilmington, Delaware or any other bailee or bailees substituted by MCC (such bailees are hereinafter referred to individually and collectively as 'Bank'), either directly or in other depositories; (b) all commodities or contractual rights in which Borrower has an interest which shall hereafter be delivered to or come into the possession, custody or control of Bank, [Monex Deposit Company ('MDC') ] or MCC in any manner or for any purpose; (c) all cash deposited with MCC or MDC by or for Borrower; and (d) all Borrower's accounts and debts with MCC.

The CFTC argues that it is an exception to its jurisdiction and, therefore, Defendants bear the burden of establishing that the exception applies. (Opp'n to MTD, Docket No. 164 at 4-6.) Defendants argue that it is an exclusion, meaning that the CFTC bears the burden of proving that the exception does not apply. (Mem. re MTD, Docket No. 41-1 at 24-25.) The Court declines to resolve this argument because, regardless of who bears the burden, Defendants show that the Actual Delivery Exception precludes the application of \u00a7\u00a7 4, 4b, and 4d to Defendants' conduct.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Under the Model Code, physical delivery \"shall be deemed to have occurred if, within the 28-day period, the quantity of precious metals or foreign currencies purchased by the full or partial payment is actually physically delivered (whether in specifically segregated or fungible bulk form) into the possession of a depository (other than the seller).\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2029531\">\n     Cal.

Rather, the metals are stored in depositories subject to contracts between Monex and the depositories which provide Monex with exclusive authority to instruct the depositories as to the disposition of metals .... When an Atlas customer opens a long position, Monex claims to transfer to the customer ownership of all of the metals underlying his position, including the financed portion of the position. This 'transfer,' however, is in reality just a book-entry in Monex's records.... In the context of a short position, Monex claims to loan the customer metals that the customer immediately sells back to Monex. As with a long position, the purported transfer of metals is in reality a book-entry in Monex's records that Monex can close out at any time in its sole discretion and at a price of Monex's choosing.\")\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    There are two reasons for treating long transactions and short transactions similarly. First, by virtue of the CFTC's investigations in 1987 and 1998, Congress was aware of the phenomenon of short sales in commodities in the years before Dodd-Frank was adopted. (\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Declaration of Gregory Walker (\"Walker Decl.\"), Docket No. 169 \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.) Second, and more critical to the goal of the Actual Delivery Exclusion, the commodities are actually there. There is no contention that Monex does not in fact possess the commodity which the customer borrows, and then sells. The investor takes title, and the title is transferred to Monex by virtue of the customer's sale. (L. Carabini Depo., Docket No. 9-2, Ex. 14 at 97-98.) Louis Carabini points out that the borrower need not sell the commodity, but could maintain it, presumably in a depository. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ) The analysis would be different if the commodities borrowed and sold were non-existent. Moreover, possession is no longer relevant when the customer completes the short transaction since the purpose of a short transaction is to sell the commodity and divest the investor of ownership.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    CEA \u00a7 4d(a) applies only to a \"futures commission merchant.\" 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 6d(a).
