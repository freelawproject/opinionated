The Individual Plaintiffs' names do not appear in the contract, and neither of them executed the contract in their corporate or individual capacity.

Rather, under the plain language of the Danzig Agreement, only Gold American Mining Corp. and Danzig, Ltd. agreed to arbitrate their claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    The Individual Plaintiffs are not bound by the Danzig Agreement's arbitration clause through agency or estoppel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \"[N]o signature is required for a person to become party to a contract.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Utah law recognizes that \"under certain circumstances, a nonsignatory to an arbitration agreement can enforce or be bound by an agreement between other parties.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Traditionally, five theories for binding [or allowing enforcement by] a nonsignatory to an arbitration agreement have been recognized: (1) incorporation by references; (2) assumption; (3) agency; (4) veil-piercing/alter ego; and (5) estoppel.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Sometimes a sixth theory, third-party beneficiary, is added, but it is closely analogous to the estoppel theory.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendants argue that agency and estoppel bind the Individual Plaintiffs-who are nonsignatories-to the Danzig Agreement's arbitration clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Defendants arguments, the selection of their cited authorities, and some of the authorities themselves overlook an important distinction between cases in which a nonsignatory seeks the benefit and protection of an arbitration clause and cases in which a signatory seeks to impose arbitration on a nonsignatory. When considering the five or six instances in which a nonsignatory may be benefitted or bound by an arbitration clause, courts must remember the distinction between a nonsignatory seeking to enforce an arbitration clause and a signatory seeking to force a nonsignatory into arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Principles of agency do not bind the Individual Plaintiffs to the Danzig Agreement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Defendants assert that \"around the time that the parties entered into the Danzig Agreement, the Individual Plaintiffs were significant controlling players in the actions of [Gold American Mining Corp.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants maintain that because of this, the Individual Plaintiffs were Gold American Mining Corp.'s agents and should be bound by the Danzig Agreement's arbitration clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants misread the law and therefore misconstrue the legal effect of the Individual Plaintiffs' status as the company's agents. Defendants identify no persuasive authority that an agent is\n   <em>\n    bound\n   </em>\n   by its principal's agreement to arbitrate. Defendants cite only authority holding that agents may\n   <em>\n    enforce\n   </em>\n   their principal's agreement to arbitrate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendants correctly assert that the claims against the Individual Plaintiffs in the Boston Arbitration are closely intertwined with the claims against Inception Mining, Inc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   But Defendants rely on case law inapplicable to the posture of our case. The inapplicable case law holds, or states in dicta, that an agent who is a nonsignatory to its principal's arbitration agreement may\n   <em>\n    compel\n   </em>\n   arbitration of claims made against it by a signatory to the agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   In those instances, the nonsignatory compels the signatory to arbitrate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendants' cases stand for the proposition that \"[u]nder the theory of agency, an agent can assume the\n   <em>\n    protection\n   </em>\n   of the contract which the principal has signed [and c]ourts have applied this principle to allow for non-signatory agents to avail themselves of the\n   <em>\n    protection\n   </em>\n   of their principal's arbitration agreement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n   This \"prevent[s] ... circumvention of valid arbitration agreements by [signatories].

While a nonsignatory agent may compel a signatory to arbitrate, a signatory may not use the agency relationship to compel a nonsignatory agent to arbitrate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Under the agency theory, \"it matters whether the party resisting arbitration is a signatory or not.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is because \"the fact that the defendant corporations entered into [arbitration agreements does] not cause their agents ... who acted only as officers on behalf of the corporations, to be personally bound by those agreements.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[S]tatus as the CEO and CFO and agents of the defendant corporations is insufficient to personally bind [agents] to the [corporations'] arbitration agreements.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[O]nly the [signatory] corporation and not its individual directors[,] officers [and agents are] bound by an arbitration agreement, because the directors[,] officers [and agents have] not personally agreed to arbitrate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Therefore, \"an agent of a disclosed principal, even one who negotiates and signs a contract for her principal, does not become a party to the contract.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   And \"under traditional agency principles, the only other way ... that an agent can be bound by the terms of a contract is if she is made a party to the contract by her principal acting on her behalf with actual, implied, or apparent authority.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendants point to only a single case,\n   <em>\n    Lee v.

But\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable and unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   , a customer opened a securities account with a corporation, and signed a customer agreement containing an arbitration\n   clause.\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   After a dispute arose concerning the management of the account, the customer filed a demand for arbitration against the corporation and against the employee that was responsible for transactions in the customer's account.\n   <footnotemark>\n    72\n   </footnotemark>\n   The employee had not signed the customer agreement and did not appear or participate in the arbitration proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    73\n   </footnotemark>\n   The arbitration panel awarded damages to the customer against both the corporation and the employee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    74\n   </footnotemark>\n   The award was confirmed by the district court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   The employee then appealed on grounds that he was not a proper party to the arbitration because he did not sign the customer agreement and state law would not enforce the terms of the contract against him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the district court's confirmation of the arbitration award against the employee. The opinion confirmed its factual setting: \"[T]he present case is an action seeking to confirm an award already made by an arbitration panel in accordance with a provision in a contract. It is not an issue of validity, revocability or enforceability of the arbitration agreement within the contract.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the procedural posture and standard of review of\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable. In our case, the Boston Arbitration remains pending and Defendants seek to enforce the Danzig Agreement's arbitration clause against the nonsignatory Individual Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Beyond the factual distinctions in\n   <em>\n    Lee,\n   </em>\n   the analysis in\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   is unpersuasive and distinguishable. The Eighth Circuit did state that \"[f]ederal courts have found that an arbitration agreement between a customer and a brokerage firm can ... be binding on the agent who represented or traded in the customer's account even if the agent had not signed the customer agreement.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n   But in each of the cases cited for this proposition, the nonsignatory agent sought to\n   <em>\n    compel\n   </em>\n   arbitration of claims made against it by a signatory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    79\n   </footnotemark>\n   And each case was in the securities setting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    80\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   's reliance on these cases glosses over the distinction between situations in which a nonsignatory is\n   <em>\n    resisting\n   </em>\n   , rather than\n   <em>\n    seeking to enforce\n   </em>\n   arbitration. Nonsignatory agents may compel, but may not be compelled. They may adopt the protection contracted by their principal, but may not be forced to arbitrate against their will. Putting aside\n   <em>\n    Lee's\n   </em>\n   post-award setting,\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   supported its single sentence with cases inapplicable to\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   's factual setting.

While the claims against the Individual Plaintiffs in the Boston Arbitration\n   may be intertwined with Danzig, Ltd.'s claims against Inception Mining, Inc., this intertwining cannot compel the Individual Plaintiffs to arbitrate. This is because an intertwining claims analysis applies only when a\n   <em>\n    nonsignatory seeks to compel\n   </em>\n   a signatory to arbitrate, not when a\n   <em>\n    signatory seeks to compel\n   </em>\n   a nonsignatory to arbitrate. \"[I]t matters whether the party resisting arbitration is a signatory or not.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    81\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The Individual Plaintiffs did not sign the Danzig Agreement in their individual capacity and did not personally agree to arbitrate. And there is no suggestion that Gold American Mining Corp.-with actual, implied, or apparent authority-entered the Danzig Agreement on behalf of the Individual Plaintiffs. Therefore, the Individual Plaintiffs are not bound by the Danzig Agreement's arbitration clause through agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Estoppel does not apply to the Individual Plaintiffs\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Defendants also urge application of estoppel. The estoppel theory is at times referred to as \"nonsignatory estoppel.\" However, use of this term can be problematic, as demonstrated by Defendants and some of their cited authorities' misreading of the law relating to the term. Nonsignatory estoppel is used to refer to situations where a nonsignatory is \"estopped from avoiding arbitration when the nonsignatory seeks to benefit from some portions of the contract but avoid the arbitration provisions.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    82\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the term is also used to refer to situations where a nonsignatory is invoking estoppel against a signatory that is resisting arbitration. The applicability of the estoppel theory depends on the situation,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether the nonsignatory is suing or being sued and whether the nonsignatory is seeking to compel or resisting arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   \"The Utah Supreme Court has recognized three circumstances in which nonsignatory estoppel applies.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    83\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first two circumstances involve \"cases where estoppel [is] implemented\n   <em>\n    against a nonsignatory\n   </em>\n   [.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    84\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the first, \"the nonsignatory has sued a signatory on the contract [for a] benefit but [the nonsignatory seeks] to avoid the arbitration provision of the same contract.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    85\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the second, \"[a] nonsignatory will ... be estopped when it receive[d] a 'direct benefit' from the contract which contains the arbitration clause.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    86\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"This variety of nonsignatory estoppel [is] employed only when the nonsignatory sues the signatory on the agreement after [the nonsignatory] receiv[ed] 'direct benefits' but [then] seeks to avoid arbitration.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    87\n   </footnotemark>\n   In both these factual settings, the nonsignatory either seeks to benefit or has already obtained a benefit from the contract-and thus is estopped from avoiding the contractual arbitration clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The third \"variety of nonsignatory estoppel [recognized in Utah] is that\n   <em>\n    enforced by a nonsignatory\n   </em>\n   when the signatory plaintiff sues a nonsignatory defendant on the contract but seeks to avoid the contract-mandated arbitration by relying on the fact that the defendant\n   is a nonsignatory.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    88\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this factual setting, the signatory is estopped from denying the clause applies.
