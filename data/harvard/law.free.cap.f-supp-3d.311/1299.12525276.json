Pariente, Justice R. Fred Lewis, Justice Peggy A. Quince, Justice Charles T. Canady, Justice Ricky Polston, Justice James E.C. Perry, Judge Bronwyn Miller, and Judge Eric Hendon (collectively, the \"Judicial Defendants\") [DE 32], and The Florida Bar's and Randi Lazarus' Motion to Dismiss [DE 33]. The Court has carefully considered the Motions, the Responses, the Reply,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and is otherwise fully advised in the premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff is a former attorney who was suspended for two years in 2013 and permanently\n   disbarred in 2015 when he continued representing his former client, David Beem, despite the suspension. \u00b6 1, 3, 27, 75.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The operative pleading is the Amended Complaint (\"AC\") [DE 20], filed herein on March 12, 2018. The AC alleges numerous federal and state law claims against all those who prosecuted and adjudicated the disciplinary cases, including the Judicial Defendants (made up of the Florida Supreme Court Justices, and two Miami-Dade Circuit Judges appointed as referees by the Florida Supreme Court), The Florida Bar, and Bar counsel (Lazarus). The AC also brings claims against The Miami New Times (\"MNT\"), which published two articles reporting Plaintiff's disciplinary history. \u00b6 220. Plaintiff seeks to invalidate his disbarment and obtain damages for himself and his former client, Beem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The AC contains eleven counts against Defendants: Count I for Abuse of Process against the Florida Bar and Lazarus; Count II for Fraudulent Concealment and Misrepresentation against the Bar Defendants;\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Count III for Unconstitutional Deprivation of Property and Liberty against the Bar Defendants; Count IV for Obstruction and Perversion of Justice against the Bar Defendants; Count V for Tortious Interference with an Advantageous Business Relationship against the Bar Defendants; Count VI for Deprivation of the Right to Contract against the Bar Defendants; Count VII for Deprivation of Access to the Courts against the Florida Bar and Lazarus; Count IX for Defamation/False Light against MNT; Count X for violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act against Miller, Labarga, Pariente, Lewis, Quince, Canady, Polston, and Perry; and Count XI for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief against The Florida Bar and Lazarus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss all claims contained in the AC for a variety of reasons. The Court finds that the AC is subject to dismissal with prejudice for the reasons stated herein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2), a pleading must contain a \"short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\" Fed.

The first article is entitled\n   <em>\n    Is Jeffrey Norkin Florida's Most Obnoxious Lawyer? The State Supreme Court Seems to Think So,\n   </em>\n   published December 10, 2013.

First, this Court is not aware of any precedent, and Plaintiff cites none, indicating that a defamation claim ripens only after Defendant has been informed of the allegedly defamatory content. Pre-suit notice to Defendant MNT under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20770.01\">\n    Fla. Stat. \u00a7 770.01\n   </extracted-citation>\n   did not start the statute-of-limitations clock. Instead, publication of the articles started the clock. Second, Courts considering the argument presented by Plaintiff-a multiple publication rule applicable to articles available on the internet-have routinely rejected that argument. There is a single publication rule in Florida involving \"any one edition of a newspaper, book, or magazine,\" with a statute of limitations that accrues at the time of the first publication.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20770.05\">\n    Fla.

These decisions are not binding but nonetheless instructive. This Court declines Plaintiff's invitation to depart from the single publication rule for all material available on the internet because it would eviscerate the statute of limitations and expose online publishers to limitless liability. Finally, Plaintiff's claim for injunctive relief changes nothing about the applicable statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The articles were published on December 10, 2013 and October 16, 2015, respectively. Plaintiff filed his initial Complaint on January 23, 2018-more than two years after each article was published. Therefore, Plaintiff's claim for defamation is dismissed as time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    The Judicial Defendants' Motion to Dismiss is Granted\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Judicial Defendants, comprised of Florida Supreme Court Justices and two Miami-Dade Circuit Judges, argue that the claims against them are barred for six reasons. They argue that the claims are barred by: (1) the\n   <em>\n    Rooker-\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   doctrine; (2) lack of standing; (3) judicial immunity; (4) Florida's litigation privilege; (5) the statute of limitations; and (6) failure to state claim upon which relief can be granted. The Court need not address all these independent bases for dismissal. All claims against the Judicial Defendants are dismissed\n   because Defendants are protected by judicial immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   All claims against the judges relate solely to their conduct in adjudicating Plaintiff's disciplinary proceedings. These claims are dismissed under the doctrine of judicial immunity. \"Judges are entitled to absolute judicial immunity from damages for those acts taken while they are acting in their judicial capacity unless they acted in the 'clear absence of all jurisdiction.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bolin v.
