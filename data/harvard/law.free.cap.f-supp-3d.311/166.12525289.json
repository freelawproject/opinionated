Fernandez pleaded guilty to, and was sentenced on, one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine knowing and intending that it would be unlawfully imported into the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Judgment [ECF No. 299]. Fernandez had pleaded pursuant to an agreement that contained, among other provisions, a waiver of his right to appeal most aspects of his plea and sentence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plea Agreement [ECF No. 247] \u00b6 19. In March 2016, Fernandez filed this motion, arguing that the attorneys who represented him at his first\n   plea hearing, at his second plea hearing and sentencing, and on his direct appeal were each ineffective in allowing him to agree to the appeal waiver, and that he did not understand what the court-appointed translator said to him during his plea hearing, rendering the waiver involuntary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Def.'s Mot.\") [ECF No. 404] at 5-9. For the reasons explained below, the Court will deny Fernandez's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The government indicted Fernandez in January 2010 on three charges: two counts of conspiracy to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and one count of conspiracy to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine knowing and intending that the cocaine would be unlawfully imported into the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseding Indictment [ECF No. 4] at 2-3, 7. On November 10, 2011, Fernandez signed an initial plea agreement, in which he agreed to plead guilty to the conspiracy-to-import count in exchange for the government's agreeing to dismiss the other two counts; agreed to the statement of facts that underlay the conspiracy-to-import count; and waived his appeal rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Plea Agreement [ECF No. 107] \u00b6\u00b6 1-3, 19. The same day, Fernandez pleaded guilty, and the Court accepted the plea.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Min. Entry of Nov. 10, 2011. Robert E. Abreu represented Fernandez during the plea bargaining process and at the November 2011 plea hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. of Nov. 10, 2011 Plea Hearing [ECF No. 408-4] at 2:9-:10, 17:6-:11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   However, Fernandez later sent a letter to the Court requesting new counsel, and Abreu moved to withdraw as counsel in February 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. to Withdraw [ECF No. 131]. The Court granted Abreu's motion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Min. Entry of Mar. 13, 2012, and Brian W. Stolarz was then appointed counsel for Fernandez under the Criminal Justice Act,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Notice of Appearance [ECF No. 211]. On August 13, 2012, Fernandez (through Stolarz) agreed to accept his prior plea again, with a few changes not relevant here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plea Agreement at 11; Tr. of Aug. 13, 2012 Plea Hr'g [ECF No. 408-11] at 2:7-:9, 16:2-:5. The government asked the Court to conduct a new plea colloquy with Fernandez under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11, \"to cure any possible Sixth Amendment taint or any other issues that have come up in the past.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. of Aug. 13, 2012 Plea Hr'g at 2:9-:12. The Court agreed to conduct a new colloquy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At the outset of the colloquy, the Court asked Fernandez whether he could \"understand these proceedings through the use of the interpreter,\" to which Fernandez replied: \"Yes, I am understanding it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at 17:25-18:2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court informed Fernandez: \"If you don't understand anything about these proceedings or any question that I ask, just let me know and I'll try to explain. If at any time you wish to consult with Mr. Stolarz, let me know that, and you'll be able to talk to him privately.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 17:5-:8. The Court then conducted the colloquy, during which the Court asked Fernandez whether he understood that, \"by pleading guilty, [he] would be generally giving up [his] rights to appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 25:9-:11.

Yes, of course.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 25:12-:13. The Court also asked whether Fernandez had had a sufficient opportunity to discuss the charge with Stolarz, to which Fernandez gave an affirmative response,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 27:9-:13; the Court then described the charge against Fernandez, and Fernandez stated that he understood the charge,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 27:14-:22. The Court fully explained the appeal waiver and, after Fernandez again told the Court that he understood that he was waiving his right to appeal, the Court found that the waiver had been discussed with counsel and that Fernandez had\n   knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at 39:14-40:22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

There, Fernandez said that he \"ha[d] not participated in any criminal groups, let alone any drug trafficking,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at 27:25-28:2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , but acknowledged his \"participation\" in criminal activity and that he knew he had \"made a mistake,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at 27:8, 27:24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After arguments from each side, during which Stolarz argued for a sentence significantly below the Guide lines range, the Court sentenced Fernandez to 144 months' imprisonment, within but on the low end of his Guidelines range.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n    at 30:11-13, 32:24-33:4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Fernandez appealed his sentence, represented this time by Joseph R. Conte.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Fernandez\n   </em>\n   , Crim. No. 12-3096 (D.C. Cir. filed Nov. 29, 2012). Fernandez argued that his sentence was unreasonable; however, as he did not challenge his appeal waiver, the D.C. Circuit dismissed the appeal on December 1, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Fernandez asserts, first, that Abreu was ineffective because Abreu coerced him to plead guilty to a crime Abreu knew he had not committed and then told him to sign away his right to appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=624%20Fed.%20Appx.%203\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=624%20Fed.%20Appx.%203\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Fernandez then claims that Stolarz was ineffective because Stolarz advised him to waive his right to appeal, knowing \"it is wrong\" so to advise, and took him to sentencing despite knowing that Abreu had advised him inaccurately during his first plea hearing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=624%20Fed.%20Appx.%203\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=624%20Fed.%20Appx.%203\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Next, Fernandez asserts that the Court erred in finding that he had knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to appeal, since he had not understood the court-appointed translator and therefore did not realize he had waived his right to appeal, \"because I did not committed [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] any crime in America.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=624%20Fed.%20Appx.%203\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=624%20Fed.%20Appx.%203\">\n    at 7-8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finally, Fernandez claims that Conte was ineffective for not having challenged the waiver on direct appeal despite knowing that Fernandez had not understood to what he was agreeing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=624%20Fed.%20Appx.%203\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=624%20Fed.%20Appx.%203\">\n    at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In doing so, Fernandez stated that he had \"read this Plea Agreement with the assistance of a federally certified English-Spanish court interpreter, and ha[d] discussed it at length with [his] attorney ... with the assistance of a federally certified English-Spanish court interpreter,\" and that he \"fully underst[oo]d this Plea Agreement and agree[d] to it without reservation.\" Plea Agreement at 11. \"A written plea agreement in which the defendant waives the right to appeal is strong evidence that the defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived the right to appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516707\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/503/#p506\">\n    888 F.3d at 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The appeal waiver in the plea agreement was clear, informing Fernandez that he was agreeing \"to waive his right to appeal the finding of guilt as well as the sentence imposed\" and \"the manner in which the sentence was imposed.\" Plea Agreement \u00b6 19. Stolarz, his counsel, also agreed that he had \"discussed the appeal waiver with the defendant\" and that he would request a specific finding from the Court \"regarding the defendant's knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516707\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/503/#p506\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Fernandez and Stolarz signed the plea agreement on August 13, 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. of Aug. 13, 2012 Plea Hr'g at 28:10-29:4. Both the existence and the specifics of the agreement therefore support a finding that Fernandez knowingly waived his appeal rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The record of the August 13, 2012 plea hearing provides further evidence that Fernandez knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his right to appeal. Upon questioning by the Court, Fernandez confirmed that he had been educated \"through the fifth year of high school,\" Tr. of Aug. 13, 2012 Plea Hr'g at 18:3-:6; that he understood the consequences of the charge to which he would be pleading guilty,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18:10-19:4; that he understood what was happening at the hearing and was not sick or taking medication that could interfere with his ability to understand the proceedings,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:6-:23; that he had had sufficient time to consult with Stolarz about the case,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 20:2-:20; and that he had not been threatened or coerced into entering his guilty plea,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 42:1 8-:20. The Court, considering these responses and Stolarz's representation that he believed Fernandez competent to make his plea, found that Fernandez was competent, understood the plea agreement, and was pleading voluntarily.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at\n   45:3-:9. The Court also made sure that Fernandez understood that he had the right to appeal, and explained the details of the appeal waiver to which Fernandez was agreeing by pleading guilty.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39:8-40:14. Fernandez acknowledged that he understood all of the provisions of the appeal waiver, and the Court made \"a specific finding that this has been discussed with [his] counsel\" and that he had \"knowingly and voluntarily waived [his] right to appeal ... to the extent set out in this agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40:15-:22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The records of the plea hearing also undermine Fernandez's specific claim that he could not understand what others were saying to him. The Court asked Fernandez during the hearing whether he was able to understand the proceedings through the use of the court interpreter, and Fernandez responded: \"Yes, I am understanding it.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17:25-18:2. Nowhere in his \u00a7 2255 petition or his reply does Fernandez provide any reason why he would (or could) have said he understood the proceedings if, in fact, he could not understand what the translator was telling him. Additionally, the Court told Fernandez that he should ask the Court if he did not understand anything about the proceedings or wished to consult with Stolarz,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17:5-:8, and Fernandez followed this suggestion several times during the hearing. For instance, when the Court explained the rights Fernandez would have if he were to plead not guilty, Fernandez responded: \"I understand, but if I were to decide that way, I would go to trial; isn't that right, Your Honor?\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22:24-:25. Likewise, he told the Court when he wished to speak to his attorney.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 42:25. And he elaborated on his responses to a number of the Court's questions, thereby showing that he clearly understood the questions asked of him.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:1-:23, 21:3-:6, 23:3-:5, 23:21-:22, 34:8-:1 1. Thus, when Fernandez said that he \"of course\" understood that he would be waiving his right to appeal,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 25:12-:13;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 40:17 (\"I do understand.\"), there is every indication that he did, indeed, understand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The entire record confirms that Fernandez knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily agreed to the appeal waiver in his plea agreement. Hence, his claim to the contrary will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Even if an appeal waiver is otherwise voluntary, courts will not enforce it if \"the defendant makes a colorable claim he received ineffective assistance of counsel in agreeing to the waiver.\"\n   <em>\n    Lee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516707\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/503/#p506\">\n    888 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   507 n.1 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Guillen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7329795,3480364\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/561/527/\">\n    561 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   530-31 ). Fernandez raises IAC claims against Abreu, Stolarz, and Conte for their actions at different stages of the case in this Court and on direct appeal. The Court examines each claim in turn, and finds each wanting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Ineffective Assistance Claim Against Abreu\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Fernandez first brings an IAC claim against his original trial counsel, Abreu, whom Fernandez says \"Coerced his Client to Plea[d] Guilty to a crime that he kn[e]w that his Client did not commit[ ], and then Told his client to Sign[ ] away his Right of Appeal.\" Def.'s Mot. at 5. The problem with this claim is that Abreu no longer represented Fernandez when Fernandez negotiated his final plea agreement and pleaded guilty. Abreu had withdrawn, and Stolarz helped Fernandez renegotiate a plea agreement that would give him a lower Guidelines range.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. of Aug. 13, 2012 Plea Hr'g at 2:3-:5, 4:8-:13. The Court set a side Fernandez's earlier guilty plea,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Min. Entry of Nov. 10, 2011, and conducted a full new plea hearing. As the government pointed out, this second hearing was designed to-and did-\"cure any\n   possible Sixth Amendment taint or any other issues that have come up in the past.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. of Aug. 13, 2012 Plea Hr'g at 2:9-:12. Additionally, the Court asked Fernandez at that second hearing whether he had had the opportunity to discuss the proposed plea and whether to plead guilty with counsel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20:25-21:2. Fernandez responded: \"I have been willing to plead guilty from the beginning. Now that everything has been ironed out and things have been done correctly, yes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21:3-:6. This response confirms that the renegotiation and rehearing process had eliminated any alleged negative effect from Abreu's representation. Hence, Fernandez cannot \"affirmatively prove prejudice,\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and his IAC claim against Abreu will be denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Ineffective Assistance Claim Against Stolarz\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Fernandez next asserts that Stolarz was ineffective, in two ways: first, by allowing Fernandez to agree to the appeal waiver; and second, by taking Fernandez to sentencing when he \"kn[e]w about all of the Inaccurate Advises ... given to his client, By Attorney Robert Abreu, at his plea agreement hearing.\" Def.'s Mot. at 6. The second half of this claim is easily disposed of. Even assuming Abreu had given Fernandez inaccurate advice, Fernandez later fired Abreu, worked with Stolarz to renegotiate the plea deal, and underwent a second plea hearing. Just as this second plea process undercuts Fernandez's claim against Abreu, so too does it show that the effect of Abreu's advice-if indeed it had been inaccurate-was washed away by Fernandez's new attorney and new plea hearing. Stolarz's decision to take Fernandez to sentencing therefore caused Fernandez no prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 691-92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Stolarz also did not render ineffective assistance by advising Fernandez to agree to the plea waiver.

There is a decent argument to be made that Conte's actions, as described by Fernandez, would fall below an objective standard of reasonableness.
