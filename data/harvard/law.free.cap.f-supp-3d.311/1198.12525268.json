ECF No. 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At its heart, this case involves a dispute over a dirt road in Storey County, Nevada, commonly known as \"Sutro Springs Road.\" In October 2016, plaintiff Lori L. Thomas (\"Thomas\") purchased approximately 40 acres of real property within Storey County\n   located near Dayton, Nevada. This property, originally carved out of a 960 acre parcel of land in Storey County, was taken out of the public domain and transferred to private ownership by United States Land Patent No. 27-68-0138 recorded February 8, 1968 (\"1968 patent\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The property conveyed by the 1968 patent was subsequently divided into smaller parcels through the Storey County development process. On August 15, 1995, the Storey County Board of Commissioners approved a subdivision of one of the parcels adjacent to the property. The final subdivision map (\"1996 map\") was recorded in Storey County on January 10, 1996, as Document No. 77085.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Sutro Springs Road is a now-paved road running through the approved subdivision. The paved portion of the road terminates in a cul-de-sac at the edge of the underlying property. A visible dirt road then continues across the property in a northeasterly direction, continues onto public land managed by the Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\"), and ultimately leads to homeowner defendants Harper's and the Zachrys' private properties above the public land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After Thomas purchased the property in October 2016, she erected barriers and obstacles, along with no trespassing signs, at the location where Sutro Springs Road transitions from the paved road ending in the cul-de-sac to the dirt road entering the property. In response, the Storey County District Attorney advised Thomas by letter that the dirt road across her property was a long-established public road and requested that she remove the barriers. Thomas refused. Then, in April 2017, during its regularly scheduled meeting, the Storey County Board of Commissioners approved a project to allow the Storey County Public Works Department to remove all the obstructions placed on the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 7, 2017, Thomas filed a complaint against defendants alleging four causes of action: (1) petition for writ of mandamus against Storey County; (2) a Fifth Amendment takings claim; (3) injunctive relief; and (4) declaratory relief and quiet title to the roadway over the property. ECF No. 1. Then, on April 10, 2017, Thomas filed a motion for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin Storey County from removing the obstructions she had placed on the road. ECF No. 3 The motion was denied by the court. ECF No. 41.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 22, 2017, after the court's order denying her motion for a preliminary injunction, Thomas transferred her interest in the underlying property to another individual. In light of her transfer of the property, Thomas moved to dismiss her complaint in its entirety. ECF No. 58. Her motion was granted in part and denied in part by the court. ECF No. 63. In that order, the court granted Thomas' motion to dismiss her non-\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   claims for a writ of mandamus, her Fifth Amendment takings claim, and her injunctive relief claim because those claims did not concern the title and nature of Sutro Springs Road as it crosses the underlying property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   However, the court denied Thomas' motion as to her declaratory relief and quiet title claim as that claim was brought\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   to determine the rights to Sutro Springs Road as it crosses the property against all other persons including the named defendants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thereafter, defendants filed the present unopposed motion for summary judgment. ECF No. 70.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Legal Standard\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate only when the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, affidavits, declarations, party stipulations, admissions, and other relevant materials in the record fairly establish that \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" FED.

In fact, in\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   , the Nevada Supreme Court found an R.S. 2477 road based solely on the road's presence on maps and surveys.\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8556968\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/96/318/\">\n    608 P.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1098 n.5. Thus, the clear weight of the undisputed historical-record in this action supports a finding that Sutro Springs Road is a public R.S. 2477 road as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Additionally, defendants have submitted evidence from citizens of Storey County concerning their use of the road prior to and after the 1968 land transfer. In particular, defendants have proffered four affidavits from individuals who used the road prior to 1968 and have continued to use the road in a manner consistent with the land since that time, such as accessing hot springs, trips for hunting, mining and reaching public land for camping and other outdoor activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 38, Exs. 4-7. Further, homeowner defendants presented their own declarations to the court establishing their own personal use of the road for decades prior to Thomas' purchase of the property: 34 years in the case of defendant Harper and 44 years in the case of the Zachry defendants.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 39, Exs. 1-2. The court finds that this additional evidence is also sufficient to establish continuous public use of the road to\n   constitute acceptance of an R.S. 2477 road across the underlying property. Therefore, the court finds that the overwhelming and undisputed evidence in this action establishes that Sutro Springs Road is a public R.S. 2477 road and that defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the remaining declaratory relief and quiet title claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that defendants' motion for summary judgment (ECF No. 70) is GRANTED. The clerk of court is directed to enter judgment in favor of defendants Thomas Zachry, Marna Zachry, John Harper, and Storey County and its Board of Commissioners and against plaintiff Lori L. Thomas on plaintiff's sole remaining cause of action for declaratory relief and quiet title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that defendant Storey County and its Board of Commissioners shall serve a copy of this order on the current owner and any other parties known to have or be claiming an interest in the underlying property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   DATED this 3rd day of May, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    A copy of the 1968 patent is attached to Thomas' motion for a preliminary injunction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 3, Ex. 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    A copy of the 1996 map is attached to Thomas' motion for a preliminary injunction.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    ECF No. 3, Ex. 2.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    In 1976, Congress passed the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (\"FLPMA\"), which repealed R.S. 2477.

Thus, if the disputed road was an R.S. 2477 road in 1968 when the property was transferred from the public domain, it continues to be such a road unless the road has been abandoned.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Defendants have proffered the following undisputed historical maps of the relevant area of Storey County: (1) an 1887 survey of the Storey County township (ECF No. 21, Ex. 1); (2) an 1890 township plat map (ECF No. 21, Ex. 2); (3) the official county map for Storey County in 1923 (ECF No. 21, Ex. 3); (4) a 1950 United States Geological Survey of the \"Virginia City Quadrangle\" (ECF No. 21, Ex. 4); and (5) a 1967 United States Geological Survey of the \"Flowery Peak Quadrangle\" (ECF No. 21, Ex. 5).
