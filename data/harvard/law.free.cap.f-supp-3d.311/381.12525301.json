Although the defendants produced no declarations in this case, the evidence submitted by the plaintiff points to the same conclusion.

In\n   <em>\n    Short\n   </em>\n   , a preliminary determination had been made to grant the plaintiff's request, but the request was misplaced and the agency was reminded of the request only after the lawsuit was filed, at which point the agency conducted its search and released the records at issue.\n   <em>\n    Short\n   </em>\n   , 613 F.

Likewise, in\n   <em>\n    Harvey\n   </em>\n   , the agency had not produced any records by the time the complaint was filed, but one week after filing, the agency sent the plaintiff a satisfactory release.\n   <em>\n    Harvey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4356979\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/178/5/\">\n    178 F.Supp.3d at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Mobley\n   </em>\n   , the government \"voluntarily processed the plaintiffs' request only three weeks after the complaint was filed,\" and the plaintiffs then voluntarily dismissed their complaint.\n   <em>\n    Mobley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3834096\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/908/42/\">\n    908 F.Supp.2d at 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
