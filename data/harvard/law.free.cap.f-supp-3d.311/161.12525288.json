The Department of Justice, of which EOUSA is a component, has moved for summary judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 (ECF No. 10). For the reasons explained below, the motion will be GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 11, 2016, Plaintiff requested copies of \"Grand jury minutes (transcripts) taken on November 6th 2013\" pertaining to his criminal indictment in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. (Decl. of Vinay J. Jolly, ECF No. 10-1, Ex. A). Such records \"were originally maintained in the criminal case\n   <em>\n    United States v. Roble\n   </em>\n   , No. 13-CF1-6095.\" (Jolly Decl. \u00b6 9). Plaintiff wrote that he had \"been provided with several other transcripts from the grand jury ... taken on April 17, 19, 24th, May\n   10, 15 and 16th, 2013 prepared by your Office.\" (Jolly Decl., Ex. A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   By letter of November 22, 2016, EOUSA denied Plaintiff's request on the erroneous premise that he had sought third-party records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. B). Plaintiff appealed to the Office of Information Policy (\"OIP\"), which accurately described the request as seeking \"access to grand jury minutes from [Plaintiff's] criminal case recorded on November 6, 2013\" but nonetheless affirmed EOUSA's denial \"on modified grounds.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. E). OIP explained: \"To the extent that the specific grand jury records that you seek exist, any such records would be protected from disclosure pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3),\" which \"concerns matters specifically exempted from release by a statute other than the FOIA[,]\" (Ex. E). OIP cited \" Rule 6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which pertains to the secrecy of grand jury proceedings.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). It stated that because any responsive records \"would be categorically exempt from disclosure, EOUSA was not required to conduct a search for the requested records.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).
