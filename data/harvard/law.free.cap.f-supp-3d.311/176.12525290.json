Post Acute claims that the rule violates the Administrative Procedure Act and the Medicare Act because it is arbitrary and capricious and was promulgated with insufficient notice. Before the Court are Post Acute's Motion for Summary Judgment, Dkt. 16, and HHS Secretary Alex M. Azar II's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, Dkt. 17.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons that follow, the Court will deny Post Acute's motion and grant the Secretary's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Medicare is a federal health insurance program administered by HHS that primarily serves elderly or disabled people. Under the Medicare Act, when a long-term care hospital discharges a Medicare beneficiary, HHS pays the hospital with predetermined standard rates rather than reimbursing actual costs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act, Pub. L. No. 106-113, \u00a7 123 (1999) (codified as a note to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395ww ) (directing the HHS Secretary to \"develop a per discharge prospective payment system for payment for inpatient hospital services of long-term care hospitals\"). The hospital receives a certain fixed amount per patient no matter what it actually spends on the patient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In implementing this prospective payment system, HHS calculates a long-term\n   care hospital's reimbursement amount by approximating the costs that a typical, similarly situated hospital would incur. HHS estimates the per patient average cost incurred by hospitals nationwide, then factors in several adjustments.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20412.513\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 412.513\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 412.515, 412.517, 412.523.

Another adjustment-central to this case-is a labor-cost adjustment that accounts for the varying wage levels across the country.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20412.513\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 412.523(d)(4) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pub.

If a particular geographic area has high hospital labor costs, a hospital in that area will receive a correspondingly higher Medicare reimbursement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   To determine a hospital's labor-cost adjustment, HHS must assign it to a geographic area. HHS does this by using geographic classifications issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The OMB defines \"Metropolitan Statistical Area\" as consisting of an \"urbanized area of 50,000 or more population, plus adjacent territory that has a high degree of social and economic integration with the core.\" Office of Mgmt. &amp; Budget, Bulletin No. 15-01 (July 15, 2015). Meanwhile, the OMB defines a \"Micropolitan Statistical Area\" identically to Metropolitan Statistical Areas except with a smaller urbanized area: the urbanized area contains at least 10,000 but fewer than 50,000 people.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20412.523\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   HHS defines Metropolitan Statistical Areas as urban areas and all other areas as rural areas.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20412.503\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 412.503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For a hospital located within a Metropolitan Statistical Area, HHS classifies the hospital's labor-market area as that Metropolitan Statistical Area. For a rural hospital, HHS classifies the hospital's labor-market area as the entirety of the rural area of the state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fiscal Year 2003 Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=67%20Fed.%20Reg.%2055%2C954\">\n    67 Fed. Reg. 55,954\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 56,015 -19, 56,057-75 (Aug. 30, 2002). HHS collects wage data from acute care hospitals to determine the labor-cost adjustment for each labor-market area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fiscal Year 2016 Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=80%20Fed.%20Reg.%2049%2C326\">\n    80 Fed. Reg. 49,326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 49,797 (Aug. 17, 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This system has been in place for more than a decade. More recently, HHS's only relevant changes have been in response to OMB's reclassification of the country's geographic areas based on the 2010 census. With the new census, certain areas moved between the Metropolitan Statistical Area and rural categories. HHS adopted these reclassifications for fiscal year 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fiscal Year 2015 Rule,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2049%2C854\">\n    79 Fed.

Reg. 49,326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Post Acute is located in Tangipahoa Parish, Louisiana, and was reclassified from a rural category into the Hammond, Louisiana Metropolitan Statistical Area after the 2010 census. For fiscal year 2014-the last year with the pre-census classifications-the Louisiana statewide rural labor-market area wage index was .7585. Dkt. 17-1. For fiscal year 2015, the Hammond wage index was .9452. Dkt. 17-2. For fiscal year 2016, the Hammond wage index was .8167. Dkt. 17-6. In sum, Post Acute's labor-costs adjustment rose significantly when it transitioned from rural to urban, but dropped from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2016. The labor-cost adjustment for 2016 resulted in a reimbursement approximately $1,046,874 lower than it would have been with the 2015 Hammond wage index (though approximately $983,840\n   <em>\n    higher\n   </em>\n   than it would have been with the 2016 Louisiana rural index).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Post Acute Mot. Summ. J. at 19, Dkt. 16; Dkt. 17-7. The fluctuation is explained partly by the fact that the Hammond Metropolitan Statistical Area has only two acute care hospitals from which HHS collects wage data. Dkt. 17-8. The smaller the number of hospitals going into the calculation, the more volatile an area's wage index will be-the shifting wages of a single hospital will have a more noticeable effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Post Acute filed this suit in June 2016. It claims that in promulgating the Fiscal Year 2016 Rule, HHS violated the notice-and-comment requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Medicare Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395hh(b)(1). Specifically, the complaint alleges that HHS failed to provide adequate notice of the \"potential for significant variability in the wage index for hospitals that are located in regions with only a few hospitals\" resulting from HHS's \"decision to retain for [fiscal year] 2016 the revised labor market delineations that were adopted in the [fiscal year] 2015 final rule.\" Compl. \u00b6 43, Dkt. 1. Post Acute also claims that HHS acted arbitrarily and capriciously (1) by failing to adopt policies to reduce year-to-year wage-index volatility for areas with few hospitals; and (2) by categorizing long-term care hospitals in Micropolitan Statistical Areas as rural (and thus decreasing their year-to-year wage index volatility) while not decreasing the wage-index volatility for hospitals like Post Acute located in Metropolitan Statistical Areas with few hospitals.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 53, 58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, Post Acute claims that HHS acted arbitrary and capriciously by failing to adopt a policy to reduce year-to-year wage-index volatility for areas with few hospitals. Notably, Post Acute does not challenge \"the wage index regulations,\" \"the most current [labor-market areas] as a basis for determining [a long-term care hospital's] wage index,\" \"the accuracy of the specific wage data used to calculate its wage index,\" or \"the accuracy of [HHS] calculations under the existing methodology that determined [Post Acute's] assigned wage index amount.\" Post Acute Opp'n &amp; Reply at 7. The challenge is aimed solely at the absence of a carve-out to reduce wage-index volatility for hospitals in areas with few acute-care hospitals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The D.C. Circuit has already ruled that HHS's delineation of labor-market areas is reasonable. In\n   <em>\n    Southeast Alabama Medical Center v. Sebelius\n   </em>\n   , the Court observed that the Medicare Act \"provides only that the [wage index] should 'reflect[ ] the relative hospital wage level in the geographic area of the hospital compared to the national average hospital wage level.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5863414,3670974\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/572/912/\">\n    572 F.3d 912\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 923 (D.C.

Noting that the term \"geographic area\" is ambiguous and could refer to an area \"as small as a city block,\" the Court concluded that \"HHS's longstanding policy of using Metropolitan Statistical Areas ... to define those 'geographic areas' is a reasonable response to this ambiguity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5863414,3670974\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/572/912/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). A geographic area as small as a city block would presumably contain no more than a single hospital and would therefore cause far more wage-index volatility than even exists in Hammond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   HHS gave more than enough reasoning, moreover, for its decision to maintain its\n   longstanding wage-index system-which has never included a special exception for hospitals like Post Acute-for fiscal year 2016. HHS explained that the use of OMB geographic classifications ensures that its wage-index system \"most appropriately accounts for and reflects the relative hospital wage levels in the geographic area of the hospital as compared to the national average hospital wage level based on the best available data that reflect the local economies and area wage levels of the hospitals that are currently located in these geographic areas.\" 80 Fed. Reg. at 24,643. HHS also referred readers to previous iterations of the rule, in which it explained that Metropolitan Statistical Areas are a reasonable metric for defining labor-market areas \"because they are based upon characteristics [HHS] believes also generally reflect the characteristics of unified labor market areas.\" 70 Fed. Reg. at 24,184. For example, Metropolitan Statistical Areas \"reflect a core population plus an adjacent territory that reflects a high degree of social and economic integration.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   And after observing that \"[l]abor market areas ... with fewer providers are generally subject to less stability in year-to-year wage index values because there is less of an averaging effect,\" HHS determined that this volatility was acceptable given that even volatile wage indexes would be calculated from \"the most recent data available that reflect the relative hospital wage level in a geographic area.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2049%2C854\">\n    79 Fed.

Salazar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3662139,3542167\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/708/209/\">\n    708 F.3d 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 216 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (\"Agency action is arbitrary and capricious if the agency offers insufficient reasons for treating similar situations differently.\" (internal quotation marks omitted) ). Specifically, Post Acute points out that HHS treats hospitals located in Micropolitan Statistical Areas-which contain smaller urban clusters than those of Metropolitan Statistical Areas but are otherwise identical-as rural. Hospitals like Post Acute that are located in Metropolitan Statistical Areas with few hospitals, however, are treated as urban.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As with the others, this claim fails for an abundance of reasons. Foremost is the fact that the different treatment Post Acute complains of was not created by the Fiscal Year 2016 Rule. The claim's object is unclear, moreover, because Post Acute does not\n   <em>\n    want\n   </em>\n   to be treated like hospitals in Micropolitan Statistical Areas-the statewide rural wage index is lower than that of the Hammond Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In any event, HHS has not treated like situations differently: Hospitals in Metropolitan Statistical Areas and hospitals in Micropolitan Statistical Areas are not alike. The former includes an urban cluster of at least fifty thousand people, while the latter might have an urban cluster of only ten thousand people. Post Acute seizes on concerns noted in the rule for fiscal year 2015 that because Micropolitan Statistical Areas generally contain fewer hospitals than Metropolitan Statistical Areas, treating them as urban could cause \"drastically more single-provider labor market areas,\" \"create instability in year-to-year wage index values for a large number of hospitals,\" and \"create an inequitable system when so many hospitals would have wage indexes based solely on their own wage\n   data, while other hospitals' wage indexes would be based on an average hourly wage across many hospitals.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=79%20Fed.%20Reg.%2049%2C854\">\n    79 Fed. Reg. at 50,182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Post Acute argues that HHS should have addressed these concerns with respect to Metropolitan Statistical Areas like Hammond as well. But the likelihood of an area having only one or two hospitals is much greater when it contains only ten thousand people than when it contains fifty thousand people.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   HHS Mot.
