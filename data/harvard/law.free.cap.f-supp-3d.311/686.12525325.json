Although his father's I-130 petition was approved in June 1994, Dessouki's related I-485 application seeking lawful permanent residence was rejected, due to an improper filing fee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   His father became a citizen in 1998. Although Dessouki remained in the United States under his indefinite parolee status, he never became a lawful permanent resident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 15, 2006, while he was serving a state prison sentence in Pennsylvania on a drug trafficking conviction, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) opened removal proceedings against him. Two and a half months later, on February 27, 2007, Dessouki filed an application for a certificate of citizenship (N-600) with United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to prevent his removal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his N-600 application, he alleged for the first time that he derived citizenship when his father naturalized as a citizen in 1998. USCIS denied his N-600 application in June 2007.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   One month later in July 2007, Dessouki appealed the denial to the Administrative Appeals Office (AAO).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The AAO, which for some inexplicable reason did not receive the appeal until 2016, upheld the denial on February 1, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the meantime, in 2008, Dessouki filed a motion to terminate removal proceedings, claiming he met the statutory requirements for derivative citizenship. The immigration judge granted his motion, finding that the government had failed to prove alienage.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because DHS did not appeal the decision, Dessouki was released from custody in May 2008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Two years later, on April 20 2010, DHS moved to reopen the removal proceedings pursuant to a change in applicable law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dessouki did not respond to the motion. Instead, he filed a second N-600 application claiming derivative citizenship on April 28, 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 20, 2010, removal proceedings were reinstated as unopposed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Then in July 2011, his second N-600 application was denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 11, 2011, Dessouki moved to terminate the removal proceedings, arguing that\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   precluded further proceedings and that he qualified as a derivative citizen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   The immigration judge denied his motion in January 2013, explaining that Dessouki \"failed to demonstrate his eligibility to derive citizenship through the naturalization of his father.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On April 4, 2014, Dessouki was apprehended by DHS and ordered removed\n   from the United States.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   He did not appeal the removal order and was removed on March 6, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sometime later, he returned to the United States. On October 13, 2016, he was charged with illegal reentry after deportation. His criminal case has been stayed pending disposition of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In January 2017, Dessouki filed a motion to reopen his removal proceedings which was denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   On February 1, 2017, the AAO upheld the denial of his first N-600 application and simultaneously noted that Dessouki \"did not appeal the denial\" of his second N-600 application.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this action, Dessouki seeks a declaration that he is a U.S. citizen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In their Rule 12(b)(1) motion, the defendants make a facial challenge to subject matter jurisdiction.
