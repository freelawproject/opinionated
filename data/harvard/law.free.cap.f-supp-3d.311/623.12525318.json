(\"RGS\") for breach of contract. (ECF Nos. 55-58.) RGS moves for summary judgment dismissing all of Plaintiff's claims against RGS. (ECF Nos. 59-62.) Defendant Roth Capital Partners, LLC (\"Roth Capital\") moves for summary judgment dismissing all of Plaintiff's claims against Roth Capital. (ECF Nos. 63-64.)

(Pl. 56.1 Stmt., ECF No. 57, \u00b6 6; RGS Counter 56.1 Stmt., ECF No. 72, \u00b6 6.) Pursuant to the SPA, Alpha Capital invested approximately $1.1 million to purchase RGS Securities in the First Offering. (Pl. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 7; RGS Counter 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 7.) On February 6, 2017, Alpha Capital, along with fourteen other institutional investors, closed on the purchase of units of RGS securities issued in the First Offering.

For example, Alpha Capital purchased 145,162 shares of common stock and 209,838 warrants. (Hoffner Decl. Ex. C, ECF No. 56-4, at 6.) The SPA defines \"Shares\" as \"the shares of Common Stock issuable to each Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement.\" (Hoffner Decl. Ex. C, ECF No. 56-3, at 4.) The SPA defines \"Warrant Shares\" as \"the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On the morning of February 7, 2017, Roth Capital contacted RGS and advised that the day's trading provided RGS with the opportunity to raise additional funds through a second offering in the form of an \"Intraday trade\" (the \"Second Offering\"). (Pl. 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 13; RGS Counter 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 13.) In order to proceed with the Second Offering, RGS needed to obtain waivers of the 90-Day Prohibition by complying with the 50.1% Requirement.

(Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 38-46.) Section 4.13(a) of the SPA provides that RGS could not issue securities for a period of 90 days following the close of the First Offering. (Hoffner Decl. Ex. C, ECF No. 56-3, at 26.) However, Section 5.5 provides that the provisions of the SPA could be waived by a \"written instrument\" signed by RGS and purchasers in the First Offering which purchased \"at least 50.1% in interest of the Shares based on the initial Subscription Amounts hereunder.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   RGS asserts that it obtained formal waiver letters from purchasers in the First Offering that represented more than 50.1% of the funds invested in that offering (including both Shares of common stock and Series L Warrant Shares), such that Section 4.13(a) was properly waived and no breach occurred. (RGS Mem. of Law in Supp., ECF No. 60 at 9.) By contrast, Plaintiff asserts that the calculation of the 50.1% Requirement under the SPA could not properly include the Series L Warrant Shares, such that there was a breach of Section 4.13(a). (Pl. Mem. of Law in Supp., ECF No. 58, at 17-18.) Thus, the issue before the Court is whether the Series L Warrant Shares should be included in the calculation of the 50.1% Requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   After a careful review of the SPA provisions, construing the plain language used by the parties, and harmonizing the terms of the SPA, the Court concludes that Series L Warrant Shares should be included in the calculation of the 50.1% Requirement. Section 5.5 provides that no provision of the SPA can be waived except by \"at least 50.1% in interest of the Shares based on the initial Subscription Amounts.\" (Hoffner Decl. Ex. C, ECF No. 56-3, at 29.) The term \"Subscription Amount\" is defined as \"the aggregate amount to be paid for the Shares and Warrants purchased hereunder as specified below such Purchaser's name on the signature page of this Agreement and next to the heading 'Subscription Amount' ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.) The signature page of the SPA has two separate lines below the purchaser's name, each of which uses the term \"Subscription Amount,\" namely, \"Subscription Amount for Shares\" and \"Subscription Amount for Series L Warrants.\" (Hoffner Decl., ECF No. 56-4, at 6.) Thus, by definition, the Subscription Amounts referred to in Section 5.5 include the Series L Warrants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiff points to the fact that the terms \"Shares\" and \"Warrant Shares\" are separately defined in the SPA to suggest that they must be different from one another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   (Pl. Mem. in Supp. at 16-17.) The Court finds, based upon the plain language of the SPA, that the term \"Warrant Shares\" is a subset of the broader term \"Shares.\" (RGS Mem. in Supp. at 8-9.) \"Warrant Shares\" is defined as \"the shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants.\" (Hoffner Decl.

(Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 38-46.) Section 4.14 provides in pertinent part that no consideration \"shall be offered or paid to any Person to amend or consent to a waiver or modification of any provision of the Transaction Documents unless the same consideration is also offered to all of the parties to such Transaction Documents.\" (Hoffner Decl.

(Pl. Mem. in Supp. at 14.) By contrast, RGS asserts that the ability to participate in the Second Offering does not constitute consideration paid by RGS, and was not a quid pro quo for a waiver. (RGS Mem. in Supp. at 17.) RGS states: \"\n   <em>\n    It is not clear\n   </em>\n   that Alpha [Capital] would have benefitted in any way by being allowed to participate in the Second Offering.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18 (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Court finds that genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether consideration was given in exchange for the waivers, in view of the fact that the seven investors that provided waiver letters were permitted the opportunity to participate, and in fact participated, in the Second Offering.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Under New York law, consideration is defined as \"some right, interest, profit or benefit accruing to one party, or some forbearance, detriment, loss, or responsibility, given, suffered, or undertaken by the other.\"\n   <em>\n    Hamer v.

Sept. 29, 2014). The role of this Court is not to determine whether it is \"clear\" if Alpha Capital would have benefited from the Second Offering. The question is whether consideration was offered or paid to the other seven investors that signed waivers, which consideration was not offered to Alpha Capital. The record evidence shows that seven of fifteen investors in the First Offering were able to invest in the Second Offering and that those investors consented to a waiver. In the circumstances, it is reasonable to infer, absent other evidence, that the right to participate in the Second Offering was offered to the seven investors, essentially in exchange for their waiver. The Court thus concludes that the issue of consideration must be resolved at trial, and those parts of both Plaintiff's and RGS's motions for summary judgment that are based on breach of the Equal Treatment Provision are DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Closely related to the Equal Treatment Provision, which requires that all parties to the SPA be treated equally, are the Disproportionate Impact Provisions, which require that a Purchaser (or group of Purchasers) not suffer a disproportionate impact from any waiver of the SPA's provisions. As set forth below, the Court also finds that the issue of breach of the Disproportionate Impact Provisions cannot be resolved on summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Disproportionate Impact Provisions\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In RGS's motion for summary judgment, it argues that it did not breach the Disproportionate Impact Provisions. (RGS Mem. in Supp. at 15-16.) Alpha Capital\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleges in its Amended Complaint that RGS breached the Disproportionate Impact Provisions (and therefore Sections 4.13(a) and 5.5 of the SPA) by conducting the Second Offering without obtaining the consent of the purchasers from the First Offering, which did not participate in the Second Offering, to waive the 90-Day Provision contained in Section 4.13(a), thereby disproportionately affecting the rights of the non-participating purchasers, including Alpha Capital. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 38-46.) During oral argument, RGS asserted there was no disproportionate impact since Alpha Capital could have purchased shares of RGS common stock on the open market at a price on the date of the Second Offering that was below the price paid for such shares in the Second Offering. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RGS 56.1 Stmt. \u00b6 88.) Alpha Capital responded at oral argument that it was deprived of the opportunity to obtain, in addition to RGS common stock, RGS warrants that were part of the Second Offering. The Court finds on the present record that there are factual issues regarding whether the waiver of the 90-Day Prohibition itself had any impact on Alpha Capital, and whether any impact on Alpha Capital was\n   disproportionate to the participating investors. Thus, those parts of RGS's motion for summary judgment that are based on breach of the Disproportionate Impact Provisions are DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Damages\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   RGS also argues that Alpha Capital cannot prove any damages from breach of the SPA. (RGS Mem. in Supp. at 18-24.) In response, Alpha Capital states that there are genuine issues of material fact as to damages and, at the very least, it is entitled to nominal damages. (Pl. Mem. of Law in Opp., ECF No. 66, at 9-15.) Although based on the current record the Court is skeptical as to the quantum of damages that Alpha Capital can prove at trial, it is true that Alpha Capital at the very least is entitled to nominal damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Raymond Weil, S.A. v.
