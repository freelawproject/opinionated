One is that the public seems to misunderstand what early voting is, that it's not actually voting, that it's filling out an absentee ballot in another location. And I personally feel that an absentee ballot can be filled out at your home, which is even more convenient, so the necessity of providing additional locations is-it's just not needed. The staff that would be needed to work each location, plus the huge burden that we still have paper poll books in Marion County makes the process very difficult.

Two preliminary problems require comment: the proper characterization of Plaintiffs' constitutional claim and of the Board's decision it challenges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   First, we affirm that the Board's decision is the only matter Plaintiffs have asked us to review. The only question presented here is whether the Board has unduly and impermissibly burdened the rights of Marion County voters. The mechanism by which the Board reached its decision is irrelevant to Plaintiffs' cause of action\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   except insofar as it may speak to the legitimacy of the governmental interest advanced in justification. Thus, the State's insistence to the contrary notwithstanding, this is not a challenge to the unanimity requirement of Indiana Code \u00a7 3-11-10-26.3(b). Plaintiffs argue neither that Section 26.3(b) is unconstitutional in every application, nor in this application. They are not complaining about\n   <em>\n    the statute\n   </em>\n   at all; they complain of\n   <em>\n    the decision\n   </em>\n   reached by the decisional process authorized by the statute. We did previously characterize Plaintiffs' claim as an \"as applied\" challenge to the statute, Dkt. 40, at 2, but that was under Plaintiffs' then-operative original\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   , Dkt. 1, and only for the purposes of establishing that this is not a case in which the State is entitled to intervene to defend its statute against facial invalidation. Here, it is more precise to say that the constitutionality of the statute is not implicated at all.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Second, we must consider whether the Board's decision (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , its failure to re-establish satellite offices in general election years after 2008 and 2009) is properly characterized as a restriction of voting rights or a failure to expand them. The Equal Protection Clause has never been held to require a unit of government to bankrupt itself in the pursuit of expanding voting rights to their maximum possible extent. And Plaintiffs do not (and could not) argue that the Board is specifically required by the Constitution to permit EIP voting and to guarantee a certain degree of convenience to EIP voters. In\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   , the Seventh Circuit framed the question as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   [P]laintiffs...are working mothers who contend that...it is a hardship for them to vote in person on election day[.]...[I]t is obvious that a federal court is not going to decree weekend voting, multi-day voting, all-mail voting, or Internet voting (and would it then\n   have to buy everyone a laptop, or a Palm Pilot or Blackberry, and Internet access?). That leaves as the only alternative that will satisfy the plaintiffs a general hardship exemption from the requirement of in-person voting; and as a practical matter that means absentee voting at will.... [That] argument ignores a host of serious objections to judicially legislating so radical a reform in the name of the Constitution.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1319266\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/385/1128/#p1130\">\n    385 F.3d at 1129-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   But a neutral and nondiscriminatory failure to extend constitutionally optional voting rights is to be sharply distinguished from an arbitrary or discriminatory restriction of voting rights (and from an arbitrary or discriminatory failure to extend voting rights to some while extending them to others, though that is not this case, as the Board's action affects every Marion County voter),\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   no matter whether those rights are constitutional requirements or statutory entitlements.

But it is hardly worth the ink to note that the Board could open neither polling places nor satellite offices only to white voters, or only to Green Party voters, or only to voters selected by\n   <em>\n    sortes Vergilianae\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   We accept for the purposes of the instant motion Plaintiffs' characterization of the Board's decision as a restriction of voting rights rather than a failure to expand them. But the propriety of that characterization is not beyond dispute. Plaintiffs are silent on the constitutional relevance, if any, of the fact that Indiana Code \u00a7 3-11-10-26.3(i) requires new annual resolutions to establish satellite offices and therefore new annual commitments to outlays of money and manpower sufficient to operate them. Plaintiffs select 2008 as \"the baseline year,\" Br. Supp. 4, 9, but fail to explain\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   , as a matter of constitutional law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Keeping the above considerations in view, while holding Plaintiffs only to a\n   <em>\n    prima\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    facie\n   </em>\n   showing of entitlement to preliminary relief, we will allow Plaintiffs to proceed supported by the evidentiary designations now before the Court and relying on the seemingly self-evident proposition that a good idea in 2008 and 2009, as determined by the Board, is a good idea through 2016-unless conditions have materially changed by 2016. And, as explained further in the\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   balance below, the greater weight of the credible evidence suggests that satellite offices were a good idea in 2008 and 2009, and that no\n   <em>\n    neutral, nondiscriminatory\n   </em>\n   factors had materially changed by 2016. In this case, it would be hyperformalistic, and would suggest a rule liable to abuse, to permit the constitutional result to vary depending on whether the statutory scheme authorized annual resolutions or, for example, biannual resolutions terminable after one year. Accordingly, subject to the testimony of future evidence, we take 2008 as the point of departure. From that vantage, we view the Board's failure to re-establish satellite offices as a curtailment of the voting rights of Marion County voters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    1.

Similarly, when Hoff instructed Fox, her proxy, to vote nay on the fall 2016 resolution, Hoff explained that she had \"[been] told\" that a planned round of discussions between \"the Republican Party and the Democratic Party\" had \"never happened, that there was a round of phone tag between [Ping] and [Eldridge] and they never got ahold of one another[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25:13-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   This is an astonishing argument for the Board's decision, and so obviously and thoroughly deficient (\"not a governmental interest at all,\" as Plaintiffs correctly point out, Br. Supp. 23) that we will not long linger over it. It is enough here to say that neither Ping nor any other functionary of the major-party county organizations had any right of consultation on the resolutions; that satellite-office resolutions are not complex pieces of legislation requiring minute inspection and negotiation of \"language,\" Dkt. 63 Ex. 9 (Hoff Dep.) 16:12, but simple and functional documents stating the number, location, and operating times of satellite offices established by them,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 63 Ex. 1 (other counties' satellite-office resolutions), all of which may be considered without reference to the \"language\" of the resolutions; and that the business of the Board is most naturally discussed, not before, but\n   <em>\n    at\n   </em>\n   its meetings, and indeed, as Plaintiffs' counsel suggested at Ping's deposition,\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   at its meetings, in observance of Indiana's \"Open Door Law.\" Dkt. 66 Ex. B (Ping Dep.) 20:21-25.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ind. Code ch. 5-14-1.5. In any event, there is no showing (and none is conceivable) of any extent to which Ping's inability to review the proposed resolution made it necessary to burden Plaintiffs' rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   b. Preventing Voter Confusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Second, preventing voter confusion was recited by Hoff in opposition to satellite offices, Dkt. 63 Ex. 9 (Hoff Dep.) 26:3-9, but this argument fares no better than the first. Eldridge's view was that voters are not confused about the nature of EIP voting. Dkt. 63 Ex. 8 (Eldridge Dep.) 20:10-13. We find that testimony more credible than Hoff's, which itself appears to be the product of confusion about the nature of EIP voting. Whatever Hoff may have meant when she said that EIP voting is \"not actually voting..., it's filling out an absentee ballot in another location[,]\" Dkt. 63 Ex. 9 (Hoff Dep.) 26:5-6, she clearly erred in asserting that \"an absentee [by mail] ballot can be filled out\n   at your home, which is even more convenient,\" on the same terms as EIP voting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26:7-9.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203-11-10-24\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 3-11-10-24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) through (13) (restricting entitlement to absentee by-mail voting to voters satisfying one of thirteen conditions). And again, even if Hoff had been correct that the public fails to understand that voting absentee by mail is \"even more convenient\" than EIP voting, Dkt. 63 Ex. 9 (Hoff Dep.) 26:8-9, there is no showing of why or how such confusion would be cured or mitigated by restricting EIP voting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   c. Cost Avoidance\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Third is \"the [monetary] cost and administrative headache that [satellite offices] would bring[,]\" two related factors we assess together. Here, a word about the judicial role in assessing these interests is in order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   A unit of government cannot, of course, defeat every constitutional challenge to voting restrictions, no matter how capriciously enacted, on the plea that fewer voters mean cheaper elections.

As to the asserted burden on election administration, the Board has already conceded before this Court that, as a result of its action, \"early voters and Election Day voters are likely to experience longer lines and wait times than would otherwise exist....\" Answer \u00b6 26. This position finds support in Eldridge's testimony on the administrative efficiency and effectiveness of EIP voting in 2008, when Eldridge served as the Board's deputy director,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 63 Ex. 8 (Eldridge Dep.) 8:1-9:17, as well as in her testimony on the ease with which the satellite centers were staffed and operated.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:20-25, 12:7-16. It finds further support in the Board's own decision to expand the use of satellite offices from two in 2008 to four in 2009 for a local, nonpartisan referendum. Dkt. 66 Ex. A (Eldridge Dep.) 13:2-14:1. Similarly, none\n   of the other thirteen Indiana counties for which there is record evidence abandoned the use of satellite offices after their introduction. Dkt. 63 Ex 1. The consistent testimony of this evidence is that, for Marion and counties like it, the benefits of satellite-office EIP voting outweigh the administrative costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   We do not find Ping's and Hoff's contrary testimony to be the more credible evidence. Ping reported \"chaos for the workers...as well as the voters\" when she voted early in person at the Southport Government Center satellite office in 2008. Dkt. 66 Ex. B (Ping Dep.) 14:7-8. But, as there is no evidence that Ping was anything other than a private voter in 2008 or had any involvement in the administration of that election, we cannot perceive a basis for Ping's knowledge of \"chaos\" generally in the operation of the Southport satellite office, or specifically due to the demands of ballot-printing there.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:5. Similarly, Hoff adduced the burden of Marion County's use of paper poll books, but the weight of this testimony is slight because it does not appear to come from Hoff's personal knowledge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 63 Ex. 9 (Hoff Dep.) 26:14-17 (\"And we [\n   <em>\n    who?\n   </em>\n   ] knew that...-I'm going to try to word this correctly. I hope that I understood it correctly.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Moreover, both Ping's and Hoff's explanations for the perceived administrative burden, so far as they are clear from the face of the record, relate to perceived defects in early voting generally or Marion County election administration generally, not to the operation of satellite offices in particular. Finally, neither Ping's nor Hoff's testimony suggests any respect in which or any reason why the operative facts justified two satellite offices in 2008, four in 2009, and none thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   As to the monetary cost, the only available evidence is Eldridge's estimation that it would cost \"[p]robably more\" than $100,000 to operate two satellite offices, assuming their use could be procured at no cost to the Board as it had been in 2008. Dkt. 66 Ex. A (Eldridge Dep.) 38:25. But Eldridge was clear that budgeting problems have never stood in the way of the establishment of satellite offices in Marion County. Funds for satellite offices in 2010 had already been set aside when that year's resolution failed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16:1- 8. Such funds apparently continued to be set aside until as late as 2015,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   at 37:22- 23, when the practice was abandoned as futile.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37:24-38:4. Nevertheless, Eldridge had no concern that, if a satellite-office resolution were passed today, it would not be fully funded.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38:5-14. There is no evidence that the financial position of Marion County or the Board in 2010 through 2016 was worse that their position in 2008 and 2009 (which, indeed, would be a surprising finding).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   In sum, it is of course incontestable that a unit of government has a legitimate interest in the health of its finances. But, on the record before the Court, we cannot say that that interest was implicated by the Board's action. The greater weight of the credible evidence suggests that the Board found the benefits of satellite offices sufficiently outweighed their costs such that their use was initiated in 2008 and expanded in 2009. No consideration of administrative or monetary cost appears have operated differently from 2010 through 2016. The barest desire simply to spend less money cannot justify the Board's action here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   d. Partisan Considerations\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Plaintiffs' theory of why satellite offices have become a partisan issue in Marion County, as inferred from their briefing on the instant motion and from the\n   <em>\n    Amended\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   , is as follows. Early voting, including EIP voting, tends to be more popular with traditionally Democratic constituencies, particularly low-income\n   and African-American voters. Any restriction on EIP voting, therefore, tends to depress Democratic voter turnout and vote share. Marion County as a whole tends to vote Democratic. Accordingly, say Plaintiffs, the Marion County Republican Party, driven by the political interests of the Indiana Republican Party, has opposed the expansion of EIP voting in Marion County in order to depress the statewide vote share of the Indiana Democratic Party and so \"achiev[e] partisan advantage....\" Br. Supp. 4. Plaintiffs allege further that the Board's post-2008 refusal to establish satellite offices in general federal election years \"was in retaliation for Marion County voters having voted in large numbers and overwhelmingly in favor of the Democratic Party's nominee for President, Barack Obama,\" in 2008. Am. Compl. \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The uncontradicted evidence in the record is that \"partisan politics probably plays a hand in decision making\" with respect to satellite offices. Dkt. 63 Ex. 9 (Hoff Dep.) 48:11-12. Indeed, it could hardly be otherwise where, contrary to the form of the applicable statute,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ind.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203-6-5-2\">\n    Ind. Code \u00a7 3-6-5-2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2), the county clerk has routinely outsourced the appointment of the other two Board members to the respective county-party chairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   At least in the case of the Republican Board member (the only Board member for which there is evidence before the Court), she appears in turn to have outsourced her decision-making to the Marion County Republican Party. When Hoff needed a proxy to cast her vote on the fall 2016 satellite-office resolution, she contacted county-party leadership to secure one. Hoff \"defer[red] to the opinion of [her] party\" on matters before the Board, Dkt. 63 Ex. 9 (Hoff Dep.) 11:4, but it is not clear what legitimate basis such deference rested on. \"By contrast [to the redistricting process, which is inherently political,]...election administration should not be political at all[.]\"\n   <em>\n    One Wis.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12132818\" index=\"238\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/198/896/\">\n    198 F.Supp.3d at 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Hoff denied that partisanship had been \"a reason [she] was given\" for voting against satellite offices, Dkt. 63 Ex. 9 (Hoff Dep.) 32:6-7, (thereby appearing to contradict herself somewhat, for, if not by her vote, how did partisanship \"play a hand\" in decision-making on satellite offices?), but did concede that, \"[i]f [the Board's rejection of satellite offices was related to partisan politics], that decision was made by someone else.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32:3-6. We cannot perceive how any \"decision\" embodied in Hoff's nay vote could have been \"made by someone else\" unless Hoff was effectively taking instruction from party officials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   With respect to the nonpartisan reasons given for Hoff's vote, Hoff did not know how great the expense of satellite offices would be and made no independent effort to find out, and it appears that Hoff never brought these matters to the Board for discussion and resolution. Nor to the public. Hoff refused to state her own reasons for voting against the fall 2016 resolution when asked to do so by a local journalist. Rather, again, she contacted county-party leadership to ask \"whether they wanted to make a\n   <em>\n    party\n   </em>\n   statement about the issue[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25:3-4 (emphasis added).

The clear inference from these undisputed facts is that nonpartisan reasons did not in fact play any significant role in Hoff's decision, that Hoff's decision was effectively the county party's decision, and that the county party thought \"it would be better\" not to publicly disclose the basis for\n   <em>\n    its\n   </em>\n   decision because that basis would not be viewed by the public as a legitimate one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In view of the absence of any credible neutral and nonpartisan explanation for\n   the Board's failure to re-establish satellite offices after 2008 and 2009, as discussed above, the record permits only one conclusion: partisanship motivated, and indeed was the but-for cause of, the Board's action. We note that the evidentiary designations to the Court do not reveal a full picture of the Board's decision-making in 2010, 2012, or 2014.

As noted above, Plaintiffs' case at this stage does suffer from evidentiary weaknesses,\n   though we expect those weaknesses to be remediable. Moreover, the Court welcomes further development of evidence and argument on the nature of the Board's action\n   <em>\n    qua\n   </em>\n   restriction of voting rights, and on the role of disparate impacts in the\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    Burdick\n   </em>\n   balance. Against these potential roadblocks for Plaintiffs, however, we set the utter absence of any legitimate justification for the Board's action. Accordingly, we conclude that Plaintiffs' chances are better than slight, worse than strong. We address the balance of equities in this light.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   The instant motion seeks an order establishing two satellite offices for both the May primary and November general elections of this year, the same number as were established in 2008. Though four satellite offices were used in 2009, Plaintiffs' claim relates chiefly to the use of satellite offices in general federal election years. Thus we agree with Plaintiffs that 2008, rather than 2009, better represents \"the last peaceable uncontested status that existed before the dispute arose.\"\n   <em>\n    Kimbley v.

The Board details the efforts it will be required to undertake to establish the satellite offices. Br. Opp. 5; Dkt. 66 Ex. C (Delaney Decl.). Writing as of February 15, 2018, the Board observes that \"the May election takes place fewer than 90 days from this submission. Election administration activities are well underway....\" Br. Opp. 5. Even then, a judicially decreed obligation to establish satellite offices would have thrown the Board's election preparation efforts into disarray.\n   <em>\n    A fortiori\n   </em>\n   now: after awaiting full briefing on the instant motion, which was completed on February 22, 2018, and after devoting the careful consideration and deliberation demanded by the important issues in this case, this\n   <em>\n    Order and Opinion\n   </em>\n   issues with fewer than two weeks remaining before the primary on May 8, 2018. The benefits to Plaintiffs at this late hour, meanwhile, would be comparatively modest. Finally, while the character and magnitude of Plaintiffs' injury does not vary with the type of election (primary or general), the public's interest in an electoral market free from arbitrary governmental interference in favor of one political party over another is less impaired in the primary-election context. And the public, too, would be ill served by last-minute upheaval and confusion in the administration of the May primary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   As to the November general election, however, we find that the balance of equities tips in Plaintiffs' favor. The Board \"acknowledges that while the same planning and election administration challenges are presented by an injunction requiring establishment of satellite offices for the November 2018 general election, the burden on the [Board] would be far less without a compressed timeframe[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11184938\" index=\"257\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/119/856/#p874\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' fair likelihood of success on the merits, and the constitutionally fundamental nature of their asserted injury, justify the imposition of this reduced burden. Both Plaintiffs and the public are positioned to enjoy the full benefits of EIP voting restored to its 2008 levels, while the public will suffer minimal disruption to any ongoing election preparation efforts, and will reap the harvest of an electoral contest conducted without a governmental thumb on the scale.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The Board concedes that Plaintiffs should not be required to post bond.
