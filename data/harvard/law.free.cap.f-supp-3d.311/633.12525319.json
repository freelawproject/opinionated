The Report recommends that the Court award the plaintiff's attorney attorney's fees in the amount of $57,754.80, and that the plaintiff's attorney return to the plaintiff the $11,382.07 he received pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice Act, as well as the $12,152 he has held in escrow, which the plaintiff's attorney indicates has already been returned.

Counsel wrote a detailed and extensive memorandum of law outlining cogent arguments for a remand.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Brief in Support of Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings Under Rule 12(c) Fed. R. Civ. P., filed Dec. 16, 2011 (Docket # 16). The briefing was effective in prompting the remand and achieved the greatest possible success for the claimant. Thus, the award is in line with the character and results of the representation. Counsel did not engage in any delay of the proceedings that might have artificially increased past-due benefits and thus the potential attorney fee award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   With respect to the third factor-whether the award constitutes a \"windfall\"-\n   <em>\n    Blizzard\n   </em>\n   notes that courts consider the following factors:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   1) whether the attorney's efforts were particularly successful for the plaintiff, 2) whether there is evidence of the effort expended by the attorney demonstrated through pleadings which were not boilerplate and through arguments which involved both real issues of material fact and required legal research, and finally, 3) whether the case was handled efficiently due to the attorney's experience in handling social security cases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5862587\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/496/320/\">\n    496 F.Supp.2d at 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Joslyn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8917432\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/389/454/#p456\">\n    389 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   456-57 ). Applying these factors here, they too weigh in favor of the fee request. Baron's counsel was particularly successful in that he achieved an award of benefits. Counsel submitted a detailed, non-boilerplate brief in support of Baron's case. The case was handled efficiently in that it was handled by a single experienced attorney and the number of hours spent was entirely appropriate to the nature of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Gisbrecht\n   </em>\n   , a court must consider whether the claimant's past-due benefits are \"large in comparison to the amount of time counsel spent on the case.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"353782\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/789/#p808\">\n    535 U.S. at 808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"353782\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/789/#p808\">\n    122 S.Ct. 1817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, counsel's request would result in compensation at an hourly rate of $711.53. While such a rate could not be justified as part of a traditional \"lodestar\" analysis, a \"lodestar\" analysis does not apply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gisbrecht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"353782\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/789/#p808\">\n    535 U.S. at 799-808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"353782\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/789/#p808\">\n    122 S.Ct. 1817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . An important factor underlying our consideration of the fee sought by counsel here is the Court's belief that \"[d]eference should be given ... to the 'freely negotiated expression both of a claimant's willingness to pay more than a particular hourly rate ... and of an attorney's willingness to take the case despite the risk of nonpayment.' \"\n   <em>\n    Joslyn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8917432\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/389/454/#p456\">\n    389 F.Supp.2d at 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wells v. Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537340\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/907/367/#p371\">\n    907 F.2d 367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 371 (2d Cir. 1990) ). Inasmuch as statutory fee awards are available only for successful litigants, a contingency fee arrangement provides an incentive to counsel to take on cases that are less than sure winners. As was stated by the Second Circuit, \"[i]n the absence of a fixed-fee agreement, payment for an attorney in a social security case is inevitably uncertain, and any reasonable fee award must take account of that risk.\"\n   <em>\n    Wells\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10537340\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/907/367/#p371\">\n    907 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   371 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Joslyn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8917432\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/389/454/#p456\">\n    389 F.Supp.2d at 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"When assessing the reasonableness of [a contingency fee payment], a court should balance the interest in protecting claimants from inordinately large fees against the interest in ensuring that attorneys are adequately compensated so that they continue to represent clients in disability benefits cases.\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Gisbrecht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"353782\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/789/#p808\">\n    535 U.S. at 805\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"353782\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/535/789/#p808\">\n    122 S.Ct. 1817\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Thus, a reduction in the agreed-upon contingency amount should not be made lightly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Here, we see no reason to reduce the amount provided in the contingent fee arrangement given counsel's skill, competence, and efficiency. In light of the fact that, as already discussed, the many factors for judging reasonableness identified by courts have been satisfied in this case, the fact that Baron's case was not a sure winner, and the importance of encouraging attorneys to accept social security cases on a contingency basis, the Court concludes that the award sought here is not so large in relation to the hours expended by counsel that it requires reduction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schiebel v.

Portnoy, dated Mar. 30, 2018 (Docket # 77) ). In fact, the record reflects that Baron's counsel was awarded $40,205.95,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Notice of Change in Benefits at 2, a figure that Baron's counsel had used in earlier filings before switching to the larger number,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Portnoy Jan. 3 Aff. \u00b6 13. Moreover, $40,205.95, when subtracted from the total amount withheld by the Social Security Administration, leaves a difference of the exact amount the Social Security Administration claims to still be withholding as potential attorney's fees.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Letter from Leslie A. Ramirez-Fisher, filed Mar. 29, 2018 (Docket # 76), at 3 n.5 (\"SSA is withholding a total of $57,754.80\"). We therefore assume that Baron's counsel was awarded $40,205.95 for services performed at the administrative level, and construe Baron's counsel's request as one for $57,754.80.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Baron's counsel also refers to this amount as $12,000.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Portnoy Jan. 3 Aff. \u00b6 11. However, insofar as the $12,152 amount is more precise and was provided by Baron's counsel more recently, the Court assumes that it is the accurate amount.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
