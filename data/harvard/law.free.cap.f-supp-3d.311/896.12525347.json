(Doc. Nos. 12, 14.) Defendant Tennessee Valley Authority (\"TVA\") has responded in opposition (Doc. No. 19), and the State and the Citizens Groups have replied (Doc. Nos. 21, 22). For the following reasons, the Court will grant the motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   TVA owns and operates an active coal-fired power plant (the \"Gallatin Plant\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   located on the north bank of the Cumberland River, within approximately five miles of Gallatin, Tennessee. Until 1970, coal combustion residual material (\"CCR\") generated through the operation of the Gallatin Plant was treated in a series of unlined ash ponds located on the western edge of the site. In 1970, these ponds were closed after reaching capacity; that area is typically referred to as the \"Non-Registered Site.\" Under Tennessee law, the Non-Registered Site is considered a solid waste disposal site, and it is managed by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation's (\"TDEC\") Division of Solid Waste Management under the Tennessee Solid Waste Disposal Act (\"SWDA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2068-211-101\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 68-211-101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to 68-211-124.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After 1970, TVA began treating its CCR using a series of unlined ponds located north-northeast of the Non-Registered Site. This area includes Bottom Ash Pond A (\"Pond A\"), Fly Ash Pond E (\"Pond E\"), and Stilling Ponds B, C, and D (together, the \"Ash Pond Complex\"). The Ash Pond Complex covers several hundred acres, and it ultimately discharges to the Cumberland River under a TDEC-issued National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (\"NPDES\") permit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 26, 2012, TDEC's Division of Water Resources issued the most recent version of TVA's individual NPDES permit (the \"NPDES Permit\"). The NPDES Permit authorizes TVA to discharge treated effluent from the Ash Pond Complex in a certain manner and imposes certain daily maximum and monthly average limits on effluent characteristics. The NPDES Permit requires TVA to conduct inspections of the Ash Pond Complex for structural defects and to identify certain conditions that may be indicative of structural instability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On November 10, 2014, the Citizens Groups issued a 60-day Notice of Violation Letter to TVA, TDEC, and the Environmental Protection Agency under the citizen suit provision of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C \u00a7 1365, alleging multiple violations at the Gallatin Plant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   33 U.S.C \u00a7\u00a7 1251 - 1387. In response, on January 7, 2015, the State filed a complaint against TVA in the Chancery Court for Davidson County, Tennessee (\"Chancery Court\"), alleging violations of the SWDA, the Tennessee Water Quality Control Act of 1977, as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2069-3-101\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 69-3-101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to 69-3-137 (\"TWQCA\"), and the NPDES Permit. With TVA's agreement, the Citizens Groups intervened pursuant to Tenn. R. Civ. P. 24.01(3). On February 27, 2015, the Citizens Groups filed their complaint in intervention, also alleging violations of the SWDA, TWQCA, and the NPDES Permit at the Gallatin Plant. TVA answered the State's and Citizens Group's complaints on March 3, 2015, and April 1, 2015, respectively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   TVA did not seek to remove the state court case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties engaged in discovery and motion practice for over two years pursuant to multiple scheduling orders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In April 2017, the Chancery Court set trial for December 2017 and extended certain discovery deadlines. In May 2017, the Chancery Court denied TVA's motions to (1) bifurcate the liability and remedy portions of trial and (2) condition the Citizen Groups'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   participation in depositions and at trial. In June 2017, the Chancery Court denied TVA's motions for (1) summary judgment on the State's complaint and (2) judgment on the pleadings on the Citizens Groups' complaint in intervention.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 30, 2017, TVA filed a motion for leave to file amended answers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 6, 2017, the State forwarded a proposed amended complaint to the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 17-1.) TVA did not consent to the proposed amended complaint and thus, on July 13, 2017, the State filed a motion to amend. On July 17, 2017, TVA filed a motion seeking interlocutory appeal of the Chancery Court's order denying summary judgment. The Chancery Court held TVA's motion to amend its answers in abeyance until after disposition of the State's motion to amend. But then TVA did not oppose the State's amendments, and on August 2, 2017, the Chancery Court entered an order granting the State's motion, entering the amended complaint, and ordering TVA to serve its answer within 30 days.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The amended complaint provides more information on a variety of subjects, including management of the Non-Registered Site, handling of CCR, and NPDES permit authorization. (Doc. No. 18-1 at Ex. 5, \u00b6\u00b6 22-48.) It also adds additional information concerning the ongoing investigation at the Gallatin Plant, including alleged TVA violations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 45, 50-52.) Perhaps most notably, the amended complaint subjects Pond A and Pond E to treatment as solid waste disposal sites under the SWDA (in the same manner as the Non-Registered Site), as opposed to wastewater treatment sites.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the amended complaint seeks the same types of relief originally pled in the complaint, including injunctive relief and the potential assessment of civil penalties under the TWQCA; however the request for injunctive relief has been broadened to incorporate Pond A and Pond E under the SWDA on an accelerated basis, a result that TVA claims would have \"dire consequences.\" (Doc. No. 19 at 9.) While TVA argues that \"the new SWDA cause of action potentially exposes TVA to millions of dollars in additional liability,\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), the State has affirmatively\n   represented to the Court that TVA's \"potential exposure to civil penalties under the amended complaint is no more than under the original complaint.\" (Doc. No. 22 at 9.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On August 4, 2017, the Chancery Court denied TVA's motion for permission to appeal the denial of summary judgment. On August 9, 2017, TVA filed a motion to exclude three of the State's disclosed experts. On August 10, 2017, the State moved to compel TVA to comply with discovery obligations ahead of the trial. That same day, one week before the parties were set to begin deposing dozens of fact and expert witnesses, TVA filed a Notice of Removal, removing the action to this Court over two and one-half years after it was initially filed in the Chancery Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Background Law\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The United States or any agency thereof may remove any civil action or criminal prosecution relating to official acts that is commenced against it in a state court \"to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place wherein it is pending.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).

Ky. 1994). Here, the State served its original complaint on TVA on January 8, 2015. TVA is an agency and instrumentality of the United States created by and existing pursuant to the Tennessee Valley Authority Act of 1933, as amended,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20831\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 831ee (2012). Because an agency of the United States was a defendant, the state court action was therefore initially removable.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201442\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). TVA admits this in its Notice of Removal. (Doc. No. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 5-7.) TVA therefore had to remove the case within 30 days of January 8, 2015.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Instead, however, TVA made a deliberate decision to not remove the state court action within the 30-day period. TVA eventually filed a Notice of Removal on August 10, 2017-over two and one-half years later. TVA therefore failed to comply with the statutory requirements for removal in \u00a7 1446(b)(1). Moreover, because this matter was initially removable, TVA is not entitled to late removal under \u00a7 1446(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   TVA makes a curious argument that it is \"always\"-meaning \"at any time\"-entitled to remove under \u00a7 1442(a)(1) because it is a federal government entity. (Doc. No. 19 at 10-11.) In support of this contention, TVA relies upon\n   <em>\n    City of Cookeville, Tenn. v. Upper Cumberland Membership Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5734747\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/484/380/\">\n    484 F.3d 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 389 &amp; n.5 (6th Cir. 2007). TVA quotes the court in\n   <em>\n    City of Cookeville\n   </em>\n   as saying that \"the text and legislative history of \u00a7 1442(a)(1) demonstrate that any federal agency sued can\n   <em>\n    always\n   </em>\n   remove under \u00a7 1442(a)(1) [.]\" (Doc. No. 19 at 10 (emphasis added by TVA).) TVA's clear implication is that the Sixth Circuit was referring to the\n   <em>\n    timing\n   </em>\n   of removal. (Doc. No. 19 at 10-11.)

There is not the slightest indication that Congress in the removal statutes used the term in any other sense, and under general rules of statutory construction the courts are required to give the term its ordinary meaning. The Court has been made aware of no colorable argument to the contrary.

The court then found that: \"the language of Section 1446(b)(1) unambiguously precludes judicial recognition of a revival exception.

As long ago as 1898, the Supreme Court declared that the removal statute must be construed as, \"in intention and effect, permitting\n   <em>\n    and requiring the defendant to file a petition for removal as soon as the action assumes the shape of a removable case\n   </em>\n   in the court in which it was brought.\"\n   <em>\n    Powers v.

This case still encompasses the same laws, and it remains, at base, a state environmental regulatory enforcement action against a federal agency. While the amended complaint presents new facts, they concern the same essential underlying subject matter as those in the original complaint-i.e., actions by TVA at the Gallatin Plant and attendant compliance responsibilities. The parties remain the same. The original claims remain. The state regulatory and permitting frameworks remain the same. The types of alleged violations generally remain the same (i.e., TWQCA, SWDA, NPDES Permit). While the amended complaint now places Pond A and Pond E under the rubric of the SWDA as opposed to the TWQCA, the addition of that claim, in the court's estimation, has not created a \"substantially new suit.\" The new \"SWDA cause of action\" incorporates many the same factual contentions and makes an underlying demand-that TVA comply with the state environmental regulatory regime-that parallels other claims in the case. While the filing of the amended complaint is surely not as \"minor\" an event as the State claims, the Court does not find it unjust for TVA to be expected to submit to state court jurisdiction on the augmented SWDA claims, particularly if factual developments have made appropriate a change in the categorization of Ponds A and E under the relevant state regulations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Put\n   simply, while there may be changes as to evidentiary requirements, discovery requirements, and a need for additional motion practice, the State's amended complaint is \"not so drastic that the purposes of the 30-day limitation would not be served by enforcing it.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2584281\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/464/1259/#p1260\">\n    464 F.Supp.2d at 1262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And, indeed, this case illustrates very nicely the purposes behind the 30-day limitation in the removal statute. Removal to federal court years after the original complaint has been filed and substantial proceedings-arguably unfavorable to the defendants-have taken place in the state courts interrupted an active litigation, thus reducing judicial economy, and likely delivered an unearned tactical advantage into the hands of TVA. Given the obvious timing of events, it is just as possible that TVA removed this case because it was doing badly in the state court than because it felt that the amended complaint confronted it with such a different case from the one it had been fighting in that courts. As the Seventh Circuit explained, when declining to apply the very exception it had set forth, a \"kind of sensitivity is [ ] required of federal courts ... sensitivity to\n   the danger of encroaching unduly on the authority of the state courts.\"\n   <em>\n    Wilson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"460255\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/668/962/\">\n    668 F.2d at 966\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This case illustrates that danger. State law regulatory claims that began by being litigated in the state court system, arguably favorably to the plaintiffs up to this point, could have ended up being decided unfavorably to the plaintiffs by a federal court. \"[T]he district courts, in interpreting and applying section 1446(b), should bear in mind, and where possible avoid, the frictions in a harmonious federal system that result when litigation involving state law ... issues is abruptly shifted into federal court and the state proceedings ... are set at naught.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"460255\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/668/962/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   For all these reasons, TVA is not entitled to the benefit of the revival exception to \u00a7 1446.

(\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Case No. 3:15-cv-00424.) Among other things, TVA sought to have the federal action dismissed on the ground of diligent prosecution by the State in the state action. The federal action was eventually tried to a judgment against TVA and is now on appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    By October of 2017, TVA had made twenty-two document productions and produced over 43,000 pages in discovery.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The parties began scheduling many depositions ahead of the discovery deadline of at the end of September 2017. By July 2017, the depositions for numerous TVA witnesses had been requested and scheduling was being negotiated.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    In October 2016, TVA submitted an application to TDEC for renewal of the NPDES Permit. Subsequently, TVA notified the State that Pond A and Pond E were no longer being utilized for treatment of CCR process wastewater as part of the Ash Pond Complex. According to the State, this brought Pond A and Pond E under the regulatory rubric of the SWDA and excluded them from being included in the renewed NPDES Permit. The State concluded that its preferred remedy was a closure-on-site option, which involves removal of impoundments into an expansion of the existing on-site permitted landfill. This had led, in significant part, to the amended complaint.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    TVA contends that the amended complaint is \"substantially different from the allegations and causes of action in the [original complaint], in which [the State] alleged that Ponds A and E were part of [the Gallatin Plant's] single wastewater treatment unit and permitted as such under the [NPDES Permit.] (Doc. No. 19 at 7.) However, the State represents that what TVA calls a \"new SWDA cause of action\" in the amended complaint actually only takes into account regulatory changes necessitated by the \"the closure of the ponds, not violations for which the State is seeking civil penalties.\" (Doc. No. 22 at 8-9.) The amended complaint indeed contains a cause of action entitled \"Closure of Bottom Ash Pond A and Fly Ash Pond E\" that is premised on the SWDA, whereas the original complaint asserted only a TWQCA claim as to the entire Ash Pond Complex.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    Examples given by Wright &amp; Miller of the circumstances in which late removal may be effective under 1446(b)(3) include: \"plaintiff amends to include a claim for relief that falls within the subject matter jurisdiction of the federal courts, such as a federal question claim or a separate and independent claim that is removable,\" where the amount in controversy is increased to satisfy the jurisdictional requirement, or where a change in parties causes the parties to be completely diverse. 14B Fed.

(Doc. No. 18-1, Ex. 1 at \u00b6\u00b6 17, 52-53.) TVA argues that they are being confronted with \"a new legal theory\" that, because Ponds A and E will no longer be in use, they will not be covered by the NPDES Permit and will be regulated under the SWDA. (Doc. No. 19 at 17.) While the formal application of the SWDA to Ponds A and E in the amended complaint and permitting process may be \"new\" in the sense that it was not necessitated until the actual disuse of Ponds A and E, the\n    <em>\n     theory\n    </em>\n    of regulation of Ponds A and E under the SWDA cannot be\n    <em>\n     new\n    </em>\n    to TVA because when other ponds at the Gallatin Plant were previously closed, they (as part of the Non-Registered Site) became subject to regulation under the SWDA. So the idea of the potential regulation of disused Ponds A and E under the SWDA simply cannot have been an alien concept to TVA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    TVA argues that the amended complaint, if successful, would have the effect of \"circumventing the permit appeal process established by the Tennessee legislature under Tenn.

TVA is obviously not a novice at the permitting process, and that process will continue. TVA may now have new substantive arguments about what the State is trying to accomplish and how it is trying to accomplish it. TVA will have motion practice and permit appeals available to it and the Court will not pre-judge the merits of those arguments in determining the issue of remand. Suffice it to say that the Court does not agree with the broad claim that this case is now entitled to be removed on the simple ground that the Gallatin Plant may end up more strictly regulated than originally anticipated.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    The Court need not mention any other arguments, save one. The Court does not credit TVA's argument that this Court is more familiar with this case by virtue of having heard the related federal case. First, the state court had this matter before it for nearly three years and ruled on summary judgment, and so the claim that the state court has only a passing familiarity with this case is dubious.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Warren\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%201267579\">\n     2007 WL 1267579\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *6 (noting \"long history\" of thirteen months before state court, concluding that \"it is appropriate for this matter to be maintained in state court before the same judge who is fully familiar with the facts and parties in this case,\" and remanding). Second, this Court excluded matters involved in the state action from the federal litigation. Finally, the federal court case ended prior to some of the developments that gave rise to the amended complaint. Accordingly, this court is no more familiar with the amended complaint than the state court.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The Court also notes that the State and Citizens Groups filed two remand motions and frequently duplicative motion briefs and reply briefs.
