Defendants move to preclude the testimony of Plaintiffs' expert Michael Zazula and for summary judgment. For the reasons that follow, the Court will not preclude Zazula's testimony. The Court also denies Defendants' motion for summary judgment, as Plaintiffs have provided a qualified expert to testify as to the cause of the fire and questions of material fact remain on Plaintiff's claims of a design defect, a manufacturing defect, and a failure to warn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Court takes the following facts from the parties' statements of undisputed facts. The Fords obtained a 2000 Ford Windstar in 2007, when it was acquired from a relative. On November 30, 2012, between 3:00 PM and 3:30 PM, Mrs. Ford parked the Windstar in their home's two-car garage. Around 8:00 PM, Mrs. Ford heard noises coming from the garage, including the sound of breaking glass. She alerted her husband, who opened the door from the kitchen to the garage and saw smoke. Mr. Ford testified he attempted to extinguish the fire with a hose for about five minutes before fire personnel arrived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Fords filed a complaint on November 26, 2014 in the New Jersey Superior Court, Law Division, seeking recovery for uninsured losses. Shortly thereafter, Plymouth Rock Assurance filed a subrogation action on July 28, 2015 in the New Jersey Superior Court, Law Division, seeking recovery for the amounts paid pursuant to the Fords' insurance policy. Both actions were subsequently removed to federal court and consolidated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs seek recovery under the New Jersey Product Liability Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Plaintiffs' expert, Zazula, produced an August 29, 2016 Investigation Report. In his report, Zazula noted several fire investigators determined the fire originated in the Windstar. In particular, he relied on Frank J. Domenico Jr., the Fire Official/Fire Investigator for the Town of Hammonton; Jim McKendrick of Palumbo Investigations; and Stanley Paluski of\n   Sterling Investigative Services for their determination that the fire originated in the rear of the Windstar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   His report detailed the following with regard to his own investigation. On September 24, 2015, wiring from the Windstar was harvested for closer examination and radiographic exams. The wiring was also inspected under microscopy for evidence of electrical activity. Several of the conductors had evidence of electrical activity in the form of beading, which is consistent with an electrical defect such as a short circuit or high-resistance connection. Zazula determined the fire occurred due to the electrical defect (i.e., the beading), and that this was consistent with an earlier recall of the vehicle, Recall NHTSA-02V072000, which stated that contaminants entering the right rear passenger compartment could cause a short circuit in the rear wire harness, which could lead to a fire.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 10, 2017, Defendants filed their Motion to Preclude the Testimony of Michael Zazula and for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate where the Court is satisfied that \" 'the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits if any,' ... demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact\" and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\n   <em>\n    Celotex Corp. v.

While employed at YBH, there were recalls dealing with ignition coil fires. Consequently, Zazula attended over twenty courses dealing with \"the failure, the failure analysis, the mode of failure and what they were doing to remedy those failures.\" Zazula then went to Prestige Volkswagen, and then worked as a product analysis engineer for Volkswagen of America from 1999 to 2004. As a product analysis engineer, Zazula looked at vehicles and their related mechanical, electrical, and electromechanical failures, which also involved work with fires.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Zazula attended a number of National Association of Fire Investigators seminars and other related seminars on fire origin/cause. Zazula is a Certified Fire and Explosion Investigator. He obtained his certification around 2004, which was last updated in 2015. He has been a member of the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) since 2004. Further, Zazula has had over five hundred vehicle fire cases. In over one hundred of them, the fire occurred within the occupant space.

First, Defendants argue Zazula improperly relied on other fire investigators in determining where the fire originated. Second, Defendants argue Zazula's own methodology is unreliable and his conclusion is speculative. The Court addresses both arguments in turn.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Zazula's report noted that Domenico, McKendrick, and Paluski all concluded that the fire originated in the Windstar, specifically in the right rear area of the vehicle.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    Zazula testified at his deposition as follows. He was brought into this case to investigate a vehicle fire after the initial inspection concluded the fire did not start from anywhere outside the vehicle. His investigation \"was limited to the vehicle.... [His] job was to look at the vehicle to determine if the vehicle was involved and whether or not if it were and if it caused the fire, what caused the fire within the vehicle.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Zazula determined that the origin of the fire was in the Ford Windstar. The basis of this opinion \"was [his] investigation as well as the investigation of the other fire officials.\" He made this determination in part in reliance on the local fire official and three other investigators that had ruled out everything else in the garage. When asked what about his own investigation led him to conclude that the origin of the fire was in the Windstar, he stated: \"Looking at the vehicle. Looking at the damage to the vehicle. Looking at the wiring systems\n    within the vehicle. The testimony of the Fords and the time frame chronology as well as my knowledge, experience, education and training.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    As to ruling out other potential origins of the fire in the garage, Zazula testified that McKendrick ruled out other sources, and that he did not do that independently. Instead, he stated he \"rel[ied] on Mr. McKendrick's 50 years of expertise in fire investigations.... He went in. He ruled out every possible ignition scenario.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    Federal Rule of Evidence 703 provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n    An expert may base an opinion on facts or data in the case that the expert has been aware of or personally observed.

But if the facts or data would otherwise be inadmissible, the proponent of the opinion may disclose them to the jury only if their probative value in helping the jury evaluate the opinion substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    \"[E]xperts in various fields may rely properly on a wide variety of sources and may employ a similarly wide choice of methodologies in developing an expert opinion.\"\n    <em>\n     Cooper v.

In the view of this Court, it was permissible for Zazula to rely on the determinations of other on-site fire investigators, who could find no point of origin for the fire other than the Windstar in reaching his own expert opinion on the origin of the fire. In his deposition testimony, Zazula made clear he was not testifying as an expert on the issue of ruling out other origins of the fire, but rather was relying on the fire investigators' findings as a starting point for his own investigation into the cause of the fire.\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    In the view of this Court, this is precisely the situation contemplated by Rule 703.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    That the other investigators are not experts, and therefore their testimony inadmissible\n    as such, is of no matter. It seems obvious that a fire investigator would, in formulating his post-hoc opinion about the cause of a fire, look to the reports of responding investigators and their factual determinations, especially as it relates to other possible causes or origins of the fire.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Indeed,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n    Rule 703 contemplates that experts often rely upon third party reports when making a decision and that this customary reliance is itself an extraneous indicia of trustworthiness sufficient to justify the dispensing of cross-examination. It is assumed that the expert, having met the expert qualification test of Rule 702, has the skill to properly evaluate the hearsay and assign it appropriate probative value.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    <em>\n     Emigh v.

It should go without saying that it would be arguably irresponsible and unprofessional to ignore such data if it existed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    The Court recognizes that this interpretation of Zazula's testimony and Rule 703 presents some dangers. More specifically: a) that the jury will be left with the impression that Zazula formed an expert opinion ruling out other possible sources for the fire and b) that the jury should consider the findings of the fire investigators themselves as the opinions of court qualified experts. However, Plaintiffs expressly disavow any testimony falling under a) and any potential for b) is easily cured by a jury instruction making clear to the jury what expert opinions have been allowed-or not allowed-by the Court. With an appropriate limiting instruction and careful questioning by counsel so as not to overstep the ground rules set by the Court, this Court finds no issue with Zazula's reliance on the fire investigators' factual determinations that no other sources of ignitions were found and that such data formed a foundational predicate for his own expert opinion.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Allstate Ins.

While Defendants argue these other investigators themselves conducted improper and unreliable investigations, that is not an issue this Court can or should resolve. Any arguments Defendants have with regard to the underlying investigations themselves are questions not of legal admissibility but of factual weight, properly reserved for cross-examination of Zazula and any of the fire investigators who may be called as fact witnesses.\n    <em>\n     Stecyk v.

Accordingly, his own investigation contributed to his conclusion that the Windstar was the origin of the fire, based on his observation of the vehicle, the damage, the progression of the fire pattern, the exterior of the vehicle, and the wiring system within the vehicle. He determined that his observations \"were all consistent with the origin being in this vehicle.\" Thus, this is not a case where an expert \"simply 'parrot[s]' the ideas of other experts or individuals.\"\n    <em>\n     In re Wagner\n    </em>\n    , No. 06-1026,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%20966010\">\n     2007 WL 966010\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *4 (E.D.

Zazula's deposition outlines the steps he took in reaching his conclusion on causation. Wiring from the rear of the Windstar was harvested for closer examination and radiographic exams. The rear specifically was targeted because that is where most of the wiring was located and because the pattern of progression of the fire indicated it started in the rear. The components had to be radiographed, as damage from the fire resulted in plastic melting and solidifying on the components. Accordingly, while some components could be observed through the naked eye, others required radiography.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    An area of one component caught Zazula's attention, as solidification of the plastic did not allow him to see the area clearly. Accordingly, Zazula harvested that piece, cleaned it, and looked at it under microscopy for evidence of electrical activity. At that point, Zazula saw activity on that section of the electrical wiring. Zazula described this as a copper globule, which indicated an abnormal electrical event. He\n    stated that, \"[w]hen you have an arc that results in a bead, that clearly indicates the presence of [an] abnormal ... electrical event. And beading is consistent with an electrical defect and/or anomaly such as short circuit or a high resistance connection.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    Zazula testified that NFPA 921 is \"a guide,\" which provides the scientific methodology that is used, in part, in investigating fires. NFPA 921 is typically considered to \"provide[ ] a reliable fire causation determination methodology.\"\n    <em>\n     State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v.

However, Zazula did not testify as to the methodology outlined in NFPA 921, nor did Plaintiffs provide this Court with a copy of NFPA 921. Accordingly, the Court is unable to compare the methodology used by Zazula with the established methodology in NFPA 921. Nonetheless, the Court finds Zazula's experience renders his methodology and opinion sufficiently reliable to proceed to trial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    \"[T]here may be some circumstances where one's training and experience will provide an adequate foundation to admit an opinion and furnish the necessary reliability to allow a jury to consider it ....\"\n    <em>\n     Oddi v.

Mar. 28, 2002) (\"[D]eterminations of cause and effect in vehicle fires\" \"are presumably normally made by experts in the field.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Plaintiffs and Defendants both produced experts on the issue of causation. As has already been discussed, Zazula, Plaintiffs' expert, opines that the fire was caused by an electrical defect in the Windstar. By comparison, Colwell, Defendants' expert, opines that \"only a limited section of the garage was excavated to identify possible ignition sources\" and thus \"numerous possible ignition sources in other locations in the garage were not identified and examined to determine if they may have acted as an ignition source for the fire.\" Consequently, Colwell determined that the \"cause of the fire is undetermined.\" Accordingly, there remains a question of fact as to the cause of the fire, rendering summary judgment inappropriate.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The Court does not find Defendants' other arguments persuasive that Plaintiffs have failed to present sufficient evidence on their claims under the New Jersey Product Liability Act. Defendants argue there is insufficient evidence of a design defect in the Windstar. However, the Court finds Zazula's testimony and the recall records to be sufficient evidence of a design defect to survive summary judgment. More specifically, certain documents from Defendants suggest the Windstar lacked seals or sealing material adequate to insulate the rear wiring harnesses from outside contaminants. Further, Zazula noticed several conductors had evidence of electrical activity in the form of beading, which is consistent with an electrical defect. This evidence suggests a defect that existed at the time the vehicle left Defendants' control.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Further, Defendants argue Plaintiffs failed to prove the availability of a practical and feasible alternative design under their design defect theory.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Lewis v. Am. Cyanamid Co.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"492039\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/155/544/\">\n     155 N.J. 544\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"492039\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/155/544/\">\n     715 A.2d 967\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 975 (1998) (\"To succeed on [a] design-defect claim, [a] plaintiff [i]s required to prove that a practical and feasible alternative design existed that would have reduced or prevented [the] harm.\"). The Court finds sufficient evidence of an alternative design to survive summary judgment from the documentation of the recall. As Plaintiffs indicate, Defendants produced a Q&amp;A form, in which Defendants explained that vehicles produced before and after the dates covered by the NHTSA-02V072000 recall did not include the defect identified in the recall: \"A different structural sealer was utilized in prior years. Following the dates of this recall, new sealing techniques and inspection processes have been instituted at the assembly plant.\" As Defendants have already started using an alternative design, this argument fails.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Finally, Defendants argue that even if there was a defect, Plaintiffs cannot succeed under a failure to warn theory because Defendants argue they fulfilled their duty to warn Plaintiffs by issuing the NHTSA-02V072000 recall. Plaintiffs counter that Defendants did not fulfill their duty because Defendants did not make a public statement regarding the recall. Plaintiffs argue that, as they were not the original owners of the Windstar, a jury could find that, by not making a public statement, they were not sufficiently warned. Defendants, however, respond that a public statement is not required, that a recall notice was sent to the Windstar's prior owner, and that the recall work was in fact performed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    N.J.S.A. 2A:58C-4 provides, in pertinent part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n    In any product liability action the manufacturer or seller shall not be liable for harm caused by a failure to warn if ... the manufacturer or seller provides an adequate warning or instruction.

This is procedurally improper although the Court recognizes this was probably in fair response to Plaintiffs' arguments concerning a manufacturing defect claim in their opposition brief. This procedural defect aside, to the extent that Defendants move for summary judgment on a manufacturing defect claim, that motion is denied. The Court determines that because a disputed issue of material fact remains on the manufacturing defect theory such a claim survives summary judgment as well. More specifically, Plaintiffs identified a document related to Recall NHTSA-02V072000 produced by Defendants which explained that \"leakage [was] happening\" because \"[t]here was too much body build variability, and application of the sealer to seal the gap was not consistent.\" This evidence suggests a manufacturing, as opposed to a design, defect, sufficient to allow this theory to proceed to trial.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
