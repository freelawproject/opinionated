Plaintiff Robinette Kelley (Kelley or Plaintiff) resists. The Court held a hearing on the Motion on April 26, 2018. Attorneys Derek Teeter and Michael Raupp were present for ISU, and attorneys Thomas Bullock and Beatriz Mate-Kodjo were present for Kelley. The matter is fully submitted and ready for disposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   ISU is a public state university located in Ames, Iowa, and as such, is the recipient of federal financial assistance. Kelley was employed by ISU as ISU's equal opportunity director and Title IX coordinator from February 4, 2013, to October 14, 2015. Kelley's immediate supervisor was Miles Lackey, Associate Vice President and Chief of Staff of ISU (Associate Vice President Lackey), who reported directly to then-President Steven Leath (President Leath). Kelley was ISU's first equal opportunity director, and upon her hiring, was told by Associate Vice President Lackey that he wanted her to be \" 'the face' of the Equal Opportunity office on campus.\" Compl. \u00b6 42, ECF No. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In her role, Kelley managed ISU's equal opportunity and affirmative action programs. Kelley alleges, however, that contrary to United States Department of Education (DOE) guidelines on Title IX, ISU failed to provide her with \"the necessary authority or support to implement her authority required by her position and by Title IX.\" Compl. \u00b6 46. For example, Kelley alleges that ISU did not provide her with direct supervision by President Leath, did not give her authority to coordinate compliance with Title IX, did not adequately fund or staff her office, did not devote resources to ensuring equal educational opportunities for students on the basis of gender, and required her to serve in multiple additional roles, including affirmative action compliance officer, Section 504 coordinator, Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) compliance officer, and civil rights investigator. Kelley further alleges that ISU failed to provide her with historical information regarding sexual assault and harassment complaints, denied her permission to revise the policy and practices on interim measures to protect student victims of sexual assault, and prevented her from ensuring that victims of sexual violence and harassment could rely on ISU for case-specific measures ensuring equal education opportunities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Kelley alleges that, during her tenure as Title IX coordinator, she became increasingly concerned with ISU's compliance with Title IX, yet \"began to receive pushback from other administrators regarding Title IX compliance issues.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 53-54. According to Kelley, ISU bypassed her office by directing student Title IX complainants to the Dean of Students Office or to University Human Resources, entities she alleges had a vested interest in the outcome of the Title IX complaints. Kelley allegedly received \"push-back [sic] and retaliation when she challenged ISU's compliance with Title IX and advocated for the need to take steps to comply with federal and state civil rights laws.\" Compl. \u00b6 63. Kelley alleges that ISU administrators ignored her, discouraged her, prevented her from processing complaints, denied her request to contract with two third-party contractors to assist with Title IX investigations, and suggested that she reduce her efforts to comply with Title IX or behave in a manner that would permit ISU to avoid its obligations under Title IX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Kelley received a performance evaluation on February 25, 2014. During the meeting, Associate Vice President Lackey told Kelley \"she needed to exhibit better ways to 'collaborate' and 'show leadership.' \" Compl. \u00b6 71. He stated that ISU administrators from the university's legal department and human resources had become \"afraid of her\" because she was always wearing her \"investigator hat\" and she was too \"litigious.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 72-73. Associate Vice President Lackey nonetheless told Kelley \"her overall performance was '99% good.' \" Compl. \u00b6 74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following the meeting, Kelley continued to make verbal and written complaints regarding Title IX compliance to Associate Vice President Lackey, President Leath, and other administrators. In July 2014, Kelley delivered to Associate Vice President Lackey a detailed compliance memo outlining her concerns regarding Title IX compliance. The compliance memo questioned ISU's protocol regarding processing of student complaints, withholding incidents from the Title IX office, and involvement of university counsel in Title IX investigations. The compliance memo also outlined several cases in which, according to Kelley, ISU had compromised her Title IX role and negatively impacted the Title IX rights of ISU students. Kelley alleges that, in response to the memo, \"the university counsel, human resources, and the president's office retaliated against [her] and ramped up efforts to marginalize her authority on campus.\" Compl. \u00b6 82. Kelley further alleges that, instead of collaborating with her to bring ISU into compliance with Title IX, \"ISU administrators intimidated [her], made veiled threats, and attempted to coerce her into backing down from pursuing meaningful responses to her compliance concerns on campus,\" all of which interfered with her job duties. Compl. \u00b6 84.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In April 2015, the DOE's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) began a Title IX compliance review of ISU. OCR enforces, among other statutes, Title IX, and provides technical assistance and guidance to recipients of federal funds so that they can take proactive efforts to comply with Title IX prior to a compliance review or lawsuit. OCR initiated the investigation after a complaint was filed with OCR by a female victim of sexual assault. Kelley alleges that ISU Counsel Paul Tanaka informed all administrators, including Kelley, not to discuss decisions made regarding the student's OCR complaint and to deny knowledge to OCR about why certain decisions were made. An OCR investigator interviewed Kelley in April 2015. Kelley informed Associate Vice President Lackey that the OCR investigator had told her she could file an OCR complaint based on Kelley's lack of independence, authority, and other Title IX compliance concerns.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In August 2015, during a sexual misconduct retreat, ISU announced that it was creating a sexual misconduct coordinator position in ISU's Student Affairs Division. Kelley alleges that, on the day of the retreat, Senior Vice President of Student Affairs Thomas Hill stated that ISU was creating the position because ISU wanted student-victims to report to the Dean of Students Office instead of Kelley.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 4, 2015, Kelley received her final performance evaluation. Three days prior, Kelley had received praise from a member of the ISU Board of Regents for a training she had conducted. During the meeting, Kelley brought up to Associate Vice President Lackey her August 2015 OCR complaint, which addressed her lack of independence and authority to enforce Title IX. Though Associate Vice President Lackey flagged two complaints about Kelley's performance, he told Kelley\n   \"her overall performance was '95% good.' \" Compl. \u00b6 106.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 14, 2015, five weeks and five days after the evaluation, Associate Vice President Lackey fired Kelley. During an October 27, 2015 phone call, President Leath informed Kelley that Associate Vice President Lackey had justified her termination because Kelley had refused to attend leadership training and classes, a claim that Kelley disputes. Kelley was told that Associate Vice President Lackey \"wanted to take the Equal Opportunity/Title IX office in a different direction and that he did not feel [she] had the leadership skills to move the office in a new direction.\" Compl. \u00b6 110.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 12, 2017, Kelley filed the instant lawsuit in the District Court of Iowa for Polk County. On November 8, 2017, ISU filed a notice of removal with this Court. ISU's removal was timely under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201446\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), and Kelley's claims, which arise under federal law, fall within the original jurisdiction of the Court under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Count I of the Complaint alleges that ISU committed discrimination in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201681\">\n    20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Kelley alleges that ISU engaged in the \"usurpation, removal, and watering down of [her] Title IX Coordinator job duties, independence, influence, and authority,\" which in turn \"place[d] employees and students at risk of sex based discrimination in violation of Title IX.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 118-19. Kelley alleges that \"ISU's inaction indicates their [sic] deliberate indifference to the rights [she] advocated for on behalf of female victims of sexual assault.\" Compl. \u00b6 122.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Count II of the Complaint alleges that ISU retaliated against Kelley in violation of Title IX. Kelley alleges that ISU maintained \"policies and practices ... that functioned to deny equal education opportunities to students and employees based on gender,\" including denying these individuals \"Title IX protections and rights.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 135, 139. Kelley alleges that \"ISU did not permit [her] to exercise her duties required under Title IX\" by diverting students from her office, removing her decision-making authority, and ignoring her recommendations. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 131, 138. Kelley alleges this resulted in \"male perpetrators of sexual and domestic violence [being] given disproportionate protections in the Title IX investigation process and given\n   <em>\n    more than\n   </em>\n   equal benefits and opportunities in educational programs and activities while female victims were given\n   <em>\n    less than\n   </em>\n   equal benefits and opportunities.\" Compl. \u00b6 145. Kelley lodged complaints about ISU's Title IX violations with an OCR investigator and ISU administrators. Kelley alleges that, as a result of these complaints and her refusal to implement non-Title IX-compliant policies, she was fired in violation of Title IX.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Count III of the Complaint alleges that ISU engaged in race and gender discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Kelley, \"an African American female,\" alleges that \"male and white colleagues were treated with more respect ... and their ideas, concerns, and suggestions were given deference because they were permitted to exercise the authority of their positions on campus.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 148, 150. Kelley alleges that, following the 2015 OCR investigation, \"male and white colleagues were given opportunities to resign from ISU with significant buyouts or severance payments, but [she] was summarily, and wrongfully, fired.\" Compl. \u00b6 152. Kelley alleges that several of these male and white colleagues \"perpetuated sex-based discrimination at ISU,\" while Kelley consistently reported ISU's non-compliant practices. Compl. \u00b6 153.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Kelley requests that this Court enjoin ISU to provide a strategic plan for the Title IX office to review policies and procedures on sex discrimination and to participate in the revision of policies to best comply with Title IX. Kelley requests that ISU be enjoined from taking adverse action against Title IX coordinators and employees who report compliance concerns, oppose non-compliant Title IX policies, or participate in federal or state civil rights investigations. Kelley requests that this Court require ISU to draft a policy vesting Title IX coordinators with the independence required by Title IX and to undergo a historical analysis of sexual assault and harassment complaints on campus. Kelley further seeks damages, compensating her for her injuries, emotional distress, and lost wages, as well as punitive damages, interest allowed by law, attorney's fees, and such other relief as this Court deems appropriate. ISU's Motion seeks dismissal of the Complaint in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Kelley alleges that ISU maintained \"policies and practices ... that functioned to deny equal education opportunities to students and employees based on gender,\" including denying these individuals \"Title IX protections and rights.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 135, 139. Kelley alleges that, by circumventing her authority as Title IX coordinator, \"male perpetrators of sexual and domestic violence were given disproportionate protections in the Title IX investigation process and given\n   <em>\n    more than\n   </em>\n   equal benefits and opportunities in educational programs and activities while female victims were given\n   <em>\n    less than\n   </em>\n   equal benefits and opportunities.\" Compl. \u00b6 145. Kelley alleges that, unlike plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Skare\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Atkinson\n   </em>\n   , ISU did not support her efforts as ISU's Title IX compliance officer. For example, Kelley alleges that administrators diverted students from her office and ignored her recommendations. Kelley alleges that, as a result, she complained to an OCR investigator and ISU administrators about ISU's failure to comply with Title IX.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   ISU argues that flagging Title IX concerns was what Kelley was expected to do as Title IX coordinator-and in making these complaints, Kelley did no more than her job, so her claim is barred under the manager rule. But Kelley's allegations frame the nature of her role as Title IX coordinator differently. According to Kelley,\n   ISU\n   <em>\n    directed\n   </em>\n   that she remain silent during the OCR investigation and implement policies that would have rendered ISU\n   <em>\n    non-compliant\n   </em>\n   with Title IX. Kelley alleges, similar to the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    HBE Corp.\n   </em>\n   , that she refused to obey ISU directives that would have stifled Kelley from complaining to the OCR investigator and ISU administrators about \"institutionalized sex based discrimination\" against \"female victims of violence.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 84, 143-44. Kelley's alleged refusal to obey these directives suggests that she stepped outside her employment role-as that role was narrowly construed by ISU-and engaged in protected activity under Title IX.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Kelley has also plausibly alleged that ISU took adverse action against her, and that this adverse action was causally linked to Kelley's protected activity.\n   <em>\n    Clausen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3795741\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/664/1038/#p1047\">\n    664 F.Supp.2d at 1047-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Kelley alleges she suffered an adverse action-being fired by Associate Vice President Lackey. Kelley alleges this was the result of her OCR complaint, her complaints to ISU administrators, and her refusal to implement ISU's non-Title IX-compliant policies. Kelley has sufficiently pleaded a claim for retaliation in violation of Title IX.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
