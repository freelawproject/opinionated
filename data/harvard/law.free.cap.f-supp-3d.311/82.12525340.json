Those provisions make it an unlawful trade practice, among other things, to \"represent that goods ... have ... characteristics, ingredients, uses, benefits, or quantities that they do not have,\" \"misrepresent as to a material fact which has a tendency to mislead,\" or \"fail to state a material fact if such failure tends to mislead.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203648966\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2028-3904\">\n    D.C.
