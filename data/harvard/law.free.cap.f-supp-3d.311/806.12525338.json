The instant action started when Tchividjian and G.R.A.C.E. then sued Federal Insurance Company (\"Federal\"), also in the Lynchburg Circuit Court. Tchividjian and G.R.A.C.E. are seeking a declaratory judgment that their insurance contract with Federal requires Federal to defend and indemnify them in the underlying suits filed by Boyer.

The Court now works through these factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The first of these factors, whether the state has a strong interest in having the issues decided in its courts, is inconclusive. Certainly \"[t]here exists an interest in having the most authoritative voice speak on the meaning of applicable law, and that voice belongs to the state courts when state law controls the resolution of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Mitcheson v.

But \"defer[ring] to the state court tort case in the circumstances before us will not advance the State's interests significantly because (1) the contractual coverage issue will not be decided by the state tort case, and (2) [the insurer] is not a party to the state case.\"\n   <em>\n    Penn-Am.

They also both came to opposite conclusions on whether this factor favored the exercise of jurisdiction. The primary difference between the cases is whether the issue of state law presented in the declaratory judgment action was \"difficult, complex, or unsettled.\"\n   <em>\n    Gross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8453017\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/468/199/#p211\">\n    468 F.3d at 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Fourth Circuit has repeatedly recognized that states have stronger interests in deciding cases when the issue is novel or otherwise problematic.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Centennial Life Ins.

The underlying suits allege the plaintiffs in this suit defamed Boyer through the publication of a blog post that alleged Boyer \"crossed sexual boundaries.\" Whether National is required to defend the plaintiffs and indemnify them for any damages arising out of those lawsuits turns on the terms of the parties' contract. Specifically, the parties both point to contractual language excluding coverage for claims \"based upon,\" \"arising from,\" or \"in consequence of\" any actual or alleged sexual behavior.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Many of\n   these terms have been definitively construed by the Supreme Court of Virginia, although not specifically in the sexual abuse context.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doctors Co. v.
