Cooper (\"Attorney Cooper\" or \"Cooper\") from representing Joyce in this case. It contends that Cooper is a necessary percipient witness and that his representation of Joyce poses a conflict of interest. The government also proposes the issuance of a subpoena\n   <em>\n    duces\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    tecum\n   </em>\n   to Attorney Cooper and requests that this Court perform an\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    camera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    ex\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    parte\n   </em>\n   examination of Attorney Cooper's file to determine whether certain documents fall within the crime-fraud exception to attorney-client privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   From 1998 to 2017, Mr. Joyce served as an elected State Senator in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He represented the Norfolk, Bristol and Plymouth district and served for nine terms. Joyce is also a member of the Massachusetts Bar and maintained a law practice while he held office which is permitted under Massachusetts law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In December, 2017, a federal grand jury returned a 113-count indictment against Joyce, charging him with criminal conduct spanning from early 2010 through February, 2016. The indictment alleges that, as a State Senator, Joyce attempted to exploit his official office for private gain in multiple corrupt schemes. The indictment was preceded by a series of articles in the Boston Globe, an investigation by the Enforcement Division of the Massachusetts State Ethics Commission, a federal grand jury investigation and a search of Joyce's law office in February, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The first alleged scheme involves\n   <em>\n    quid\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    pro\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    quo\n   </em>\n   agreements with an energy insurance brokerage company which, for the time being, will remain anonymous and will hereinafter be referred to as \"EIB\". According to the government, Joyce agreed to sponsor, file, amend and vote on\n   property-assessed-clean-energy (\"PACE\") legislation that benefitted EIB in exchange for monthly cash payments and EIB common stock. In addition, the indictment alleges that Joyce and EIB's CEO agreed that Joyce would act in his official capacity to influence the Massachusetts Division of Insurance (\"DOI\") to act favorably toward EIB.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In the second alleged scheme, Joyce accepted privately held EIB common stock from the EIB CEO in exchange for Joyce's official action with respect to PACE and the DOI. When the custodian of Joyce's IRA account would not authorize a purchase of EIB common stock as a tax-free rollover using Joyce's existing simplified employee pension IRA (\"SEP-IRA\") assets, Joyce orchestrated a purchase of that common stock using fictitious retirement accounts he created for himself and his spouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The third alleged scheme involved payments by a coffee franchise owner to Joyce for non-existent legal services and free deliveries of hundreds of pounds of coffee in exchange for the promotion, sponsorship and filing of state legislation by Joyce for the benefit of the franchise owner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Attorney Cooper began representing Joyce in March, 2015, after the Boston Globe began an investigation of his conduct as a senator, his law practice, alleged conflicts of interest and campaign finances. Cooper represented Joyce in his interaction with the Globe and with respect to a separate investigation by the Massachusetts Ethics Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Government contends that Joyce engaged Cooper to make false representations to the Globe and the Ethics Commission. Those statements include,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , a letter to the Ethics Commission stating that Joyce purchased EIB common stock with funds from his SEP-IRA and an email to the Ethics Commission including copies of a fraudulently backdated invoice and checks related to the purchase of coffee. Defendant denies that those communications included false statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Government filed the motion at issue in February, 2018. In addition to defendant's opposition to that motion,\n   <em>\n    amicus\n   </em>\n   briefs in support of defendant have been filed by the Massachusetts Bar Association and the Boston Bar Association.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Disqualification of Attorney Cooper\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\" That right to counsel attaches when an individual is arrested and held to answer criminal charges.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gouveia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196731\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/180/#p185\">\n    467 U.S. 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 185-186,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196731\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/180/#p185\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6196731\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/180/#p185\">\n    81 L.Ed.2d 146\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984).

Accordingly, the government argues, Joyce turned Cooper into a percipient witness whom the government intends to call.

He has also agreed to stipulate that he waives any right to rely on the advice of Cooper or the law firm of Todd &amp; Weld concerning the disputed statements and that he knowingly, voluntarily and with advice of independent counsel waives any right to contend that Cooper represented him while under a conflict of interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   At the hearing on the motion to disqualify, the government argued that the stipulation was insufficient because it does not state that 1) Cooper disclosed to the Ethics Commission all material information that Joyce provided to him or 2) Joyce is the sole source of information provided to the Commission. Those concerns are unavailing. Joyce now stipulates that he is the sole source of the statements concerning his state of mind and contends that the fact that Cooper cannot testify that Joyce was the sole source of every statement is not a material factor in the pending motion to disqualify. The government offers no authority to the contrary. Given Joyce's revised stipulation, the government has failed to show that Cooper's testimony is necessary to its case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The drastic remedy of disqualification is unwarranted in light of Joyce's stipulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Diozzi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1649821\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/807/10/#p13\">\n    807 F.2d 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 16 (reversing, as constitutional error, disqualification of defense counsel where stipulation was adequate substitute for attorney's testimony). The\n   <em>\n    Diozzi\n   </em>\n   court rejected the government's argument that the jury could be confused by the written submission and that defense counsel's testimony would aid the effective ascertainment of truth, concluding that the government \"failed to support the disqualification order on best evidence grounds.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1649821\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/807/10/#p13\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1649821\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/807/10/#p13\">\n    at 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Diozzi\n   </em>\n   , the government here has failed to demonstrate that, without Cooper's testimony, it will have to settle for less than its best evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Conflict of Interest\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The government submits that Cooper must be disqualified because Joyce enlisted him as an active participant in concealment of the ongoing racketeering activity which created a potential or actual conflict of interest. Defendant responds that his stipulation waiving the alleged conflict should resolve the matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Although a presumption exists in favor of defendant's counsel of choice, that presumption \"may be overcome by a showing of a serious potential for conflict.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Grand Jury Proceedings\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10534285\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/859/1021/#p1024\">\n    859 F.2d 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1024 (1st Cir. 1988).

Should Cooper act in such a manner he would be subject to a renewal of the motion to disqualify. Such a scenario can perhaps be avoided, however, by a directive to trial counsel to refer to Cooper as \"the attorney who was representing the defendant at the time.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Finally, the government submits that Cooper's defense of Joyce may be improperly restricted by Cooper's self-interest and the Massachusetts Rules of Professional Conduct. Both contentions are misplaced. First, the government has yet to produce any evidence that Cooper acted illegally.

There is no indication thus far that Attorney Cooper has run afoul of his ethical responsibilities in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Provided defendant takes full responsibility for and adopts all statements Attorney Cooper made on his behalf and disclaims any reliance on an advice-of-counsel or\n   <em>\n    mens\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    rea\n   </em>\n   defense, the Court perceives no need for Cooper to testify in this case. Nor does the Court have grounds to believe that Attorney Cooper has engaged in any criminal behavior such that the alleged conflict of interest would be rendered unwaivable.

The Court should consider\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   among other things, the volume of materials the district court has been asked to review, the relative importance to the case of the alleged privileged information, and the likelihood that the evidence produced through\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    camera\n   </em>\n   review, together with other available evidence then before the court, will establish that the crime-fraud exception does apply.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216839\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/554/#p563\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The government's original subpoena Schedule A was notably overbroad, requesting, as it did, documents \"from January 1, 2013, through the present\". Defense counsel estimated compliance would have required the production of ten thousand pages. The government's revised Schedule A is more reasonable in both duration and scope. The prosecution has not been fully forthcoming as to the relative importance to the case of the privileged information but it is clear that such information is critical to certain counts of the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Defendant correctly observes that the actual submissions to the Ethics Commission comprise only two of the 113 counts of the indictment (and two racketeering acts). Nonetheless, the backdated coffee invoice is a core allegation in this case, as are the allegedly false statements submitted with respect to EIB. In light of the government's revised and circumscribed Schedule A, the Court finds that an\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    camera\n   </em>\n   review would be reasonable under the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gorski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362053\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/807/451/\">\n    807 F.3d at 460-62\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming district court's determination that\n   <em>\n    Zolin\n   </em>\n   review was appropriate).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Defendant further maintains that, even if this Court should decide to conduct an\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    camera\n   </em>\n   examination, it should limit production pursuant to the subpoena to statements to the Ethics Commission that were actually false. That argument is unpersuasive. As an initial matter, if, as the indictment alleges, Joyce enlisted Cooper to submit a backdated coffee invoice and check to the Ethics Commission, Joyce used Cooper for the purpose of committing a crime or fraud, triggering the exemption. Second, defendant submits that Joyce's statements regarding whether his contacts with the DOI were \"ministerial\" cannot be false, because \"legal arguments based upon facts are not true or false.\" Although defendant cites a few tort cases distinguishing statements of fact from statements of opinion in the realm of negligent misrepresentation and defamation, he provides no case law declaiming that objectively erroneous legal opinions offered in bad faith cannot be false. This Court declines the invitation to create that new rule. Finally,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   under principles of subject-matter waiver, the waiver of privilege applies as to the entire subject matter, not a narrowly defined subset of documents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gorski\n   </em>\n   , No. CRIM. 12-10338-FDS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%204656576\">\n    2014 WL 4656576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (D.

If the Court finds such communications, it is to hold an\n   <em>\n    ex\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    parte\n   </em>\n   hearing to allow the party holding the privilege to be heard on the subject before the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gorski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4362053\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/807/451/\">\n    807 F.3d at 457\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The Court reiterates that a\n   <em>\n    Zolin\n   </em>\n   review is initiated by the low evidentiary standard of a \"good faith belief by a reasonable person.\"\n   <em>\n    Zolin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216839\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/554/#p563\">\n    491 U.S. at 572\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216839\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/491/554/#p563\">\n    109 S.Ct. 2619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court makes no assumption as to the import of the\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    camera\n   </em>\n   examination or its bearing upon the ultimate issues in this case and the Court is cognizant that the government has not alleged (much less proffered facts of) improper conduct on the part of defense counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   <strong>\n    VI.\n    <em>\n     Amici curiae\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In addition to an affidavit prepared by former Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Associate Justice Robert J. Cordy, two friend of the court briefs were filed in opposition to the government's motion. The first was submitted by the Massachusetts Bar Association, the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, the ACLU of Massachusetts and 71 prominent criminal defense attorneys. The second was submitted by the Boston Bar Association.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The briefs address the \"serious policy implications\" that the government's position would have on the administration of justice. The Cordy Affidavit highlights the value of pre-indictment and pre-charging discussions between lawyers representing the targets of government investigations and the government agents and lawyers conducting those investigations. The Massachusetts Bar Association brief warns against the risk that the \"government might seek to disqualify criminal defense counsel for tactical reasons\" while the Boston Bar Association brief contends that pre-indictment statements to a government agency implicate the First Amendment right to petition the government. It insists that the First Amendment protects \"some falsehood in order to protect speech that matters.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The warnings of the\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   give pause to the government's motion to disqualify but are less concerned about a\n   <em>\n    Zolin\n   </em>\n   review. This Court's decision will not facilitate the government's \"veto [of] a defendant's counsel of choice\" but the government has convinced a grand jury that there is probable cause to believe defendant enlisted an attorney for the purpose of committing a crime or fraud so it will issue its toned-down subpoena. During the\n   <em>\n    in\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    camera\n   </em>\n   review, the Court will either determine that the crime-fraud exception does not apply (in which case the\n   <em>\n    status\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    quo\n   </em>\n   will continue) or that the crime-fraud exception applies (in which case the defendant was not entitled to the attorney-client privilege in the first place).\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clark\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3917212\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/289/1/#p14\">\n    289 U.S. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 14,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3917212\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/289/1/#p14\">\n    53 S.Ct. 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3917212\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/289/1/#p14\">\n    77 L.Ed. 993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1933) (explaining privilege does not apply \"where the relation giving birth to it has been fraudulently begun or fraudulently continued\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Even where the crime-fraud exception applies, a defendant's waiver of conflict of interest is foreclosed only where the attorney herself commits unlawful acts. The Boston Bar brief acknowledges that the First Amendment offers no protection where a \"lawyer knowingly communicated false information on behalf of his client.\" Furthermore, a finding at this time that there is a good-faith basis to believe Joyce intended to use the services of counsel to foster a crime or fraud is not a finding that the crime-fraud exemption automatically applies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Edgar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7641694\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/82/499/#p508\">\n    82 F.3d 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 508-509 (1st Cir. 1996) (observing\n   that \"[t]he third line of defense [to protect defendant's privilege] is that there will ultimately be a disinterested judicial determination of the issue\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Accordingly, the\n   <em>\n    amici\n   </em>\n   briefs are carefully noted and the Court is confident that a\n   <em>\n    Zolin\n   </em>\n   review will not precipitate the parade of horribles foretold therein.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the government's motion to disqualify Attorney Howard M.
