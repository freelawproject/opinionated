D.E. 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiffs, Envision HealthCare Corporation (\"Envision\") and Sheridan HealthCorp, Inc. (\"Sheridan\"), sue United HealthCare Insurance Company (\"United\") for damages stemming from alleged contractual breaches.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-4. The contract required Plaintiffs to pay for the medical expenses of patients insured by United, and United, in turn, would pay Plaintiffs according to pre-determined payment rates.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ex. A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Defendant unilaterally changed the contractual payment rates in response to perceived overbilling by Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 35, 55.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The contract provides that in the event the Parties disagree as to the existence of overbilling, \"the issue will be resolved through the dispute resolution process set forth in the Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. The dispute resolution provision requires that \"any and all disputes\" arising out the contract be referred to binding arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Parties agree that this mandatory arbitration provision is enforceable as written, and that all of Plaintiffs' claims fall within its scope. Plaintiffs argue, however, that by unilaterally changing the payment rate, Defendants waived the arbitration provision, and therefore Plaintiffs are no longer bound by it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   1)\n   <em>\n    Defendant Has Not Waived Its Arbitration Right\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   An agreement to arbitrate may be waived.\n   <em>\n    Ivax Corp. v.

The Eleventh Circuit has established a two-part test to determine whether a party has waived its right to arbitrate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"940747\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/286/1309/#p1315\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   First, the court must decide \"if, under the totality of the circumstances, the party has acted inconsistently with the arbitration right.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"940747\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/286/1309/#p1315\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotations omitted) (citing\n   <em>\n    Ivax Corp. v.

Second, the court must look to see \"whether, by doing so, that party has in some way prejudiced the other party.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"940747\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/286/1309/#p1315\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \"A contractual breach alone, however, cannot rise to the level of waiver; otherwise, parties would never arbitrate contract disputes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"940747\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/286/1309/#p1315\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"940747\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/286/1309/#p1315\">\n    at 1319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Here, Plaintiffs attempt to do precisely that which\n   <em>\n    Ivax\n   </em>\n   prohibits: turn a breach of contract into a waiver of an arbitration clause. They argue that United waived the arbitration provision by unilaterally changing the payment rates, thereby engaging in \"self-help\" rather than obeying the procedures set forth in the dispute resolution provision. No case cited by Plaintiff or any in the Court's own review extends the waiver rule so far. Waiver has been found where a party litigated for three years before moving for arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Garcia v. Wachovia Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3631980\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/699/1273/\">\n    699 F.3d 1273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2012). And where a party waited five years to compel arbitration and colluded with its insured to injure the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    Morewitz v. W. of England Ship Owners Mut. Prot. &amp; Indem. Ass'n (Luxembourg)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7418030\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/62/1356/#p1366\">\n    62 F.3d 1356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1366 (11th Cir. 1995). It has also been found where a party refused to participate in arbitration, and where an arbitration provision was so one-sided as to be unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cox v. Ocean View Hotel Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4038040\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/533/1114/#p1124\">\n    533 F.3d 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1124 (9th Cir. 2008) ;\n   <em>\n    Hooters of Am., Inc. v. Phillips\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11626011\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/173/933/#p938\">\n    173 F.3d 933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 938 (4th Cir. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This case is different; the waiver is premised on a breach alone. To extend the waiver rule to a contractual breach alone would, as\n   <em>\n    Ivax\n   </em>\n   warns, render arbitration provisions meaningless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ivax Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"940747\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/286/1309/#p1315\">\n    286 F.3d at 1319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Additionally, Plaintiff has not identified any prejudice. Plaintiff asserts that Defendant's unilateral change to the payment rates has caused it harm, but this is harm from the alleged contractual breach, not prejudice flowing from conduct inconsistent with Defendant's right to arbitrate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Citibank, N.A. v. Stok &amp; Assocs., P.A.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=387%20Fed.%20Appx.%20921\">\n    387 Fed.Appx. 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 924 (11th Cir. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Eleventh Circuit has found prejudice where a party litigates for some time before invoking its arbitration right, thereby\n   forcing the other party to incur substantial time and expense.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Morewitz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7418030\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/62/1356/#p1366\">\n    62 F.3d at 1366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding prejudice where the party asserting waiver demonstrated that its adversary allowed, at a minimum, five years to pass-the time between the liability action and the enforcement action-before invoking its right to arbitrate);\n   <em>\n    S &amp; H Contractors, Inc. v. A.J. Taft Coal Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1812429\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/906/1507/#p1514\">\n    906 F.2d 1507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1514 (11th Cir. 1990) (same after an eight-month delay);\n   <em>\n    Stone v. E.F. Hutton &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541156\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/898/1542/#p1543\">\n    898 F.2d 1542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1543 (11th Cir. 1990) (same after one year and eight month delay). There has been no such delay here. Plaintiff filed suit on March 12, 2018, and Defendant timely moved to compel arbitration April 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For these reasons, the Court finds that Defendant has not waived the arbitration provision. Because the Parties agree that the arbitration provision is otherwise enforceable and applicable to this dispute, the Motion must be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   2)\n   <em>\n    The Case Should Be Dismissed, Not Stayed\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   When a case is subject to binding arbitration, it is within the district court's discretion whether to stay or dismiss a case.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    N-Tron Corp. v. Rockwell Automation, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. CIV.A. 09-0733-WS-C,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%20653760\">\n    2010 WL 653760\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7 (S.D.
