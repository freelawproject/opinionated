Parties' Arguments\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. IMC Defendants' Arguments in Support of the Motion for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the motion for summary judgment, IMC Defendants first argue that undisputed facts show that TMJ Plaintiffs' claims for rescission under the Securities Act of 1933 are time-barred because they must have been brought within one year of the alleged sale of the security and were not; and no tolling or \"discovery\" rule applies to this period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   IMC Defendants point to the execution dates of the operating agreements and the deposition testimony of TMJ member Aaron Motwani to establish that TMJ Plaintiffs acquired the LLC membership interests more than one year before this suit was filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, IMC Defendants argue, no genuine fact dispute exists as to whether TMJ Plaintiffs' LLC membership interests were acquired more than a year before this action was filed, and IMC Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on the rescission claim brought under the Security Act of 1933.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   IMC Defendants next argue that undisputed facts establish that TMJ Plaintiffs acquired the LLC membership interests via a negotiated, one-on-one transaction in which TMJ Plaintiffs were represented by counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, pursuant to the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Marine Bank v. Weaver\n   </em>\n   , IMC Defendants argue the LLC membership interests are not securities under federal law; and because Louisiana state securities law mirrors federal law, the LLC Membership interests are not securities under state law either.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In addition, IMC Defendants argue that undisputed facts show that TMJ Plaintiffs could exercise significant control over the restaurants, precluding \"security\" status, insofar as TMJ Plaintiffs were not passive\n   investors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, IMC Defendants argue, there is no genuine fact dispute that the LLC membership interests acquired by TMJ Plaintiffs fall outside the definition of a \"security.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, IMC Defendants argue, they are entitled to summary judgment on TMJ Plaintiffs' claims for rescission under federal and state securities laws.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   For these same reasons, IMC Defendants assert that they are entitled to summary judgment on TMJ Plaintiffs' security fraud claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Furthermore, even if the LLC membership interests were a \"security,\" IMC Defendants argue, the \"private placement\" exemption would exempt them from registration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, IMC Defendants argue that in the Fifth Circuit, the lack of any widespread, public solicitation is \"essentially dispositive on its own.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   IMC Defendants additionally point to evidence that TMJ Plaintiffs could fend for themselves, as demonstrated by the manner of offering, eligibility of the purchasers, information, and resale restrictions; and therefore, pursuant to the Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    SEC v. Ralston Purina Corp.\n   </em>\n   , the investments are exempt from registration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, even assuming that the LLC membership interests were a \"security,\" IMC Defendants argue they are entitled to summary judgment on TMJ Plaintiffs' claims for rescission under federal and state securities laws.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Next, IMC Defendants argue that IMC Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on TMJ Plaintiffs' misrepresentation and breach of contract claims because forward-looking, oral predictions of the future are not actionable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   IMC Defendants point to evidence that the parties' agreements include both merger/integration clauses and no-oral-modification clauses, which IMC Defendants contend preclude reliance on any representations or promises that were not incorporated into the parties' written agreements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   In addition, IMC Defendants point to evidence that the agreements which TMJ Plaintiffs signed contemplate a risk of loss, as indicated in a section titled, \"\n   <strong>\n    ALLOCATION OF PROFITS\n    <em>\n     AND LOSSES\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, IMC Defendants argue, the alleged oral representations made by David Crabtree (IMC's CEO) were made in September 2016, a year after the agreements were signed in the summer/fall of 2015; thus, the alleged oral representations could not have been part of the parties' agreements or modifications to them, as the contracts provided that modifications must be made in writing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly IMC Defendants argue,\n   they are entitled to summary judgment on TMJ Plaintiffs' claims for intentional/negligent misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, and breach of contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Next, IMC Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on TMJ Plaintiffs' breach of fiduciary duty claim because the members of IMC MOA and IMC NOLA, which are manager-managed Florida LLCs, do not owe fiduciary duties to each other.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, Defendant IMC Holdings, as a member but not a manager of each, does not owe a fiduciary duty to TMJ Plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   IMC Defendants also argue that TMJ Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of showing that Mario Abal, who allegedly made the misrepresentations to TMJ Plaintiffs that supposedly induced TMJ Plaintiffs to enter into the Operating Agreements, made those representations in his capacity as an agent or employee of IMC Management.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, IMC Defendants contend, the evidence shows that Abal worked for the Defendant IMC Holdings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, IMC Defendants contend, both Defendant IMC Holdings and Defendant IMC Management are entitled to summary judgment on the breach of fiduciary duty claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   IMC Defendants next argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on TMJ Plaintiffs' LUTPA claim because: (1) such a claim does not apply to an alleged securities violation; (2) the claim is preempted; and (3) TMJ Plaintiffs lack standing to assert such a claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   IMC Defendants further note that the first two reasons are pure issues of law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   and only the third involves a question of fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   With respect to the third reason, IMC Defendants assert that a LUTPA claim is only available to direct consumers or business competitors, and TMJ Plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of showing that they fall into either of these two categories.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, IMC Defendants argue, they are entitled to summary judgment on the LUTPA claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, with respect to TMJ Plaintiffs' claim in the Amended Complaint for anticipatory breach of contract relating to the New Orleans Restaurant, IMC Defendants argue that TMJ Plaintiffs, not IMC Defendants, failed to perform their obligations pursuant to the New Orleans agreements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, IMC Defendants point to evidence that TMJ Plaintiffs was required to construct a \"shell\" for the New Orleans Restaurant and that TMJ Plaintiffs put development of the New Orleans Restaurant on hold \"many months ago.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, IMC Defendants assert, they are\n   entitled to summary judgment on TMJ Plaintiffs' claims regarding the New Orleans Restaurant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     B. TMJ Plaintiffs' Arguments in Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In opposition, TMJ Plaintiffs first argue that their demand for rescission is not time-barred because TMJ Plaintiffs did not learn of IMC Defendants' failure to register until long after the November 2015 amended agreement was executed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    63\n   </footnotemark>\n   TMJ Plaintiffs argue that the statute of limitations does not begin to run until a plaintiff discovers (or should have discovered by the exercise of reasonable diligence) the underlying violation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    64\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite due diligence, TMJ Plaintiffs contend, IMC Defendants' failure to register was not discovered until January 2017, when TMJ Plaintiffs received updated pro formas reflecting the actual operations from Fourth Quarter 2016; when TMJ Plaintiffs received daily sales reports in April 2017; and when TMJ Plaintiffs began investigating their claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, TMJ Plaintiffs argue, when they learned of IMC Defendants failure to comply with the applicable securities laws and failure to register is a fact issue not appropriate for resolution on a motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, TMJ Plaintiffs argue that IMC Defendants' motion with respect to TMJ Plaintiffs' demand for rescission must be denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Next, TMJ Plaintiffs argue that IMC Defendants' reliance on\n   <em>\n    Marine Bank\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that a negotiated, one-on-one transaction does not involve a \"security\" as defined by the Securities Act of 1933 is misplaced.\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to TMJ Plaintiffs,\n   <em>\n    Marine Bank\n   </em>\n   revolved around \"important differences between a certificate of deposit ... and other long-term debt obligations\" and resulted in the Supreme Court reversing the court below because of the \"unusual instruments\" involved in that particular case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, TMJ Plaintiffs assert, the Supreme Court did not hold that the instruments in\n   <em>\n    Marine Bank\n   </em>\n   were not securities due to the fact they were one-on-one agreements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n   As no such absolute rule exists, TMJ Plaintiffs contend IMC Defendants argument that the LLC membership interests are not securities because they were one-on-one agreements is incorrect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   TMJ Plaintiffs next argue that the LLC membership interests are securities inasmuch as they are \"investment contracts\" as set forth by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    SEC v.

Accordingly, the Court will not look beyond the four corners of those agreements to determine the contractual obligations of IMC Defendants for the purpose of deciding TMJ Plaintiffs' claim for breach of contract. However, TMJ Plaintiffs assert that IMC Defendants failed to perform the terms of the contract, and this is in dispute.

TMJ Plaintiffs argue that IMC Defendants acknowledge that under Florida law, a manager of a manager-managed LLC owes fiduciary duties to its members; and the Management Agreement, which is included and incorporated by the Operating Agreement, establishes that IMC Holdings is the Managing Member.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Under Louisiana choice of law rules, \"the law of the place where the corporation was incorporated governs disputes regarding the relationship between the officers, directors, and shareholders and the officers' and directors' fiduciary duties.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    208\n   </footnotemark>\n   As IMC MOA and IMC NOLA are Florida limited liability companies, the parties do not dispute that Florida law applies to the breach of fiduciary duty claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Under Florida law, \"[t]he elements of a claim for breach of fiduciary duty are: the existence of a fiduciary duty, and the breach of that duty such that it is the proximate cause of the plaintiff's damages.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   <footnotemark>\n    209\n   </footnotemark>\n   Chapter 605 of the Florida Revised Limited Liability Company Act provides that \"[e]ach manager of a manager-managed limited liability company and member of a member-managed limited liability company owes fiduciary duties of loyalty and care to the limited liability company and members of the limited liability company.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    210\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, \"[a] manager of a manager-managed limited liability company and a member of a member-managed limited liability company shall discharge their duties and obligations under this chapter or under the operating agreement and exercise any rights consistently with the obligation of good faith and fair dealing.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    211\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The parties do not dispute that IMC MOA is a manager-managed Florida LLC.

TMJ Plaintiffs argue that the Management Agreement, which is included and incorporated by the Operating Agreement, establishes that \"IMC Holdings is the Managing Member.\" TMJ Plaintiffs point to Section 4.1.1 of the Revised MOA Business Operating Agreement, which provides that IMC Holdings shall be the \"initial manager\" of IMC MOA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    214\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, it appears that IMC Holdings owed a fiduciary duty to IMC MOA as the \"initial manager\" of IMC MOA. Moreover, to the extent a disputed issue of fact exists as to whether Mario Abal was acting as an agent of IMC Management when the alleged misrepresentations were made constituting an alleged breach of IMC Management's fiduciary duties to IMC MOA and their respective members, summary judgment is not appropriate.

Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act Claim\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   IMC Defendants argue,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the LUTPA claim must be dismissed because it was not timely filed. In response, TMJ Plaintiffs assert that the LUTPA claims are not preempted because TMJ Plaintiffs only later discovered the underlying unfair trade practices and could not file suit until then.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act is codified at Louisiana Revised Statute \u00a7 51:1409, which provides, in pertinent part: \"Any person who suffers any ascertainable loss of money or movable property, corporeal or incorporeal, as a result of the use or employment by another person of an unfair or deceptive method, act, or practice declared unlawful by Section 51:1405, may bring an action individually but not in a representative capacity to recover actual damages.\" Section 51:1409(E) provides that \"[t]he action provided by this section shall be prescribed by one year running from the time of the transaction or act which gave rise to this right of action.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    215\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Zeigler v. Housing Authority of New Orleans\n   </em>\n   , the Louisiana Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal stated that an act gives rise to a right of action under Section 1409 when the plaintiff \"suffer[s] any ascertainable loss of money or moveable property.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    216\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court in\n   <em>\n    Zeigler\n   </em>\n   further stated, \"The date of the alleged wrongful act begins the running of the prescription, even if the plaintiff was unaware of the act.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    217\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Louisiana Second Circuit Court of Appeal has also recognized that Section 51:1409(E)\"has been interpreted as creating a peremptive, rather than a prescriptive period,\" and therefore \"cannot be interrupted or suspended.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    218\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   IMC Defendants argue that more than one year has passed between the date of the alleged wrongful act and the date TMJ Plaintiffs filed this action, and therefore, the LUTPA claims are time-barred. TMJ Plaintiffs argue that TMJ Plaintiffs \"only later\" discovered the underlying unfair trade practices and could not file suit until then. However, TMJ Plaintiffs cite no authority for the assertion that the limitations period for a LUTPA claim is subject to a discovery rule. Moreover, under Louisiana law, the date of the alleged wrongful act begins the running of the prescription, even if TMJ Plaintiffs were unaware of the act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    219\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   In the Amended Complaint, TMJ Plaintiffs assert that IMC Defendants' actions in providing false and misleading information to TMJ Plaintiffs constitute unfair and/or deceptive acts giving rise to their LUTPA claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    220\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, TMJ Plaintiffs do not point to any alleged action whereby IMC Defendants provided false and misleading information within one year of May 3, 2017, the date this action was filed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    221\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, because there is no disputed issue of material fact, the Court finds that IMC Defendants' are entitled to judgment as a matter of law that the LUTPA claim is perempted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     G. Claim for Anticipatory Breach of Contract\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   IMC Defendants argue that TMJ Plaintiffs are not entitled to declaratory judgment for anticipatory breach because there is no genuine fact in dispute that (1) it was TMJ Plaintiffs (not IMC Defendants) that were responsible for delivering a built-out premises for such a restaurant, and (2) it was TMJ Plaintiffs that decided to stop development of the New Orleans Restaurant. TMJ Plaintiffs argue that summary judgment on this claim should be denied because if and when either party manifested an unwillingness to perform their obligations, and whether such a party was justified based on the factual circumstances are all material facts which the Parties genuinely dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Latter &amp; Blum, Inc. v. Ditta\n   </em>\n   , the Louisiana Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal stated, \"Louisiana courts have recognized the doctrine of anticipatory breach of contract.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    222\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court further recognized\n   that \"[t]he doctrine of anticipatory breach of contract applies when an obligor announces he will not perform an obligation which is due sometime in the future.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    223\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Under those circumstances, the obligee need not wait until the obligor fails to perform for the contract to be considered in breach.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    224\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   IMC Defendants contend that there is no material fact in dispute that TMJ Plaintiffs, not IMC Defendants, breached their obligations under the New Orleans Restaurant agreements by failing to deliver a built-out premises for the restaurant, and stopping development of the restaurant. In response, TMJ Plaintiffs argue that if and when either party manifested an unwillingness to perform their obligations, and whether such a party was justified based on the factual circumstances are all material facts in dispute. As support, TMJ Plaintiffs cite only the deposition of David Crabtree, IMC's CEO, who, when asked whether he had personally taken any action to further develop the New Orleans Restaurant, stated that it was \"not in [his] control.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    225\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   To the extent that judgment on this claim requires a determination of fact as to whether IMC Defendants owed TMJ Plaintiffs an obligation and announced that they would not perform the obligation, TMJ Plaintiffs have put forth some evidence that IMC Defendants' indicated that they would not perform the obligation. Accordingly, because genuine issues of material fact are in dispute, the Court will deny IMC Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     V. Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court grants IMC Defendants' motion to the extent it seeks summary judgment on TMJ Plaintiffs' claims for rescission under the Securities Act of 1933 and TMJ Plaintiffs' LUTPA claim, as the Court finds no genuine dispute of material fact to preclude summary judgment as to these claims. However, because material facts are in dispute summary judgment is not appropriate as to all other claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Accordingly,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS HEREBY ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that IMC Defendants' motion for summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   to the extent it seeks summary judgment on TMJ Plaintiffs' claims for rescission pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 and TMJ Plaintiffs' LUTPA Claim. IMC Defendants' motion for summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   in all other respects.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    Rec.
