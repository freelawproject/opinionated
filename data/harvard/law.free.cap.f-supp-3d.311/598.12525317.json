Song, and R. Julian Ventura (collectively, the \"Plaintiffs\") are judgment creditors from a previously adjudicated Fair Labor Standards Act litigation,\n   <em>\n    Kim v. Kum Gang, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 12 Civ. 6344 (MHD) (S.D.N.Y.) (the \"FLSA Action\"). Plaintiffs have alleged that one of the FLSA Action judgment debtors, Defendant Ji Sung Yoo (\"Ji Sung\"), violated fraudulent conveyance sections of the New York Debtor and Creditor Laws (\"DCL\") when he transferred real property interests to members of his family, Defendants Sandra Yoo (\"Sandra\"), Samuel Yoo (\"Samuel\") and Carolyn Yoo (\"Carolyn\") (collectively, the \"Yoos\" or the \"Defendants\") in an attempt to avoid paying debts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A bench trial in this action was held before the Court between January 22 and January 30, 2018. Based upon the prior proceedings, the findings of fact, and conclusions of law set forth below, Plaintiffs\n   have proven that each property interest Ji Sung transferred was fraudulent conveyed and entitled to be set aside. Plaintiffs are further entitled to a money judgment to satisfy mortgages taken out on two of the properties from the transferees of those property, in addition to certain attorneys' fees as against Ji Sung and Sandra.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Prior Proceedings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 21, 2015, Plaintiffs filed their complaint. Dkt. No. 1. Plaintiffs' complaint alleged that Ji Sung fraudulently conveyed three pieces of property-a home in Little Neck, New York (the \"Home\"), a condominium on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, New York (the \"Condo\"), and a commercial property in the Sheepshead Bay neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York (the \"Brooklyn Property\")-to Sandra, Samuel, and Carolyn.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 35-45. Invoking the Court's ancillary enforcement jurisdiction to secure payment on a judgment award of $2,672,657.30 entered against Ji Sung and for Plaintiffs in the FLSA Action, Plaintiffs sought to return the alleged fraudulently conveyed property interests to Ji Sung's estate and require payment for mortgages taken out on the Home and Brooklyn Properties to return those properties to their pre-conveyance value. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 7, 38, 42, 45. Plaintiffs also sought attorneys' fees and costs. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 38, 42, 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 15, 2015, Defendants moved to dismiss Plaintiffs' Complaint, Dkt. Nos. 28, 35, which was denied on January 19, 2016, Dkt. No. 57. On June 20, 2017, Defendants moved for summary judgment, Dkt. No. 85, which was denied on September 29, 2017,\n   <em>\n    Kim v.

Sept. 29, 2017) (\" Summary Judgment Opinion\"). During motion practice on Defendants' summary judgment motion, Plaintiffs stated they no longer intended to pursue Section 276 intentional fraud claims against Carolyn or Samuel. Dkt. Nos. 95, at 20 n.22; 107, at 9 n.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Evidence was presented between January 22 and January 30, 2018. Final arguments were held on March 28, 2018, at which point the matter was marked fully submitted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Findings of Fact\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Three witnesses testified at trial: Ji Sung, Sandra, and Kang Youl Lee (\"Lee\"), the Yoos' financial accountant. Tr. 24:25-7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Their testimony is found generally to be self-serving and unreliable. In particular, Sandra and Lee's inconsistent and often unsupported accounts offer limited corroboration to Ji Sung's version of events, which is described in greater detail following a brief reflection of Sandra and Lee's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Sandra's testimony seismically shifted over the course of the litigation and appeared crafted after her deposition to support Defendants' trial posture. This was evident during her testimony regarding the many checks written by and to the Yoos that she claimed supported fair consideration for the disputed property conveyances.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   Tr. 228:22-23 (stating at trial that she wrote a check to pay the Kum Gang rent),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Tr. 312:1-19 (stating at trial that she had made a copy of a check before giving it to Kum Gang),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Tr. 229:8-230:17 (stating at trial that she wrote a check to Kum Kang),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Tr. 245:24-246:10 (stating at trial that many of the checks given to Ji Sung's restaurants were her friends who wrote out checks at her request),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Tr. 283:8-284:8 (stating at her deposition that the check described at Tr. 228:22-23 was given to her by an acquaintance and not at her request),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Tr. 314:21-22 (stating at her deposition that the check described at Tr. 312:1-19 was obtained from Kum Gang),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Tr. 288:22-289:15 (stating at her deposition that the check described at Tr. 229:8-230:17 was given to her by her brother-in-law),\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   Tr. 319:10-16, 324:19-21, 327:4-6, 328:3-9, 329:9-13, 330:12-16 (stating at trial that the checks described at Tr. 245:24-246:10 in general were not friends, but rather employees, and that her brother-in-law had done the soliciting). Of particular note, Sandra had no believable explanation for how checks she stated had come only from her account had been altered to cover-up that the checks had actually come from her joint account with Ji Sung.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 230:18-232:14, 292:10-11, 293:19-25; Defs.' Ex. B, at 7, 8; Pls.' Exs. 70-71. Sandra's responses to straight-forward questions about whether money went from Kum Gang to her restaurant, Gum Gang, when other uncontroverted evidence demonstrated that fact, evinced an intention to avoid contrary facts for the sake of Ji Sung's narrative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 306:13-16, 357:8-11; Pls.' Exs. 50-55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Lee's testimony was similarly wavering and unreliable. Like Sandra, Lee's testimony as to where money from Ji Sung's restaurants came from, went to, and for what purposes shifted over the course of trial. Lee sometimes stated that certain monies went to Sandra, only to later refuse to state with the same confidence that he knew anything about the same checks.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Tr. 33:5-11, 34:2-10 (stating that certain ledger entries for Ji Sung's restaurants demonstrated checks that went to Sandra),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Tr. 34:23-24, 35:11-14 (stating there was no way to know if certain check payments went to Sandra). Lee's testimony was equivocal as to why certain ledger entries for Ji Sung's restaurants reflected payment to Sandra as payroll or as repayment for loans Sandra made.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Tr. 71:2-25 (stating that the checks were for payroll),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Tr. 82:19-83:3 (stating that the checks were for loan repayment, not payroll). The manner in which Lee described the accounting of Ji Sung's restaurants to which he testified at trial indicated that the records were made one way and then, later, changed based on ex post direction from Ji Sung and Sandra. Tr. 50:15-53:5, 55:8-63:16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In addition to the aforementioned witness testimony, the parties submitted documentary evidence at trial, including New York State Department of Labor (the \"DOL\") records, checks written by and given to the Yoos, the facts subject to preclusive effect based on prior findings in the FLSA Action\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   , and prior sworn\n   declarations and affidavits submitted over the course of this proceeding. Having considered them all, this evidence established the following facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Ji Sung and Sandra, husband and wife, have four children: Carolyn, Samuel, Sue, and June. Tr. 111:9-11, 181:19-182:23. Sandra is principally at home and cares for June, who is disabled and requires twenty-four hour care. Tr. 111:20-25; 182:12-19. The Yoos, in differing ownership arrangements, own three properties: the Home, located at 52-32 Leaf Place, Little Neck, New York, Tr. 126:6-7; the Condo, located at 325 Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, New York, Tr. 119:22-25; and the Brooklyn Property, located on Avenue U, Brooklyn, New York, Tr. 127:10-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   For the past twenty-six years, Ji Sung has owned two Korean restaurants in New York City: Kum Gang, Inc. (\"Kum Gang\"), in Flushing, Queens, and Kum Kang, Inc. (\"Kum Kang\"), in Midtown Manhattan, and during the time period at issue, he was the sole owner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tr. 112:1-12, 112:24-113:20, 124:17-21, 138:19-20; Pls.' Exs. 1 (\"FLSA Op.\"), at 4, 28-31. As an owner and manager, Ji Sung \"maintain[ed] close control over their operations,\" FLSA Op., at 4, and the two restaurants operated with similar personnel and management practices and policies, Tr. 139:2-8. Ji Sung purchased the restaurants, in part, by using a $1 million inheritance the family received from Sandra's parents at the time of Ji Sung and Sandra's wedding. Tr. 124:22-125:2, 358:19-359:3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The nature of the inheritance was contested at trial. Both Ji Sung and Sandra testified that Sandra exclusively inherited the $1 million, who in turn loaned it to Ji Sung to open his businesses. Tr. 125:3-5; 181:3-10, 187:18-20; 359:14-360:15. The contention that Ji Sung and Sandra's marriage had a transactional component to it is belied by other evidence in the record, however. Most importantly, Sandra sworn previously that the $1 million was given by her family specifically to Ji Sung for his business endeavors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Affidavit of Sandra Yoo dated June 17, 2017 (\"Sandra Aff.\") \u00b6 2, Dkt. No. 85, Ex. E. Other evidence showed that Ji Sung and Sandra only split their finances following Ji Sung's business problems, Tr. 362:16-21, and other shared joint bank accounts, Tr. 296:5-8, 364:12-365:10, 369:5-370:10. This evidence establishes that the two shared undifferentiated finances. Sandra described her relationship with her husband as \"not a business relationship between husband and wife.\" Tr. 361:2. The wedding inheritance money literally could have been given to Sandra,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 359:24-360:1, but the evidence established that the money was given to the Yoos as a couple, and that it was spent in large part on the restaurants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In January 2010, the DOL began investigating Kum Kang (the \"2010 KK Investigation\"). Pls.' Ex. 6A. The investigation reviewed Kum Kang's payroll records\n   from July 1, 2005, through February 11, 2010.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 18. Ji Sung averred at trial that he was unaware of this investigation, Tr. 176:8-9, but that claim is countervailed by other evidence. Ji Sung was aware at the time that he was in violation of applicable labor laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FLSA Op. 83-85 &amp; n.54 (describing the actions taken by Ji Sung and other FLSA Action defendants to conceal their unlawful employment practices and concluding that the \"defendants' violation of the applicable [labor] laws was certainly willful\"). Ji Sung was also aware of the DOL's investigation, as evidenced by his involvement in early 2010 with manufacturing false time cards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FLSA Op. 50, 52-53, 60, 74, 83 &amp; n.36 (describing the defendants' creation of false time cards during the 2010 KK Investigation in the home of a relative of Ji Sung's while Ji Sung hid the real time cards in his home garage).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This was not Ji Sung's first encounter with DOL investigations. In 2007, following an investigation begun in January 2005, the DOL had fined Ji Sung for failing to pay his employees properly or to maintain proper payroll records. FLSA Op. at 83 n.54; Tr. 115:11-14. The DOL initially fined Ji Sung around $168,000 in actual damages, which with penalties could have amounted to over $1 million, but ultimately settled with him for $137,000 in damages. Tr. 115:15-116:18, 172:16-173:7; FLSA Op. at 83 n.54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On March 10, 2010, Ji Sung, who had a half interest in the Condo shared with Carolyn, conveyed one-third of that interest to Sandra. Pls.' Ex. 8; Tr. 195:10-13. The conveyance deed for the Condo stated there was consideration of ten dollars but also that the full sale price was for zero dollars. Pls.' Ex. 8, at 3, 9. The Condo had been appraised at $1.275 million on February 2, 2010. Ex. 9, at 4. At this time, the Condo's mortgage was refinanced, amounting to $729,750, for which Ji Sung maintained joint and several liability. Pls.' Ex. 10, at 3-5 (stating that if multiple individuals signed the agreement as \"Borrower\" that each is \"fully and personally obligated to keep all of Borrower's promises\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. 120:1-121:7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In November 2010, the DOL commenced a second investigation into Ji Sung's restaurants, this time Kum Gang (the \"2010 KG Investigation\"). Pls.' Ex. 6B. The investigation reviewed Kum Gang's payroll records from February 19, 2009, through November 21, 2010.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , at 2. Ji Sung was aware of this investigation and similarly aware that the restaurant was engaged in labor law violations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 139:2-6 176:2-19; Pls.' Ex. 6B, at 2; FLSA Op., at 85.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Records demonstrated that Ji Sung's restaurants were not financially lucrative in 2010. That year, Kum Kang had a total income of $1,147,975, but the restaurant's operating expenses and other deductions reduced its taxable income to a loss of $208,098.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pls.' Ex. 31. Similarly, while Kum Gang had a total income of $2,324,559, the restaurant's taxable income was $101,772. Pls.' Ex. 28.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2010, Kum Gang had book value assets amounting to $800,000 and liabilities of $287,310, while Kum Kang had book value assets amounting to $725,128 and liabilities of $191,178. See Pls.' Exs. 28, at Sch. L, 31, at Sch. L.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On February 10, 2011, the DOL wrote Ji Sung to inform him that, as a result of the 2010 KK Investigation, he owed underpayments and damages amounting to $1,176,208.30. Defs.' Ex. J, at 659. Over the course of the month, Kum Kang employees and the DOL adjusted the underpayment computations following additional provided documentation, ultimately reducing the owed total to $694,966.41 on March 11, 2011; at that time, the DOL stated that revised restitution amount would be final, with no further negotiations, subject to the maximum penalties permitted, and that three additional cited violations would be added.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Ex. J, at 66-68 (detailing the DOL investigator's final report); Tr. 118:5-12 (explaining that the DOL originally tried to fine Ji Sung \"over $2 million,\" but that the negotiation ended \"around $600,000\"). On March 16, 2011, Ji Sung, through his and Kum Kang's counsel, informed the DOL that he could not pay the assessed restitution amount, was uninterested in discussing a payment plan, and continued to believe the assessed amount was incorrect. Defs.' Ex. J, at 64, 68;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. 119:1-9, 128:23-129:3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On April 22, 2011, as a result of failing to pay the 2010 KK Investigation's assessed restitution, the DOL issued Ji Sung an Order to Comply to pay damages totaling $1,950,992.84 (the \"2010 Order\"). Pls.' Ex. 6A, at 2. Specifically, the DOL determined that Ji Sung owned: $555,973.03 in owned underpayments; $144,080.37 in interest (assessed at 16%)\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; $138,993.38 in liquidated damages (25% of wage damages)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   ; and $1,111,946.06 in civil penalties (200% of wage damages)\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That same day, the DOL issued a second Order to Comply against Ji Sung totaling $6,000 in civil penalties for additional labor law violations. Defs.' Ex. J, at 60.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On June 10, 2011, Ji Sung appealed the 2010 Order to the New York State Industrial Board of Appeals (the \"IBA\"). Defs.' Ex. J, at 98-99. In his Petition for Review, Ji Sung stated that the Order was unreasonable because it was \"based on erroneous figures provided by an accountant who has since recanted his submissions ... [s]ince the figures upon which the Order was based are erroneous[,] that makes the findings ... erroneous as well.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 98. Ji Sung calculated that he owed \"probably about 10% of what was assessed.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On November 16, 2011, Ji Sung made two conveyances, both to Sandra and Samuel. First, Ji Sung, who jointly owned the Home with Sandra, conveyed his half interest\n   in the Home to Sandra and Samuel. Pls.' Ex. 11; Tr. 126:21-25. The conveyance deed for the Home stated there was consideration of ten dollars but also that the full sale price was for zero dollars. Pls.' Ex. 11, at 4, 8. The Home was appraised at $770,000 on December 21, 2011. Ex. 9, at 2. Second, Ji Sung conveyed his full interest in the Brooklyn Property, also to Sandra and Samuel. Pls.' Ex. 15; Tr. 127:13-17. The conveyance deed for the Brooklyn Property stated there was consideration of ten dollars but also that the full sale price was for zero dollars. Pls.' Ex. 15, at 4, 8. The Brooklyn Property was appraised at $1.1 million on July 27, 2012. Pls.' Ex. 16, at 6. As part of his 2011 federal gift tax report, Ji Sung listed the conveyances of the Home and Brooklyn Property. Pls.' Ex. 36. At the time of Home and Brooklyn Property conveyances, Sandra was aware that Ji Sung had a \"desperate need of money ... because of the restaurant.\" Tr. 207:11-19. Ji Sung continued to reside in the Home following the transfer of his interest.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 199:21-201:10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Ji Sung's restaurants were again not lucrative in 2011. That year, Kum Kang had a total income of $1,519,696, but the operating expenses and other deductions reduced the restaurant's taxable income to $0. Pls.' Ex. 32. Similarly, Kum Gang had a total income of $2,159,818, but the restaurant's taxable income was $22,616. Pls.' Ex. 29. The restaurants' tax returns also show that Kum Gang had book value assets amounting to $1,053,782 and liabilities of $526,023, while Kum Kang had book value assets amounting to $742,990 and liabilities of $165,111.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' Exs. 29, at Sch. L, 32, at Sch. L.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A part of Defendants' position has been that Ji Sung conveyed each of the properties for the purpose of mortgaging or refinancing the mortgages of the properties under Sandra's name; their alleged theory is that Sandra possessed better credit, and that the money received from those mortgages were given to Ji Sung, used by his restaurants, and counted as consideration for the property conveyances.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 120:11-121:4, 127:18-128:2, 143:22-24, 148:23-148:17. Ji Sung and Sandra both claimed that Sandra controlled the mortgage money, which was given to Ji Sung upon need and request.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Tr. 144:16-20, 150:6-152:5.

By contrast, the 2010 KK Investigation was the second DOL investigation into Ji Sung's restaurants and, therefore, had statutory penalties that were likely to be assessed. Moreover, aside from Ji Sung's unsupported view, Defendants have put forward no evidence to show why Ji Sung was likely to win in any appellate action brought against the DOL for any assessed liability.

As described above, the Condo was not conveyed for fair consideration. Moreover, Plaintiffs have established that Ji Sung was aware of his unpaid wage violations, for which he believed he would be liable for some amount of liabilities. However, the amount of the 2010 KK Investigation, by itself, is just as likely to have been able to be talked down below the value of Ji Sung's assets as not, given how close the two values were to one another. Furthermore, while the debt as to Ji Sung's workers' unpaid wages had accrued, the record established does not show sufficient reason for Ji Sung himself to believe that he would be liable either for an additional DOL investigations or a FLSA law lawsuit and any consequent penalties or judgment. As such, the conveyance of the Condo has not been established as fraudulent under Section 275.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Khan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%2010474969\">\n    2014 WL 10474969\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *19 (finding that, while evidence adduced demonstrated that the debtor's insolvency, it did not show the \"subjective belief that she would incur debts beyond her ability to pay\" because such evidence was \"consistent with the Debtor's holding the subjective belief that she would be unable to pay her debts as they came due\" and \"also consistent with the Debtor holding the view that she would be able to pay her debts in small increments\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   For similar reasons, Plaintiffs have not established that the Condo conveyance was intentionally fraudulent and in violation of DCL Section 276.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   As described above, under Section DCL 276, \"[w]here actual intent to defraud creditors is proven, the conveyance will be set aside regardless of the adequacy of consideration given.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Sharp Int'l Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9013936,9019452\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/403/43/\">\n    403 F.3d at 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Looking to the badges of fraud implicated by the Condo's conveyance, certain are clearly established: the conveyance was between family members; there was a lack of fair consideration; and Ji Sung was insolvent at the time.

Moreover, while the Condo conveyance was made shortly after the commencement of the DOL's investigation into Kum Kang, the transfer was made not made in secret and no evidence adduced indicated that the transfer was performed in a hasty or otherwise unusual way. Taken together, while not without suspicion, the evidence does not establish by the higher standard of clear and convincing evidence that the conveyance was made with fraudulent intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Accordingly, the conveyance of the Condo must be set aside as a violation of DCL Section 273.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grace v.

Ex. 36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In the absence of fair consideration, Defendants have failed to show solvency following the conveyances. Aside from approximately $22,000 in profits from his restaurants, Defendants did not establish that Ji Sung had acquired any new salable assets between the Condo and the Home and Brooklyn Property transfers. Rather, following the conveyances, his assets decreased substantially, as without the Home or the Brooklyn Property, Ji Sung only still had one-third of the value of the Condo, amounting to $181,750. By contrast, his liabilities had increased, and now included the fully assessed amount from the 2010 KK Investigation, approximately $1,956,992, the amount assessed from the 2010 KG Investigation, which Ji Sung was aware had started a year ago and which in total assessed approximately $649,591, and the still-present and accrued liability from the FLSA Action, amounting to $1,674,977. For the same reasons described above, these were existing debts for which Ji Sung had probable liability amounting to approximately $4.28 million. As Ji Sung's liabilities exceeded his established salable assets following these conveyances, each satisfies the requirements of DCL Section 273.\n   <em>\n    Grace\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6045631\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/443/180/#p189\">\n    443 F.3d at 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Plaintiffs' DCL Section 275 claims as to the Home and Brooklyn Property have also been met. Unlike the Condo conveyance, the evidence established that by the time Ji Sung transferred interest in the Home and Brooklyn Properties, he knew of the over $1.95 million in assessed penalties by the DOL from the 2010 KK Investigation, which he had no reason to believe would be reduced on appeal. He also knew about the 2010 KG Investigation, from which new liability was likely to be assessed. It cannot be said that in November 2011 Ji Sung believed he would have debt incurred from the FLSA Action. But even just accounting for the two DOL investigations, they alone establish that Ji Sung recognized that he would incur debts amounting to somewhere around or above $2 million. Ji Sung also knew that, following the conveyances, his depleted real estate assets amounted to approximately $181,750 and the value of the restaurants, even viewed most charitably and somewhat unrealistically based on the shareholders equity reflected in 2011 tax returns, amounted to approximately $1.1 million-in total, below what his likely debts would be. Indeed, it is a telling glimpse into Ji Sung's perception of his finances that he transferred, in their entirety, his interests\n   in both properties at the same time, shortly after appealing the hefty penalties assessed by the DOL from the 2010 KK Investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   All told, it has been shown by a preponderance that Ji Sung was aware he would not be able to pay his future debts as a result of the conveyances.

In the context of the Home and Brooklyn Property conveyances, additional badges support a finding of intentional fraud: that the conveyances were made on the same day, in the wake of a sizable DOL penalty assessment and the instigation of a second DOL investigation into Ji Sung's other restaurant; that Sandra was aware of Ji Sung's desperate need for money and wanted to get his name off of family assets; and that Ji Sung continued to reside at the Home in the same fashion following the transfer as before. While one badge points in the opposite direction-the conveyances were not made in secret-taken together, these multiple badges of indicia persuade that by the end of 2011, Ji Sung had determined he was going to owe more money than he had; by off-loading his real estate interests, Ji Sung was attempting to \"hinder, delay, or defraud\" creditors he believed would be knocking at his door in the future.
