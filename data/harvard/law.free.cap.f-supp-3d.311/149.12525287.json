Plaintiff points to an excerpt from the November 2015 Letter from ICE to U.S. Representative Torres, which Plaintiff claims Defendants possessed before publishing the Article, which reads: \"ICE has no legal authority to investigate or prosecute bail bond companies or other related service providers regarding allegations of inappropriate conduct between two private parties such as an indemnitor and bond company.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 10;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 2, 7-8. According to Plaintiff, the November 2015 Letter alone establishes that Plaintiff \"was not under investigation in 2013, as falsely represented by BuzzFeed.\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In its degree of precision, Plaintiff's Amended Complaint is much like the complaint the D.C. Circuit considered in\n   <em>\n    Trudeau\n   </em>\n   . There, the court observed that \"Trudeau's complaint makes quite clear which text he regards as false (specified sentences in the press release), and why he regards it as false (because of specified inconsistencies with the [settlement agreement] ).\"\n   <em>\n    Trudeau\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3457912,3352451\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/456/178/\">\n    456 F.3d at 193\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The same is true here. Plaintiff's Amended Complaint \"makes quite clear which text [it] regards as false\" (the Article's allegation that ICE investigated Plaintiff in 2013 for allegedly targeting immigrant detainees and fraudulently charging them a fee for services), \"and why [it] regards [that text] as false\" (because of its inconsistency with the specified quote from the November 2015 Letter). Thus, much as the Circuit did in\n   <em>\n    Trudeau\n   </em>\n   , the court evaluates whether Plaintiff's specific theory of defamation is plausible in light of the complaint's allegations and, importantly, the Article itself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The court finds that it is not. To begin, contrary to what Plaintiff claims, there is\n   no material inconsistency between the alleged defamatory statement contained in the Article and the above-quoted excerpt from the November 2015 Letter. In the November 2015 Letter, ICE represented that it lacked the \"legal authority to investigate\" businesses like Plaintiff \"regarding allegations of inappropriate conduct between\n   <em>\n    two private parties\n   </em>\n   such as an indemnitor and bond company.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 10 (emphasis added). Thus, the focus of the quoted portion of the November 2015 Letter pertains to ICE's absence of authority to investigate conduct between two\n   <em>\n    private\n   </em>\n   parties involved in the bail bonding business. That quote says nothing, however, about whether ICE had the power in 2013 to investigate conduct between a private bail-bonds indemnitor like Plaintiff, and\n   <em>\n    detained immigrants\n   </em>\n   under ICE custody. The Article, at least implicitly, asserts that ICE did have such power, but the quoted portion of the November 2015 Letter does not say otherwise. All it does is speak to ICE's investigatory authority with respect to conduct between private parties-not a private party's acts directed at ICE detainees. Thus, the specific theory of falsity that Plaintiff advances is not supported by the factual allegations that it makes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   And there is more. The Article contains hyperlinks to three records, each of which is meant to be respective evidence of the claims that, in 2013, Plaintiff's business practices were the subject of investigation by \"the commonwealth attorney for the State of Virginia,\" \"the Fairfax City Police Department,\" and \"ICE's Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) unit.\" Article at 5. Plaintiff challenges the authenticity of the document hyperlinked as evidence that ICE investigated Plaintiff in 2013 but closed the investigation for lack of evidence. The court therefore does not consider that record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523999\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/296/98/#p105\">\n    296 F.Supp.3d at 104-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204990519\">\n    2017 WL 4990519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (explaining that a court may consider a document to be incorporated in the complaint by reference if, among other things, its authenticity is not disputed). But Plaintiff does not contest the authenticity of the other two hyperlinked records, which concern purported investigations by \"the commonwealth attorney for the State of Virginia\" and \"the Fairfax City Police Department,\" and both of which appear in the very same sentence in the Article as the challenged statement concerning the ICE investigation. Article at 5. These records appear to come from ICE's files circa 2013. One record, referencing the date \"10/21/2013,\" bears an \"ICE\" Bates stamp number and exemption markings (e.g., \"(b)(6), (b)(7)(C)\") consistent with withholdings under the Freedom of Information Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204990519\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (linking to \"commonwealth attorney\" record). The other record, referencing the date \"10/30/2013,\" likewise contains redactions consistent with FOIA withholdings.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%204990519\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (linking to \"Fairfax City Police Department\" record). The court, at this stage, need not conclusively determine that these hyperlinked records in fact come from ICE's files circa 2013. It is sufficient at this juncture to observe that the records-again, whose authenticity Plaintiff does not dispute-make less plausible Plaintiff's allegation that ICE did not conduct at least\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   kind of an investigation into Plaintiff's business practices in 2013, even if it did no more than gather investigative records from local law enforcement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff's failure to attach the November 2015 Letter to the Amended Complaint, or at least further quote from it, leaves the factual predicate for Plaintiff's defamation claim wanting here.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Alston v.

Torres to ICE, which lists a series of questions for the agency concerning \"possible exploitation\" of immigrant detainees by Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Article at 5;\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272311\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/208/293/#p298\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (linking to \"letter\").

It may be. If so, the November 2015 Letter presumably would shed substantial light on whether ICE in fact investigated Plaintiff in 2013. Plaintiff's failure to attach such a critical record to its Amended Complaint, when combined with the deficiencies in his pleading discussed above, therefore leaves further questions about the plausibility of Plaintiff's defamation claim. For these reasons, the court finds the Amended Complaint fails to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Liberty Lobby, Inc. v.

The two motion-to-dismiss standards are fundamentally at odds. First, under the D.C.

Such burden-shifting at the motion to dismiss is anathema to the Rule 12(b)(6) standard, which places the burden squarely on the defendant to justify dismissal.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    3M Co. v.
