Plaintiff, by counsel, requests further relief in the form of pre-judgment interest, in addition to Plaintiff's Motion for Attorneys' Fees and Costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; ECF No. 70. Both of these Motions stem from successfully suing the Isle of Wight County (\"Defendant\") for failing to reinstate Plaintiff in violation of the Family Medical Leave Act (\"FMLA\"). Plaintiff was employed by Defendant and was not reinstated to her position after her FMLA leave ended. These matters have been fully briefed and are ripe for disposition. A hearing will not aid judicial determination. For the reasons set forth herein, Plaintiff's Motion for Further Relief is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   in part and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   in part and Plaintiff's Motion for Attorneys' Fees is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   in part and\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

On October 28, 2015,\n   Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint alleging that Defendant had engaged in (1) retaliation in violation of the FMLA and (2) failure to reinstate in violation of the FMLA. ECF No. 16. On January 24, 2017, after full briefing by the parties, the Court granted in part and denied in part Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment. ECF No. 48. The Court dismissed Count I of the Amended Complaint, leaving Count II as the only remaining claim of the Amended Complaint.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court held a bench trial on March 7, 2017. ECF No. 59. On August 10, 2017, the Court issued its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, as required by Rule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. ECF No. 68. The Court found Defendant liable for violating the FMLA and entered judgement for Plaintiff, in the amount of $747,320.66.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff filed a Motion for Attorneys' Fees on August 24, 2017, and a Motion for Further Relief on August 28, 2017. ECF Nos. 70-71, 72-73. On September 7, 2017, Defendant filed a Response to both Motions. ECF Nos. 74, 80. Plaintiff filed a Reply to the Motion for Attorneys' Fees on September 11, 2017. ECF No. 79. Plaintiff did not file a Reply on the Motion for Further Relief. On September 7, 2017, Defendant appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (\"the Fourth Circuit\"), but Defendant filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the appeal on January 8, 2018. ECF Nos. 77, 85-86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff requests a total of $136,646.33 in attorneys' fees and costs together. ECF No. 70;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 79 at 7. Specifically, Plaintiff requests $129,929.65 in attorneys' fees at rates ranging from $200 and $385 per hour for 431.60 hours of work. ECF No. 70;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 79 at 4-5. Plaintiff also requests $6,716.68 in costs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Lastly, Plaintiff requests a total of $8,507.00 in pre-judgment interest. ECF Nos. 72-73.

The average prevailing Prime Rate is 3.5% based on the time frame in question-August 2014, the date of termination, to August 2017, the date of the entry of judgment. On August 10, 2017, the Court entered a judgment of $747,320.66 in favor of Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Therefore, the Court calculates that a pre-judgment interest award of $81,247.11\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

However, the Court also addresses whether Plaintiff is entitled to further relief, in the form of post-judgment interest fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Under the post-judgment statute, Section 1961 provides that \"[s]uch interest shall be calculated from the date of the entry of the judgment, at a rate equal to the weekly average 1-year constant maturity Treasury yield, as published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, for the calendar week preceding the date of the judgment.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201961\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As previously mentioned, the Court entered a judgment of $747,320.66 in favor of Plaintiff, and the Court calculated a pre-judgment interest fee of $81,247.11. Despite post-trial motions and Defendant's appeal, which was voluntarily dismissed, the calculation of the post-judgment interest fee award runs from the date of the entry of judgment on August 10, 2017.

Plaintiff contends that the case itself was not complex; however, Plaintiff \"engaged in extensive discovery and motion practice.\" ECF No. 71. Specifically, Plaintiff used its legal efforts to retain an experienced labor and employment attorney, Attorney David Simonsen, to review this matter and provide a second opinion on the strength of the case. ECF No. 71-7. Plaintiff also concedes that they purposely reduced the amount of hours expended on failed claims when they were clearly distinguishable from the hours expended on the successful claim, or they reduced the amount of hours in half if the hours exhausted on failed claims did not clearly differentiate the hours logged for the successful FMLA denial of rights claim. Additionally, Plaintiff reduced 2.95 hours, at $85 per hour for a total of $250.75, for the inclusion of administrative or clerical entries in the attorneys' fees award. ECF No. 79 at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Defendant argues that Plaintiff failed to prove the reasonableness of several of the fees that Plaintiff claims. Defendant contends that some of Plaintiff's attorneys' fees are unreasonable because some of the entries include block billing, overstaffing of attorneys at depositions and trial, and fees\n   for clerical work from the two paralegals who provided services during the case. For example, Defendant highlighted entries of block billing that included \"4.25 hours for 'drafted First Amended Complaint and revised same; review the file and email correspondence; research and review of defamation law.' \" ECF No. 74 at 3. Defendant also argues that Plaintiff overstaffed depositions and trial hearings by employing multiple attorneys to perform the work of one attorney. Defendant states that Plaintiff should not receive an award for costs associated with receiving a second opinion for this case because the experience of the attorneys already working the matter was sufficient experience to handle the intricacies of the case based on their combined years of experience.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. Additionally, Defendant contends that Plaintiff's bill of costs is untimely under Local Civil Rule 54 of the Eastern District of Virginia.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11. The Court entered judgment for Plaintiff on August 10, 2017, and Plaintiff was required to file her bill of costs on August 21, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff filed her bill of costs on August 24, 2017, three days after the deadline.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court determines that Plaintiff's Motion is timely under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 54. Plaintiff had no later than 14 days from the entry of judgment to file her Motion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Court entered judgment for Plaintiff on August 10, 2017, and Plaintiff timely filed her Motion on August 24, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Court finds that neither Plaintiff nor Defendant really dispute factors two through twelve of the\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   factors in their pleadings. Most importantly, both parties did not dispute the reasonableness of Plaintiff's $200 to $385 hourly rates. Plaintiff submitted affidavits attesting to the reasonableness of the hourly rates. Based on the affidavits, James H. Shoemaker, Jr.'s attorney's fee is $385 based on his experience. Cindra M. Dowd's attorney's fee is $300 based on her experience. Jason E. Messersmith's attorney's fee is $235 based on his experience. Lastly, Andrew J. Dean's attorney's fee is $200 based on his experience. The Court finds that Plaintiff's rates, along with the Court's modification to the number of hours expended in this case, are a reasonable basis for determining Plaintiff's attorneys' fees award. Accordingly, the Court need not address any other factors in its analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The Court also concludes that Plaintiff's hours expended during this matter require a downward adjustment. Some of the hours listed on Plaintiff's review statement should be excluded because of inter-office correspondences, vague entries, extensive hours documented for trial preparation, and clerical tasks. The Court reduced James Shoemaker's hours to 257 hours after deducting approximately 1.7 hours for inter-office communications, 22.55 hours for vague entries, 39.1 hours for excessive hours documented for trial preparation, and 0.4 hours for clerical work. For example, the Court excluded entries such as the following: hours for inter-office conferences and email correspondences documented on September 2014, April 2015, and May 2017; hours for vague entries noting trial preparation, file organization, and trial record review on January 2017, March 2017, and May 2017; hours for extensive or duplicated documentation concerning preparation for depositions, research on case law and relevant facts, and review of exhibit books on January 2017, February 2017, April 2017, and May 2017; and hours for clerical work documented on March 2017. ECF No. 71-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court reduced Andrew Dean's hours to 6.5 hours because the entry for trial preparation was vague and Plaintiff raised no objection in the Reply to the reduction of Dean's 6.8 hours expended during the trial. ECF No. 79 at 5 n. 4. The\n   Court reduced Jason Messersmith's hours to zero hours after subtracting 0.2 hours for an inter-office conference. ECF No. 71-3 at 13. The Court reduced Cindra Dowd's hours to 68.75 hours after removing roughly 0.10 hours for inter-office communications and 2.9 hours for vague entries. The Court excluded hours for vague entries noting review and compiling of documents on June 2016 and December 2016, and hours for inter-office communication on December 2016. ECF No. 71-4. After considering the reduction of hours, the Court finds that $120,870 in attorneys' fees is reasonable in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court computed the lodestar award by multiplying a total number of 332.25 hours expended by the attorneys' respective hourly rates of $200, $300, and $385, totaling $120,870 in attorneys' fees. The Court determined James Shoemaker's attorney's fees by multiplying 257 hours by his $385 hourly rate, totaling $98,945. The Court calculated Cindra Dowd's attorney's fees by multiplying 68.75 hours by her $300 hourly rate, totaling $20,625. The Court also calculated Andrew Dean's attorney's fees by multiplying 6.5 hours by his $200 hourly rate, totaling $1,300. Lastly, the Court reasoned that Jason Messersmith, who had a billing rate of $235 per hour, had no billable hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court added a total of $1,440.75 in paralegal's fees and $6,716.68 in other costs for a total of $8,157.43 in overall costs. Paralegals' fees were determined by multiplying 16.95 hours by the hourly paralegal rate of $85, totaling $1,440.75. The Court eliminated additional billed paralegal hours which were merely clerical tasks or vague entries. The Court calculated the other costs based on the monetary figure and invoice of Attorney David Simonsen presented in Plaintiff's Motion, totaling $6,716.68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Therefore, the Court finds that a downward adjustment in the lodestar award is warranted. The Court awards a total of $129,027.43 in Plaintiff's attorneys' fees and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
