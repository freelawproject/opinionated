Introduction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   A. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Plaintiffs are members of a group, Falun Gong, developed in the second half of the twentieth century in China. The People's Republic of China (\"Chinese Government\"), it is alleged, has acted to suppress this group in both China and abroad, including in the United States; it deems it a threat to the hegemony of the Chinese State and Communist Party.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pitman B. Potter,\n   <em>\n    Belief in Control: Regulation of Religion in China\n   </em>\n   , 174 The China Q. 317, 323, 331-32 (2003); Fenggang Yang,\n   <em>\n    The Red, Black, and Gray Markets of Religion in China\n   </em>\n   , 47 The Soc. Q. 93, 110-13 (2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Adherents of Falun Gong live in the United States. Some are citizens of this country. It is contended by them as plaintiffs that the Chinese Government has conspired with individuals to harm followers and suppress Falun Gong in the United States by organizing and encouraging the Chinese Anti-Cult World Alliance (\"CACWA\") and individuals to inflict injuries on those who follow Falun Gong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Defendants oppose Falun Gong in Flushing, Queens, New York, and elsewhere. They deny that Falun Gong is a religion. Following the position of the Chinese Government, their opposition is based upon characterizing Falun Gong as a \"cult\" indoctrinating its followers with beliefs that are dangerous, unscientific, and offensive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiffs' claims require a showing, for the purposes of this litigation, that Falun Gong is a religion and that defendants obstructed the right of its adherents to practice this religion at places of religious worship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In China, and in the United States, anti-Falun Gongists define Falun Gong as a \"cult\" that challenges the authority of the ruling Communist Party and Chinese Government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Anne S. Y. Cheung,\n   <em>\n    In Search of a Theory of Cult and Freedom of Religion in China: The Case of Falun Gong\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=13%20Pac.%20Rim%20L.%20%26%20Pol%27y%20J.%201\">\n    13 Pac. Rim L. &amp; Pol'y J. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The history and tradition in American constitutional law and the beliefs of most of the population of the United States mandates a finding that Falun Gong is a religion for only purposes of standing and applicable substantive law in the present case. \"Heresy trials are foreign to our Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Ballard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142066\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/322/78/#p86\">\n    322 U.S. 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 86,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142066\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/322/78/#p86\">\n    64 S.Ct. 882\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6142066\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/322/78/#p86\">\n    88 L.Ed. 1148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1944).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The court defines Falun Gong as a religion for purposes of this litigation.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Sections III(B), IV(A). The court makes no ruling on the religious nature of Falun Gong for general theological purposes. The parties' post-summary judgment hearing submissions seeking a definition of Falun Gong as a religion or non-religion for purposes outside this litigation are not persuasive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plts.' Post-Hr'g Br. at 1-10, ECF No. 145; Defs.' Post Hr'g Br. at 1-3, 7-10, ECF No. 146.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiffs proselytize their religion and protest the Chinese Government's opposition to it on Main Street in Flushing, Queens, near what they consider to be one of their temples.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appendixes A &amp; B (map and pictures of area). The Federal Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act protects plaintiffs \"lawfully exercising ... [their] First Amendment right of religious freedom\n   <em>\n    at a place of religious worship\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20248\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) (emphasis added). This statute is inclusive of all lawful religious practices and of all places it is practiced. Any place a religion is practiced-be it in underneath a tree, in a meadow, or at a folding table on the streets of a busy city-is protected by this and other statutes and the First Amendment to the Federal\n   Constitution. A contrary reading would render the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act unconstitutional since it would discriminate between religions that use formal temples and those that do not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Plaintiffs set up their tables in a heavily pedestrian-traveled area in Queens.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Summary Judgment Hearing Transcript (\"Hr'g Tr.\") 251:5-253:10 (April 4, 2018 &amp; April 11, 2018). There they proselytize for the Falun Gong, also known as Falun Dafa.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20248\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As noted above, for purposes of this litigation, Falun Gong is properly characterized as a religion under the Federal Constitution and federal and state statutes and cases.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Sections III(B), IV(A). Its adherents verbally and with hand-outs, signs, and literature attacked the Chinese Government politically for, among other things, harvesting human organs. Hr'g Tr. 265:15-266:6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Defendants, following the Chinese Government's position, allegedly verbally and physically attacked plaintiffs at their tables, and referred to Falun Gong as a \"cult,\" dangerous to its adherents and others.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Section II(C). Defendants claim plaintiffs attacked them physically.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   At times the debates became loud, spirited, and robust, with occasional striking out and hitting, but with no appreciable physical harm to any person.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20248\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Since the instant case was brought, physical confrontations have subsided.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. 156:24-157:10.

Plaintiffs seek dismissal of defendants' counterclaims. Defendants seek dismissal of several of plaintiffs' causes of action.

Caylan Ford\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Ford received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Chinese History from the University of Calgary, a Masters in International Affairs from the George Washington University, and a Masters in International Human Rights Law from the University of Oxford. Hr'g Tr. 39:7-14. She has studied and written learned articles about Falun Gong.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   39:7-41:11. She practices Falun Gong.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   44:1-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   She explained the genesis and basic teachings of Falun Gong:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   Falun Gong was first publicly taught in China in 1992 by a man named Li Hongzhi who is referred in the practice as the master or teacher....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   Li described Falun Gong, which is also sometimes called Falun Dafa. It's described as a practice stemming from the Buddhist school and it's stated essential teachings principles, and practice methods have been transmitted orally to him through a long lineage of masters and disciples .... as is quite typical of Asiatic or spiritual disciplines and traditions. After being passed on to him, he reorganized some of these practice methods to make them suitable for popularization and he compiled the essential teachings in the book Zhuan Falun ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   [I]t was originally classified as a system of Qigong. And Qigong is an umbrella term, it's a system of categorization that's fairly new in China that captures sort of a wide variety of meditation-regulated breathing practices. And they were classified in contemporary China as forms of Chinese medicine meant to effect better health. But Li Hongzhi made clear that Falun Dafa, Falun Gong, the purpose of it was not limited to obtaining better health. Instead, it was presented as a path to transcendence, spiritual salvation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   Emphasis was put on spiritual and moral rectitude, and the ultimate goal is to achieve a kind of reconciliation with the divine. And this is actually much more reflective of the traditional function that these kinds of meditation and exercises had in antiquity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   But a lot of these were more philosophical or theological components ... lost within the political climate of communist China. So, in effect, Li Hongzhi was reviving the kind of religious origins of this type of Qigong discipline.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   45:10-47:3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Ford further explained the relationship between Falun Gong and the meditation and breathing exercise practice, known as Qigong.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   Well, Qigong is not a discrete single thing. So Falun Gong shouldn't be understood as a branch of Qigong or a sect, for instance. Rather, Qigong is a modern system of a classification that was devised in the political climate of the Peoples Republic of China under Communism.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   So, for centuries, Qigong-like techniques of meditation, regulated breathing, specific movements and exercises, these have been employed for centuries, if not millennia, by Daoist practitioners, by some Buddhist groups, as a sort of ancillary means of achieving spiritual transformation. And many of these types of practices were transmitted orally\n   through lineage systems in private, and they were sort of rediscovered early in the Maoist era. In order to survive in that political climate, they had to cast off their theistic beliefs or their religious beliefs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-123\">\n   So, to survive, Qigong practices were essentially reclassified as systems of Chinese medicine and stripped of their more overtly religious content. And it's that trend, as I said earlier, that Falun Gong in a sense reversed ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   Qigong is not necessarily religious, or the practices that are described as Qigong practices, rather, are not necessarily unreligious. Some of them are. I suppose, in a way, it's analogous to ... Yogic practices. In both China and India, there are these similar traditions of ... focused movements that are in to assist a person in their quest for transcendence and moksha and enlightenment, and comprised part of spiritual and religious practice. That doesn't mean that everyone practicing [\u00a2] yoga in New York is engaged in a religious practice, but neither does it mean that there are no religious applications or religious practices that involve yoga ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   So some Qigong practices, I think, could rightly be classified as having religious elements, and some having been divorced from their religious roots no longer have that claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   49:9-50:24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Buddhism and Falun Gong are related to one another.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   [T]here is the Buddhist religion founded by Buddha Shakyamuni, the historical Buddha, but then there is the Buddhist school Falun Gong calls Fojiao .... And the Falun Gong understand the name of this is that the Buddhism founded by Buddha Shakyamuni, the religious Buddhism is but one branch of a much broader school. And so the relationship between Falun Gong and religious Buddhism is of two different sort of denominations within a very vast system or school of teachings. As opposed to Falun Gong being a sect of religious Buddhism as founded by Buddha Shakyamuni.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   103:23-104:9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In Ford's expert opinion, Falun Gong is a religion by Western standards. She described the features of Falun Gong that led to this conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   Falun Gong elaborates a very complete cosmology or sacred order. It places ethical and moral demands on its practitioners and grounds these demands within a metaphysical framework.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   The ultimate goal of the practice is the attainment of spiritual salvation, enlightenment, transcendence of this mortal realm in the context of Eastern religions. They talk of reincarnation, a cycle of samsara. And the goal is ultimately to extricate one's self from this cycle of reincarnation and achieve reconciliation for the divine. It involves an extensive body of scripture, a moral code. Teachings deal with ultimate questions of the purpose of life, the afterlife, the source of suffering, the means of salvation. It discusses metaphysical, or other worldly realms that are beyond our human perception or beyond this material world, planes inhabited by deities or gods.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   In terms of its function in the lives of its practitioners with the caveat that religion can mean different things to different people and can be embraced with varying levels of commitment for the vast majority of Falun Gong practitioners that I know, they engage daily with the study of Falun Gong [teachings], Falun Gong meditation and exercise, and they certainly would see it as, you know, sort of playing a parallel role to what belief in God plays in established in\n   orthodox faiths. And it's an essential component to their self-identity.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   So, in all these ways, yes, I believe that Falun Gong would qualify as a religion based on our Western conceptions of religion, and certainly, based under U.S. law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   51:7-52:11\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Falun Gong teaches of a divine creator:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   So its teachings articulate a belief in a divine creator, and the ultimate kind of manifestation is found in the principles of Chinese of Zhen, Shan, Ren .... But this translates roughly as truth or truthfulness; compassion, benevolence; and something akin to forbearance. Endurance, patience, et cetera.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   And this quality is described as the great law of the universe, the Dafa. It represents the fundamental or the ultimate nature of the universe. The ultimate manifestation of the Dao or the Buddhist law. It's seen as the source of order that animates and gives rise to all life and all things. And It's the sole criteria by which Falun Gong measures what's good and bad, right and wrong. So it's unchangeable and immutable, and it's ... the source or the divine ground of being.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   52:16-53:8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Unlike some other religions, Falun Gong generally does not issue strict prohibitions; instead, it offers its followers general principles.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-141\">\n   [Li Hongzhi's] approach ... is typically to explain the principles of why a particular thing is good or bad. Why it may not be compatible with the ends of practice. And then it's up to the individual student, him or herself, to apply these principles in her life.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   So, as an example, Buddhist practices have just a hard-and-fast prohibition on eating meat. Falun Gong would explain that the practitioner shouldn't be attached to eating meat, that negative karma may be accrued in the process of eating meat. But it doesn't forbid it outright. So this is a little bit of ... how to understand the sort of Li's approach to these types of ethical teachings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   53:12-54:22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   It is a \"revealed religion\" shown to Li's followers through his speeches and writings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   57:23-58:5. Much \"is left to the individual practitioner to understand and interpret in their life and their own manner.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The daily practice of Falun Gong includes five exercises:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   These include four slow-moving meditative standing exercises and one seated meditation. In addition, there's a daily short meditation ritual that's performed ... multiple times a day where possible, and it's kind of akin to a prayer. These are the main sort of outward manifestations of ritual in that sense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   54:23-55:6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Although Falun Gong's founder has stated that it is not a religion, Ford explained that this teaching is based on a Chinese concept of religion that differs from religion in the Western sense.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   59:1-60:4. Li has stated the Falun Gong is not a \"Zong Jiao,\" a Chinese concept that is often translated as \"religion\" in English.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   Zong Jiao is actually a neologism that was invented in China in the 19th century. It generally is translated into English as religion, but I would say that a more accurate translation is institutional religion or organized religion because what the term Zong Jiao encompasses is much narrower than what the English term is understood to mean i.e., Zong Jiao refers to highly institutionalized religion that [has] churches or temples, clergy or some kind of monastic order; systems of membership, tithing, et cetera....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   [A]t various points, Li has said that Falun Gong is not a, he said it's not a Zong Jiao because it doesn't have these kinds of institutionalized features....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-151\">\n   The fact that the Li Hongzhi has said in Chinese that Falun Gong is not a Zong Jiao religion, to me, has no bearing on the question of whether it should be understood as a religion under U.S. law. I think it's perfectly irrelevant for the United States who, as I understand it, has their own criteria ... that are independent of this kind of question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   59:1-62:8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Falun Gong does not have many formal physical or organizational structures. In the 1990s, it had no temples or clergy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   89:18-23. There is now a Falun Gong Temple located in upstate New York, and several more formal Falun Gong gathering places, including those in Flushing, Queens.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   89:18-90:13.

He had two primary bases for his conclusion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   Well, the first conclusion, the first basis, would be that Falun Gong describes itself as one of the 84,000 Buddhisms. And Buddhism is recognized, I think, in America as being a religion. If Buddhism is not a religion, then it's very hard to say what is a religion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n   The second point is that like most religions, Falun Gong is not about worldly things or even about one's self, it is about advancing through a path of spiritual exercise to higher and higher levels of understanding of the nature, the origins, the moral dimensions and so forth of the universe and I think it shares this characteristic with every religion that I can think of.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   124:7-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   He explained the relationship between Falun Gong and Buddhism:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-165\">\n   I would say [Falun Gong] is probably one-third composed of analogies and quotations from the Daoist and Buddhist masters. The story, of course, is that Li Hongzhi [Falun Gong's founder] as a very young boy was recognized as having certain spiritual gifts and, therefore, during the Cultural Revolution, he was\n   taken from monastery to monastery in China where there were great sages. And each of these sages would teach him the essence and the best of what that sage knew and this was his education.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n   So you can say that his education was eclectic in the sense that he studied with many masters of many different Chinese religions and then he put together a synthesis that he had arrived at, but which was a synthesis of what was already there in the others. And, therefore, it was kith and kin. It was in no way different. It was in certain respects novel you might say, but it represents in many ways, also, a development of trans-Buddhist thought which you can follow all the way back to the time of Buddha.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   130:13-131:7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   c.

He did express hesitation about calling it a religion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   171:3-172:2. Some of the aspects that give Dr. Xia pause include: (1) a lack of a God and savior figure,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   173:11-15; (2) Falun Gong's founder's statements that it is not a religion,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   173:23-174:3; and (3) Falun Gong's lack of interfaith tolerance,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   174:3-175:18.

First Amendment Drafting History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   Writing several years before the passage of the Bill of Rights, James Madison-the principle author of the First Amendment-described his inclusive, broad view of religion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-254\">\n   Because we hold it for a fundamental and undeniable truth, \"that Religion or the duty which we owe to our Creator and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence.\" [Virginia Declaration of Rights, art. 16.] The Religion then of every man\n   <em>\n    must be left to the conviction and conscience of every man\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    and it is the right of every man to exercise it as these may dictate\n   </em>\n   . This right is in its nature an unalienable right. It is unalienable, because the opinions of men, depending only on the evidence contemplated by their own minds cannot follow the dictates of other men: It is unalienable also, because what is here a right towards men, is a duty towards the Creator. It is the duty of every man to render to the Creator such homage and such only as he believes to be acceptable to him. This duty is precedent, both in order of time and in degree of obligation, to the claims of Civil Society. Before any man can be considered as a member of Civil Society, he must be considered as a subject of the Governour of the Universe: And if a member of Civil Society, who enters into any subordinate Association, must always do it with a reservation of his duty to the General Authority; much more must every man who becomes a member of any particular Civil Society, do it with a saving of his allegiance to the Universal Sovereign. We maintain therefore that in matters of Religion, no man's right is abridged by the institution of Civil Society and that Religion is wholly exempt from its cognizance. True it is, that no other rule exists, by which any question which may divide a Society, can be ultimately determined, but the will of the majority; but it is also true that the majority may trespass on the rights of the minority.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   James Madison,\n   <em>\n    Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments\n   </em>\n   (June 20, 1785) (emphasis added). In Madison's view, the \"conviction and conscience of everyman\" was the touchstone of religion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20248\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   No longer was it the Established Church of England.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   Prior to the enactment of the Bill of Rights, religion was mostly left out of the United States Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Frank Lambert,\n   <em>\n    The Founding Fathers and the Place of Religion in America\n   </em>\n   14 (2003) (\"For the delegates at the Constitutional\n   Convention in 1787, religion was a divisive issue that threatened the union they were trying to forge. Fractured by pluralism and enflamed by sectarianism, Americans were unlikely to agree upon any federal establishment, no matter how broadly stated. Thus the delegates opted to avoid conflict by making no mention whatever of religion in the proposed Constitution except in the ban against all religious tests. Thereby, they gave legal standing to the free religious market place.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   The idea of equating religion with \"conscience\" became part of First Amendment history. What is now part of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, in its initial draft by Madison read: \"The civil rights of none shall be abridged on account of [1] religious\n   <em>\n    belief or worship\n   </em>\n   , [2] nor shall any national religion be established, [3] nor shall the full and equal rights of\n   <em>\n    conscience\n   </em>\n   be in any manner, or on any pretext, infringed.\" 1 Annals of Cong. 434 (1789) (emphasis added). \"Throughout the summer of 1789, the three clauses rotated in and out of the text.\" Burt Neuborne,\n   <em>\n    Madison's Music: On Reading the First Amendment\n   </em>\n   133 (2015).

At common law, the second marriage was always void, and from the earliest history of England polygamy has been treated as an offence against society. After the establishment of the ecclesiastical courts, and until the time of James I., it was punished through the instrumentality of those tribunals, not merely because ecclesiastical rights had been violated, but because upon the separation of the ecclesiastical courts from the civil the ecclesiastical were supposed to be the most appropriate for the trial of matrimonial causes and offences against the rights of marriage, just as they were for testamentary causes and the settlement of the estates of deceased persons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11293\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/98/145/#p162\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11293\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/98/145/#p162\">\n    at 164-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   With this Abrahamic worldview in mind, the Court considered \"whether those who make polygamy a part of their religion are excepted from the operation\" of a statute outlawing polygamy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11293\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/98/145/#p162\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11293\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/98/145/#p162\">\n    at 166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As originally introduced in the 42d Congress, the section was solely a criminal provision outlawing certain conspiratorial acts done with intent 'to do any act in violation of the rights, privileges, or immunities of another person.' Introducing the bill, the House sponsor, Representative Shellabarger stressed that 'the United States always has assumed to enforce, as against the States, and also persons, every one of the provisions of the Constitution.' The enormous sweep of the original language led to pressures for amendment, in the course of which the present civil remedy was added. The explanations of the added\n   <em>\n    language centered entirely on the animus or motivation that would be required, and there was no suggestion whatever that liability would not be imposed for purely private conspiracies\n   </em>\n   . Representative Willard, draftsman of the limiting amendment, said that his version 'provid(ed) that the essence of the crime should consist in the intent to deprive a person of the equal protection of the laws and of equal privileges and immunities under the laws; in other words, that the Constitution secured, and was only intended to secure, equality of rights and immunities, and that we could only punish by United States laws a denial of that equality.'. Representative Shellabarger's explanation of the amendment was very similar: 'The object of the amendment is to confine the authority of this law to the prevention of deprivations which shall attack the equality of rights of American citizens; that any violation of the right, the animus and effect of which is to strike down the citizen, to the end that he may not enjoy equality of rights as contrasted with his and other citizens' rights, shall be within the scope of the remedies of this section.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-342\">\n   Other supporters of the bill were even more explicit in their insistence upon coverage of private action. Shortly before the amendment was introduced, Representative Shanks urged, 'I do not want to see (this measure) so amended that there shall be taken out of it the frank assertion of the power of the national Government to protect life, liberty, and property,\n   <em>\n    irrespective of the act of the State\n   </em>\n   .' At about the same time, Representative Coburn asked: 'Shall we deal with individuals, or with the State as a State? If we can deal with individuals, that is a less radical course, and works less interference with local governments. It would seem more accordant with reason that the easier, more direct, and more certain method of dealing with individual criminals was preferable, and that the more thorough method of superseding State authority should only be resorted to when the deprivation\n   of rights and the condition of outlawry was so general as to prevail in all quarters in defiance of or by permission of the local government.' After the amendment had been proposed in the House, Senator Pool insisted in support of the bill during Senate debate that 'Congress must deal with individuals, not States. It must punish the offender against the rights of the citizen.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-343\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026715\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/88/#p98\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-344\">\n   <em>\n    Griffin\n   </em>\n   did not address the issue of\n   <em>\n    which constitutional rights\n   </em>\n   are protectable against private conspiracies under \u00a7 1985(3).

The alleged violence occurred at or around the Falun Gong spiritual center or at tables where plaintiffs were proselytizing.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   Section II(C).

These physical acts were allegedly accompanied by threatening remarks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-484\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that defendants' deposition testimony was vague and that they only asserted the counterclaims because the plaintiffs asserted affirmative claims. While some of defendants' testimony may be short on details, several of the claims-hitting and throwing rocks-are clear. They support an assault and battery claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-485\">\n   Plaintiffs' argument boils down to the fact that they do not think defendants claims are credible.
