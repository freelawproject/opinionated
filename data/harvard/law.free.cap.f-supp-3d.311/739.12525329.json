SCHROEDER, District Judge.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Andrew S. Thiessen brings suit against Defendant Stewart-Haas Racing, LLC (\"Stewart-Haas\") alleging employment discrimination based on disability. Specifically, Thiessen's complaint alleges failure to accommodate, failure to promote, retaliation, and wrongful discharge under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (\"ADA\"). (Doc. 2 at 7-10.) Before the court is Stewart-Hass's motion to dismiss Thiessen's failure to promote, retaliation, and wrongful discharge claims. (Doc. 13.) The motion has been fully briefed and is ready for decision. (Docs. 14, 17, 19.) For the reasons set forth below, the motion will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The complaint alleges the following facts, which are accepted as true and construed in the light most favorable to Thiessen for the purposes of the present motion:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Thiessen was employed by Stewart-Hass, which operates a number of professional racing teams (primarily in NASCAR), as a tear down technician from January 13, 2013, until January 31, 2017. (Doc. 2 \u00b6\u00b6 10-11.) This work involves the cutting of sharp sheet metal, and it is not uncommon for the technicians to get cut in the process. (Doc. 17-1 at 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In November of 2015, Thiessen learned he was HIV positive. (Doc. 2 \u00b6 14.) Around that time, he told Donna Lawing, Stewart-Haas's HR Director, of his diagnosis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15.) Lawing kept this information confidential but instructed Thiessen to be careful in his work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16-17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In December of 2015, Thiessen requested a transfer to the company's Suspension Department. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Lawing told Thiessen she would need a new version of his resume in order for him to be transferred, despite the fact that she already had a copy and other employees had been transferred without having to provide an updated resume. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.) Thiessen did not receive the requested transfer, and it appears that he never sent an updated resume to Lawing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sometime in April of 2016, Stewart-Haas conducted safety training for its employees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) While this training included information on blood borne pathogens, it did not specifically cover HIV or AIDS or the ways these conditions can be\n   communicated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22; Doc. 17-1 at 5.) As such, some of Thiessen's co-workers were uninformed on the ways HIV can be transferred to others. (Doc. 2 \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In July of 2016, Thiessen confided in a co-worker that he had been diagnosed with HIV. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) By late 2016, it had become \"common knowledge\" among employees that Thiessen was HIV positive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25.) Co-workers became afraid to work with him, for fear of being infected with HIV. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26.) At some point in 2016, some of Thiessen's co-workers went to the physician on staff and requested HIV tests to confirm they had not contracted HIV. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Around December of 2016, Thiessen asked to be transferred from his race team, the Sprint Cup Team, to Stewart-Haas's Ixfinity Team. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28-29.) This request was denied, and Thiessen was told that members of the Sprint Cup Team could not be transferred to the Ixfinity Team. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.) However, Thiessen is aware of another Stewart-Haas employee who was allowed to make such a transfer. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On January 31, 2017, Thiessen was terminated for \"creating an unsafe working environment for others\" due to his physical impairment. (Doc. 2-3.) In its termination letter, Stewart-Hass stated that Thiessen had \"expos[ed] other employees to blood borne pathogens in their workplace\" and that management had received photographic evidence that he had dropped blood in his work area and failed to clean it up. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thiessen disputes the claim of photographic evidence, argues that he has never exposed other employees to blood borne pathogens, and claims that he was cut only once during the course of his employment and promptly \"cleaned up the blood and bandaged the cut.\" (Doc. 2 \u00b6\u00b6 46, 48.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Prior to Thiessen's termination, his job performance had always met or exceeded Stewart-Haas's employment standards. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43.) Thiessen was also never given any formal warning, nor was he disciplined in any way, before he was terminated, in violation of Stewart-Haas's progressive disciplinary policy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On May 6, 2017, Thiessen filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") against Stewart-Haas. (Doc. 2-1.) The charge alleges that that he had been fired as a result of his disability, but it makes no mention of a failure to accommodate, a failure to promote, or any form of retaliation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On October 23, 2017, the EEOC issued a right to sue letter. (Doc. 2-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On November 17, 2017, Thiessen filed the present action, alleging failure to accommodate, failure to promote, retaliation, and wrongful discharge. (Doc. 2.) Stewart-Haas now moves pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) to dismiss all but the wrongful discharge claim on the grounds that the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction and, alternatively, moves pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss all but\n   the wrongful discharge claim on the grounds that the claims fail to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(Doc. 14 at 9-12.) Thiessen argues that his EEOC charge gives rise to all of the claims he brings. (Doc. 18 at 9.) Specifically, he argues that he checked the \"Disability\" discrimination box on the EEOC charge and that there were no boxes for \"Failure to Promote,\" \"Wrongful Discharge,\" or \"ADA Retaliation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He also argues that his requests to be transferred to other departments should give rise to his failure to promote and failure to accommodate claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The court agrees with Stewart-Haas. Thiessen has failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to his failure to accommodate, failure to promote, and retaliation claims. The EEOC charge giving rise to Thiessen's complaint contains only a brief description of his claim and alleges only that he was \"terminated for creating an unsafe working environment for other employees due to [his] physical impairment.\" (Doc. 2-1.) The charge makes no mention whatsoever of any request for accommodation, any request for promotion, or any form of a claim of retaliation for having engaged in a protected activity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further, while Thiessen argues that there is no box to indicate that he is complaining of \"ADA Retaliation,\" there is a box labeled \"Retaliation\"-which Thiessen chose to leave blank. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plainly, the EEOC charge complains only of a single wrongful discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Moreover, there is nothing in the charge to indicate that Thiessen's other claims are \"reasonably related\" to his claim for wrongful discharge.\n   <em>\n    Evans\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7641145\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/80/954/#p963\">\n    80 F.3d at 963\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thiessen's EEOC charge mentions only his wrongful discharge claim. His new claims involve different time frames, actors, and discriminatory conduct. For example, Plaintiff was terminated January 31, 2017. (Doc. 2 \u00b6 31.) Thiessen's lawsuit alleges a failure to transfer in December 2015 and December 2016 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18, 28), and the failures to promote allegedly occurred during several unidentified conversations \"with Defendant\" and \"on several occasions\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65). The new claims also involve different actors. Clyde McLeod terminated Thiessen (Doc. 2-3), whereas Thiessen allegedly asked Donna Lawing to be transferred (Doc. 2 \u00b6\u00b6 18, 28). And the new claims allege different discriminatory conduct-failure to promote, failure to accommodate, and retaliation. While these are all allegedly based on violations of the ADA, they allege claims that exceed the scope of his charge and would not have been developed by a reasonable investigation.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Chacko\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1554034\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/429/505/#p508\">\n    429 F.3d at 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding allegations of national origin epithets by coworkers not covered by EEOC charge alleging three specific confrontations with supervisors not involving national origin slurs);\n   <em>\n    Rosier v.

(Doc. 18 at 10-11.) However, those communications only confirm that \"Thiessen did not make a request for any type of accommodation whatsoever\" during the conciliation process. (Doc. 17-1 at 4.)
