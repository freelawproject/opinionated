While Plaintiff was waiting with his son, he was confronted by New York City Police Department (\"NYPD\") officers Nicholas Nelson and Jessica Hernandez, arrested, briefly detained, and cited for disorderly conduct and disobeying a lawful order. (Defs. Statement of Material Facts (\"Defs. 56.1\") (Dkt. 43) \u00b6\u00b6 5-21.) Plaintiff subsequently filed this suit, which alleges, among other things, that Nelson and Hernandez violated various of his rights under the U.S. and New York State constitutions and New York tort law. (Compl. (Dkt. 1).) Before the court is Defendants' motion for partial summary judgment as to Plaintiff's claims against the NYPD, his claims under the New York State Constitution, his claims under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against the City of New York, and his intentional-infliction-of-emotional-distress (\"IIED\") and negligence claims. (Defs. Mot. for Partial Summ. J. (Dkt. 41); Defs. Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Partial Summ. J. (\"Defs. Mem.\") (Dkt. 42).)

(Defs. 56.1 \u00b6 5.) The son called Plaintiff, who came to the scene of the accident. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Soon afterwards, Hernandez and Nelson arrived at the scene of the accident as well. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.) According to Plaintiff, Nelson immediately began shouting at everyone present to move back. (Pl. 56.1 Counterstatement \u00b6 3; Pl. Dep. Tr. (Dkt. 47-2) 30:7-8, 35:2-11.) Nelson asked Plaintiff if Plaintiff had been in one of the cars involved in the accident; when Plaintiff said that he was not, Nelson allegedly pushed him back. (Pl. Dep. Tr. 38:25-39:4.) Plaintiff allegedly then told Nelson that Plaintiff's son had been in the accident, that the son was scared, and that Plaintiff needed to remain with him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   35:12-36:11, 36:18-37:13.) According to Plaintiff, Nelson then asked him for identification and, while Plaintiff was trying to get his identification, pushed him \"so hard,\" twisted his arm, threw him up against a wall, and, with Hernandez's help, handcuffed him. (Defs. 56.1 \u00b6 15; Pl. 56.1 Counterstatement \u00b6\u00b6 4-5; Pl. Dep. Tr. 36:13-17, 37:14-38:13, 38:25-39:10.) Nelson then allegedly threw Plaintiff to the ground, dragged him by the handcuffs to a police car, slammed him against the police car, put him in the back seat of the car, and punched him repeatedly in the torso. (Defs. 56.1 \u00b6 15; Pl. 56.1 Counterstatement \u00b6\u00b6 6-7; Pl. Dep. Tr. 39:24-40:1, 43:18-22, 45:19-46:4, 47:16-48:5, 50:3-52:18.) While allegedly punching Plaintiff, Nelson asked where Plaintiff was from; when Plaintiff responded that he was from Yemen, Nelson allegedly said that \"in Yemen they spit in your face.\" (Pl. 56.1 Counterstatement \u00b6 9; Pl. Dep. Tr. 52:19-24.) Meanwhile, Hernandez, who was sitting in the front of the cruiser, allegedly asked Plaintiff \"was this worth it[?]\" (Pl. 56.1 Counterstatement \u00b6 10; Pl. Dep. Tr. 53:22-54:1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When two other officers arrived at the scene, Nelson allegedly uncuffed Plaintiff\n   and told him that he was lucky that the other officers had arrived to rescue him. (Pl. 56.1 Counterstatement \u00b6 13; Pl. Dep. Tr. 60:13-15.) Plaintiff was cited for disorderly conduct and released, and he promptly headed to the 66th Precinct to file a complaint. (Pl. 56.1 Resp. \u00b6 20; Pl. 56.1 Counterstatement \u00b6 17; Pl. Dep. Tr. 63:13-16, 64:16-18.) The disorderly-conduct charged was subsequently dismissed (Defs. 56.1 \u00b6 21; Pl. Dep. Tr. 55:16-56:25), and two police officers (whose names he could not remember) allegedly visited his home several months later to apologize for his mistreatment and to say that Nelson needed additional training (Pl. 56.1 Counterstatement \u00b6 18; Pl. Dep. Tr. 116:25-118:11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Plaintiff served a notice of claim against the City of New York (the \"City\") and the NYPD on November 15, 2013, and testified at a hearing held pursuant to Section 50-h of the New York General Municipal Law. (Compl. (Dkt. 1) \u00b6\u00b6 7-8.) He thereafter commenced this action, which asserts twelve claims against the City, NYPD, Hernandez, and Nelson under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and New York State law. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-88.) With respect to Plaintiff's claims under federal law, Plaintiff alleges (1) that Hernandez and Nelson violated his Fourteenth Amendment right to equal protection of the laws by subjecting him to mistreatment based on his country of origin (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-44); (2) that they unreasonably searched and seized him, in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 45-48); (3) that they used excessive force against him, in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-52); and (4) that he was injured as a result of municipal customs and policies, such that the City is liable under\n   <em>\n    Monell v. Department of Social Services\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    436 U.S. 658\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    56 L.Ed.2d 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1978), for the deprivation of his constitutional rights (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 53-60). With respect to his claims under New York State law, Plaintiff alleges that Defendants violated his rights under the New York Constitution to the equal protection of law (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61-63) and not to be unlawfully searched and seized or subjected to excessive force (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64-66); that Defendants are liable in tort for unlawful infliction of emotional distress (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67-69), battery (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70-74), assault (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 75-78), and negligence, both in failing to protect him (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 79-82) and for hiring and retaining Nelson and Hernandez (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 83-85); and that the Municipal Defendants are liable under a theory of respondeat superior for all of Hernandez's and Nelson's allegedly unlawful acts (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 86-88).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As noted above, Defendants have moved for partial summary judgment. Defendants do not seek summary judgment with respect to Plaintiff's \u00a7 1983 equal-protection, search-and-seizure, or excessive-force claims against Hernandez and Nelson, his state-law assault or battery claims, or his claim that the City is vicariously liable for Hernandez's and Nelson's intentional torts. (\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Defs. Mem. at 5-6.) Instead, Defendants only argue in their motion that they are entitled to summary judgment as to Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   , state constitutional, IIED, and negligence claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After Defendants filed their motion for partial summary judgment, Plaintiff withdrew his New York State constitutional claims against Nelson and Hernandez (Pl. Mem. in Opp'n to Mot. for Partial Summ. J. (\"Pl. Mem.\") (Dkt. 46) at 14), his IIED claim (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15), and his negligent-failure-to-protect claim (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiff refused, however, to withdraw his negligent-training-and-supervision claim \"absent a clear concession that Officers Nelson and Hernandez were acting within the scope of their employment\" at the time of his arrest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17.) Defendants conceded\n   this point in their reply brief (Defs. Reply in Supp. of Mot. to Dismiss (\"Defs. Reply\") (Dkt. 48) at 10), so the parties appear to agree that Plaintiff's state-law negligent-training-and-supervision claim is untenable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Passucci v.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   <strong>\n    /Failure to Train, Supervise, and Discipline\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Although Plaintiff initially asserted a sweeping\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 54, 56-57), he has since focused this claim on allegations that the City failed to train, supervise, or discipline its police officers (particularly Nelson) regarding their use of force, and that this failure amounted to deliberate indifference to his Fourth Amendment rights. (Pl. Opp'n at 7-12.) Defendants advance several reasons why, in their view, Plaintiff has not shown that he was injured pursuant to a municipal policy or custom, as is necessary to establish\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability. (Defs. Mem. at 5.) First, they argue, to the extent Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim relies on a failure-to-train theory, he has not identified specific deficiencies with respect to the City's police-officer-training program or shown that such deficiency is \"closely related to the ultimate injury\" Plaintiff suffered. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Dekuyper v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   , No. 14-CV-8249 (DLC),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207335662\">\n    2016 WL 7335662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D.N.Y. Dec. 16, 2016) ).) Second, they contend, to the extent this claim relies on a theory that the City acted with deliberate indifference in failing to supervise or discipline its officers (particularly Nelson), he has not shown that there was an obvious need for better supervision or discipline or that any deficiencies in supervision or discipline actually resulted in the deprivation of Plaintiff's constitutional rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Defs. Reply at 3-4.) The court agrees with Defendants that Plaintiff has not adduced evidence from which a rational factfinder could conclude that the City acted with deliberate indifference in failing to train, supervise, or discipline its police officers (and especially Nelson) regarding the use of force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Municipalities cannot be vicariously liable under \u00a7 1983 for their employees' acts.\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    436 U.S. at 694-95\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1490618\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/436/658/\">\n    98 S.Ct. 2018\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs. Mem. at 5.) Instead, he relies on a 2015 report prepared by the Office of the Inspector General for the NYPD (\"OIG-NYPD\") regarding the NYPD's use of force (the \"IG Report\"), which discusses the City's use-of-force training (Off. of the Inspector Gen., N.Y.C. Dep't of Investigation, Police Use of Force in New York City: Findings and Recommendations on NYPD's Policies and Practices (2015) (Dkt. 47-19) at 39-44), and on the deposition testimony of Nelson and Hernandez. In the IG Report, the OIG-NYPD reviewed how the NYPD trains academy cadets and active-duty officers in the use of force, ultimately concluding that the NYPD should both place greater emphasis in training on how to de-escalate tense situations and increase the police academy's use of \"scenario and simulation trainings.\" (IG Report at 39-44.) In their depositions, both Hernandez and Nelson were questioned about the use-of-force training they received as cadets and on the job. While Hernandez gave conflicting testimony about whether she could remember receiving any such training (\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   Hernandez Dep. Tr. 12:11-15,\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   107:13-17,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   107:22-108:4), Nelson testified that he had received such training both in the academy and on the job, although he could not remember the precise meaning of \"Level II force\" or recall the NYPD Patrol Guide's procedures regarding the use of force (Nelson Dep. Tr. 14:17-21,126:20-127:3; 127:11-128:8, 129:2-5, 129:19-130:7, 130:16-131:4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   After reviewing this evidence, the court cannot discern any \"specific deficiency in the city's training program\" that was \"closely related\" to Plaintiff's alleged injuries. As an initial matter, the evidence before the court shows that the NYPD does, in fact, train its officers in the use of excessive force, and that Nelson in particular received such training. Simply alleging that Nelson used excessive force against Plaintiff does not show that Nelson received inadequate training about when and how to use force.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Jenkins v. City of New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3782389\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/478/76/#p95\">\n    478 F.3d 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 95 (2d Cir. 2007) (\"A training program is not inadequate merely because a few of its graduates deviate from what they were taught.\"). For the same reason, the fact that Nelson could not remember details about his training-or that Hernandez apparently\n   could not remember anything about her training-does not show that the training was itself inadequate. While Plaintiff insinuates that Nelson's on-the-job training was inadequate because it \"came in the form of watching a video tape\" (Pl. Mem. at 7), Plaintiff offers no evidence that videotapes are a deficient means of training or, even assuming solely for the sake of argument that they are, that the choice to train Nelson using videotapes, rather than some other means of training, was responsible for Plaintiff's alleged constitutional injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The best evidence in support of Plaintiff's position is the IG Report, which expressly recommends that the NYPD enhance its training on the de-escalation of hostile encounters. (IG Report at 43-44.) Courts in this district have repeatedly refused, however, to impose\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability on the basis of the IG Report.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hanson v.

Mar. 27, 2018) (collecting cases). Even assuming that the IG Report did establish that the NYPD's training on the de-escalation of hostile encounters was deficient, however, Plaintiff's failure-to-train claim is nevertheless unavailing, because, by his own account, Plaintiff was not interacting with Nelson or Hernandez in a way that would call for de-escalation. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Dep. Tr. 35:2-56:3.) Thus, Plaintiff cannot show that this specific alleged deficiency in the NYPD's training program is causally connected to his claimed constitutional injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Because Plaintiff has not produced \"evidence of any deficient or absent training program related to ... excessive force that could have caused the instant alleged violations,\" he cannot show that the City acted with deliberate indifference in failing to train its police officers, or Nelson in particular.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Underwood v.

In support of this contention, Plaintiff points to the IG Report, in which the OIG-NYPD analyzed 207 allegations of non-lethal force in 179 cases between 2010 and 2014 and concluded that, among other things, the NYPD provided insufficient guidance to officers about how to handle confrontations with members of the public and \"frequently failed to impose discipline even when provided with evidence of excessive force.\" (IG Report at 1, 3-5.) As alluded to above, courts in this circuit have been hesitant to impose\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   liability on the basis of the IG Report alone.

Sept. 7, 2016) (concluding that, in conjunction with other evidence, the IG Report's finding that officers in more than 35 percent of substantiated excessive-force cases were not disciplined sufficed to allow the plaintiff's failure-to-discipline claim to withstand a motion to dismiss).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Even assuming that the IG Report could support such a conclusion in some other case, however, it cannot here, because it was issued well after Plaintiff's arrest. As noted above, the incident at issue in this suit took place in September 2013, but the IG Report was not published until March 2015. Absent some additional evidence-for example, about why the report was commissioned and what the City knew as of September 2013-the IG Report alone does not create a triable issue as to whether the City was deliberately indifferent to the need for greater supervision or discipline to prevent the use of excessive force by NYPD officers in general.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boddie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%201466555\">\n    2016 WL 1466555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    b.

In support of this theory, Plaintiff points to evidence that both officers have been the subject of prior misconduct complaints. The court first discusses whether these complaints are sufficient to create a triable issue regarding the City's supervision or discipline of Hernandez, then turns to Nelson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    Hernandez\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The City cannot be liable based on its failure to supervise or discipline Hernandez. The record indicates that Hernandez was the subject of two prior Civilian Complaint Review Board (\"CCRB\") complaints: a 2008 complaint regarding \"the use of physical force, discourteous words and offensive language regarding race\" and a 2009 complaint \"regarding offensive language relating to someone's race.\" (Pl. 56.1 Counterstatement \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.) Hernandez has also been the subject of three NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau (\"IAB\") investigations, none of which involved complaints of false arrest or the use of excessive force.

Without something more-for example, evidence that the 2008 incident involved such \"extreme\" use of force that the need for additional supervision or discipline should have been obvious,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Amnesty Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"645496\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/361/113/#p127\">\n    361 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   129 -a single, five-year-old complaint about excessive force is insufficient to support a rational conclusion that it was \"obvious\" to the City that Hernandez required additional supervision or discipline.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marshall v.

From early 2010 until the date of Plaintiff's arrest, Nelson received at least 11 CCRB complaints, the majority of which pertained to the use of physical force, verbal abuse, or discourtesy. (CCRB History (Dkt. 47-9 at ECF p.24) at ECF pp.25-26.) It appears that none of these complaints resulted in discipline, because the allegations against Nelson were unsubstantiated, Nelson was exonerated, or the complainant would not cooperate with the investigation. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) During his deposition, Nelson testified that he had also been the subject of an additional CCRB complaint pertaining to an allegedly unlawful stop, threatened and actual use of physical force, and discourteous words. (Pl. 56.1 Counterstatement\n   \u00b6 61; Nelson Dep. Tr. 103:20-104:22.) As a result of having received three CCRB complaints within one year, Nelson was subject to \"Level I\" force monitoring beginning on June 19, 2012. (Pl. 56.1 Counterstatement \u00b6 69.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nelson was also the subject of five IAB investigations based on similar civilian complaints (which overlap in part with the CCRB complaints discussed above). (IAB Officer Resume (Dkt. 47-7); Defs. 56.1 Reply \u00b6 63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Prior to the incident in question, Nelson was also the subject of at least three domestic-violence complaints, including (1) a 2009 incident in which Nelson pushed and choked his girlfriend (Pl. 56.1 Counterstatement \u00b6 64); (2) an April 2010 incident in which Nelson threatened to mutilate a man he saw with his former girlfriend (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 65); and (3) a September 2012 incident in which Plaintiff was accused of ransacking another girlfriend's house during a verbal dispute (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71). In April 2010, as a result of the first two incidents, Nelson was placed on \"modified assignment,\" his firearm was taken away, and he was docked 20 vacation days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66-67.) The third incident was, however, found by NYPD investigators to be largely unsubstantiated. (Feb. 19, 2014, Report (Dkt. 47-14 at ECF p.8) at ECF pp.8, 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, Plaintiff also notes that Nelson was named as a defendant in two civil-rights lawsuits based on incidents that took place before Plaintiff's arrest. (Pl. 56.1 Counterstatement \u00b6 75.) In the first suit, the plaintiff alleged that, in May 2009, Nelson and other police officers falsely arrested him, used excessive force against him, and misrepresented that he had engaged in disorderly conduct. 1st Am.

Although the court need not resolve the question, it seems safe to say that Nelson's history of\n   complaints-which includes eight CCRB complaints, two additional IAB complaints, and two lawsuits alleging the use of excessive force, as well as several domestic- or domestic-related violence complaints-would suffice to create a triable issue as to whether it was obvious to the City that there was a risk that Nelson would use excessive force against arrestees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Regardless of whether the City was aware of such a risk, however, Plaintiff's failure-to-supervise and failure-to-discipline theories are unavailing because he has not presented evidence from which a rational factfinder could conclude that the City acted with deliberate indifference to this risk.

July 19, 2005) (\"complete failure to investigate\"). Plaintiff has not identified any complaints to which the City simply failed to respond. To the contrary, it appears to the court that the City investigated the complaints against Nelson and, to the extent those complaints were found to be substantiated, disciplined him, subjected him to increased force monitoring, and warned him that civilian complaints could derail his career.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mahan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%201677524\">\n    2005 WL 1677524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (noting that the force monitoring program \"is\n   <em>\n    itself\n   </em>\n   evidence of disciplinary action\"). To the extent the complaints against Nelson were found to be unsubstantiated or were settled without an admission of liability by the City, those complaints do not provide a valid basis for concluding that the City was deliberately indifferent to his use of excessive force, because they do not, by themselves, establish that he used excessive force in the first place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tieman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%201379652\">\n    2015 WL 1379652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *21 ;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hart v.

(Pl. Opp'n at 9.) Nelson was aware, however, that he had been subject to \"Level I\" force monitoring because he had accumulated\n   multiple CCRB complaints. (Nelson Dep. Tr. 27:5-24.) While it is true that Nelson did not recall being subject to \"Level II\" force monitoring (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   28:11-29:24), this fact does little to help Plaintiff's case. Because the City subjected Nelson to \"Level II\" force monitoring\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's arrest, Plaintiff cannot show that any deficiency with respect to this level of force monitoring actually caused him to suffer constitutional injury. Moreover, the fact that the City increased Nelson's force monitoring soon after Plaintiff's arrest shows that the City\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   supervise and discipline Plaintiff in response to complaints about his alleged use of excessive force, and tends to undermine any inference that the City acted with deliberately indifference to his violations of constitutional rights.

(Pl. Opp'n at 9.) Complaints, without more, do not prove that a police officer actually violated anyone's constitutional rights, so those unsubstantiated complaints cannot support a rational conclusion that the NYPD's force-monitoring system was \"so deficient as to reflect a policy of deliberate indifference to the civil rights of the citizenry.\"\n   <em>\n    Mahan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%201677524\">\n    2005 WL 1677524\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sarus v.

Defendants have not challenged the legal sufficiency of Plaintiff's assault and battery claims, nor have they argued that the City cannot be vicariously liable for such claims.

Defendants seem to argue that these claims are duplicative of his assault and battery claims. (Defs. Reply at 9.) But the intentional torts of assault and battery do not share the elements of the state constitutional claims in dispute, which protect wholly different legal interests-namely, the right not to be unreasonably detained and searched, and the right not to be subject to racially discriminatory government action, as opposed to the right not to be physically threatened and injured. While Defendants assert that plaintiff could have brought his equal-protection or search-and-seizure claims \"under state law, but he chose not to,\" this assertion is hard to understand, as Plaintiff asserted these claims under the New York State Constitution, which is, of course, \"state law.\" More importantly, Defendants fail to identify any specific state causes of action that would render Plaintiff's state equal-protection and search-and-seizure claims unnecessary. Defendants have not shown that Plaintiff has an adequate alternative remedy for these claims, to the extent these claims are asserted against the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Accordingly, the court GRANTS Defendants' motion for summary judgment with respect to all claims asserted under the New York State Constitution against Nelson and Hernandez; GRANTS the motion with respect to Plaintiff's state-constitutional excessive-force claim, to the extent it is asserted against the City; and DENIES the motion with respect to Plaintiff's state-constitutional equal-protection and search-and-seizure claims, to the extent they are asserted against the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    C.
