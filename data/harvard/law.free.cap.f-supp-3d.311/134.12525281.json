MCFADDEN, United States District Judge\n     Plaintiff Zead Khalaf Ibrahim lives in Jordan as an Iraqi political refugee. He tried to come to the United States, but the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service denied his I-590 Iraqi Resettlement Application and, subsequently, denied his Request for Reconsideration of that denial. At issue in this case is the Department of State's response to Mr. Ibrahim's Freedom of Information Act requests for all records in the Department's possession related to the denial of his application and the denial of his Request for Reconsideration. The Department of State has produced some responsive records and has redacted or withheld other records. Before this Court are the Department of State's motion for summary judgment and Mr. Ibrahim's crossmotion for partial summary judgment. Because some exemptions that the Department of State invokes properly apply but others do not, the Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment will be granted in part and denied in part, as will the Plaintiff's Cross-Motion for Partial Summary Judgment.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-9\">\n      <strong>\n       I.

At least part of the new evidence in question appears to be Mr. Ibrahim's diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which he says \"explains Mr. Ibrahim's inability to recall particular facts about his abductions and also explains any inconsistencies in his original Resettlement Application.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      \u00b6 25.
