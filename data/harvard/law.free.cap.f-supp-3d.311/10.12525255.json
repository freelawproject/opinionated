(collectively, \"Wells Fargo\") to deny a Home Affordable Modification Program (\"HAMP\") application filed by Genet Damtie in 2010. Given its subject matter, one might reasonably expect that Ms. Damtie would be a party to this case. She is not. Instead, this case has been brought by Tibebe F. Samuel, an individual who allegedly represented Ms. Damtie in her dealings with Wells Fargo. Ms. Damtie's HAMP application was never granted. She ultimately fired Plaintiff in early 2017. Her home was foreclosed later that year. Plaintiff filed suit shortly thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff, who does not purport to represent Ms. Damtie in this lawsuit, contends that Wells Fargo treated him unfairly during Ms. Damtie's HAMP application process. Plaintiff's currently-operative Amended Complaint is filled with generalized allegations of broken promises, deception and defamation. It is not a model of clarity or specificity. Defendants have filed a [12] Motion to Dismiss the Amended Complaint. Upon consideration of the\n   pleadings,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   the relevant legal authorities, and the record as it currently stands, the Court GRANTS-IN-PART and DENIES-IN-PART that motion. All of the claims that the Court can discern in Plaintiff's Amended Complaint are dismissed. For many of those claims, the statute of limitations has run. For others, Plaintiff has failed to plead essential elements. And for still others, there is simply no private cause of action available to Plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   However, for the first time in his Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiff has raised defamation and interference with business relationship claims based on a statement that Wells Fargo allegedly made to Ms. Damtie about Plaintiff in March 2017. Because Plaintiff proceeds\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , the Court has considered these claims despite the fact that they were absent from his Amended Complaint. Unlike Plaintiff's other defamation and interference claims, these claims do not appear to be time-barred or otherwise subject to dismissal on the pleadings on the current record. Plaintiff's lawsuit will be allowed to continue only so that he can assert claims based on the March 2017 statement. However, the Court will order Plaintiff to file a Second Amended Complaint that specifically asserts these claims so that there is an operative complaint in this case that sets forth the claims that are actually at issue going forward. This new pleading shall also omit the claims that the Court dismisses with prejudice, as discussed in more detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the purposes of the motion before the Court, the Court accepts as true the well-pleaded allegations in Plaintiff's Amended Complaint. The Court does \"not accept as true, however, the plaintiff's legal conclusions or inferences that are unsupported by the facts alleged.\"\n   <em>\n    Ralls Corp. v.

Cir. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In their reply brief, Defendants argue that the Court may not consider exhibits and factual assertions raised for the first time in Plaintiff's Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss because \"it is well-settled that a plaintiff cannot seek to amend his pleadings in an opposition to a motion to dismiss.\" Defs.'

Although this principle is indeed well-settled in cases where the plaintiff is represented by counsel, it does not apply in the same fashion in cases where the plaintiff proceeds\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . Because Plaintiff proceeds in this matter\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , when determining whether Plaintiff can state a plausible claim for relief the Court must consider his complaint in light of all of his filings, including those submitted in response to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown v.

Plaintiff is a self-described \"loan modification consultant\" who helps home owners navigate the HAMP application process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. As is required by law, Plaintiff was not to be paid by Ms. Damtie unless and until her HAMP application process was completed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29, 31.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   An \"Authorization Letter\" was sent to Wells Fargo notifying it of Plaintiff's retention by Ms. Damtie, and Wells Fargo allegedly responded to the letter indicating that it agreed to work with Plaintiff as Ms. Damtie's agent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 3, 32.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Wells Fargo allegedly indicated that it would make a decision on Ms. Damtie's HAMP application within 45-60 days (assuming that all required information had been provided).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 4, 32. However, according to Plaintiff, the process ended up taking more than seven years.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   During this period Plaintiff allegedly completed numerous tasks on behalf of Ms. Damtie (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \"faxing and mailing documents\" and \"letter writing\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.

Instead, Wells Fargo's intention was allegedly \"to accumulate interest in the mortgage,\" \"prolong the HAMP process\" and eventually foreclose on the home when profitable to Wells Fargo.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In a section of his Amended Complaint entitled \"Defamation of Character and Interference in Plaintiff's Business,\" Plaintiff alleges that Wells Fargo made certain false statements about Plaintiff to Ms. Damtie and others.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-45. In his Amended Complaint, Plaintiff alleges two specific instances when such false statements were made. First, Plaintiff alleges that \"[i]n the Superior Court of the District of Columbia in July 2016 during a hearing, the defendant's representative made a false statement regarding the Plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. Second, Plaintiff alleges that \"[i]n August 2016, a complaint was lodged by the borrower against the Defendant to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)\" and \"although the Defendant and the Plaintiff discussed ... the complaint,\" Defendants \"provided false information to the CFPB stating that the\n   Defendant was 'unable to reach the Plaintiff' in order to address the issues in the complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 43. Finally, although not alleged in his Amended Complaint, Plaintiff has raised a third allegedly defamatory statement in his Opposition to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss. According to a letter allegedly sent by Ms. Damtie to Plaintiff, a Wells Fargo customer service representative told Ms. Damtie on March 28, 2017 that her HAMP application had not been granted in part because Wells Fargo had been unable to get in touch with Plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n, Ex.

Cursory, unexplained allegations of misconduct do not satisfy the pleading standards of Federal Rule 8 and, to the extent Plaintiff is alleging fraud, they certainly do not satisfy the heightened pleading standards of Federal Rule 9(b). Below, the Court addresses whether the\n   <em>\n    specific\n   </em>\n   allegations in this case are sufficient to state plausible claims for relief pursuant to the causes of action Plaintiff appears to be asserting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Contract Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To the extent Plaintiff intends to assert contract claims, those claims are dismissed with prejudice. The Court can only discern one\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   agreement from Plaintiff's pleadings that could, theoretically, support a contract claim between Plaintiff and Defendants: Defendants' alleged \"promise\" in 2010 to Plaintiff that they would process Ms. Damtie's HAMP application within 45-60 days (assuming all required information had been provided).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Assuming for the purposes of Defendants' Motion to Dismiss that Plaintiff could have standing to enforce this promise, and that this promise could serve as the basis for an actionable contract claim, Plaintiff's claim still must be dismissed with prejudice because the statute of limitations has run. \"The statute of limitations in the District of Columbia for bringing a breach of contract claim is three years,\" and it begins to run at the time of the alleged breach.\n   <em>\n    LoPiccolo v.

A breach of contract claim premised on Defendants' failure to comply with the 45-60 day timeline promise would have accrued when Defendants (allegedly) failed to make a decision on Ms. Damtie's HAMP application within that timeframe.

Assuming that claim was based on the allegedly false statement that Defendants would process Ms. Damtie's HAMP application within 45-60 days, the claim fails because it is time-barred.

Regardless, the one narrow claim that the Court has allowed to remain in this case is based on a statement allegedly made by \"Wells Fargo customer service,\" and it is not clear at this point whether that statement was made on behalf of WFC or WFB. Both Defendants shall remain in the case.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
