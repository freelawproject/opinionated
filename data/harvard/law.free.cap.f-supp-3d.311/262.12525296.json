In a \"closely guarded category\" of contexts, however,\n   <em>\n    Chandler v.

Here, the Court must determine whether private nursery-school teachers in the District of Columbia fall within the narrow band of those who can be subjected to a random, suspicionless search regime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 2004, the District passed the Child and Youth Safety and Health Omnibus Amendment Act and established a series of drug- and alcohol-testing policies for individuals who work with children, including employees of private childcare facilities. Nearly a decade later, in 2013, the office responsible for licensing such facilities announced that it was interpreting the Act so as to require the random, suspicionless testing of their personnel. Under these new rules, nursery schools were required to subject their staff to such testing or face the loss of their licenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs in this case-the Association of Independent Schools of Greater Washington, the River School, and two individual teachers-are now challenging that testing policy. They set forth two counts in their Complaint, alleging that the testing requirement violates both the Fourth Amendment and the D.C. Administrative Procedure Act. They additionally contend that the District is bound in this case by the doctrine of collateral estoppel, as an earlier administrative determination prevented the revocation of a nursery school's license for its refusal to impose such testing. The District now moves to dismiss, and Plaintiffs have responded with their own Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment. Finding that the District's random testing runs afoul of the Fourth Amendment, the Court will grant Plaintiffs' Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Because both sides have filed dispositive motions, the facts cannot be set forth in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Fortunately here the facts that matter are essentially all undisputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Factual History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The context for this case begins over a decade ago, when the city passed the Child and Youth Safety and Health Omnibus Amendment Act of 2004 (CYSHA). The Act was implemented, in part, to address the \"tragic effects of drug or alcohol permeating youth group homes\" and to prevent \"catastrophic consequences\" that could result from employees \"being under the influence of drugs or alcohol.\" Council of the District of Columbia, Committee on Human Services, Report on Bill 15-607 (Nov. 12, 2004). To that end, the Act introduced random drug and alcohol testing for those employees in \"safety-sensitive positions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651779\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/305/#p309\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   CYSHA defines such childcare positions as those in which: (a) the employee has direct contact with children or youth; (b) she is entrusted with the direct care and custody of children or youth; and (c) the performance of her duties in the normal course of employment may affect the health, welfare, or safety of children or youth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-2031\">\n    D.C.

For these employees, the Act provides for a regime of suspicionless, random urine testing to be \"performed by an outside contractor\" at a District-certified laboratory.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-2031\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-2031\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 1-620.34(a). The statute also requires \"private entit[ies] licensed by the District government [with] employees who work in safety-sensitive positions [to] establish mandatory drug and alcohol testing policies and procedures that are consistent with the\" Act.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-2031\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-2031\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 1-620.36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The relevant entities in this case-\n   <em>\n    viz.\n   </em>\n   , child-development facilities-are licensed by the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE). Under the Child Development Facilities Regulation Act, OSSE has the authority to license those facilities that are \"a center, home, or other structure that provides care and other services, supervision, and guidance for children, infants, and toddlers on a regular basis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-2031\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-2031\">\n    .,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 7-2031(3). Infants are defined as those younger than 12 months, while toddlers are children between 12 and 24 months of age.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-2031\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-2031\">\n    .,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 7-2031(4), (8). The Act, however, explicitly does not address \"public or private elementary or secondary school[s] engaged in legally required educational and related functions or a pre-kindergarten education program licensed pursuant to the Pre-K Act of 2008.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-2031\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-2031\">\n    .,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 7-2031(3). OSSE's licensing authority thus applies only to those facilities serving infants, toddlers, and children that are not public or private pre-K, elementary, or secondary programs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Nearly a decade after the passage of CYSHA, OSSE first addressed the intersection of the Act and its licensing authority. In April 2013, the Office issued a memorandum to licensed childcare providers requiring them to conduct random drug and alcohol testing of their employees. According to the memo, \"[A]ny personnel who work ... in a childcare development facility\" were considered \"safety sensitive\" and thus would be \"required to participate in a drug and alcohol testing program that tests applicants before they begin work and employees periodically and randomly.\" Exh. B (OSSE Memo) at 1. This was followed by subsequent memoranda that provided dates of training sessions regarding compliance and addressed FAQs on the policy, the latter of which stated that \"drug/alcohol testing should be conducted during the pre-employment process, randomly, and whenever there is a reasonable suspicion that someone might be using drugs or alcohol.\" Exh. D (OSSE FAQs).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In issuing these policies, OSSE introduced a testing regime for child-development facilities distinct from that applicable to DCPS and D.C. charter-school employees. Under the governing regulations for those individuals, which are promulgated by the District's Department of Human Resources, employees who \"[c]oordinate, develop, or support recreational activities,\" \"[m]anage, plan, direct, or coordinate educational activities, \"[p]erform tasks involving individual or group counseling,\" or \"[a]ssess, monitor, or support childcare activities\" are considered \"protection sensitive,\" rather than \"safety sensitive.\" 6-B DCMR \u00a7 411.2. This means that District public- and charter-school teachers are not subject to random, suspicionless testing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-2031\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-2031\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 430.1, 411.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In January 2014, an OSSE employee forwarded an email titled \"License Renewal Drug Testing\" to Tracy R. Armstrong, the Director of Human Resources at the River School. The School, where individual plaintiffs Katherine Brebbia and Lauren Walence are both employed, is located in Washington, D.C., and educates children from eighteen months to third grade.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10-11. The OSSE email informed River that it would be required to implement random drug testing \"aligned with CYSHA requirements.\" ECF No. 2-11 (OSSE Email, Jan. 14. 2014). According to the Office, that meant that (1) the School must conduct pre-employment testing through an outside vendor; (2) the School must determine the percentage of employees to be tested; (3) the School must submit a list of all employees to an outside vendor for the random selection of employees to be tested; (4) each quarter, the outside vendor must send a list of those employees to be randomly tested to the School; and (5) the School must notify\n   current employees in writing of the testing procedure before it is implemented.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-2031\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-2031\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   From April 2014 through June 2015, River objected to the random drug-testing requirements announced by OSSE.

G (Nov. 2014 Letter to OSSE); Nancy Mellon Decl., Exh. 5, \u00b6\u00b6 24-25. On June 19, 2015, the D.C. State Superintendent of Education Hanseul Kang provided the School with \"an official explanation ... regarding drug testing by private institutions and lay[ing] out the requirements for full licensing.\" Chiang Decl., Exh. H (June 2015 Kang Letter). This letter clearly stated that child-development facilities must establish pre-employment and random drug testing for all employees, and that enforcement of the testing provisions was \"a requirement for licensure\" of such facilities.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-2031\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In June 2015, the Association of Independent Schools of Greater Washington (AISGW) responded to Superintendent Kang with a letter requesting immediate relief from the random-testing requirement for three of its member schools, including the River School.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 2-15 (June 2015 AISGW Letter). In August 2015, Kang sent back a letter making clear that the AISGW schools would be required to implement the policy. Although she acknowledged that OSSE has previously \"made certain allowances and granted licenses in a manner inconsistent with the law[,]... [t]his approach is not endorsed by OSSE's current leadership,\" and it was the \"policy of the District of Columbia that private, licensed child care providers must engage in drug and alcohol testing for employees.\" ECF No. 2-16 (Aug. 2015 OSSE Letter). Recognizing, however, that it would \"take time for certain facilities to comply with the requirements,\" Kang agreed to extend River's license while it developed \"policies and procedures necessary to comply with the legal provisions around drug and alcohol testing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-2031\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Five months later, on January 11, 2016, the River School received a Notice of Intent to Revoke its child-development-center license.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 2-17 (Notice of Revocation).

Their Complaint alleges that requiring child-development facilities such as the River School to implement a random drug- and alcohol-testing policy is a violation of (1) the Fourth Amendment and (2) the District of Columbia's Administrative Procedure Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 52-56. The following month, Defendants requested a 90-day stay of proceedings pending legislative review by the D.C. Council.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 12. Plaintiffs agreed to the stay and to withdraw their motion for a preliminary injunction based on the condition that OSSE would not enforce the random-testing requirement during the course of litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 20 (Joint Stipulation and Request for Briefing Schedule). In total, Defendants successfully requested three additional stays of proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minute Orders of Jan. 25, 2017, Apr. 25, 2017, July 24, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In December 2016, while this case was stayed, OSSE published rules implementing CYSHA-including regulations addressing mandatory drug and alcohol testing for licensed child-development facilities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5-A DCMR \u00a7 136. These regulations require testing of employees prior to employment, upon reasonable suspicion, and post-accident, but do not address random, suspicionless testing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-2031\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-2031\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \u00a7 136.3.

According to Plaintiffs, Defendants are estopped from arguing here that employees of child-development facilities occupy \"safety-sensitive\" positions that require them to submit to random, suspicionless drug testing. This line of argument is based off a May 3, 2016, decision by Administrative Law Judge Paul B. Handy in\n   <em>\n    St. Paul's Lutheran Nursery School v. District of Columbia Office of the State Superintendent of Education\n   </em>\n   , which addressed a different challenge to the OSSE drug testing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chiang Decl., Exh. A, Case No. 2015-OSSE-00011,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%2011066279\">\n    2016 WL 11066279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. Office of Admin. Hearings) (May 3, 2016). St. Paul's Lutheran Nursery School initiated the action before the D.C. Office of Administrative\n   Hearings (OAH) after receiving OSSE's notice of intent to revoke the school's child-development-facility license for failure to implement the random-testing requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   OAH Order at 2, 6. AISGW participated in the case by filing an amicus brief in support of St. Paul's and presenting at oral argument.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   After seven months of proceedings and a two-hour administrative hearing on April 22, 2016, ALJ Handy issued a Final Order prohibiting OSSE from revoking St. Paul's license for failure to implement suspicionless drug and alcohol testing. The Order concluded that, \"in order to avoid an unconstitutional result,\" \"the CYSHA ... must be construed in such a manner that teachers and others who come into contact with children are not considered 'safety-sensitive' employees subject to random drug and alcohol testing.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. Three weeks later, OSSE filed a motion with OAH seeking reconsideration of the Final Order, which was subsequently denied on July 28, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD, Exh. L (OAH Order Denying Reconsideration). OSSE then had thirty days to petition for judicial review of that determination in the D.C. Court of Appeals,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D.C. App. R. 15(a)(2), but the Office did not appeal. Plaintiffs argue that, in light of the final OAH Order addressing the constitutional implications of the random, suspicionless testing of child-development-facility employees, Defendants are now estopped from enforcing such a requirement against AISGW schools.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In asserting such a bar, Plaintiffs ask this Court to apply the doctrine of non-mutual offensive collateral estoppel, which may be used where \"a plaintiff seeks to estop a defendant from relitigating issues [that] the defendant previously litigated and lost against another plaintiff.\"\n   <em>\n    Ali Baba Co. v.

They additionally assert that, in order to invoke the doctrine against the District, Plaintiffs must demonstrate \"affirmative misconduct by a government agent.\" Def. Reply at 5.

The ALJ's decision in the negative, according to AISGW, was \"rendered after full adversary proceedings\" that provided the parties with \"a full and fair opportunity to litigate\" and thus should be considered \"binding on OSSE here.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Court begins with the identity of the issues. It is clear that the issue raised and litigated before ALJ Handy is the same as that before this Court-namely, the constitutional implications of allowing child-development-facility teachers to be deemed \"safety-sensitive\" and thus subject to random drug and alcohol testing. The \"dispositive\" question articulated in\n   <em>\n    St. Paul's\n   </em>\n   was whether OSSE could, pursuant to CYSHA, require \"random drug and\n   alcohol testing\" of \"teachers and others who come into contact with children.\" OAH Order at 89. The issue before the Court today is precisely that. Given the breadth of the issue identified as conclusive in the OAH Order, moreover, the age difference between the children enrolled at St. Paul's and those at AISGW schools does not matter much in distinguishing between the two cases. The issue before OAH was not limited to the specific ages of the children at St. Paul's. Rather, that school was seeking re-instatement of its OSSE license-a license that is identical to those held by AISGW schools and that does not distinguish between facilities based on the precise ages of the children they serve.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Reply at 4. ALJ Handy's determination relied in no part upon a reduced need to protect children a year or two older, nor did it suggest that his analysis might differ for younger age groups. The age difference between the respective schools' student populations therefore does not preclude the application of collateral estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The question of whether OSSE-licensed child-development-facility teachers could be subject to random drug tests was, moreover, \"actually litigated,\" as it was \"contested by the parties and submitted for determination by the court.\"\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin v.

Yet while\n   <em>\n    St. Paul's\n   </em>\n   was a challenge to a specific licensing determination, the relief sought here is analogous to that case-namely, that AISGW schools be permitted to retain their licenses without requiring random, suspicionless drug and alcohol testing. It does not seem, therefore, that the distinction in remedies creates a meaningful gulf between the two cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In terms of factors favoring estoppel, Plaintiffs argue that the District had \"every incentive to litigate the\n   <em>\n    St. Paul's\n   </em>\n   proceeding fully,\" particularly given that it could have foreseen additional litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.

Reply at 8-9. The Supreme Court has held that, in certain contexts, the pervasive regulation of a field may result in a diminished expectation of privacy for those operating under such constraints. In\n   <em>\n    Skinner\n   </em>\n   , for instance, it found that the privacy expectations of railroad workers were reduced \"by reason of their participation in an industry that is regulated pervasively to ensure safety.\" 489 U.S. at 627,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12032926\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/602/#p614\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1402\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As the District notes, such facilities must maintain certain classroom ratios and sizes, satisfy healthy and safety standards, and ensure that their staff meet specified professional-development and training requirements. The employees are additionally subject to background checks, fingerprinting, medical examinations, and drug testing prior to employment and must show that they are\n   physically capable of caring for children.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 13-15. Such regulations, Defendants contend, result in a diminished privacy interest. Plaintiffs rejoin that the regulations governing child-development facilities are a far cry from those previously found to reduce privacy interests in the Fourth Amendment context. AISGW argues that these regulations are analogous to those imposed on D.C. public-school teachers and are \"standard for educators,\" and that Defendants cannot show that they \"constitute heavy regulation in the same manner as that faced by railway employees.\" Pl.

This Circuit has made clear that a generalized compelling government interest, without more, does not suffice to justify random, suspicionless searches. That is, \"even where the government asserts important interests, it must still demonstrate an immediate threat to those interests that could not practically be addressed through a suspicion-based approach in order to justify\" a suspicionless policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vilsack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3772080,3884636\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/681/483/\">\n    681 F.3d at 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Reply at 10. Indeed, this Court\n   certainly appreciates the District's efforts to protect young children from potential harm. Yet, as discussed above, a compelling interest is not-standing alone-sufficient to impose a random, suspicionless search regime. The inquiry must be into not only the\n   <em>\n    sincerity\n   </em>\n   of the concern, but also its \"immediacy or gravity.\"\n   <em>\n    Transportation Inst.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063031\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/727/648/#p655\">\n    727 F.Supp. at 657\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Plaintiffs assert that Defendants have not demonstrated such urgency or specificity with respect to their alleged safety interest. AISGW's argument on this point is premised in large part upon the District's failure to present evidence that any child at any licensed child-development facility has been harmed or even endangered because of drug or alcohol use.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Reply at 10. In response, the District states that \"[d]ecreased awareness and poor judgment at a child development facility\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   prove fatal to child safety.\" MTD at 21 (emphasis added). Yet, in support of this position, Defendants can muster only nationwide statistics and nebulous assertions of risk.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD at 20, 27. Unable to show\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   of substance abuse among childcare providers, the District simply states that \"[i]t is well-documented that drug use has increased in the United States\" and that \"[u]ndoubtedly, drug use may lead to decreased awareness and poor judgment.\" MTD at 20. Such generalized statements do not a concrete government interest make. The Court does not dispute-nor could anyone-the premise that drug use may cause impairment, but it finds thoroughly unconvincing the relevance of such a broad, commonsense proposition to the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Faced with a dearth of actual evidence, Defendants fall back on the position that they need not make any such showing. According to the District, \"[A] particularized or pervasive drug problem\" is not required for the government to be \"allow[ed] ... to conduct suspicionless drug testing.\" MTD at 25. Indeed, Defendants are correct that the Supreme Court has stated that \"[a] demonstrated problem of drug abuse\" is \"not in all cases necessary to the validity of a testing regime.\"\n   <em>\n    Chandler\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651779\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/305/#p309\">\n    520 U.S. at 319\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651779\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/305/#p309\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

According to Plaintiffs, this delay in implementation indicates that there was no \"immediate threat\" motivating the random testing. If the risk to children in these facilities is as compelling and urgent as Defendants maintain, Plaintiffs argue, then why did they not implement testing as soon as the statute was passed? According to Defendants, the answer is that \"[t]he timing of OSSE's enforcement of CYSHA's random testing requirement does not negate the need for random testing.\" MTD at 25. That may be so, but such a substantial delay certainly does not support the District's position that nursery-school teachers pose a grave and immediate threat to the children in their care. As this Circuit held in\n   <em>\n    Vilsack\n   </em>\n   , \"[T]he [agency's] long-delayed action ... belie[s] the conclusion that there is so serious a staff drug problem ... as to present 'special needs' requiring suspicionless intrusion on all employees.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3772080,3884636\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/681/483/\">\n    681 F.3d at 497\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs note that Defendants declined to appeal the decision in\n   <em>\n    St. Paul's\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 12. As discussed above, the OAH Final Order in\n   <em>\n    St. Paul's\n   </em>\n   resulted in the reinstatement of that nursery school's license,\n   <em>\n    without\n   </em>\n   random and suspicionless drug and alcohol testing. The fact that the District decided not to appeal that determination, according to AISGW, is yet another indicator that teachers do not pose \"an imminent threat to children enrolled at nursery schools licensed by OSSE.\" Reply at 11. St. Paul's is licensed under the same provisions as the Plaintiffs' institutions, and it is certainly germane that Defendants declined to appeal the OAH decision allowing that school to care for infants and toddlers without random, suspicionless testing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In sum, the Court finds that although the desire to protect the District's youngest citizens is certainly a sincere and serious government interest, \"[t]he lack of evidence\n   ... coupled with the speculative nature of the risk\" means that Defendants do not demonstrate a level of immediacy or concreteness so as to tip the scale sharply in their favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vilsack\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3772080,3884636\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/681/483/\">\n    681 F.3d at 498\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   b.

In evaluating the practicability of a suspicion-based regime, courts have often looked to whether it would be \"feasible to subject [employees] or their work-product to the kind of day-to-day scrutiny that would appear necessary in order for their supervisory observation to be effective.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Fed'n of Fed.

Cir. 1989). Here, AISGW asserts that its teachers are subject to such observation, particularly when the District's regulations require that nursery-school teachers work in close proximity and under supervision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Reply at 12. Defendants respond that, although the regulations may\n   <em>\n    require\n   </em>\n   such levels of interaction among colleagues and supervisors, they do not\n   <em>\n    know\n   </em>\n   that such environments are actually in place at AISGW schools.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 25-2, \u00b6 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In doing so, the District attempts to create a disputed issue of fact, alleging that it needs further information in order to assess the opportunities for observation in AISGW-school classrooms. Yet speculation as to the schools' non-compliance with District regulations does not protect Defendants from summary judgment here. Indeed, the District appears to\n   <em>\n    rely\n   </em>\n   upon the existence of and compliance with these precise regulations earlier in its briefing, when it argues that nursery-school teachers have a diminished expectation of privacy in part because \"child development facilities are heavily regulated,\" including the requirement \"that they maintain specific adult-to-child ratios and group sizes ... and ensure that [ ] staff satisfy specified professional development and training requirements on safety.\" MTD at 14. To cast such regulations as, on one hand, sufficient to reduce teachers' expectations of privacy but, on the other, irrelevant to the practicalities of their working conditions seems somewhat disingenuous. The Court notes, moreover, that OSSE has the capacity to verify compliance with its own regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   5-A DCMR \u00a7\u00a7 111.1, 111.5, 111.6.

This line of argument is somewhat odd, given that neither side disputes that child-development-facility staff are able to monitor the children in their classroom. There would seem to be minimal, if any, added burden in observing an adult co-worker if one is able to supervise multiple toddlers. The Court therefore concludes that it would, in fact, be feasible to subject nursery-school teachers to a level of observation consistent with a suspicion-based search regime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Am.

As to the latter, it finds that the District's interest does not rise to the level of immediacy or concreteness needed to justify the random, suspicionless testing of nursery-school teachers. While it does not doubt that Defendants' policy is a sincere attempt to protect infants and toddlers cared for in the District, the Court's holding reflects the principle that preventing the invasion of personal-privacy rights is \"among the highest responsibilities of the federal judiciary.\"\n   <em>\n    Bangert v. Hodel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7392701\" index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/705/643/#p655\">\n    705 F.Supp. 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 655 (D.D.C. 1989). Charged with this duty, the Court determines that nursery-school teachers such as Plaintiffs cannot be subjected to random, suspicionless searches as a condition of their employment. The Court therefore holds as a matter of law that OSSE's testing requirement \"does not fit within the closely guarded category of constitutionally permissible suspicionless searches,\" and it will thus grant Plaintiffs' Motion.\n   <em>\n    Chandler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651779\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/305/#p309\">\n    520 U.S. at 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651779\" index=\"154\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/305/#p309\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1295\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
