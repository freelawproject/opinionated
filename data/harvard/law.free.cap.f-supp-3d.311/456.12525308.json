When a waterway is thus blocked, even the potential for commercial maritime activity is lost and it becomes non-navigable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Tundidor v.

While it may indeed be the case that commercial traffic in that area is sparse or nonexistent and that \"there is almost no potential for commercial boats to be tied to [the] dock,\" (Docket No. 10 at 3), the fact remains that such potential exists. At the time of the incident, Plaintiffs' vessel was tied to the dock of Villa 9 of Isla San Marcos in Humacao, Puerto Rico, a waterway in Palmas del Mar that leads into the sea. (Docket No. 5-1 \u00b6 20). Commercial vessels, should they wish to, could use the area for trade or travel. The waterway runs from the docks into the ocean, meaning it is capable of functioning as an interstate highway for commerce. There is no need for present, actual commercial activity; it is enough that it\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   occur. Because there is potential for the waterway at issue to be used in such a manner, it is navigable for admiralty jurisdiction purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Relationship to Traditional Maritime Activity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   As for whether the tort bears some relationship to traditional maritime activity, the Court must first \"assess the general features of the type of incident involved to determine whether the incident has a potentially disruptive impact on maritime commerce.\"\n   <em>\n    Grubart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1334726\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/527/#p534\">\n    513 U.S. at 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1334726\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/527/#p534\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Second, the Court \"must determine whether the general character of the activity giving rise to the\n   incident shows a substantial relationship to traditional maritime activity.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1334726\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/527/#p534\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In deciding whether the incident had a potentially disruptive impact on maritime commerce, the Supreme Court anchored its analysis \"not on the specific facts at hand but on whether the 'general features' of the incident were 'likely to disrupt commercial activity.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1334726\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/527/#p534\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1334726\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/527/#p534\">\n    at 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1334726\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/527/#p534\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, Plaintiffs do not find safe harbor in their argument that, simply because their claim involves only non-commercial vessels tied to a private dock, admiralty jurisdiction does not exist. (Docket No. 10 at 5). While it may be the case that the only boats involved in the incident happened to be pleasure boats, \"[t]he jurisdictional inquiry does not turn on the actual effects on maritime commerce ... nor does it turn on the particular facts of the incident in this case.\"\n   <em>\n    Sisson v.

While most of the boats in the area may have been pleasure crafts, had there been a commercial vessel nearby, the possibility that it would have been impacted in such conditions is quite high. Again, the focus is not on \"the specific facts at hand\" but rather on \"whether the 'general features' of the incident were 'likely to disrupt commercial activity.' \"\n   <em>\n    Grubart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1334726\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/527/#p534\">\n    513 U.S. at 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1334726\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/527/#p534\">\n    115 S.Ct. 1043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendants argue that a collision between pleasure boats moored at private docks in a navigable waterway is clearly substantially related to \"traditional maritime activity.\" (Docket No. 15 at 8). Plaintiffs take a different tack, contending that because the vessels in question were all non-commercial pleasure crafts tied to private docks, there was no impact on actual or possible maritime commerce, and thus admiralty jurisdiction is inappropriate here. (Docket No. 10 at 3). In light of the facts and relevant case law, Plaintiffs' argument flounders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The need for maritime regulations that provide predictability and uniformity means that both commercial and pleasure vessels must be governed by the same rules.\n   <em>\n    Foremost Ins.

(Docket No. 10 at 6). This argument misses the mark. Even if federal jurisdiction is not exclusive, it is still proper. Simply because jurisdiction exists to hear the case in state court does not mean that it may\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   be heard in state court. \"The rationale for removal is that defendants as well as plaintiffs should have the option to choose federal court for cases within the federal jurisdiction. That jurisdiction is intended to protect both parties, and therefore, both parties should have access to it.\" JOSEPH W. GLANNON, EXAMPLES AND EXPLANATIONS- CIVIL PROCEDURE 115-16 (5th ed. 2003).

In their motion to remand, Plaintiffs requested attorney's fees and costs, arguing that Defendants \"definitely lacked [an] objectively reasonable basis\" for removal. (Docket No. 10 at 7). As explained above, Defendants' removal was objectively reasonable, and indeed, was proper because original federal jurisdiction exists here. Thus, the Court, within its discretion, declines to award fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
