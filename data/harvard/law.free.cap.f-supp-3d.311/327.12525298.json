DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The plaintiff challenges three aspects of GSA's response to the FOIA request at issue: (1) the adequacy of GSA's search, Pl.'s Opp'n at 6; Pl.'s Reply at 1-3, ECF No. 28; (2) GSA's failure to produce \"attachments to emails exchanged between GSA and the\" PTT, Pl.'s Reply at 3; Pl.'s Opp'n at 8-9; and (3) the sufficiency of GSA's explanations for redactions under Exemption 5 and Exemption 6, Pl.'s Opp'n at 17-29; Pl.'s Reply at 6-14. These issues are addressed\n   <em>\n    seriatim\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. GSA'S SEARCH WAS INADEQUATE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   GSA conferred with the plaintiff and advised via email on July 26, 2017, that the agency would search for \"all records reflecting communications (including emails, telephone call logs, calendar entries, meeting agendas, or any other records reflecting communications)\" between GSA and eight identified PTT members as well as for certain search terms. Def.'s Mot., Ex. D at 1, Email from GSA's Duane Smith to AO's Cerissa Cafasso (July 26, 2017). Contrary to GSA's assurance, however, the plaintiff contends that GSA failed to search \"telephone call logs, calendar entries, stand-alone electronic records (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , records that were created electronically but never emailed), or paper records,\" and further that \"GSA has systems of records that potentially contain responsive records, and yet the agency has entered no evidence that it searched those systems or an adequate\n   alternative.\" Pl.'s Reply at 2. GSA does not dispute that no search was conducted of call logs, meeting agendas, or paper records, but apparently contends that a search for these forms of records \"goes far beyond what is required by the FOIA,\" Def.'s Opp'n at 3, and that the search performed was \"reasonably tailored\" to the request \"based on its knowledge of its [own] practices,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   At the outset, GSA provides conflicting information regarding whether calendar entries were searched. The agency affidavit states that, in searches of the type performed in this case, \"calendar logs\" are searched. Lewis Decl. \u00b6 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem.

Nevertheless, while records of emailed calendar invitations were produced, no actual calendar entries or logs were reflected in GSA's production. Thus, based on this record, the plaintiff raises the reasonable suspicion \"that the agency almost certainly did not actually search calendars.\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 7. GSA has been silent in explaining the presence of calendar invitation emails in its production, without concomitant calendar entries or logs, despite the agency's promise to search for and produce responsive, non-exempt calendar logs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n at 4.

GSA has withheld the GSA attorney's response as privileged, despite the fact that this email chain indicates that the attorney's \"information\" was relayed to a third party. In this context, the plaintiff rightly asks: \"How was Mr. Hodnett's first inquiry considered a solicitation of legal advice?

Cafasso Decl., Ex. 2 at 18, Email from GSA's Seth Greenfeld to GSA's Neil Skidmore and GSA's Lennard Loewentritt (Jan. 5, 2017).
