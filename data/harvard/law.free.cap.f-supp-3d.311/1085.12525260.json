The motion is opposed by the nine remaining defendants, Certain London Market Insurance Companies (\"London Market Insurers\"), National Indemnity Company (\"National Indemnity\"), Westchester Surplus Lines Insurance Company (\"Westchester\"), Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London (\"Lloyd's\"), ACE American Insurance Company (\"ACE American\"), AXIS Surplus Insurance Company (US) (\"AXIS\"), Lloyd's Syndicate 0382 HDU (\"Syndicate 382\"), Aspen Specialty Insurance Company (\"Aspen\"), and Landmark American Insurance Company (\"Landmark\") (collectively the \"Nine Insurers\"). The motion is fully briefed and ready for review. For the following reasons, the Court concludes that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over this action, and therefore must grant Foresight's motion to remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This action was filed in the Circuit Court of the City of St. Louis on August 4, 2017. The plaintiff is Foresight, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of Delaware with a principal place of business in the City of St. Louis, Missouri. Foresight, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, owns the Deer Run Mine, a \"longwall\" coal mine located in Hillsboro, Illinois (the \"Hillsboro mine\"). On or about March 26, 2015, the Hillsboro mine was evacuated due to a spontaneous combustion event. Mining operations have been suspended since that time pursuant to an order issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Foresight purchased insurance coverage for the Hillsboro mine in a complex arrangement involving a \"Quota Share Property Damage / Time Element Policy\" (the \"Main Policy\") with multiple layers of coverage. Fourteen separate insurers each issued a policy with unique market reference and/or policy numbers. Five of the insurers, including remaining defendants Lloyd's, Westchester, ACE American, and AXIS, provided insurance policies to Foresight in the primary layer, which attach to the Main Policy. Four insurers, including remaining defendants London Market Insurers and National Indemnity, subscribed to the Main Policy and issued quota share primary policies, sharing a portion of the risk according to a fixed percentage. Five insurers, including remaining defendants Syndicate 0382, Aspen, and Landmark, issued\n   quota share policies in the excess layer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the time of the spontaneous combustion event, the Hillsboro mine was insured for \"all perils\" of \"direct physical loss of or direct physical damage to the Property Insured\" resulting from an \"Occurrence,\" as well as business interruption costs. Foresight claims that as a result of the spontaneous combustion event, it has incurred in excess of $300 million in direct property losses or damage, business interruption, and other losses and costs. The insurers have provided advances to Foresight in the amount of $43,331,773.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 15, 2017, Foresight filed a Corrected Petition in the Circuit Court for the City of St. Louis, asserting state law claims for declaratory judgment, breach of contract, and statutory vexatious refusal to pay a claim against all fourteen of the Hillsboro mine's insurers: Chubb Bermuda Insurance Ltd. (formerly known as ACE Bermuda Insurance Ltd.) (\"Chubb\"), Ironshore Insurance Limited, Markel Bermuda Limited, Allied World Assurance Company Ltd., Montpelier Reinsurance Ltd., London Market Insurers, National Indemnity, Lloyd's, Westchester, ACE American, AXIS, Syndicate 0382, Aspen, and Landmark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 18, 2017, defendant Chubb removed the action to this Court asserting that federal question jurisdiction exists pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20202\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 205 (2012) (\"FAA\"), as the insurance policy it issued to Foresight contained an arbitration provision mandating that any disputes or controversies arising under the policy be arbitrated in London, England under the Arbitration Act of 1996 of the United Kingdom. Chubb asserted that its policy's arbitration provision is an international arbitration agreement subject to a multinational treaty, the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (the \"Convention\"), 21 U.S.T. 2517,\n   <em>\n    adopted\n   </em>\n   June 10, 1958 (entered into force with respect to the United States Dec. 29, 1970).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Specifically, Chubb's Notice of Removal cited Section 202 of the FAA, which provides that \"[a]n arbitration agreement or arbitral award arising out of a legal relationship, whether contractual or not, which is considered as commercial ... falls under the Convention\" unless the agreement arises out of a relationship \"entirely between citizens of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20202\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 205 of the FAA authorizes the removal to federal court of state court actions involving an arbitration agreement that falls under the Convention, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Where the subject matter of an action or proceeding pending in a State court relates to an arbitration agreement or award falling under the Convention, the defendant or the defendants may, at any time before the trial thereof, remove such action or proceeding to the district court of the United States for the district and division embracing the place where the action or proceeding is pending. The procedure for removal of causes otherwise provided by law shall apply, except that the ground for removal provided in this section need not appear on the face of the complaint but may be shown in the petition for removal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20205\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . No other defendant joined in Chubb's Notice of Removal or filed a separate notice of removal, and the Notice of Removal asserted that the consent of other defendants was not required under the Convention. (Doc. 1 at 4, \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Foresight filed the instant motion to remand on September 18, 2017. On September 26, 2017, Foresight, Chubb, Ironshore Insurance Limited, Markel Bermuda Limited, Allied World Assurance Company Ltd., and Montpelier Reinsurance Ltd. filed a Joint Motion to Stay or Defer Plaintiff's\n   Motion to Remand (Doc. 30), after these defendants obtained an ex parte anti-suit injunction from the High Court of Justice, Queen's Bench Division, Commercial Court in London, England, prohibiting Foresight from litigating this action any further against those five defendants based on the London arbitration agreement in their policies. On January 16, 2018, Foresight dismissed with prejudice all claims against these five defendants. Foresight did not dismiss its claims against the Nine Insurers, and the motion to remand remains pending as to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In determining whether a claim \"arises under\" federal law, courts must be \"mindful that the nature of federal removal jurisdiction-restricting as it does the power of the states to resolve controversies in their own courts-requires strict construction of the legislation permitting removal.\"\n   <em>\n    Nichols v.

Policy Language\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Each of the insurance policies between Foresight and the Nine Insurers (collectively the \"Policies\") contain identical language regarding arbitration in all material respects and provide that the polices are governed by Missouri law.

Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Foresight moves to remand, arguing that the case was improperly removed and must be remanded to state court because the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction. Foresight asserts that the Court's federal question and removal jurisdiction depend on the applicability of the Convention Act, which it argues does not apply here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Foresight states that Missouri law, the law governing the Policies, prohibits mandatory arbitration clauses in insurance policies, and argues that Missouri law \"reverse preempts\" the Convention in light of the McCarran-Ferguson Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=15%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201011\">\n    15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 1015 (2012). Foresight contends that the arbitration clauses in the Nine Insurers' policies are invalid and unenforceable under the Missouri Uniform Arbitration Act, \u00a7 435.350 of the Missouri Revised Statutes. The statute provides in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   A written agreement to submit any existing controversy to arbitration or a provision in a written contract,\n   <em>\n    except contracts of insurance\n   </em>\n   and contracts of adhesion, to submit to arbitration any\n   controversy thereafter arising between the parties is valid, enforceable and irrevocable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mo.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20435.350\">\n    Mo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 435.350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Nine Insurers oppose the motion to remand, asserting that federal question jurisdiction exists by virtue of the Convention, \"an international treaty guaranteeing the reciprocal enforcement of international arbitration agreements and conferring exclusive jurisdiction in the federal courts.\" (Doc. 27 at 3.) The Nine Insurers assert that the Convention supersedes both Missouri's anti-arbitration law and the McCarran-Ferguson Act, and therefore this Court has original jurisdiction over the action brought by Foresight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Application of the Convention Act\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Convention is a multinational treaty. Congress amended Chapter 2 of the FAA in 1970 to aid in the enforcement of the Convention,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20201\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 208 (2012). In this Memorandum and Order, the Court refers to Chapter 2 of the FAA as the \"Convention Act,\" to distinguish the implementing legislation from the treaty itself, the Convention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Convention Act permits removal of state court actions involving arbitration agreements that fall under its purview. The Convention Act applies to an \"arbitration agreement or arbitral award arising out of a legal relationship, whether contractual or not, which is considered as commercial\" unless the agreement arises out of a relationship \"entirely between citizens of the United States.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20202\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 202\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Foresight argues in its reply memorandum that the policies issued by the Nine Insurers are not \" 'international agreements' containing 'international arbitration provisions' \" subject to the Convention Act. (Doc. 33 at 5.) Foresight contends the case should be remanded \"for this reason alone\" because the Nine Insurers have \"failed to prove that each is a foreign citizen\" and \"have submitted no evidence of their citizenship.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   This contention is incorrect. If the Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action based on Chubb's removal under the Convention Act, then it would have supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) over claims concerning policies that are not subject to the Convention Act, as these are part of the same case or controversy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ESAB Group, Inc. v.

As in\n   <em>\n    Safety National\n   </em>\n   , the Nine Insurers contend that the Convention itself, not the Convention Act, supersedes the Missouri anti-arbitration law and the McCarran-Ferguson\n   Act. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 27 at 3, 7.) The Nine Insurers argue that (1) the McCarran-Ferguson Act prohibits an \"Act of Congress\" from invalidating, impairing, or superseding a state law that regulates the business of insurance, (2) the Convention is not an Act of Congress, and (3) because the Convention is not an Act of Congress, the McCarran-Ferguson Act does not apply to arbitration agreements in insurance policies issued by foreign insurers. Integrating the Fourth Circuit's reasoning in\n   <em>\n    ESAB Group\n   </em>\n   , the Nine Insurers also argue that the McCarran-Ferguson Act's scope is limited to legislation within the domestic realm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The decisions on which the Nine Insurers rely,\n   <em>\n    Safety National\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    ESAB Group\n   </em>\n   , offer entirely different rationales for the results they reach. As discussed above, the Circuit Courts of Appeals that have addressed the issue have made conflicting rulings on the interplay between the Convention, the Convention Act, and the McCarran-Ferguson Act. The Court is not persuaded by the Nine Insurers's argument and the Fifth Circuit majority's holding in\n   <em>\n    Safety National\n   </em>\n   that courts are to construe the Convention itself, not the Convention Act, in determining whether the McCarran-Ferguson Act provides reverse-preemptive effect to state insurance law. The dissenting opinion in\n   <em>\n    Safety National\n   </em>\n   convincingly explicates why the majority's reasoning in that case is flawed. The dissent also persuasively explains why rules of statutory construction require the plain language of the McCarran-Ferguson Act to be followed, whether or not Congress intended or considered that Acts of Congress implementing treaties be subject to the statute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   This interpretation contradicts the plain language of the McCarran-Ferguson Act.\n   <em>\n    In the Act, Congress prescribed a clear-statement rule for federal statutes\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    affecting the business of insurance: uncertain provisions are to be construed not to\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    preempt state insurance law\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. Dep't of Treasury v.
