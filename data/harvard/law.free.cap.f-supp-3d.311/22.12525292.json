Manafort Jr., who has been indicted in two criminal cases brought by the Office of Special Counsel, filed a civil complaint against the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\"), Special Counsel Robert S. Mueller III, and Acting Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein, alleging that the Department exceeded its authority when it issued the order appointing the Special Counsel (the \"Appointment Order\"), and that the Special Counsel exceeded his authority as well. Compl. [Dkt. # 1]. Manafort has refined his claims since the case was originally filed, and in this civil case, he is only asking the Court to enjoin future actions against him under the Appointment Order. But as the D.C. Circuit has made clear, \"[p]rospective defendants cannot, by bringing ancillary equitable proceedings, circumvent federal criminal procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    Deaver v.

Therefore, defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint will be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Count I of the complaint, brought against DOJ and the Acting Attorney General, alleges that the Acting Attorney General issued an Appointment Order that did not comport with the applicable DOJ regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 50-59;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.4\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 600.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, according to Manafort, the grant of authority to the Special Counsel was an\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   action on the part of the Acting Attorney General in violation of\n   the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 50-59. Count II, brought only against the Special Counsel, alleges that even if the Appointment Order was valid, the Special Counsel exceeded the scope of the authority he was given when he indicted Manafort, because the charges did not arise out of the investigation into the 2016 presidential election and the allegations of Russian interference in the election.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.4\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.4\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 60-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.

They argue first that Manafort may not bring a federal civil action to interfere with his ongoing criminal prosecution. Defs.' Mem. at 11-18. Next, they contend that Count I should be dismissed for three reasons: (1) the APA may only be invoked by claimants who do not have an adequate remedy at law, and Manafort has such a remedy in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure; (2) the Special Counsel regulations do not create legal rights that can be enforced through any lawsuit, including a civil suit brought under the APA; and (3) there has been no final agency action for purposes of the APA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.4\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.4\">\n    at 11-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

And on March 27, 2018, Manafort filed a similar motion to dismiss the indictment pending in the Eastern District of Virginia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

While there is obvious overlap among the issues raised in the instant civil action and in the motions to dismiss the criminal cases, this opinion will not address, and should not be read as expressing any opinion about, the merits of those motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In any event, Manafort has significantly narrowed the scope of his civil case to reduce that overlap. In his opposition to the pending motion to dismiss, plaintiff appeared to back away from what seemed to be an unambiguous request that the Court deem the indictment to be invalid. When the complaint was filed, it alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   The indictment raises stale allegations DOJ must have been aware of for nearly a decade; they are not matters that \"arose from the investigation\" into the 2016 election and alleged collusion with the Russian government.

Mr. Downing: We are, Your Honor.\"). Thus, the only claim that is pending for purposes of this motion is Count I against the Department of Justice and the Acting Attorney General under the APA, and plaintiff has emphasized that with that claim, he seeks only \"prospective relief: an order declaring invalid the\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   Appointment Order and enjoining the Special Counsel's future\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   exercise of authority under that Order.\" Pl.'s Opp. at 11;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 7:22-25;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.4\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20600.4\">\n    at 8:21-23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Moreover, counsel further clarified at the hearing that plaintiff is not seeking an order setting aside the Appointment Order in its entirety; rather, he is only seeking to invalidate paragraph (b)(ii), which grants the Special Counsel the authority to investigate \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\" Tr. at 9:12-10:9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. A to Compl. [Dkt. # 1-1] (\"Appointment Order\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   But a civil case is not the appropriate vehicle for taking issue with what a prosecutor has done in the past or where he might be headed in the future. It is a sound and well-established principle that a court should not exercise its equitable powers to interfere with or enjoin an ongoing criminal investigation when the defendant will have the opportunity to challenge any defects in the prosecution in the trial court or on direct appeal. Therefore, the Court finds that this civil complaint must be dismissed. The conclusion that this is the necessary outcome is reinforced by the requirement in the sole statute that plaintiff invokes-the Administrative Procedure Act-that a claimant may only seek relief under the Act if he lacks an adequate remedy at law. Plaintiffs claims about the legitimacy of the Appointment Order can be addressed in his criminal cases in accordance with the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, so the Court should not reach the merits of those claims here. Moreover, given the way plaintiff has re-characterized and altered his civil complaint to overcome these obstacles to the Court's exercise of its jurisdiction, it is not at all clear that there is any ripe, justiciable controversy left in this lawsuit for the Court to resolve, and there are certainly no allegations of impending irreparable harm that would justify injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I.
