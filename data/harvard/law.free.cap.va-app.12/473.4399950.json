We conclude that the evidence was insufficient to support the conviction. In doing so, we hold that an imitation controlled substance, as defined by. Code \u00a7 18.2-247(B), must be one which has a disposition or tendency to be misused.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">On September 29, 1988, the defendant sold a small vial of white crystal powder to an undercover police officer for $20. The defendant told the officer \u201cthat it was really good and that it was all rocks.\u201d The officer testified that the substance \u201clooked exactly like rock cocaine.\u201d However, the State Laboratory analyzed the substance and reported that it was not a controlled substance. The lab report is silent as to the identity of the white powder in the vial and the Commonwealth offered no evidence at trial to identify the substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">In finding the defendant guilty of distributing an imitation controlled substance, the trial judge stated that he believed the Commonwealth had proved that the white powder was \u201ca substance that is subject to abuse.\u201d The trial judge said that he thought \u201ca substance which in its appearance indicates that it is a drug and which, if distributed, shows people that they can take the drug safely when in fact they cannot\u201d constitutes abuse of a substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">Any person who distributes an imitation controlled substance is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. Code \u00a7 18.2-248(C). An \u201cimitation controlled substance\u201d is any substance which: (1) is not a controlled substance; (2) is \u201csubject to abuse\u201d; and (3) by express or implied representations, purports to act like a controlled substance as a stimulant or recognized for use in that par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>ticular formulation for any purpose other than for such stimulant or depressant effect. Code \u00a7 18.2-247(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">The parties disagree over the meaning of the phrase \u201csubject to abuse.\u201d The appellant contends the Commonwealth, by failing to establish the identity of the substance, failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the substance involved in this case was \u201csubject to abuse.\u201d The Attorney General argues that \u201csubject to abuse\u201d means no more than that a substance can be ingested by means similar to those means by which a controlled substance can be ingested. In other words, if a substance can be eaten, inhaled or injected, it is, according to the Attorney General, \u201csubject to abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">The Attorney General\u2019s argument, however, broadens the commonly accepted meaning of these words. \u201cSubject to\u201d means \u201chaving a disposition or tendency; liable (to).\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary </em>(2d College ed. 1970). \u201cAbuse\u201d means \u201cto use wrongly; misuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The words of a statute must be given their plain meaning. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lukhard, </em>229 Va. 316, 321, 330 S.E.2d 84, 87 (1985). Therefore, before a substance may be an imitation controlled substance, it must be one which has a disposition or tendency to be misused or is liable to being misused.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">No evidence was introduced as to the nature of the substance which the defendant sold. It could have been sugar, flour, or some inert substance with no particular propensity for misuse. On this record, the evidence was insufficient to establish that the substance had a disposition or tendency to being misused. Therefore, the Commonwealth failed to prove that the defendant distributed an imitation controlled substance as defined by Code \u00a7 18.2-247(B). For this reason, the appellant\u2019s conviction is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">Coleman, J., and Cole, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b523-10\"> Judge Cole participated in the hearing and decision of this case prior to the effective date of his retirement on April 30, 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
