Carter.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b590-10\">Opinion</p>\n<author id=\"b590-11\">PER CURIAM</author>\n<p id=\"AqO\">Upon reviewing the record and briefs of the parties, we conclude that the appeal is without merit. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the circuit court. Rule 5A:27.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">The Virginia Employment Commission awarded unemployment benefits to Lisa M. Carter, mailing its decision on June 19, 1990. G. S. Foods, Inc., Carter\u2019s former employer, filed a petition for review with the circuit court on July 10, 1990. Citing Code \u00a7 60.2-625(A), the circuit court dismissed the petition as untimely. G. S. Foods appeals, arguing (1) that the petition was timely filed, and (2) that if the petition was untimely, the circuit court could extend the time for filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-13\">Code \u00a7 60.2-622(B)(l) reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-14\">Any decision of the [Virginia Employment] Commission, upon a hearing on appeal, shall become final ten days after the date of notification or mailing, and judicial review shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>be permitted the claimant or any interested party claiming to be aggrieved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Code \u00a7 60.2-625 (A) reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">Within ten days after the decision of the Commission upon a hearing pursuant to \u00a7 60.2-622 has become final, any party aggrieved who seeks judicial review shall commence an action in the circuit court of the county or city in which the individual who filed the claim was last employed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The circuit court concluded that G. S. Foods\u2019 petition was required to be filed by July 9, 1990, or twenty days from the date of mailing. G. S. Foods contends that the circuit court\u2019s decision ignores the terminology \u201cnotification or mailing\u201d in Code \u00a7 60.2-622(B)(1). Rather, the argument goes, \u201cnotification\u201d means receipt of the mailing. Since G. S. Foods filed its petition within twenty days of the receipt of the mailing, it contends that the petition was timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">G. S. Foods\u2019 construction of the statute would render useless the inclusion of the word \u201cmailing.\u201d The date of receipt of the mailing would always follow the date of mailing. Accordingly, the latter of the two dates, i.e., the date of receipt of the mailing, would always trigger the running of the time period for filing a petition. If the legislature had so intended this interpretation of the word \u201cnotification,\u201d it would not have been necessary to include the word \u201cmailing\u201d in the statute.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-9\">It is a well established rule of construction that a statute ought to be interpreted in such a manner that it may have effect, and not found to be vain and elusive. Every interpretation that leads to an absurdity ought to be rejected. It is our duty to give effect to the wording of the statute, and allow the legislative intention to be followed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-10\"><em>Barnett </em>v. <em>D. L. Bromwell, Inc., </em>6 Va. App. 30, 34, 366 S.E.2d 271, 273 (1988) (quoting <em>McFadden </em>v. <em>McNalton, </em>193 Va. 455, 461, 69 S.E.2d 445, 449 (1952)).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">G. S. Foods also contends that the circuit court erred when it concluded that the filing period was jurisdictional, and thus, it did not have the authority or ability to extend the period. The circuit court was correct. Code \u00a7 60.2-625(A) states that a party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>seeking judicial review \u201cshall commence an action\u201d within ten days after the Commission\u2019s decision becomes final. \u201cIt is well settled that [w]hen the word \u2018shall\u2019 appears in a statute it is generally used in an imperative or mandatory sense.\u201d <em>Mayo </em>v. <em>Department of Commerce, 4 </em>Va. App. 520, 523, 358 S.E.2d 759, 761 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">For the reasons stated, we affirm the decision of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">Benton, J., Coleman, J., and Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
