He contends that Code \u00a7 54.1-2938, requiring chiropractors to use the word chiropractor with their name if they use the title doctor, and Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A) (12), prohibiting the publication of a claim of superiority, are unconstitutional. We hold that Code \u00a7 54.1-2938 does not violate the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment and that, although Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(12) is not unconstitutionally vague, its application to the appellant impinged upon his right to free speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">The Virginia Board of Medicine held a formal administrative hearing to determine (1) whether the appellant\u2019s business card violated Code \u00a7 54.1-2938 which requires \u201c[chiropractors using the title \u2018Doctor\u2019 or \u2018Dr.\u2019 in connection with their names [to] also use the word \u2018Chiropractor\u2019 or \u2018D.C.,\u2019 \u201d and (2) whether the appellant\u2019s advertisement, published in the Yellow Pages of a local telephone directory, violated Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(12) which prohibits the publishing of an advertisement by a practitioner of the healing arts containing \u201ca claim of superiority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">The appellant\u2019s business card reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-8\">TIDEWATER CHIROPRACTIC CENTER</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afz\">Preventive Family Health Care</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"As6\">DR. JOHN T. DOTTI</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b785-10\">(phone number and address omitted). The appellant testified at the hearing that every time he handed out the card, the recipient looked at it and responded, \u201cOh, so you\u2019re a chiropractor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b785-11\">The appellant\u2019s Yellow Pages\u2019 advertisement states that the appellant is a \u201cSports Medicine Specialist.\u201d In support of his position that he is a sports medicine specialist, the appellant testified that: he took a variety of courses at Texas Chiropractic College related to sports medicine; he participated in a sports medicine program while attending chiropractic college; he is a former member of the ACA Council on Sports Medicine; he has served on a voluntary basis as a staff physician with college and private athletic teams; he was formerly associated with Gold\u2019s Gym; and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>attended two different seminars on sports medicine in 1986, one in Virginia Beach and one in Florida. The appellant testified that he was not certified in the area of sports medicine because \u201c[t]he Medical Board will not certify chiropractors.\u201d He also testified that he received Continuing Chiropractic Education credit for the seminar in Virginia Beach and \u201cwould have received [credits] from the State of Florida if [he] had applied for them, but since [Virginia] doesn\u2019t recognize such procedures, [he] didn\u2019t apply for them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">The Board found the appellant in violation of both statutes and, in addition to reprimanding him, ordered him to cease and desist from advertising in violation of the statutes. On appeal, the circuit court found that the appellant failed to demonstrate an error of law and affirmed the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">\n<em>I. THE BUSINESS CARD</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">In Virginia, if a chiropractor uses the title \u201cDoctor\u201d in connection with his or her name, he or she is required to also use the word \u201cChiropractor\u201d or \u201cD.C.\u201d with his or her name.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Code \u00a7 54.1-2938. In support of its conclusion that the appellant was in violation of this statute, the Board found that the appellant had used a business card since 1987 in which \u201cDr.\u201d was used in connection with his name without the words \u201cchiropractor\u201d or \u201cD.C.\u201d The appellant argues that this conclusion is erroneous because: (1) he is in factual compliance with the statute, and (2) the statute violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment by treating chiropractors differently from other doctors.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">In contending that he is in factual compliance with the statute, the appellant argues that the word \u201cchiropractic\u201d on the top of the card satisfies the statute. He points out that the statute does not require that the title \u201cDoctor\u201d be followed by the designation \u201cchiropractor.\u201d He also claims that the card was not \u201cused\u201d until it was presented to someone and that every time he handed out a card the recipient would look at it and say, \u201cOh, so you\u2019re a chiropractor.\u201d We find these arguments unconvincing. Code \u00a7 54.1-2938 plainly requires that the word \u201cchiropractor\u201d or \u201cD.C.\u201d be used \u201cin connection with\u201d the chiropractor\u2019s name when that chi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>ropractor attaches the title \u201cDoctor\u201d to his name. The word \u201cchiropractic\u201d used in the name of the clinic is not sufficient. Further, even if the Board accepted the appellant\u2019s testimony that everyone he handed the card to acknowledged that he was a chiropractor, appellant did not comply with the statute. The fact that a recipient of the card states, \u201cOh, so you\u2019re a chiropractor,\u201d does not constitute compliance with the statutory mandate. Therefore, we conclude that evidence that the appellant \u201chanded out thousands of [business] cards over the years\u201d on which he used the title \u201cDr.\u201d in connection with his name without also using the word \u201cchiropractor\u201d or \u201cD.C.\u201d is substantial evidence supporting the Board\u2019s finding that the appellant is in violation of Code \u00a7 54.1-2938. <em>See Virginia Real Estate Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Bias, </em>226 Va. 264, 269, 308 S.E.2d 123, 125 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">Next, the appellant claims that Code \u00a7 54.1-2938 is unconstitutional in that it violates the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment. Specifically, the appellant asks us to apply strict judicial scrutiny to Code \u00a7 54.1-2938 because the classification in the statute \u201cimpinges upon a fundamental right explicitly or implicitly protected by the Constitution.\u201d <em>San Antonio Indep. School Dist. </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 1, 17 (1973). According to the appellant, the classification impinges upon his first amendment right of free speech by inhibiting his ability as a chiropractor to \u201cconvey his societal status.\u201d We conclude that the classification does not inhibit the conveyance of information; rather, it requires the dissemination of <em>more </em>information. To comply with the statute, a chiropractor must be more specific about his \u201csocietal status\u201d than other doctors: he may communicate that he is a doctor as long as he simultaneously communicates that he is a chiropractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Since a fundamental right is not impinged upon by Code \u00a7 54.1-2938, the classification in the statute need only \u201cbear a \u2018reasonable\u2019 relation to a \u2018legitimate\u2019 governmental objective.\u201d <em>Salama </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 320, 323, 380 S.E.2d 433, 435 (1989) (citing <em>City of New Orleans </em>v. <em>Dukes, 427 </em>U.S. 297, 303 (1976)). The Commonwealth argues that the statute fulfills a governmental interest by ensuring \u201cthat the public has at least some of the information necessary to make an informed judgment when seeking chiropractic care as distinguished from\u201d other types of health care. We conclude that this interest is legitimate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>that the requirement that chiropractors communicating that they are doctors simultaneously communicate that they are chiropractors reasonably serves this interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The appellant complains that \u201cdoctors of medicine, osteopathy, podiatry, optometry, dentistry, psychology, veterinary medicine, or any other profession the practice of which requires the possession of a doctoral degree\u201d are not regulated by a similar statutory requirement. However, \u201c[classifications will not be deemed unconstitutional just because they result in some statutory discrimination or inequality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Dandridge </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>397 U.S. 471, 485 (1970)). All that is necessary is \u201c \u2018any state of facts [which] reasonably may be conceived to justify\u2019 \u201d the classification. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Dandridge </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>397 U.S. at 485). In this case, the classification is justified by the state\u2019s interest in assuring that an individual seeking medical help for back pain is informed whether the doctor offering treatment is a chiropractor. For this reason, we conclude that Code \u00a7 54.1-2938 does not violate the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">\n<em>II. THE YELLOW PAGES AD</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b788-7\">Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A) (12) states that a practitioner of the healing arts is guilty of unprofessional conduct if he \u201c[publishes in any manner an advertisement relating to his professional practice which contains a claim of superiority.\u201d The appellant argues that the statute is unconstitutional (1) on its face for vagueness, and (2) as applied to him by restricting his first amendment right to freedom of speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">First, the appellant contends that Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(12) is unconstitutionally vague because it is unclear whether the prohibition of a \u201cclaim of superiority\u201d refers to a claim of superiority of one branch of medicine over another, a claim of superiority among specializations, or a claim of superiority of professionals over lay people. In interpreting this statute, we must \u201ctake the words as written\u201d and give them their plain meaning. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Lukhard, </em>229 Va. 316, 321, 330 S.E.2d 84, 87 (1985). \u201cSuperior\u201d is defined as \u201c[o]f a higher nature or kind . . . [o]f great value or excellence; extraordinary.\u201d <em>American Heritage Dictionary </em>(2d college ed. 1982). Further, in light of the principle that \u201c[t] ruthful advertising ... is entitled to the protections of the First Amendment,\u201d <em>In re R.M.J., </em>455 U.S. 191, 203 (1982), Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>\u00a7 54.1-2914(A) (12) may only prohibit untruthful or misleading claims of superiority. Therefore, Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A) (12) prohibits only untruthful or misleading claims by a health care professional that his or her services are of a higher quality than another\u2019s or are in some way extraordinary. So interpreted, this statute \u201cgive[s] a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden.\u201d <em>Papachristou </em>v. <em>City of Jacksonville, </em>405 U.S. 156, 162 (1972). We conclude that Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(12) is not unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Second, the appellant contends that Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A) (12) is unconstitutional as applied to him because it impinges upon his first amendment right of free speech. He claims that he is, in fact, a sports medicine specialist in the field of chiropractics, and, thus, the Board\u2019s ruling is an unconstitutional prohibition of truthful information. <em>See In re R.M.J., </em>455 U.S. at 203. The Board, however, found that the appellant lacks \u201cthe required training, education, and certification to hold himself out to the public as anything but a chiropractor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Untruthful and misleading advertising may be absolutely prohibited. <em>Id. </em>However, \u201ccertain types of potentially misleading information, <em>e.g., </em>a listing of areas of practice,\u201d may not be absolutely prohibited \u201cif the information also may be presented in a way that is not deceptive.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">In <em>Peel </em>v. <em>Attorney Registration &amp; Disciplinary Commission of Illinois, </em>496 U.S. 91, 110 (1990), the Court held that a state cannot completely ban an attorney from advertising as a \u201ccertified civil trial specialist\u201d if that claim is \u201cnot actually or inherently misleading.\u201d The Court found that the attorney\u2019s claim was neither actually or inherently misleading because he was in fact certified \u201cas a specialist by [a] bona fide organization.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court stated that to prevent confusion among consumers by \u201cpotentially misleading statements of private certification or specialization ... a State might consider screening certifying organizations or requiring a disclaimer about the certifying organization or the standards of a specialty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>In re R.M.J., </em>455 U.S. at 201-03).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">In this case, the Board found that the appellant lacks \u201cthe required training, education, and certification to hold himself out\u201d as a sports medicine specialist. The Board, however, cites no stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>dard appellant must meet before he could advertise himself as a sports medicine specialist. Without some standard, the Board could not have determined whether the advertisement was untruthful or misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">The Commonwealth carries a heavy burden in cases involving the \u201ccategorical prohibition against the dissemination of accurate factual information to the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 109. As stated above, only untruthful or misleading claims of superiority are banned by Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(12). However, by not having a standard by which to judge the appellant\u2019s advertisement, we cannot say that the Commonwealth carried its burden of proving that the appellant\u2019s advertisement was untruthful or misleading. Given the constitutional presumption favoring disclosure over concealment, <em>id., </em>we conclude that the Board\u2019s finding that the appellant\u2019s advertisement violates Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(12) is unconstitutional because the Commonwealth failed to prove that such finding would conceal only untruthful or misleading, as opposed to truthful, information. On remand, the Board must state what standard it applies in determining whether a practitioner of the healing arts is a specialist in a given area. Only in applying a consistent standard can the Board determine who is and is not a \u201cspecialist\u201d and whether a particular advertisement truthfully conveys that message.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">In summary, we hold that the appellant\u2019s card, which contained the word \u201cchiropractic\u201d in the name of the appellant\u2019s clinic, did not comply with Code \u00a7 54.1-2938 and that Code \u00a7 54.1-2938 does not violate the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment because it bears a reasonable relationship to a legitimate governmental interest. Furthermore, we hold that Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A) (12) prohibits only untruthful claims of superiority and, therefore, is not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. Finally, we hold that the standardless application of Code \u00a7 54.1-2914(A)(12) to the appellant violated his right to free speech because the Board was unable to find his claim that he was a sports medicine specialist untruthful. For these reasons, the judgment of the circuit court is reversed and the matter is remanded so that the Board\u2019s decision may be vacated and the Board directed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>conduct such additional proceedings, not inconsistent with this opinion, as may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Baker, J., and Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b786-9\"> Code \u00a7 54.1-2938 reads: \u201cChiropractors using the title \u2018Doctor\u2019 or \u2018Dr.\u2019 in connection with their names shall also use the word \u2018Chiropractor\u2019 or \u2018D.C.\u2019 The title \u2018Doctor\u2019 or \u2018Dr.\u2019 shall not be used alone by chiropractors.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
