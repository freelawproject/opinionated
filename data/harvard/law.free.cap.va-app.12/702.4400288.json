Cohen appeals from a decision in which the commission denied her application for permanent partial disability benefits under Code \u00a7 65.1-56 based on its holding that Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> created a substantive right, and thus, could not be applied retroactively to extend the limitation period of Code \u00a7 65.1-99.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>We hold that Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 is procedural in nature, that it affects remedy only and disturbs no vested or substantive rights of the employer, and that it was intended to apply retroactively. Accordingly, we find that the commission erred in holding that Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 could not be applied retroactively to permit Cohen\u2019s application to be considered on its merits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Cohen, a nurse, was injured on September 15, 1985, when she slipped on some surgical preparation solution and fell to the floor, injuring both of her knees. Fairfax Hospital Association and the Virginia Insurance Reciprocal (employer) accepted the injury as compensable, and Cohen received benefits for temporary total and temporary partial disability. On November 9, 1986, Cohen returned to work. Although she was unable to resume her pre-injury duties due to the injury to her knees, Cohen received a wage for other work which was equal to or in excess of her pre-injury average weekly wage.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">On January 16, 1990, Cohen filed an application for hearing in which she requested permanent partial disability benefits pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.1-56. Her application was denied by an assistant claims examiner, who ruled that it was not timely filed, since it was filed more than three years after Cohen had last received compensation benefits for her injury. Upon requesting that her application be reconsidered based on Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1, Cohen was informed by a deputy commissioner that Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 was inapplicable to her case, and therefore, her application for permanent partial disability benefits was barred by the three-year limitation period set forth in Code \u00a7 65.1-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">Cohen requested a review by the full commission, which affirmed the decision of the Claims Division and held that Code \u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>65.1-55.1 created a substantive right, and thus, could not be applied retroactively. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The well-established general rule concerning retroactive application of statutes was set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Duffy v. Hartsock, </em>187 Va. 406, 46 S.E.2d 570 (1948). There, the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-6\">Retrospective laws are not favored, and a statute is always to be construed as operating prospectively, unless a contrary intent is manifest; but the legislature may, in its discretion, pass retrospective and curative laws provided they do not partake of the nature of what are technically called <em>ex post facto </em>laws, and do not impair the obligation of contracts, or disturb vested rights; and provided, further, that they are of such nature as the legislature might have passed in the first instance to act prospectively.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 419, 46 S.E.2d at 576. The distinction between substantive provisions of law, which cannot be applied retroactively, and procedural or remedial statutes, which may be applied retroactively where a retrospective legislative intent is demonstrated, was explained in <em>Shiflet </em>v. Eller, 228 Va. 115, 120, 319 S.E.2d 750, 753 (1984). In <em>Shiflet, </em>the Supreme Court stated that substantive rights are addressed in statutes which create duties, rights, or obligations. In contrast, the Court explained that procedural or remedial statutes merely set forth the methods of obtaining redress or enforcement of rights. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">In order for Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 to apply retroactively, therefore, it must be procedural in nature and affect remedy only, disturbing no substantive or vested rights. <em>Buenson Div., Aeronca </em>v. <em>McCauley, </em>221 Va. 430, 432, 270 S.E.2d 734, 736 (1980); <em>Allen v. Mottley Constr. Co., </em>160 Va. 875, 889, 170 S.E. 412, 417 (1933). The statute must also contain an expression of retrospective legislative intent. <em>Buenson, </em>221 Va. at 435, 270 S.E.2d at 737; <em>Allen, </em>160 Va. at 889, 170 S.E. at 417.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-9\">Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 allows a claimant, who is still unable to perform his pre-injury work because of a compensable injury, and yet returns to work at a wage equal to or greater than his pre-injury wage, to have his post-injury wages considered as compensation for a period of up to twenty-four months after his return to work <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>for the purposes of computing the limitation period set forth in Code \u00a7 65.1-99. Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1, therefore, allows a qualifying claimant to extend by up to two years the period in which he must file an application for a change in condition. A claimant such as Cohen, who is requesting permanent disability benefits pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.1-56, would be subject to a thirty-six month limitation period from the date compensation was last paid, unless he can factually qualify under Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 for an extension of the limitation period. If the claimant qualifies under Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1, the limitation period can be extended to a maximum of five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">In the case before us, Cohen filed an application seeking benefits pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.1-56. Assuming that her post-injury wage was equal to or greater than her pre-injury weekly wage, and that Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 may be retroactively applied, the limitation period of Code \u00a7 65.1-99 would be extended for a period of up to five years. For purposes of our analysis here only, we accept Cohen\u2019s proffer made to the commission that she could produce evidence bringing herself within the purview of Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1, by its express language, operates only to amplify the term \u201ccompensation\u201d as it is used in Code \u00a7 65.1-99. Thus, the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis as to whether Code \u00a7 65.1-99 may be applied retroactively is instructive in determining whether Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 may also be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">The Supreme Court addressed the issue of retroactive application of Code \u00a7 65.1-99 in <em>Buenson </em>and <em>Allen. </em>In those cases, the Court held that the amendments to the limitation period in Code \u00a7 65.1-99 were procedural in nature and affected remedy only. In <em>Buenson, </em>at the time of the claimant\u2019s injury, Code \u00a7 65.1-99 provided that a change in condition application had to be filed within twelve months after the date for which compensation was last paid. Before that twelve-month period had expired in the claimant\u2019s case, the statute was amended, extending the limitation period from twelve months to twenty-four months. Seeking to rely on the new twenty-four month limitation period, the claimant in <em>Buenson </em>argued that the amendment to Code \u00a7 65.1-99 could be applied retroactively. Based on its prior decision in <em>Allen, </em>the Supreme Court agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\">Referencing its decision in <em>Allen, </em>the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>We found that the amendment was procedural in nature, that it affected remedy only and disturbed no vested rights, and that its language evidenced retrospective intent. Accordingly, we ruled that the new limitation should be applied retroactively.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-5\"><em>Buenson, </em>221 Va. at 432, 270 S.E.2d at 735-36. In explaining its decision that the amendment to the statute evidenced retrospective intent, the Court quoted directly from its prior decision in <em>Allen:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-6\">[The amendment] provides \u201cno such review. . . shall be made after twelve months from the date of the last payment of compensation pursuant to <em>an award </em>under this act.\u201d The legislature has placed a limitation in which the petition for review must be filed. The words \u201can award\u201d are all-inclusive. . . As adopted, it includes two classes of awards \u2014 those theretofore made, and those thereafter to be made. There is nothing in the phraseology that confines its operations to either past or future awards, but both are included.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b755-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 433, 270 S.E.2d at 736 (quoting <em>Allen, </em>160 Va. at 889-90, 170 S.E. at 417) (emphasis added). The Supreme Court, in reaching its decision in <em>Buenson, </em>also pointed out: \u201cPersuasive here is the fact that the new limitation period became effective before the old limitation would have barred McCauley\u2019s claim.\u201d 221 Va. at 434, 270 S.E.2d at 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">We hold that the same analysis applies to the case before us. Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 is procedural in nature and affects remedy only, because it operates solely to extend the limitation period of Code \u00a7 65.1-99 in cases where a claimant, who is physically unable to return to his pre-injury employment because of a compensable injury, returns to work within his capacity at a wage equal to or greater than his pre-injury wage. Thus, the language of Code \u00a7 65.1- 55.1 has the same effect as if it had been added to Code \u00a7 65.1- 99, namely allowing this certain class of claimants to receive an extension of the twenty-four and thirty-six months limitation periods provided in that section. Further, Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 has no applicability, except with reference to Code \u00a7 65.1-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-11\">The employer claims, however, that Code \u00a7 65.1-99 is substantive in nature because it is a statute of repose. The employer argues that since Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 is applicable only with refer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>ence to Code \u00a7 65.1-99, it also operates as a statute of repose and is thereby substantive in nature. First, we find that Code \u00a7 65.1-99 is not a statute of repose. As stated by this Court in <em>Bartholow Drywall Co. v. </em>Hill, 12 Va. App. 790, 407 S.E.2d 1 (1991):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-5\">An award based on a change in condition is different from the right to recover for the injury itself; a change in condition is remedial and enlarges or diminishes a former award to meet the circumstances of a particular case. . . . Code \u00a7 65.1-99 is not jurisdictional and may be waived by the employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 793, 407 S.E.2d at 2-3 (citations omitted). Since Code \u00a7 65.1- 99 is not a statute of repose, we find that the balance of the employer\u2019s argument with regard to Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 also fails. In addition, the employer\u2019s position here is directly contradicted by the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Buenson </em>and <em>Allen, </em>where the amendments to the limitation period in Code \u00a7 65.1-99 were found to be procedural in nature, applying to remedy only.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">Since Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 applies only to the limitation period set forth in Code \u00a7 65.1-99 and does not contain within its provisions a substantive extinguishment of a cause of action, we likewise conclude that it is not a statute of repose. <em>See School Bd. of the City of Norfolk v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>234 Va. 32, 37, 360 S.E.2d 325, 327-28 (1987). Consequently, we reject the employer\u2019s argument that Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 is substantive, rather than procedural, in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">We also find that retroactive application of Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 to Cohen\u2019s case does not impair any substantive or vested rights of the employer. The provisions of Code \u00a7 65.1-55-1 became effective on July 1, 1989, approximately four months before Cohen\u2019s claim otherwise would have been barred under Code \u00a7 65.1-99. Thus, like the claimant in <em>Buenson, </em>Cohen\u2019s claim was still alive when the new statute was passed. No vested or substantive rights had accrued to the employer prior to its passage.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">The case before us is distinguishable from <em>Brushy Ridge Coal Co. </em>v. <em>Blevins, </em>6 Va. App. 73, 367 S.E.2d 204 (1988), relied upon by the commission. In <em>Brushy Ridge, </em>this Court held that Code \u00a7 65.1- 100.1, which creates a duty in the employee to notify the employer of any change in wages and grants to the employer the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>right to recover for overpayments made, was substantive in nature because it granted a new right to the employer. <em>Id. </em>at 79, 367 S.E.2d at 207. Consequently, this Court concluded that Code \u00a7 65.1-100.1 could not be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">In contrast, Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 acts only to lengthen the period of time in which certain claimants can seek review of an award under Code \u00a7 65.1-99. It does not create new substantive rights, but rather, like the amendments to Code \u00a7 65.1-99 at issue in <em>Buenson </em>and <em>Allen, </em>extends procedural remedies, enabling certain claimants a longer period of access to obtain existing substantive rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">We also find no merit in the employer\u2019s argument that <em>Roller </em>v. <em>Basic Construction Co., </em>238 Va. 321, 384 S.E.2d 323 (1989), requires a different result. In that case, the Supreme Court held that because reciprocal rights and duties do not exist until there is an injury by accident, no vested rights were abridged when a statute of limitations was changed before the accident. In reaching this holding, the Supreme Court stated that the rights of the employer and employee are fixed at the time of the injury by accident. <em>Id. </em>at 330, 384 S.E.2d at 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\"><em>Roller </em>involved an occupational disease claim where the claimant died of cancer after being exposed to asbestos in his employment. Prior to the time the diagnosis of asbestosis was communicated to the claimant, Code \u00a7 65.1-52 was amended to eliminate that part of the limitation period dealing with five years from the date of the last injurious exposure in employment. In holding that the amended statute, which contained the sole limitation period of two years from the communication of the diagnosis to the employee, applied to the claimant\u2019s case, the Supreme Court relied on the factor, unique to occupational disease claims, that an injury by accident does not occur until the date of the first communication of the diagnosis to the employee. Since the claimant in <em>Roller </em>had not been told of his disease before the statute of limitations had been amended, the Supreme Court held that an injury by accident had not occurred and thus, no vested rights had accrued to the employer before that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">The employer claims that since Cohen\u2019s injury by accident occurred on September 15, 1985, under <em>Roller, </em>all rights of the parties were fixed at that time. We find, however, that while Cohen\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>substantive rights were fixed as of the date of her injury by accident, her remedies were not. Nothing in the language of <em>Roller </em>persuades us otherwise. Further, since Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 was enacted before Cohen\u2019s right to file for a change in condition had expired under Code \u00a7 65.1-99, no rights were vested in the employer as of July 1, 1989, the date Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 took effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Finally, we hold that the language of Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 evidences a legislative intent that it be applied retroactively. In so holding, we rely on the reasoning of the Supreme Court in <em>Allen, </em>which was reaffirmed in <em>Buenson. </em>In these cases, the term \u201can award,\u201d as it appeared in Code \u00a7 65.1-99, was held to evidence a retrospective legislative intent. The Court reasoned that if the legislature had intended to provide that the new limitation period applied only prospectively, it could have used the language \u201can award hereafter made.\u201d Similarly, in the case before us, we find that the language, \u201cAll wages,\u201d in Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 evidences retrospective legislative intent. Had the legislature not intended that it apply retroactively, using the reasoning in <em>Allen </em>and <em>Buenson, </em>it would have instead provided, \u201cAll wages hereafter paid.\u201d Since this qualifying language was not included in Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1, this section, as written, evidences a retrospective legislative intent to include all wages, those already paid at the time of its enactment, and those thereafter paid. Accordingly, we find that Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 must be applied retroactively to Cohen\u2019s case if she can factually establish her entitlement to rely on this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">For the reasons stated, we reverse the commission\u2019s decision and remand this cause for reconsideration of Cohen\u2019s application consistent with the principles set forth herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">Coleman, J., and Moon, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b751-11\"> Code \u00a7 65.1-55.1 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b751-12\">Certain wages considered compensation. - All wages paid, for a period not exceeding twenty-four consecutive months, to an employee (i) who is physically unable to return to his pre-injury work due to a compensable injury and (ii) who is provided work within his capacity at a wage equal to or greater than his pre-injury wage shall, for the sole purposes of \u00a7 65.1-99, be considered compensation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b751-13\"> Code \u00a7 65.1-99(A) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b751-14\">Review of award on change in condition. - Upon its own motion or upon the application of any party in interest, on the ground of a change in condition, the Industrial Commission may review any award and on such review may make an award ending, diminishing or increasing the compensation previously awarded, sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>ject to the maximum or minimum provided in this Act, and shall immediately send to the parties a copy of the award. . . .
