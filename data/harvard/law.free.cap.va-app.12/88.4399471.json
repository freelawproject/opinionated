Inherent in that decision was the commission\u2019s finding that the statute of limitations was not tolled under Code \u00a7 65.1-87.1. Hervey contends the statute of limitations was tolled by certain payments to him from Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company (Company) and regardless, the Company should be es-topped from relying on the statute of limitations since it failed to file an accident report with the commission as required by Code \u00a7 65.1-124. In the alternative, Hervey asserts he is entitled to benefits based on an occupational disease claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">On July 2, 1986, Hervey fell at work and struck his head, lacerating his eyebrow. He reported to the Company clinic where he received medication and several sutures for the lacerations. He returned to work the next day. For the following month, he suffered from dizzy spells and losses of consciousness. However, during his return visits to the clinic for his lacerations, Hervey evidently neglected to inform the clinic physician of his spells of dizziness or unconsciousness. He cannot remember informing the physician and his clinic records contain no reference to these symptoms. On January 20, 1987, Hervey suffered a grand mal seizure, and sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>sequently has suffered other seizures.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Hervey filed a \u201cHealth and Weekly Disability Claim\u201d with the Company\u2019s health claims department on January 30, 1987. The claim was filed with the Company\u2019s benefits office, which is separate from the Company\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation department. The benefits office does not handle workers\u2019 compensation claims. The Company\u2019s health claims department only handles non-occupational injuries or illnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">In his claim form, Hervey failed to complete the portions of the-form under the heading \u201cPatient &amp; Insured Information\u201d that would have indicated whether the seizures were related to employment and, if related to an accident, when the accident occurred. Likewise, the physician failed to complete his portion of the form indicating the date of the injury. Instead, the form described the seizure as an apparent \u201csingle event,\u201d without relating it to Hervey\u2019s head injury at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Prior to the injury, Hervey had never applied for or received workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Also, he had never filed a claim for sick pay. Hervey testified that he was under the belief that the claim forms he filed with the Company were for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">During the five months he was away from work, Hervey received from the Company weekly disability payments in the amount of $120, approximately one-half the amount of his weekly salary. The checks did not disclose whether they were workers\u2019 compensation or insurance payments. However, the payments were in fact coming from the Company\u2019s health and accident policy, not from its workers\u2019 compensation insurer. The Company also paid only a portion of Hervey\u2019s medical bills while Hervey had to pay a deductible in accordance with the Company\u2019s health plan coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">For its part, the Company, on July 7, 1986, filed a first report of injury under the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act with the federal Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs, which administers that act. On January 17, 1989, the Company finally filed with the Industrial Commission a first report of accident, which is required to be filed within ten days after the accident under Code \u00a7 65.1-124.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>In late August 1988, more than two years after the date of his injury, Hervey filed an application for a workers\u2019 compensation benefits hearing. In the application, he indicated the hearing was for a change in condition of an accidental injury. There was no indication that the hearing concerned an occupational disease. A hearing was granted and held on February 3, 1989 before the deputy commissioner. After receiving all the evidence and testimony, the deputy commissioner ruled Hervey\u2019s right to compensation under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act was barred since Hervey failed to file a claim with the commission for the initial injury within two years. The deputy commissioner noted Hervey\u2019s claim was barred unless the Company\u2019s acts prevented Hervey from filing a claim. The deputy commissioner concluded that since the Company \u201cduly filed and the claimant received medical benefits pursuant, to the employer\u2019s health benefit scheme,\u201d Hervey was not \u201csufficiently prejudice [sic] to warrant the requirements necessary to invoke estoppel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Hervey applied to the commission and obtained a review of the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision. In his brief to the commission, he raised three issues: \u201c(1) the construction and application of Section 65.1-87.1; (2) the effect of the fact that the employer did not file an accident report with the Industrial Commission as required by Section 65.1-124 and (3) whether the limitation period (Section 65.1-49) for an occupational disease is applicable in this case.\u201d Without addressing the issue of occupational disease, the commission affirmed the decision. The commission ruled the Company\u2019s failure to file the first report of accident did not toll the statute of limitations. The commission found there was nothing in the record to show the Company misled or induced Hervey to delay filing a claim, nor any evidence to support a finding of fraud on the Company\u2019s part. The commission noted that Hervey received the benefits for which he applied and that he never questioned the inconsistencies between the amount of benefits he received under the health plan and the amount he would have received as workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">Since Hervey failed to raise the occupational disease issue in the initial hearing before the deputy commissioner, the full commission, apparently in accordance with the established Rules of the Industrial Commission, refrained from addressing the issue. We also cannot address Hervey\u2019s argument that since his injury is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>an occupational disease, the statute of limitations does not bar his claim. He did not properly raise this issue before the Industrial Commission. We cannot consider an issue raised for the first time on appeal. Rule 5A:18. Thus, we turn to the remaining issues raised by Hervey.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Hervey contends the Company should be estopped from relying on the statute of limitations since it failed to properly file a first report of accident in accordance with Code \u00a7 65.1-124.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues that if the Company had filed a first report of accident with the commission, then the commission would have sent him a pamphlet informing him of the necessary steps he should have taken to guard his rights; thus, the Company\u2019s failure to comply with the statutory directive resulted in prejudice to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Hervey erroneously relies on Code \u00a7 65.1-87.1 to support his argument. This Code section, in effect at the time \u00f3f these proceedings, provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-7\">In any case where an employer has received notice of an accident resulting in compensable injury to an employee . . ., and although no award has been entered, such employer nevertheless has paid <em>compensation </em>to such employee during incapacity for work resulting from such injury, <em>and such conduct of the employer has operated to prejudice the rights of such employee </em>with respect to the filing of a claim prior to expiration of a statute of limitations otherwise applicable, such statute shall be tolled for the duration of such payment. For purposes of this section, such rights of an employee shall be deemed not prejudiced if his employer has filed the first report of accident as required by \u00a7 65.1-124 . . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">This section of the Code provides for the tolling of the statute of limitations under certain circumstances. It also specifies instances where the statute of limitations will not be tolled because of a <em>per se </em>absence of prejudice to the claimant. One of those instances is where an employer has filed a first report of accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>as required by Code \u00a7 65.1-124. Therefore, a proper reading of Code \u00a7 65.1-87.1 prevents tolling of the statute of limitations when Code \u00a7 65.1-124 has been satisfied but does not mandate the tolling of the statute of limitations where a first report of accident has not been filed. Instead, Code \u00a7 65.1-127 provides for a mandatory fine of not more than $250 where an employer has failed to file a first report of accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Hervey\u2019s remaining and primary argument is that the statute of limitations was tolled since the Company paid his medical bills and continued to pay him a portion of his salary during his period of disability. Again, he relies on Code \u00a7 65.1-87.1 to support his argument. This section of the Code provides for the tolling of the statute of limitations where three criteria are established. First, the employer must have received notice of an accident resulting in compensable injury to an employee as required by Code \u00a7 65.1-85. In this case, it is clear that the Company received notice of the accident. Second, the employer must have paid \u201ccompensation\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to an injured employee during incapacity for work resulting from the injury. Here, the parties disagree over whether the Company\u2019s payments to Hervey constituted \u201ccompensation\u201d under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Finally, the employer\u2019s payment of compensation must have operated to prejudice the rights of the employee with respect to the filing of a claim prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations. Again, the parties disagree over whether the conduct of the Company prejudiced Hervey\u2019s rights with respect to the filing of his claim within two years of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">In essence, Hervey argues that the term \u201ccompensation\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 65.1-87.1 should be broadly interpreted and \u201cshould cover any payments made by the employer to the employee while disabled,\u201d thereby covering the payments made to him in this case. Specifically, he argues that \u201ccompensation\u201d includes payment of medical bills or any monetary payment. The commission did not specifically address this issue. Rather, it found that \u201cthe confusion on [Hervey\u2019s] part as to whether he was receiving workers\u2019 compensation benefits or Health and Accident benefits may be understandable but it was not caused by the em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>ployer. [Hervey] received the benefits for which he applied.\u201d Arguably, implicit in this finding is the further finding that for purposes of Code \u00a7 65.1-87.1 the payment of medical bills and partial salary under the Company\u2019s health and accident policy was not \u201ccompensation.\u201d While compensation is not defined in the Virginia Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, in <em>Bowden </em>v. <em>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., </em>11 Va. App. 683, 401 S.E.2d 884 (1991), for purposes of applying Code \u00a7 65.1-87.1, we \u201c[found] nothing in Code \u00a7 65.1-87.1 to indicate that the legislature intended the term \u2018compensation\u2019 to apply to payments other than those mandated by Chapter 5, i.e., lost wages or a percentage thereof paid in lieu of an award by the commission.\u201d In <em>Bow-den </em>we held that payments received by the claimant pursuant to the Longshore and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act were not \u201ccompensation\u201d as contemplated by Code \u00a7 65.1-87.1. We reasoned that payments made outside the requirements of the Virginia Act are not included within the provisions of this Code section. <em>Bowden </em>is controlling here. The payments which Hervey received from the Company\u2019s health and accident policy were payments outside the requirements of the Virginia Act and as such were not compensation under Code \u00a7 65.1-87.1. Accordingly, the provisions of this Code section are not applicable to this case for purposes of tolling the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Finally, even though Code \u00a7 65.1-87.1 is not applicable to this case we must determine whether the Company is estopped from relying on the statute of limitations proscribed in Code \u00a7 65.1-87. <em>Stuart Circle Hospital v. Alderson, </em>223 Va. 205, 288 S.E.2d 445 (1982), is controlling. Here, the commission\u2019s finding that the Company was guilty of neither actual nor constructive fraud designed to deter Hervey from filing a workers\u2019 compensation claim is amply supported by the record. In addition, there is nothing in the record from which it reasonably could be inferred that the Company was guilty of any misconduct which misled Hervey to his detriment. Hervey filed a \u201cHealth and Weekly Disability Claim\u201d with the Company\u2019s health claims department more than six months after the date of the accident. That department handled non-occupational injuries and illnesses and was totally detached from the Company\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation department. Hervey never contacted the Company\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation department until he filed a claim over two years after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>The Company responded to Hervey\u2019s health and disability benefits claim by providing him with payments under its health and disability insurance plan. As noted by the Commission, Hervey received the benefits for which he applied. There is nothing in the record to suggest the Company was attempting to mislead Hervey. In contrast, Hervey never questioned why he was receiving only partial payment of his medical bills and had to pay a deductible, which was in accordance with the health benefits plan and contrary to the mandate of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Hervey\u2019s failure to contact the workers\u2019 compensation office to notify the Company of the alleged relation of his seizures to his accident and to question the amount of his benefit payments were the cause of the loss of his rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">In summary, we hold that Code \u00a7 65.1-87.1 is not applicable to this case. We agree with the commission\u2019s finding that because the Company was not guilty of any misconduct which misled or induced Hervey to delay the filing of a workers\u2019 compensation claim within the required two years, his claim is barred pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.1-87.1. Therefore, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Baker, J., and Barrow, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-10\"> Code \u00a7 65.1-124 states in pertinent part that \u201c[wjithin ten days after the occurrence and knowledge thereof as provided in \u00a7 65.1-85, of an injury to an employee, a report thereof shall be . . . mailed to the Industrial Commission . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b141-7\"> In 1989, Code \u00a7 65.1-87.1 was amended to include compensation \u201cor wages.\u201d This amendment is not applicable to the present case and we express no opinion concerning its applicability to circumstances such as those presented in this cas\u00e9.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
