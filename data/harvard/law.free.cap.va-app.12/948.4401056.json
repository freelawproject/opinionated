Darnell, appeals his convictions of two counts of taking, obtaining, or withholding a credit card in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-192. He contends that the trial court should have dismissed the charges on double jeopardy grounds because he had previously been convicted of petit larceny of a \u201cpocketbook containing U. S. currency, credit cards and miscellaneous items.\u201d He argues that the second prosecution is barred under the holding in <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299 (1932), <em>Grady </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>495 U.S. 508 (1990), and the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-294. We find that the prosecutions under Code \u00a7 18.2-192 are barred by <em>Grady </em>and, therefore, we reverse the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-12\">On March 6, 1989, Douglas Long\u2019s wallet was taken from his pants, which were hanging in the locker room at the Westwood Racquet Club. The wallet contained $61 in cash and other items, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>including a Dominion Bank \u201cMost\u201d card and an American Express card. He went to a nearby Dominion Bank to report the loss of his Dominion Bank card. When he arrived at the bank, he saw the defendant walking away from an automatic teller machine with the Dominion Bank card in his hand. Long remembered seeing the defendant in the locker room before his wallet was taken, so he confronted the defendant and retrieved his wallet and credit cards. The money was not in the wallet, but the defendant removed it from his pants and returned it to Long.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-5\">Henrico County Police Officer E. J. Kopacki arrived at the scene and took a statement from the defendant. The defendant admitted taking the wallet from Mr. Long\u2019s trousers. He also admitted removing the money from the wallet, but claimed he did not know the credit cards were in the wallet.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-6\">On April 6, 1989, the defendant was convicted in the general district court of petit larceny of a \u201cpocketbook containing U. S. currency, credit cards and mise, items\u201d belonging to Douglas Long in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-96.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant was subsequently tried and convicted in circuit court on two counts of taking, obtaining, or withholding a credit card in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-192.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-7\">On June 20, 1989, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss in the trial court, alleging that \u201c[t]hese indictments are violative of the double jeopardy clause of the Constitution since he has previously been convicted of the lesser included of\u00edense petit larceny involving these items. (Warrant of arrest is attached).\u201d Filed with the motion was a legal memorandum in support thereof. The court took the motion under advisement and, after the trial, heard argument on the motion on August 9, 1989. No reference was made to <em>Grady </em>because it was not decided until May 29, 1990. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court overruled the motion to dismiss, holding that petit larceny is not a lesser included offense of credit card theft and that the elements of the two are different.</p>\n<p id=\"b999-8\">At the outset, the Commonwealth contends that Darnell cannot rely on the argument that his conviction is barred by <em>Grady </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>495 U.S. 508 (1990), because he did not make this argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>ment in the trial court. In the trial court, the defendant relied solely upon <em>Blockburger </em>to argue that the double jeopardy clause was violated. Therefore, the Commonwealth argues, since the <em>Corbin </em>case was not the basis for the argument in the trial court, it should not be considered on appeal. Rule 5A.T8. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">We find that <em>Grady, </em>although decided after the decision was rendered in the trial court, is applicable to this case. In <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>479 U.S. 314 (1987), the United States Supreme Court held: \u201c[A] new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a \u2018clear break\u2019 with the past.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 328; <em>see also Kelly v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 359, 367-68, 382 S.E.2d 270, 274-75 (1989). As a general rule, judicial decisions are to be applied retroactively. <em>Department of Highways &amp; Transp. </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>1 Va. App. 349, 352, 338 S.E.2d 660, 662-63 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">\u201cRule 5A:18 serves an important function during the conduct of a trial. It places the parties on notice that they must give the trial court the first opportunity to rule on disputed evidentiary and procedural questions. The purpose of this rule is to allow correction of an error if possible during trial, thereby avoiding the necessity of mistrials and reversals.\u201d <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 418, 423, 350 S.E.2d 229, 232 (1986). The defendant complied with Rule 5A:18 by making a motion to dismiss based on the double jeopardy clause, by filing a legal memorandum with the motion, and by fully arguing the motion before the trial court. He could not have argued <em>Grady </em>because it had not been decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">In order to be considered on appeal, an objection must be timely made and the grounds stated with specificity. Rule 5A:18. \u201cUnless an objection is stated with reasonable certainty at the time of the ruling, neither the Supreme Court nor the Court of Appeals will consider the question for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>Simmons v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 445, 450, 371 S.E.2d 7, 10 (1988), <em>rev\u2019d, </em>238 Va. 200, 380 S.E.2d 656 (1989). The purpose of the rule is \u201cto give the trial court an opportunity to rule intelligently and to avoid unnecessary appeals, reversals, and mistrials.\u201d <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Goughnour, </em>221 Va. 265, 269, 269 S.E.2d 801, 804 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">\u201cIt is the duty of a party, as a rule, when he objects to evidence, to state the grounds of his objection, so that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>judge may understand the precise question or questions he is called upon to decide. The judge is not required to search for objections which counsel have not discovered, or which they are not willing to disclose.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry., </em>179 Va. 642, 651, 20 S.E.2d 489, 492-93 (1942). Although objections must be specific and not general, in this case we find that the objection was made with sufficient certainty so that the trial judge could understand the precise question he was called upon to decide. Darnell attached to his motion both his petit larceny warrant of arrest and the indictments upon which he was charged. In his attached memorandum, he cited applicable cases, referring to the leading case of <em>Blockburger. </em>However, in circumstances such as this, it is impossible to refer to cases not yet decided and to law promulgated between trial and appeal. We, therefore, find that Rule 5A:18 does not bar an appeal of an issue where the law has changed between trial and appeal, such as in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To hold otherwise would deny the defendant the benefit of decisions rendered after the date of trial, decisions which the Supreme Court has declared have retroactive effect in all cases still pending on direct review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">The double jeopardy clause embodies three protections: \u201cIt protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. It protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction. And it protects against multiple punishments for the same offense.\u201d <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 717 (1969) (footnote omitted). In <em>Grady </em>v. <em>Corbin, </em>\u201cthe Supreme Court clarified the standard for determining whether successive prosecutions are barred by the double jeopardy clause of the fifth amendment.\u201d <em>Low </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>11 Va. App. 48, 51, 396 S.E.2d 383, 385 (1990). Under <em>Grady, </em>the court must first apply the traditional <em>Blockburger </em>test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-6\">The applicable rule is that where the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one, is whether each provision requires proof of a fact which the other does not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">284 U.S. at 304. However, as stated in <em>Grady.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>[A] subsequent prosecution must do more than merely survive the <em>Blockburger </em>test. As we suggested in <em>Vitale, </em>the Double Jeopardy Clause bars any subsequent prosecution in which the government, to establish an essential element of an offense charged in that prosecution, will prove conduct that constitutes an offense for which the defendant has already been prosecuted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">495 U.S. at 521 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">The first inquiry is whether <em>Blockburger </em>bars the subsequent prosecution. \u201cIf application of that test reveals that the offenses have identical statutory elements or that one is a lesser included offense of the other the inquiry must cease, and the subsequent prosecution is barred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 516. The Supreme Court of Virginia has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1002-7\">The theft of several articles at one and the same time constitutes an indivisible offense, and a conviction or acquittal of any one or more of them is a bar to a subsequent prosecution for the larceny of the others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\"><em>Holly </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>113 Va. 769, 772, 75 S.E. 88, 89 (1912). However, \u201cthe rule applies only to a case involving multiple larceny prosecutions predicated upon the theft of multiple articles stolen contemporaneously.\u201d <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 757, 761, 240 S.E.2d 658, 661, <em>cert. denied, </em>435 U.S. 909 (1978). Here, the defendant faced only one larceny charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">The defendant asserts that petit larceny is a lesser included offense of taking, obtaining or withholding a credit card. \u201cA lesser included offense is an offense which is composed entirely of elements that are also elements of the greater offense. Thus, in order for one crime to be a lesser included offense of another crime, every commission of the greater offense must be a commission of the lesser offense.\u201d <em>Kauffmann </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 400, 409, 382 S.E.2d 279, 283 (1989). \u201cConversely, an offense is not lesser included within another if it has an element the other does not.\u201d <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>11 Va. App. 649, 652, 400 S.E.2d 794, 795 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 18.2-192 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"955\">*955</page-number>(1) A person shall be guilty of credit card or credit card number theft when:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1003-5\">(a) He takes, obtains or withholds a credit card or credit card number from the person, possession, custody or control of another without the cardholder\u2019s consent.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">The taking must be with the intent to use, sell, or transfer the card to a person other than the issuer or the cardholder. <em>Cheatham </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 286, 290, 208 S.E.2d 760, 763 (1974); <em>see also Wilder </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 145, 147, 225 S.E.2d 411, 413 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">\u201cLarceny is the wrongful taking of the goods of another without the owner\u2019s consent and with the intention to permanently deprive the owner of possession of the goods.\u201d <em>Bright </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va. App. 248, 251, 356 S.E.2d 443, 444 (1987). Code \u00a7 18.2-96 determines the monetary value which constitutes petit larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">A comparison of the elements discloses that petit larceny is not a lesser included offense of a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-192. Larceny requires proof of an intent \u201cto permanently deprive\u201d while Code \u00a7 18.2-192 requires only an intention to \u201cuse, sell or transfer.\u201d Thus, every conviction under Code \u00a7 18.2-192 would not necessarily result in a conviction of petit larceny. For example, an individual could take a credit card from its owner\u2019s possession intending to use the card to make a purchase without the owner\u2019s consent, proceed to use the card in making the purchase, and subsequently return the card before the owner became aware of its absence. In such a situation, the perpetrator could be convicted under Code \u00a7 18.2-192, but not of petit larceny<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because he lacked the \u201cintent to permanently deprive.\u201d Also, Code \u00a7 18.2-192 requires proof of a fact which petit larceny does not, <em>i.e., </em>that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"956\">*956</page-number>a credit card be taken. Therefore, under <em>Blockburger, </em>a defendant could be convicted of both petit larceny and taking, obtaining, or withholding a credit card.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">Applying the <em>Grady </em>test, however, we reach a different result. In the present case, the same conduct which constituted the substantive petit larceny offense was alleged and proved as essential elements in the credit card theft prosecution. The issue before us is whether evidence of the larceny of the \u201cpocketbook, containing U. S. currency, credit cards and mise, items\u201d belonging to Douglas Long \u2014 conduct that constitutes an offense for which Darnell has already been convicted \u2014 established an essential element of the credit card theft charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">We must decide whether <em>Grady </em>\u201cprohibits a successive prosecution when evidence of previously prosecuted conduct proves only a portion of an essential element of the second charge, or whether <em>Grady </em>prohibits a successive prosecution only when the evidence of previously prosecuted conduct proves the \u2018entirety\u2019 of an essential element.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>928 F.2d 639 (4th Cir. 1991). In <em>Clark, </em>the fourth circuit adopted the rule that in order for the conduct used in the first trial to be barred from use in the second trial, the conduct must, standing alone, fully establish a legal element of the crime charged in the second prosecution. <em>Id. </em>at 642. We agree with the holding in <em>Clark </em>and adopt it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">In circuit court, the indictments specifically charged the defendant with taking, obtaining and withholding a Dominion Bank card and an American Express card belonging to Long. At trial in the circuit court, Long testified on cross-examination that the American Express card and Dominion Bank card were the only credit cards contained in the wallet. Thus, there can be no question but that the American Express card and the Dominion Bank card were the credit cards referred to in the district court case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">We assume that \u201cproof in the first trial followed the charge.\u201d <em>Low, </em>11 Va. App. at 52, 396 S.E.2d at 385. In order for the defendant to be convicted of petit larceny of the credit cards, as alleged in the warrant, the Commonwealth was required to prove that the defendant wrongfully removed the wallet containing the credit cards from Long\u2019s trousers, without his consent. This is the precise conduct which the Commonwealth relied on in the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"957\">*957</page-number>court to prove essential elements of Code \u00a7 18.2-192. Therefore, the subsequent prosecution is barred by <em>Grady.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1005-4\">The defendant also contends that the subsequent prosecution is barred under Code \u00a7 19.2-294. However, this section is not applicable when one crime is a common law offense. <em>Blythe </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>222 Va. 722, 284 S.E.2d 796 (1981).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Larceny is a common law crime, although it is regulated by statute. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>435 F.2d 453, 457 (4th Cir. 1970), <em>vacated, </em>404 U.S. 53 (1971). Therefore, Code \u00a7 19.2-294 is not applicable to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">In conclusion, the subsequent prosecution is barred under <em>Grady </em>v. <em>Corbin </em>where the Commonwealth, to establish an essential element of Code \u00a7 18.2-192, proved conduct which constituted petit larceny, a crime for which the defendant had already been prosecuted. Accordingly, we reverse and dismiss the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b998-13\"> Judge Cole participated in the hearing and decision of this case prior to the effective date of his retirement on April 30, 1991 and thereafter by designation pursuant to Code \u00a7 17-116.01.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b999-9\"> This warrant was made a part of the record on appeal by a writ of certiorari dated October 17, 1990.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1001-8\"> We need not decide whether the defendant could raise the issue on appeal in the absence of any objection on double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1003-9\"> Code \u00a7 18.2-192(2) provides that \u201cCredit card or credit card number theft is grand larceny and is punishable as provided in \u00a7 18.2-95.\u201d This is not dispositive because this relates to punishment and not to the elements which must be proved, which is the critical test under <em>Blockburger.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1003-10\"><em> </em>Although Code \u00a7 18.2-192 is comprehensive in scope, it is possible for credit card theft to constitute a more general offense. <em>See Sullivan v. </em>Commonwealth, 210 Va. 201, 169 S.E.2d 577 (1969)(in burglary conviction property stolen was credit card), <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 988 (1970); <em>see generally </em>Groot, <em>Criminal Offenses and Defenses in Virginia </em>77 (2d ed. 1989); Costello, <em>Virginia Criminal Law and Procedure </em>\u00a7 16.1-2, at 174 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1005-10\"> We read <em>Grady </em>to be applicable to the circumstances of this case regardless of the order of these prosecutions. <em>See </em>495 U.S. at 521 n.11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1005-12\"> In <em>Blythe, </em>the defendant was convicted of voluntary manslaughter under Code \u00a7 18.2-35 and unlawful wounding under \u00a7 18.2-53.

Likewise, Code \u00a7 18.2-96 merely defines how petit larceny is punished without defining the offense.
