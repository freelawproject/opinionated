His appeal raises three issues: (1) whether the trial judge erred in overruling Bagheri\u2019s motion to strike at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, (2) whether the Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Bagheri knowingly and intentionally passed worthless checks, and (3) whether the Commonwealth proved beyond a reasonable doubt the account lacked sufficient funds or credit when Bagheri wrote and delivered the checks. We conclude that the Commonwealth sufficiently proved Bagheri committed the charged offenses, and we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-9\">\n<em>FACTS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-10\">The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence proved that Bagheri, an automobile dealer, wrote two checks, each dated August 24, 1988, for the purchase of two cars from Stohlman Leasing Company. The general manager for Stohlman testified that he received checks in the amounts of $12,500 and $33,000 on August 24, 1988. Both checks were deposited to Stohlman\u2019s bank account and returned to Stohlman stamped, \u201cinsufficient funds.\u201d On November 17, 1988, Stohlman\u2019s legal counsel sent two certified letters to Bagheri notifying him that the checks were returned unpaid and advising him to pay the debts within five days in accord with Code \u00a7 18.2-183. Bagheri signed receipts for both letters. Bagheri neither paid the amount due nor returned the cars to Stohlman.</p>\n<p id=\"b1120-11\">The Commonwealth introduced Bagheri\u2019s bank account statements covering the latter half of July 1988 through the beginning of September 1988. Deposits to the account include $23,722.77 on August 23, $15,400 on August 24, $22,700 on August 25, and $4,090 on August 26. However, the account had a negative balance from August 24 until August 31, except on August 25 when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>there was a balance of $10,022.04. Prior to and after August 24, 1988, numerous checks were presented to the bank, but were returned by the bank the next day as unpaid. Some checks were twice presented and returned unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-5\">Bagheri moved to strike the evidence, arguing the Commonwealth failed to show \u201cthat there were insufficient funds in this account on the day that the checks were written.\u201d He contended that, although the checks were stamped \u201cinsufficient funds,\u201d there was no indication that they were stamped on August 24, 1988. He argued that in the absence of proof of the account\u2019s status on the day the checks were written, the evidence failed to prove an offense. The trial judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-6\">Bagheri began his defense with his accountant\u2019s review of the checking account statement for August 1988. The accountant recounted various deposits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1121-7\">On August 15 [Bagheri] deposited $25,200, which deposit slips is here and I have a copy of them. On August 16 he deposited $73,825. And on August 23 he deposited $23,672.27. And on August 24 he deposited $15,400.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1121-8\">On this information, the accountant asserted that Bagheri deposited \u201caround 140, 145 thousand, something like that\u201d and had sufficient funds in the account on August 24, 1988 to cover the checks.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-9\">The accountant also testified that his analysis of the account indicated that, \u201c[b]ased on the [bank\u2019s] experience [with Bagheri\u2019s] business, [the bank] gave him immediate credit when he deposited a check.\u201d The accountant reached that conclusion by observing that whenever the bank statements reported negative balances at the close of a day, the bank would pay the day\u2019s checks and rely on the next day\u2019s deposits to cover the insufficiency. Thus, he concluded that although at the close of August 23 and 24 the statement reported a negative balance, the bank normally extended credit to Bagheri and paid the checks on those days.</p>\n<p id=\"b1121-10\">Bagheri testified that he wrote the checks on August 24, but delivered the $33,000 check on August 25 and the $12,500 check on August 26 because he was waiting to receive more money to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>deposit. He deposited $15,400 on August 24 and $22,700 on August 25 believing that the bank gave him immediate credit for the deposits. He testified that he reconciled the account as he wrote checks and made deposits, but admitted he had no line of credit with the bank to cover checks written on a negative balance. Bagheri did not introduce his own checking account records that he claimed to maintain on a daily basis. Bagheri denied any intent to defraud Stohlman or to pass a bad check.</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-5\">\n<em>MOTION TO STRIKE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-6\">Bagheri first argues that the trial court erred in overruling his motion to strike made at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case-in-chief. We disagree. \u201cIt is well settled . . . that when a defendant elects to present evidence on his behalf, he waives the right to stand on his motion to strike the evidence made at the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case.\u201d <em>White </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 231, 233, 348 S.E.2d 866, 867 (1986). Therefore, \u201cthe sufficiency of the evidence is to be determined from the entire record.\u201d <em>Hargraves </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 604, 605, 248 S.E.2d 814, 815 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-7\">\n<em>SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1122-8\">Code \u00a7 18.2-183 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1122-9\">the making or drawing or uttering or delivery of a check, draft, or order, payment of which is refused by the drawee because of lack of funds or credit shall be prima facie evidence of intent to defraud or of knowledge of insufficient funds in, or credit with, such bank . . . unless such maker or drawer, or someone for him, shall have paid the holder thereof the amount due thereon, together with interest, and protest fees . . . within five days after receiving written notice that such check, draft, or order has not been paid to the holder thereof.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1122-10\">Since the drawer\u2019s state of mind is difficult to prove, the General Assembly created \u201ca rebuttable presumption of the necessary intent and knowledge if a dishonored check is not paid within five days after giving of the notice specified in the statute.\u201d <em>Huntt </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 212 </em>Va. 737, 739, 187 S.E.2d 183, 186 (1972); <em>see also Cook </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>178 Va. 251, 258, 16 S.E.2d 635, 638 (1941).</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1075\">*1075</page-number>The Commonwealth introduced both returned checks stamped \u201cinsufficient funds\u201d as well as bank statements indicating the checks were both presented and returned on two separate occasions. Evidence showed that Stohlman notified Bagheri by certified mail that the bank dishonored the checks and that Stohlman demanded payment within five days, but received none. This evidence is sufficient to invoke the rebuttable presumption of Code \u00a7 18.2- 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-6\">Bagheri argues that the conviction should be overturned because he proved that the bank extended him credit whenever it paid the overdrafts in anticipation of future deposits. We conclude that the evidence fails to rebut the statutory presumption. Code \u00a7 18.2- 181 defines credit as \u201cany arrangement or understanding with the bank ... for the payment of such check.\u201d Bagheri presented no evidence of a credit arrangement or understanding with the bank. His accountant testified that his analysis of the transactions indicated that the bank, as a matter of practice, did extend credit on overdrafts. The documentary evidence, however, does not support the accountant\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-8\">The bank statements prove only that Bagheri\u2019s bank (1) made entries on Bagheri\u2019s account when checks drawn on the account were presented for payment, (2) posted checks to Bagheri\u2019s account causing an overdraft, and (3) returned checks the day following the posting when deposits posted to the account did not eliminate the overdraft. The Uniform Commercial Code, as adopted in Virginia, permits Bagheri\u2019s bank, which is the payor bank in these transactions, to provisionally post Bagheri\u2019s account on the day a check is received for payment. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 8.4-109 (and the Official Comment). The provisional posting is not final payment and may be reversed by returning the check prior to the bank\u2019s midnight deadline. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 8.4-104(h), 8.4- 104(j), 8.4-213 (and the Official Comment), and 8.4-301 (and the Official Comment).</p>\n<p id=\"b1123-9\">The account statement for July 1988 shows that during the period from July 15 to July 29 the bank dishonored and returned the next day six checks that were drawn on a negative balance. Similarly, the August 1988 statement shows that thirty-two checks, including the two checks at issue, were dishonored and returned on the next day for insufficient funds. Thus, the transactions shown on the bank statements prove only that the bank was operating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1076\">*1076</page-number>within recognized commercial practices. The bank statements do not prove that Bagheri had a credit arrangement or understanding with the bank regarding the payment of overdrafts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-5\">Furthermore, the accountant\u2019s testimony contradicted his own theory that the bank\u2019s statement of accounts proved a credit arrangement between Bagheri and the bank. He testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-6\">Q. [D]id [Bagheri] have sufficient funds in the account to cover those checks [on August 24]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-7\">A. If [Stohlman] presented the checks back while he had sufficient funds, <em>some other check would bounce.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-8\"><em>* </em>* *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-9\">Q. And if the account were to say that there is a returned fee, how would you count that into your calculations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-10\">A. It shows that one check has been returned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-11\">Q. And you would deduct that because that\u2019s a fee that the bank charges you for every returned check?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-12\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-13\">Q. And that\u2019s a check returned that is <em>not </em>paid?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1124-14\">A. That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1124-15\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-16\">On this evidence, Bagheri failed to prove the bank was extending credit for his overdrafts. When considering Bagheri\u2019s own admission that he wrote checks with the hopes of covering the amount with future deposits and Bagheri\u2019s failure to either pay Stohlman or return the cars, the trial judge reasonably concluded that the evidence proved beyond a reasonable doubt Bagheri intentionally and knowingly wrote and delivered checks on an account with insufficient funds. \u201c[T]he \u2018Bad Check\u2019 statute is specifically aimed to discourage the giving of bad checks for what purports to be a cash purchase when the drawer has, instead of the present means, only a vague intention to make the check good some time in the future.\u201d <em>Cook, </em>178 Va. at 259, 16 S.E.2d at 638.</p>\n<p id=\"b1124-17\">We reject Bagheri\u2019s further contention that the evidence was insufficient to prove the account lacked sufficient funds when the checks were written or delivered. The account statements introduced by the Commonwealth prove the status of the account bal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1077\">*1077</page-number>anees on the relevant dates. The accountant merely testified there were sufficient <em>deposits </em>to cover the two checks. A review of the statement demonstrates that the account carried a negative balance on August 23 and 24 and from August 26 to August 31. On September 1, the account reported a positive balance only after the $33,000 check at issue was unpaid and returned for the second time. There was a $10,022.04 balance at the close of August 25, which was obviously insufficient to satisfy either check. Thus, the evidence proved beyond any doubt that the account contained insufficient funds to cover the checks at any time between August 24 and September 1, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1125-7\">Koontz, C.J., and Keenan, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1125-8\"> Justice Keenan participated in the hearing and decision of this case prior to her investiture as a Justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
