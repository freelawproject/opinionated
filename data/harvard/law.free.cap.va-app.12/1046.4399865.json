Elizabeth Shaffer, Assistant Attorney General (Mary Sue Terry, Attorney General, on brief), for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b1095-13\">Opinion</p>\n<author id=\"b1095-14\">BARROW, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_tu\">In this criminal appeal, we hold that a conviction for petit larceny which occurred during the period of probation is sufficient cause to support revocation of the petitioner\u2019s suspended sentence even if evidence of the facts underlying the conviction is not presented. In addition, we hold that a continuance of the revocation proceeding is not required while an appeal of the underlying conviction is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-15\">In 1987, pursuant to a plea agreement, the defendant was sentenced to three years in prison for petit larceny. The trial judge suspended the sentence and placed the defendant on three years probation. Terms for probation included conditions that the defendant be of \u201cgood behavior\u201d and \u201cobey all Municipal, County, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>State and Federal laws and ordinances.\u201d The defendant, while on probation, was arrested for petit larceny and, on October 23, 1989, was found guilty of the offense by a jury. The defendant appealed his conviction to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-5\">Less than one month after his October 23, 1989 conviction, the defendant was brought before the trial court for a show cause hearing concerning the effect of the conviction on his probation. At the hearing, defense counsel moved for a continuance \u201cuntil the Court of Appeals has a chance to rule upon his appeal.\u201d The trial court denied the motion. Defense counsel argued that the defendant should not be found in violation of probation because \u201cthere are merits to the appeal and it is quite possible that the conviction will be overturned.\u201d Counsel stated, \u201cwe have no evidence, just argument.\u201d Based on evidence of the defendant\u2019s conviction by jury, the trial court found that the defendant had violated \u201cone of the terms of his probation requiring him to obey all municipal, county, state and federal laws and ordinances.\u201d The court ordered that the defendant\u2019s previously suspended sentence be executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1096-6\">In Virginia, \u201c[t]he court may, for any cause deemed by it sufficient which occurred at any time within the probation period . . . revoke suspension of sentence and any probation.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-306. A revocation of a suspended sentence must be based on reasonable cause, <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 217, 220, 116 S.E.2d 270, 275 (1960), but a court has broad discretion in making such a determination, <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 325, 326, 228 S.E.2d 555, 556 (1976). Furthermore, \u201can alleged violation upon which revocation is based need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1096-7\">The defendant argues that the evidence \u201cis inadequate . . . to establish that appellant\u2019s probation should have been revoked.\u201d However, at the show cause hearing, there was evidence before the court that, while the defendant was serving his suspended sentence on probation, he committed petit larceny and was convicted by a jury for that offense. We find this evidence sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant had violated one of the terms of his probation. It matters not, as the defendant claims, that evidence of the underlying facts of the conviction was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>presented.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That the trier of fact in a criminal proceeding found beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant violated a state law is sufficient evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in revoking the defendant\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-5\">The defendant also argues that the trial court erred in refusing to grant a continuance until this court has ruled on the appeal of his October 23, 1989 conviction. Specifically, the defendant contends that if this Court reverses his conviction on the merits, the trial court\u2019s only cause for revoking his probation will no longer exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-6\">The decision to grant or deny a continuance in a criminal case lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>10 Va. App. 67, 70, 389 S.E.2d 727, 729 (1990). The exercise of this discretion must not \u201cprejudice the defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial or deprive him of his constitutional right \u2018to call for evidence in his favor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 70-71, 389 S.E.2d at 729-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-7\">In applying these principles to a proceeding to revoke probation, a trial court may take steps to ensure that a defendant will not be incarcerated because of a revocation based on an improper conviction. If a defendant\u2019s suspended sentence is revoked, execution of the sentence may be postponed pending an appeal. Code \u00a7 19.2-319. In such a case, a defendant may be eligible for bail based upon appropriate considerations. <em>See Dowell v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 225, 229, 367 S.E.2d 742, 744 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1097-8\">The appeal of the underlying conviction will determine the outcome of the appeal of the revocation proceeding. While no appellate court in Virginia has addressed the significance of an appeal of a conviction upon which a probation revocation is based, other jurisdictions have. Where the criminal conviction underlying the revocation is affirmed on appeal, the appeal is considered without merit; <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>State, </em>146 Ga. App. 414, 414, 246 S.E.2d 435, 436 (1978); or is considered moot; <em>Manos </em>v. <em>State, </em>489 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1050\">*1050</page-number>787, 787 (Okla. Crim. App. 1971). If, on the other hand, the underlying conviction is reversed on appeal, the revocation must also be reversed. <em>People </em>v. <em>Irving, </em>116 Mich. App. 147, _, 321 N.W.2d 873, 874 (1982); <em>Tift v. State, </em>133 Ga. App. 466, 466, 211 S.E.2d 411, 411 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-7\">In this case, the appellant\u2019s petition for appeal of the underlying conviction has been denied by this court, and no further appeal has been sought. Therefore, the appeal of the revocation of the appellant\u2019s suspension of sentence is moot.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1098-9\">Coleman, J., and Moon, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1097-9\"> At oral argument, the defendant complained because the trial court refused to allow him to cross-examine a witness concerning the facts underlying his conviction. Since this issue was not presented in his brief, we do not consider it except to the extent that it relates to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the revocation. <em>See Rogers v. </em>Rogers, 170 Va. 417, 421, 196 S.E. 586, 588 (1938).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1098-10\"> Since the underlying conviction was not reversed, we do not address under what circumstances such a reversal would require a reversal of the revocation of a suspended sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
