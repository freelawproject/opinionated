Commonwealth, 212 Va. 23, 24, 181 S.E.2d 622, 624 (1971). Under that test, \u201cone occasion of driving an automobile may give rise\u201d to more than one conviction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1045-11\">Here, Treu failed to stop his truck after Fairfax police officers flashed emergency lights for him to stop. He fled at a high rate of speed from Fairfax County into Falls Church.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Officer Allen Frede of the Falls Church Police Department positioned his cruiser so as to \u201cbox\u201d in Treu. Without slowing down, Treu drove his vehicle into the cruiser and then fled from the scene. Frede sustained personal injury and the cruiser was damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-12\">On August 3, 1989, Treu pled guilty in Fairfax County to flight from and eluding the police, a violation of former Code \u00a7 46.1-192.1. Subsequently, an Arlington County grand jury indicted him for failing to stop at the scene of an accident involving personal injury, a violation of former Code \u00a7 46.1-176. Treu raised the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-294 as a bar to the Arlington prosecution. He was convicted in Arlington County of failing to stop at the scene of an accident involving property damage, a violation of former Code \u00a7 46.1-176.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-13\">Applying the <em>Estes </em>test to the facts, we conclude that the Arlington County prosecution for hit and run was not barred. None of the evidence involving the flight from police in Fairfax County was required to prove the hit and run in Falls Church. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>The Arlington County conviction was not based on the \u201csame act\u201d that served as the basis for the Fairfax County conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-5\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1046-7\">Duff, J., and Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1045-14\"> Offenses committed in Falls Church are prosecuted in Arlington County Courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
