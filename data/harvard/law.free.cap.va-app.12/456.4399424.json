On appeal, the issues are: (1) whether Code \u00a7 9-6.14:16 of the Virginia Administrative Process Act (\u201cVAPA\u201d) affords EDF a right of judicial review in addition to that provided for in Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29; (2) whether EDF lacked standing under the applicable provision to seek judicial review of the Board\u2019s case decision; (3) whether the Board\u2019s internal memorandum was improperly applied as a rule or regulation; and (4) whether the Board\u2019s denial of EDF\u2019s request for a formal hearing was proper. We find that EDF lacked standing. Therefore, we affirm the decisions of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Rocco Farm Foods, Inc., Rocco Realty, Inc. and Mountain View Rendering Co. (collectively \u201cRocco\u201d) own and operate a poultry processing plant and a wastewater treatment facility in Shenandoah County, Virginia. This facility discharges treated effluent into Stony Creek, a tributary of the north fork of the Shenandoah River. On June 27, 1988, the Board reissued Rocco\u2019s Virginia Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (\u201cVPDES\u201d) permit, to be effective September 1, 1988. The VPDES permit placed limits on the amount of effluent which could be discharged into Stony Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">On July 22, 1988, after the permit was issued, the Board\u2019s staff issued an internal memorandum to all regional directors entitled \u201cFlow Tiered VPDES Permit\u201d (\u201cMemorandum\u201d). The Memorandum allowed for the issuance of flow-tiered VPDES permits. VPDES permits allow differing amounts of effluent to be discharged in correlation with the changes in river flow rates. For example, lower amounts of effluents could be discharged when river flow was the lowest, in the dry season, but higher amounts could be discharged in the rainy season when river flow was higher.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">By letter dated September 15, 1988, Rocco petitioned the Board to amend its VPDES permit, which limited emission based on a single yearly low river value, to a flow-tiered permit. On November 8 and 15, 1988, the Board published public notice of Rocco\u2019s application for the modification of its VPDES permit. Several citizens and interest groups, including EDF, expressed concerns over the draft permit. In response, the Board conducted a public hearing in Woodstock, Virginia, on February 28, 1989. EDF attended that meeting and made comments. Additionally, EDF submitted written comments for the Board\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>The Board authorized reissuance of the amended permit at the meeting on March 21, 1989. The amended permit became effective on April 28, 1989. On April 18, 1989, EDF requested a formal hearing in connection with the Board\u2019s decision to amend the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">On July 21, 1989, EDF filed an appeal in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond challenging the Board\u2019s decision to amend the VPDES permit (Rocco 1). EDF asserted that the Memorandum was improperly applied as a rule or regulation, although it had not been promulgated in accordance with the VAPA. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4 (defining the terms \u201crule\u201d and \u201cregulation\u201d). Also, EDF alleged that, in relaxing the VPDES limitations, the Board violated the \u201canti-backsliding\u201d provisions of the Board\u2019s regulations and federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">On June 16, 1989, the Board denied EDF\u2019s request for a formal hearing. In its letter denying EDF\u2019s petition for formal hearing, the Board stated that EDF was without standing to request a formal hearing. Also, the Board stated that EDF had not raised any genuine and substantial legal issues warranting a formal hearing. In a separate cause of action, EDF appealed this denial to the Richmond Circuit Court alleging that the Board\u2019s action was arbitrary and in violation of its own procedural rules (Rocco 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">On December 13, 1989, both cases were heard in the circuit court on demurrers alleging that EDF lacked standing to challenge the Board\u2019s actions. Rocco became a defendant through intervention.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The trial court found that two Code provisions are involved in determining whether EDF has standing in either case: Code \u00a7\u00a7 9-6.14:16 and 62.1-44.29. The trial court held that EDF could appeal under Code \u00a7 9-6.14:16 even if appeal was unavailable under Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 because the latter does not \u201cspecifically exclude appeal under the APA.\u201d Thus, EDF had standing to appeal if the court found it to be: (1) an \u201cowner aggrieved\u201d under Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29; (2) a \u201cperson affected by and claiming the unlawfulness of any regulation\u201d under Code \u00a7 9-6.14:16; or (3) a \u201cparty aggrieved by and claiming the unlawfulness of a case decision\u201d under Code \u00a7 9-6.14:16.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>The trial court found that EDF was not an \u201cowner aggrieved\u201d under Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 because it is not \u201can entity subject to the State Water Control Board\u2019s power and jurisdiction; <em>i.e., </em>an entity which owns or operates an actual or potential discharge source or a permit issued by the Board.\u201d EDF was not a \u201cperson affected\u201d by a regulation because in order for the Memorandum to be a regulation there must be \u201ca promulgation by an agency.\u201d Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4. Here, the Memorandum was merely a staff memorandum which was not promulgated by the agency, and was not binding on the Board. EDF was not a \u201cparty aggrieved\u201d because it was neither a \u201cparty\u201d nor was it \u201caggrieved.\u201d The trial court found that under the Board\u2019s Procedural Rule No. 1, section 1.13, only the applicant or permittee is a party capable of appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> EDF was also not \u201caggrieved\u201d by the Board\u2019s decision. The trial court noted that EDF, a non-profit environmental membership organization, appeared solely in a representative capacity for eight of its members, some of whom are riparian owners of Stony Creek and some who use the waterway for recreational purposes. The court found that EDF \u201cdoes not and cannot have (in a representational capacity) the same interests as one directly affected,\u201d citing <em>Virginia Beach Beautification Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>231 Va. 415, 344 S.E.2d 899 (1986). Since the court found the EDF was without standing in both cases, the demurrers were sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The first issue on appeal is whether the trial court erred in holding that Code \u00a7 9-6.14:16 afforded EDF a right of judicial review in addition to that provided in Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Code \u00a7 9-6.14:16 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">Any <em>person affected </em>by and claiming the unlawfulness of a regulation, or <em>party aggrieved </em>by and claiming unlawfulness of a case decision . . . shall have a right to direct review thereof ... in the manner provided by the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia, (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>(1) Any <em>owner aggrieved </em>by a final decision of the Board under \u00a7\u00a7 62.1-44.15(5), 62.1-44.15(8a), (8b), and (8c), 62.1-44.16, 62.1-44.17, 62.1-44.19 or \u00a7 62.1-44.25, whether such decision is affirmative or negative in form, is entitled to judicial review thereof in accordance with the provisions of the Administrative Process Act. (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">To determine how the standing requirements in the basic law<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the VAPA interrelate, the trial court referred to the statutorily declared policy of the VAPA. Code \u00a7 9-6.14:3 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">The purpose of this chapter is to supplement present and future basic laws conferring authority on agencies either to make regulations or decide cases as well as to standardize court review thereof save as laws hereafter enacted may otherwise expressly provide. This chapter does not supersede or repeal additional procedural requirements in such basic laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The trial court found that appeal was available under Code \u00a7 9-6.14:16, even if unavailable under Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29, because the basic law did not \u201cspecifically exclude the APA appeal.\u201d This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Code \u00a7 9-6.14:16 does not supplement Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 because the latter is not a \u201cbasic law conferring authority on agencies either to make regulations or decide cases.\u201d Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 is a statute providing for judicial review. The purpose of Code \u00a7 9-6.14:16 is to \u201cstandardize court review . . . <em>save as laws hereafter enacted may otherwise expressly provide.\u2019\u2019\u2019\u2019 </em>Code \u00a7 9-6.14:<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (emphasis added). The basic law does not, contrary to the trial court\u2019s view, have to \u201cspecifically exclude the APA appeal.\u201d3 Code \u00a7 9-6.14:16 gives deference to provisions of the basic law, such as Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29, which make express provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>for standing. This construction is supported by the concluding sentence of \u00a7 9-6.14:3 which states, \u201cThis chapter <em>does not supersede or repeal additional procedural requirement in such basic laws\u201d </em>(emphasis added). This statement would be mere surplus-age under the construction given Code \u00a7 9-6.14:16 by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The trial court\u2019s construction of Code \u00a7 9-6.14:16 also assumes that in retaining the \u201cowner aggrieved\u201d requirement in Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 the legislature intended \u201cto do a vain and useless thing.\u201d <em>See Williams </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>190 Va. 280, 293, 56 S.E.2d 537, 543 (1949). The \u201cowner aggrieved\u201d requirement is a more restrictive standard than \u201cperson affected\u201d or \u201cparty aggrieved.\u201d Had the legislature intended review to be standardized under Code \u00a7 9-6.14:16, it would have deleted the \u201cowner aggrieved\u201d requirement, as it deleted specific requirements in other sections.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">We hold that where the basic law contains a specific standing requirement, such as that contained in Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29, this requirement is controlling over the standardized court review in Code \u00a7 9-6.14:16. Thus, in determining whether EDF had standing to appeal, review is limited to whether EDF is an \u201cowner aggrieved\u201d under Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>The trial court interpreted \u201cowner,\u201d as defined in Code \u00a7 62.1-44.3(5),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to mean \u201cany entity subject to the State Water Control Board\u2019s power and jurisdiction; <em>i.e., </em>any entity which owns or operates an actual or potential discharge source or a permit issued by the Board.\u201d Under this definition, the trial court found that EDF is not an \u201cowner aggrieved\u201d and had no standing to appeal. The correctness of the trial court\u2019s construction is evidenced by the 1990 amendment to Code \u00a7 62.1-44.3(5), which added the limitation: \u201cthat owns, operates, charters, rents, or otherwise exercises control over or is responsible for any actual or potential discharge of sewage, industrial wastes, or other wastes to state waters, or any facility or operation that has the capability to alter the physical, chemical, or biological properties of state waters in contravention of \u00a7 62.1-44.5.\u201d Absent a finding that EDF is an \u201cowner,\u201d it cannot have standing under \u00a7 62.1-44.29. Therefore, the trial court was correct in sustaining the demurrer in Rocco 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Since EDF was without standing to challenge the final decision of the Board, EDF is necessarily without standing to assert the underlying substantive argument that the Memorandum was improperly applied as a rule or regulation, the third issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The final issue raised by EDF is the propriety of the Board\u2019s denial of EDF\u2019s request for a formal hearing.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Board denied EDF\u2019s petition, stating that EDF was without standing to petition for a hearing and, in any event, had failed to raise substantial issues of law or fact. The denial of this petition was appealed in the trial court in Rocco 2. The trial court found that EDF was without standing to appeal the decision of the Board. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>this issue was not squarely addressed by the trial court, this finding was necessarily based on the trial court\u2019s finding that EDF had no standing under Code \u00a7\u00a7 9-6.14:16 or 62.1-44.29.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The right to a formal hearing is governed by the VAPA and the basic law. Code \u00a7 9-6.14:12(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">The agency <em>shall </em>afford opportunity for the formal taking of evidence upon rel\u00e9vant fact issues in any case in which the basic law provides expressly for decisions upon or after hearing and <em>may </em>do so in any case to the extent that informal procedures under \u00a7 9-6.14.11 have not been had or have failed to dispose of a case by consent, (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">The basic law does not expressly provide for issuance of VPDES permits only upon or after formal hearings. Therefore, formal hearings are not mandatory under Code \u00a7 9-6.14:12. However, Code \u00a7 62.1-44.25 provides for a formal hearing for any \u201cowner\u201d that is aggrieved by any action taken by the Board without a formal hearing. In addition, the Board\u2019s Procedural Rule 1, \u00a7 1.23(a), provides that the \u201capplicant or permittee or any person aggrieved\u201d may petition for a formal hearing. The Board\u2019s Executive Secretary shall authorize a formal hearing if the petition raises \u201cgenuine and substantial issues of law or fact which, if resolved adversely to the petitioner, would result in injury to the petitioner.\u201d Procedural Rule 1, \u00a7 1.23(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">The true issue is whether EDF can appeal the denial of a request for a formal hearing to the circuit court. Appeal is unavailable under the VAPA. Code \u00a7 9-6.14:16 provides for appeal by a \u201cparty aggrieved by and claiming unlawfulness of a case decision.\u201d The denial of EDF\u2019s request for a formal hearing was not a \u201ccase decision\u201d as that term is defined in Code \u00a7 9-6.14:4(D).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> EDF was not a \u201cnamed party\u201d in the proceedings before the State Water Control Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Appeal is also unavailable under the basic law. The Board\u2019s Procedural Rule 1 does not provide for appeal from such a decision. Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29 limits judicial review to any \u201cowner aggrieved\u201d by a decision under Code \u00a7 62.1-44.25, whether the action is affirmative or negative in form. In so doing, the legislature has limited review to \u201cowners.\u201d As we have already determined, EDF is not an \u201cowner\u201d as defined by the basic law. Therefore, EDF is without standing to challenge the denial of the petition for formal hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">In conclusion, we hold that where there is a specific provision for standing in the basic law, that provision of basic law is controlling over the VAPA. The legislature has limited those that can appeal decisions of the State Water Control Board to \u201cowners aggrieved.\u201d Code \u00a7 62.1-44.29. \u201cOwner,\u201d as used in the basic law, refers to an entity exercising control over a potential discharge site. Under this definition, EDF, a non-profit environmental group, is without standing. Similarly, standing to challenge the denial of a formal hearing has been limited to \u201cowners.\u201d Accordingly, the decisions of the trial court in sustaining the demurrers are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Barrow, J., and Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b505-14\"> Judge Cole prepared and the Court adopted the opinion in this case prior to the effective date of his retirement on April 30, 1991.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b508-9\"> Procedural Rule No. 1, section 1.13 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">The applicant or permittee shall be a party to the public hearing.
