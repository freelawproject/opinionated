He claims in each instance the evidence was insufficient and that his prior convictions were not \u201clike\u201d shoplifting or concealment of merchandise. We affirm and hold that stealing a check in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-98 is \u201clike\u201d concealing merchandise in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-103 for purposes of enhancing punishment under Code \u00a7 18.2-104(b), and is an offense \u201cdeemed to be larceny\u201d for purposes of enhancing punishment under Code \u00a7 19.2-297.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-13\">On appeal, we construe the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inference fairly deducible therefrom. <em>Higginbotham </em>v. <em>Common</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number><em>wealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-5\">On October 24, 1989, Stamps was shopping in a supermarket when he was observed concealing throat lozenges, candy, a tea strainer, lunch meat and ham underneath his shirt and in the inside pocket of his coat. He was convicted of violating Code \u00a7 18.2-103, concealment of merchandise and punished pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-104(b) because it was his third offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Later, on November 21, 1989, as Stamps was leaving a Peoples Drug Store, a check point alarm sounded. Store employees asked Stamps to return to the store. There, Stamps removed from his person a bottle of cologne that belonged to the store and threw it onto a store shelf. For this he was convicted of petit larceny and punished pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-297 because it was his third offense. In each case, to enhance his punishment, the Commonwealth proved that Stamps previously had been convicted of grand larceny in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-95, and larceny of a check in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-104(b) provides that when a person has been convicted of concealing merchandise, he shall be found guilty of a Class 6 felony if. he has twice previously been convicted of \u201cthe like offense ... or for a violation of \u00a7 18.2-95 or \u00a7 18.2-96.\u201d The \u201clike offense\u201d must be \u201clike\u201d concealment or taking of merchandise, as defined in Code \u00a7 18.2-103.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-8\">The violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-95, grand larceny, is specifically provided for in Code \u00a7 18.2-104(b) as an offense that may be used to enhance punishment. Thus, the question is whether larceny of a check in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-98 may be used to enhance punishment. The mere fact that Code \u00a7 18.2-104(b) contains, in addition to the phrase \u201clike offense,\u201d an express reference to Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-95 and 18.2-96 does not require a conclusion that a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-98 is not a \u201clike offense.\u201d It is not unusual for the legislature to include overlapping terms in one section. <em>See Diggs </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>6 Va. App. 300, 304, 369 S.E.2d 199, 201 (1988) (en banc). Code \u00a7 18.2-103 involves the physical concealment on one\u2019s person or taking of property of another against the will of its owner. The crime is complete as of the time of the taking or concealment of the merchandise on the person with the requisite intent. Code \u00a7 18.2-98 states that \u201c[i]f any person steal any . . . check ... he shall be deemed guilty of lar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>ceny thereof.\u201d Thus, both crimes involve the physical taking of property with a larcenous intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-4\">This case may be distinguished from <em>Snead </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>11 Va. App. 643, 400 S.E.2d 806 (1991), where we held that issuing a bad check, a violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-181, was not \u201clike\u201d concealment of merchandise and does not trigger enhanced punishment under Code \u00a7 18.2-104(b). In <em>Snead, </em>we held that the elements of issuing a bad check and willfully concealing merchandise with the intent to commit fraud are different. <em>Id. </em>at 648, 400 S.E.2d at 807. The criminal act involved in issuing a bad check is writing or issuing the check. The criminal act in concealing merchandise is concealing or taking. However, both concealment under Code \u00a7 18.2-103 and theft of a check under Code \u00a7 18.2-98 require proof of a \u201clike\u201d act, a similar element \u2014taking (concealing) against the will of the owner. Thus, stealing a check is \u201clike\u201d concealing merchandise.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-5\">With regard to the third offense petit larceny conviction, it is clear that both prior convictions are included as offenses for enhanced punishment. Code \u00a7 19.2-297 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-6\">When a person is convicted of petit larceny, and it is . . . found . . . that he has been before sentenced ... for <em>any larceny </em>or any offense <em>deemed to be larceny </em>by the law of the sentencing jurisdiction, he shall be confined in jail not less than thirty days or more than twelve months; for a third, or any subsequent offense, he shall be guilty of a Class six felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">Here, one conviction was for grand larceny, Code \u00a7 18.2-95, which fits the \u201cany larceny\u201d criterion; the other conviction was for the stealing of a bad check, Code \u00a7 18.2-98, which fits the \u201coffense deemed to be larceny\u201d criterion.</p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">We do not consider the other questions raised on brief because they were not raised in the trial court and, thus, may not be raised on appeal. Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">Coleman, J., and Duff, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
