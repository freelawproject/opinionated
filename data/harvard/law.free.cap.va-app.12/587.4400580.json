Three or more convictions ... of the following . . . offenses:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-10\">b. Driving or operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants or drugs in violation of \u00a7 18.2-266;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-11\">c. Driving a motor vehicle while his license, permit, or privilege to drive a motor vehicle has been suspended or revoked in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-272, 46.2-301 or \u00a7 46.2-302;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-12\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-13\">3. The offenses included in subdivisions 1 and 2 of this section shall be deemed to include offenses under any valid county, city, or town ordinance paralleling and substantially conforming to the state statutory provisions cited in subdivisions 1 and 2 of this section and all changes in or amendments thereof, and any federal law, any law of another state or any valid county, city, or town ordinance of another state substantially conforming to the aforesaid state statutory provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>Although this is a civil proceeding, its effect is to impose a forfeiture. Therefore, the operative statute must be strictly construed against the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The appellant\u2019s two convictions for driving while intoxicated are embraced within Code \u00a7\u00a7 46.2-35l(l)(b) and 46.2-351(3). He argues that his conviction for operating a motor vehicle in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-271.1 does not fall within the purview of Code \u00a7 46.2- 351, because there is no reference therein to Code \u00a7 18.2-271.1. He concedes that Code \u00a7 18.2-271.1(E) provides that any person who operates a motor vehicle in violation of the restrictions of a license issued pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-271.1 shall be guilty of a violation of former Code \u00a7 46.1-350, but argues that Code \u00a7 46.2- 351 also makes no reference to former Code \u00a7 46.1-350.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Chapter 727 of the Acts of Assembly (1989) repealed Title 46.1 of the Code of Virginia and enacted Title 46.2. The act provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\">That whenever any of the conditions, requirements, provisions, or contents of any section, article, or chapter of Title 46.1 or any other title of this Code as such titles existed prior to October 1, 1989, are transferred in the same or modified form to a new section, article, or chapter of this title or any other title of this Code and whenever any such former section, article, or chapter is given a new number in this or any other title, all references to any such former section, article, or chapter of Title 46.1 or other title appearing in this Code shall be construed to apply to the new or renumbered section, article, or chapter containing such conditions, requirements, provisions, contents, or portions thereof. 1989 Va. Acts 1926.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-10\">Code \u00a7 18.2-271.1(E) expressly provided that the appellant\u2019s November 28, 1988 conviction for operating a motor vehicle in violation of restrictions imposed by Code \u00a7 18.2-271.1 was a violation of Code \u00a7 46.1-350. The quoted provision of the 1989 Acts translates that reference to Code \u00a7 46.2-301, a violation expressly embraced within the scope of Code \u00a7 46.2-351. Therefore, the trial court acted properly in considering that conviction in adjudging the appellant an habitual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Duff, J., and Moon, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
