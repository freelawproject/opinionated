We hold that the defendant\u2019s role as a teacher supervising the victim who was his student is not sufficient, standing alone, to constitute intimidation used to sexually abuse her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-9\">The defendant, a teacher in a Chesterfield County middle school, was serving as a tutor-moderator for an in-house suspension program. The victim, a fifteen-year-old eighth grader, participated in the program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-10\">The suspension was conducted in a room with about twelve students. All of the other students\u2019 desks faced a wall away from the defendant\u2019s desk. The victim\u2019s desk faced a different wall.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-11\">The victim asked the defendant if she could come up to his desk for help with some school work. The victim testified that defendant said to her, \u201cfor a D, eight or ten inches that a black man could do it for \u2014 that you need about nine or ten inches that a black man could do it for you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-12\">Later, the victim again went up to the defendant to get the defendant\u2019s help with an assignment. She had raised her hand to ask the defendant about a spelling problem because she did not want to go up to his desk. However, according to the victim\u2019s testimony \u201c[the defendant] said, \u2018Michelle, what word goes with this?\u2019 And he was calling out a bunch of words. \u2018Why don\u2019t you come up?\u2019 And I was right at his desk and in a chair, school seat. And he was helping me. And he grabbed my right breast.\u201d She further testified that the defendant reached down the right side of her neck to her left side and grabbed her breast. The victim then returned to her own seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b1212-13\">Shortly thereafter, the victim told the defendant that she needed to be excused from the classroom to obtain a worker\u2019s per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>mit. When the defendant\u2019s wife, another teacher in the school, relieved him, the defendant accompanied the victim to the guidance office. The victim testified that once out of the classroom, the defendant remarked, \u201cI ought to take you back in the woods and screw you.\u201d The victim reported the incident to a teacher and the principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-5\">The victim had spent the previous year in eighth grade as well. The defendant\u2019s wife had taught the victim math the previous year and had given her a failing grade. The victim had met the defendant during that first year. The defendant would help the victim with her problems, and she considered him a friend.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-6\">The defendant contends insufficient evidence existed to prove the elements of force, threat, or intimidation necessary for a conviction of sexual battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-7\">Sexual battery occurs when one sexually abuses another against the other\u2019s will \u201cby force, threat or intimidation, or through the use of the complaining witness\u2019 mental incapacity or physical helplessness.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-67.4. \u201c[S]ome force other than merely that force required to accomplish the unlawful touching\u201d is required to constitute sexual battery. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>5 Va. App. 529, 534, 365 S.E.2d 237, 240 (1988). Further, \u201cunless some force is used to overcome the will of the complaining witness, the unlawful touching constitutes common law assault and battery,\u201d rather than sexual battery. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1213-8\">The Commonwealth agrees that the defendant did not force or threaten the victim but contends he intimidated her. The defendant was in a position of authority over the victim by virtue of his role as a monitor in the suspension program. Thus, the Commonwealth argues, the defendant used his position to intimidate the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1213-9\">Intimidation need not be by threats of violence or bodily harm. <em>Harris v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 519, 521, 351 S.E.2d 356, 357 (1986). It does, however, require that a victim be put \u201cin fear of bodily harm by exercising such domination and control of her as to overcome her mind and overbear her will.\u201d <em>Sutton v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 654, 663, 324 S.E.2d 665, 670 (1985). Psychological pressure may be intimidation if imposed \u201con one who, under the circumstances, is vulnerable and susceptible to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>such pressure.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1214-5\">The evidence in this case, however, when viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, does not reveal that the defendant intimidated the victim. He did not \u201covercome her mind and overbear her will\u201d by the exercise of \u201cdominion and control of her.\u201d He did not use his position to threaten her with disciplinary action or other adverse consequences to accomplish his goal. He may have abused his position of trust as a teacher and may have used his position as a subterfuge, but neither his words nor his conduct served to dominate or control her so as to \u201covercome her mind and overbear her will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-6\">Therefore, the defendant\u2019s judgment of conviction is reversed, and the proceeding is remanded to permit the Commonwealth to prosecute the defendant for a lesser offense, if it so chooses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1214-8\">Benton, J., and Elder, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
