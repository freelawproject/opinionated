Approximately a year later, the Ulericks separated and were divorced. Upon their separation, Mrs. Ulerick commenced cohabitation with Kogon, whom she subsequently married. At the time of the child\u2019s conception, Mrs. Ulerick was involved in an adulterous relationship with Kogon. HLA tests eliminated the possibility that Ulerick could be the child\u2019s father and established a likelihood of over ninety-nine percent that Kogon was the father. Based on these circumstances, and on the child\u2019s resemblance to Kogon, the juvenile and domestic relations district court ruled that Kogon is the child\u2019s father. However, it ordered that Ulerick be granted visitation on a basis which it specified. Upon proof that Kogon denied that visitation, the juvenile and domestic relations district court convicted him of contempt. On appeal, the circuit court upheld and reimposed the contempt conviction. We find that the juvenile and domestic relations district court was without jurisdiction and authority to order visitation by Ulerick. Therefore, we reverse the conviction for contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">In matters concerning custody and visitation, the welfare arid best interests of the child are the \u201cprimary, paramount, and controlling consideration[s].\u201d <em>Mullen </em>v. <em>Mullen, </em>188 Va. 259, 269, 49 S.E.2d 349, 354 (1948). \u201cA child\u2019s continuing relationship with both parents [is] an important consideration.\u201d <em>M.E.D. </em>v. <em>J.P.M., </em>3 Va. App. 391, 397, 350 S.E.2d 215, 219 (1986). Except under unusual circumstances, a child\u2019s best interests are served by maintaining close ties between him and his non-custodial parent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number><em>Eichelberger </em>v. <em>Eichelberger, 2 </em>Va. App. 409, 412, 345 S.E.2d 10, 12 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">The common law right of visitation extends only to parents. Absent an express statutory grant of jurisdiction, the courts may not order visitation with a child by a non-parent over the objection of the custodial parent. <em>West v. King, </em>220 Va. 754, 756, 263 S.E.2d 386, 387 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In <em>West, </em>the court considered the effect of Code \u00a7 16.1-241, which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-6\">[E]ach juvenile and domestic relations district court shall have . . . exclusive original jurisdiction . . . over all cases, matters and proceedings involving:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-7\">A. The custody, visitation, support, control or disposition of a child:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-9\">3. Whose custody, visitation or support is a subject of controversy or requires determination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-10\"><em>See West, </em>220 Va. at 756, 263 S.E.2d at 387. Holding that this statute did not authorize the award of visitation rights to a grandparent over the objection of the custodial parent, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-11\">As between a parent who has been awarded custody of a child, on the one hand, and, on the other, third persons, including grandparents, the rights of the custodial parent are paramount; the parent has the authority to control the child and to determine with whom it visits. If these rights are to be derogated by a grant of jurisdiction purporting to permit the award of grandparental visitation privileges despite the custodial parent\u2019s objection, then the grant should be specific, reflecting the legislative intent in unambiguous language.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-12\">In our opinion, the language of \u00a7 16.1-241 (A)(3) is completely inadequate to confer jurisdiction to award the visitation privileges sought by the grandmother here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 756-57, 263 S.E.2d at 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Subsequent to <em>West, </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-241(A) was amended to include the following unnumbered paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">The authority of the juvenile court to adjudicate matters involving the custody, visitation, support, control or disposition of a child shall not be limited to the consideration of petitions filed by a mother, father or legal guardian but shall include petitions filed at any time by any party with a legitimate interest therein. A party with a legitimate interest shall be broadly construed and shall include, but not be limited to, grandparents, and other blood relatives and family members. The authority of the juvenile court to consider a petition involving the custody of a child shall not be proscribed or limited where the child has previously been awarded to the custody of a local board of social services. <em>In any decree involving visitation, the juvenile and domestic relations district court may provide in such decree for visitation privileges for grandparents, stepparents or other family members.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">The trial court based its decision upholding the award of visitation to Ulerick on the broad construction to be given to the term \u201cparty with a legitimate interest.\u201d This term is not limited to those enjoying a family relationship. However, this term applies only to those whose petitions may be considered. The authority for an award of visitation is defined by the last sentence, which we have emphasized. This authority is limited. It permits only the award of visitation to grandparents, stepparents, or other family members.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">Ulerick is not the child\u2019s father. He is not a grandparent. He is not married to the child\u2019s mother. He bears no family relationship to the child, either by blood or by law. He is not the child\u2019s stepfather. <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(6th ed. 1990) defines stepfather as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-9\">The husband of one\u2019s mother by virtue of a marriage subsequent to that of which the person spoken of is the offspring.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">This definition excludes Ulerick. Even should the term be construed more broadly to include him by virtue of his previous mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>riage to the child\u2019s mother, nonetheless, that step-parental relationship, being dependent upon his marriage to the mother, was extinguished upon the dissolution of that marriage. <em>See NPA </em>v. <em>WPA, </em>8 Va. App. 246, 251, 380 S.E.2d 178, 181 (1989). However tragic and appealing his case may be, Ulerick enjoys no legal visitation rights with respect to the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The juvenile and domestic relations district court was without jurisdiction to order Kogon to afford Ulerick visitation rights. That order being void, its violation will not support a judgment for contempt. <em>See Leisge v. Leisge, </em>224 Va. 303, 306, 296 S.E.2d 538, 540 (1982); <em>Laing </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>205 Va. 511, 513, 137 S.E.2d 896, 898 (1964); <em>Robertson v. Commonwealth, </em>181 Va. 520, 536, 25 S.E.2d 352, 358 (1943). Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">Keenan, J., and Cole, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b647-8\"> Judge Cole participated in the hearing and decision of this case prior to the effective date of his retirement on April 30, 1991 and thereafter by designation pursuant to Code \u00a7 17-116.01.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
