We conclude that, if it plainly appears from the facts and circumstances of a particular case that a non-constitutional error did not affect the verdict, the error is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-7\">In Virginia, non-constitutional error is harmless \u201c[w]hen it <em>plainly appears </em>from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-678 (emphasis added). \u201c[A] fair trial on the merits and substantial justice\u201d are not achieved if an error at trial has affected the verdict. Consequently, under Code \u00a7 8.01-678, a criminal conviction must be reversed unless \u201cit plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that\u201d the error did not affect the verdict. An error does not affect a verdict if a reviewing court can conclude, without usurping the jury\u2019s fact finding function, that, had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-8\">Constitutional error, on the other hand, is harmless only when the reviewing court is \u201cable to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967). The federal standard is not required, however, for a non-constitutional error. <em>See Mu\u2019Min </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>239 Va. 433, 442 n.4, 389 S.E.2d 886, 892 n.4, <em>cert. granted in part, </em>111 S. Ct. 242 (1990), <em>aff'd, </em>111 S. Ct. 1899 (1991). While the federal standard expressly adopts \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d as the reviewing court\u2019s required level of confidence, the statutory standard for non-constitutional error does not.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1053-9\">Use of the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard, while an appropriate measure of confidence in fact finding, is an unusual device to use in deciding questions of law. Like \u201cpreponderance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>the evidence\u201d and \u201cclear and convincing evidence,\u201d \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d is a relative and subjective standard suitable for measuring the probability of the occurrence of a past event. But, in determining if an error is harmless, a reviewing court does not decide the probability of the occurrence of a past event, i.e., if, in fact, the defendant committed the crime charged. It determines, instead, whether, as a matter of law, this decision by the fact finder was affected by the error. If so, the error is not harmless; if not, the error is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">In making this decision with respect to non-constitutional error, the level of confidence used by a reviewing court is not \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d It is, instead, whether \u201cit plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at trial,\u201d a more absolute measure and one more suitable for application to questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">This does not mean, however, that the burden of proof at trial is not a consideration in a harmless error analysis. Even though the burden of proof at trial is not part of the test for measuring whether non-constitutional error is harmless, a reviewing court must take into account the burden of proof applied at trial when evaluating the impact of an error upon a verdict. To the extent that the impact of an error on a verdict is affected by the burden of proof, in a criminal case, the reviewing court must consider that the fact finder was required to reach its verdict \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-7\">Code \u00a7 8.01-678 applies to both civil and criminal cases. By requiring a reviewing court to consider the applicable burden of proof at trial, the provisions of Code \u00a7 8.01-678 can be applied to both civil and criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-8\">The test for harmless error should complement rather than subvert the burden of proof at trial. Saltzburg, <em>The Harm of Harmless </em>Error, 59 Va. L. Rev. 988, 989 (1973). A civil case having a burden of proof with a lower degree of certainty than that required in a criminal case generally will not be tested for harmless error with the higher degree of certainty required by the burden of proof for criminal cases. Similarly, a criminal case requiring a higher degree of certainty in the burden of proof should not be tested for harmless error with the lower degree of certainty required by the burden of proof in civil cases. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1055-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1007\">*1007</page-number>In criminal cases, the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is a constitutional requirement of due process. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970). Only by considering the burden of proof applied at trial when determining harmless error on appeal can this constitutional requirement be preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">In this case, in order to determine if it plainly appears that the error did not affect the verdict, we must review the record and the evidence and evaluate the effect the error may have had on how the finder of fact resolved the contested issues. The defendant was tried for robbery of a music store employee who was on his way to make a night deposit at a bank. The employee who was robbed and another employee who was with him at the time of the robbery testified that the defendant was the robber. A nearby storekeeper identified the defendant as the person who she saw run past her when she heard cries from the employee who was robbed. A fourth person testified that he had seen the defendant in the vicinity at the time of the robbery. On the other hand, the defendant\u2019s mother, the mother\u2019s boyfriend, one of the defendant\u2019s friends, and the defendant all testified that at the time of the robbery the defendant was at his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">During cross-examination, the defendant admitted that while he was a juvenile he had been found not innocent of two felonies. The trial court previously had ruled during a motion in limine, over the defendant\u2019s objection, that the prosecutor could ask the defendant on cross-examination whether he had been found not innocent of these ofFenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-7\">This was error,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but not one of constitutional dimension. As described in the panel opinion which heard this appeal, the prosecution has no constitutional right to cross-examine a defendant, and, in this case, the prosecution\u2019s cross-examination was limited by a policy of preserving a juvenile offender\u2019s anonymity as expressed in Virginia\u2019s juvenile law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-8\">In determining whether this error could have affected the verdict, we must first determine whether the trial court gave a curative instruction. If it gave a curative instruction to the jury, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1008\">*1008</page-number>the jury is presumed to have followed \u201can explicit cautionary instruction promptly given\u201d unless the record shows otherwise. <em>LeVasseur </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 564, 589, 304 S.E.2d 644, 657 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>464 U.S. 1063 (1984). If, however, the trial court did not give a curative instruction, the error is presumed to be prejudicial \u201cunless it plainly appears that it could not have affected the result.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 291, 296, 269 S.E.2d 811, 814 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">The use of presumptions for this purpose has been criticized because presumptions are \u201cill-suited for appellate purposes where the only valid presumption is that regularity in proceedings is so important that error may not be lightly disregarded.\u201d <em>Saltzburg, supra, </em>at 1018. However, these presumptions stand only at the threshold of the harmless error analysis and constitute no more than an expression of the principle embodied in Code \u00a7 8.01-678. Restated, these presumptions mean only that at the beginning of the harmless error analysis, if the record reveals that the trial court promptly instructed the jury to disregard the effect of erroneously admitted evidence, the reviewing court may assume that the jury followed that instruction unless the record \u201csuggests a manifest probability\u201d that it did not. <em>Boykins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 309, 313, 170 S.E.2d 771, 774 (1969). If, on the other hand, as in this case, there is no such instruction to rely upon, the reviewing court must consider the error prejudicial unless \u201cit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1009\">*1009</page-number>plainly appears from the record and the evidence\u201d that the verdict was not affected by the error. Code \u00a7 8.01-678.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">This presumption of prejudice, however, does not suggest the need for a perfect trial. \u201cNo trial is perfect, and error will at times creep in.\u201d <em>Parsons </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>154 Va. 832, 852, 152 S.E. 547, 554 (1930). \u201cEvery man is entitled to a fair trial and to nothing more, and so . . . out of the imperative demands of common sense, has grown the doctrine of harmless error.\u201d <em>Oliver </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>151 Va. 533, 541, 145 S.E. 307, 309 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">The effect of an error on a verdict varies widely \u201cdepending upon the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Story, </em>476 Pa. 391, 409, 383 A.2d 155, 164 (1978). Each case must, therefore, be analyzed individually to determine if an error has affected the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-7\">In this case, there was no instruction to the jury directing them to disregard the defendant\u2019s juvenile record. In fact, the trial court instructed the jury that it could consider the evidence \u201cas affecting his credibility.\u201d Consequently, we begin our analysis by considering the error prejudicial unless it plainly appears from the record and the evidence that the verdict was not affected by the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-8\">The decisive issue presented by the evidence at trial was whether the defendant was the perpetrator of the crime. The victim and a person who was with the victim said that the defendant was the robber. The other witnesses placed the defendant at the vicinity of the crime. These witnesses did not see any tattoos on the exposed arms of the robber even though the defendant has four tattoos on his arms. They did not see an injured ear on the robber even though the defendant had severely lacerated his ear eight days earlier which had required surgery and remained swollen and discolored. There were discrepancies in the testimony regarding height and hair color of the defendant. The defendant and three eyewitnesses testified that he was at home at the time of the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-9\">Only if the jury believed the eyewitnesses who said that the defendant was the robber or in the vicinity of the robbery and did not believe the defendant and the three witnesses who corroborated him, could it have found him guilty. The defendant\u2019s testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1010\">*1010</page-number>mony was critical. If it believed the defendant or could not decide whom to believe, it would have had to acquit him. Impeachment of the defendant, therefore, may have been a basis upon which the jury chose not to believe him. In addition, had the jury found the defendant\u2019s testimony incredible, it was entitled to infer that he had lied to conceal his guilt. <em>See Speight </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>4 Va. App. 83, 88, 354 S.E.2d 95, 99 (1987). Impeachment of the defendant, therefore, was an independent basis upon which the jury could have arrived at its verdict. We cannot say that impeachment of the defendant\u2019s exculpatory testimony was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">In summary, evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior juvenile record offered to impeach his testimony, if successful in achieving its purpose, could have affected the verdict. We cannot say, therefore, that, in spite of the erroneous admission of this evidence, \u201cit plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached.\u201d Consequently, the judgment of conviction is reversed and the proceeding is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-7\">Koontz, C.J., Benton, J., Duff, J., Moon, J., Cole, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1053-10\"> We overrule the holding of a panel of this court in <em>White </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>9 Va. App. 366, 388 S.E.2d 645 (1990), that the federal test for harmless error applicable to constitutional error is also applicable to non-constitutional error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1055-9\"> For the reasons stated in its opinion, the panel which heard this appeal determined that this was error. The office of the Attorney General did not contest this holding in its petition for rehearing; therefore, we conclude that for purposes of this appeal it has acquiesced in it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1056-6\"> This principle has been consistently followed by Virginia courts in applying Code \u00a7 8.01-678 and is not, as suggested in Judge Keenan\u2019s concurring opinion, a new or inconsistently applied standard. <em>See Curtis v. </em>Commonwealth, 12 Va. App. 527, 405 S.E.2d 230 (1991); <em>White </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>9 Va. App. 366, 372, 388 S.E.2d 645, 648 (1990); <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.

Further, while the majority expressly states that it does not apply the \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard of <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18 (1967), to evaluate non-constitutional error, I believe that its standard is also more stringent than <em>Chapman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1058-10\">Code \u00a7 8.01-678 directs that the trial record be reviewed as a whole in determining whether trial error necessitates reversal of a cause. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1059-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>[W]hen it plainly appears from the record and the evidence given at the trial that the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached, no judgment shall be arrested or reversed ... [f] or any . . . defect, imperfection, or omission in the record, or for any other error committed on the trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">This language requires the reviewing court to consider the nature of the error committed, in the context of the entire case, to determine whether the parties have had a fair trial and substantial justice has been reached. In contrast, the majority opinion requires the reviewing court to consider the fact finder\u2019s original burden of proof in weighing the error and presume that the error is prejudicial unless the record affirmatively shows that it did not affect the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">Code \u00a7 8.01-678, however, does not require that the record affirmatively show that the error did not affect the verdict. Nevertheless, the majority imposes this requirement in the test that it articulates here. I believe that such a requirement is more stringent than the <em>Chapman </em>standard which the majority abandons today because this standard requires the reviewing court to find with certainty that the error had no effect upon the verdict, rather than simply finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the error was harmless. Even under the standard of review for constitutional error, \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d the reviewing court is not required to disclaim every possibility that the error may have influenced a juror\u2019s consideration of the case, but only that no reasonable doubt exists upon the whole record that the verdict was affected by the error. Justice Traynor has said that non-constitutional error is harmless when it is \u201chighly probable that the error did not affect the judgment.\u201d R. Traynor, <em>The Riddle of Harmless Error </em>34-35 (1976). I believe that is but yet another way of saying that it \u201cplainly appears ... the parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-7\">An appellate court must consider the error and evaluate its effect, if any, upon how the fact finder weighed and balanced the evidence or resolved the credibility of witnesses. Thus, while the appellate court, in considering whether error is harmless, does not weigh and balance the evidence in the role of fact finder to determine whether guilt has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>does evaluate how the error may have affected the weight of evidence and credibility of witnesses in deciding whether, in accordance with the mandate of Code \u00a7 8.01-678, \u201cthe parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">In applying Code \u00a7 8.01-678, our Supreme Court has applied several tests for analyzing non-constitutional error. I believe that each of those tests is but another expression by the Supreme Court, in the context of the particular case, of the statutory standard that error will be deemed harmless when it \u201cplainly appears\u201d that \u201cthe parties have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached.\u201d In <em>Boykins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 309, 313, 170 S.E.2d 771, 774 (1969), the Court stated: \u201c[A] conviction should not be reversed unless the introduction of improper evidence suggests a manifest probability that it was prejudicial to the defendant.\u201d The use of this \u201ctest\u201d by the Court appears to be limited to cases of non-constitutional error where a timely curative instruction has been given. In other cases involving non-constitutional error, our Supreme Court has cited Code \u00a7 8.01-678 while at the same time holding that the error at issue was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>See Hopkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>230 Va. 280, 337 S.E.2d 264 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1098 (1986); <em>Rozier v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 525, 248 S.E.2d 789 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">Other \u201ctests\u201d for non-constitutional error have also been employed by the Supreme Court. In <em>Overbee </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>227 Va. 238, 315 S.E.2d 242 (1984), the Court looked to whether the evidence exclusive of the improper evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to support the conviction. In <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 534, 311 S.E.2d 769 (1984), the Court held that error in the admission of expert opinion may be harmless when the other evidence of guilt is overwhelming. In <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 713, 292 S.E.2d 358 (1982), the Court found that reversal was not required on the basis that the improper evidence did not excite the passions of the jury. In <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 291, 296, 269 S.E.2d 811, 814 (1980), cited by the majority, the Court held that error is \u201cpresumed to be prejudicial unless it plainly appears that it could not have affected the result.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-7\">I do not believe that these cases, considered as a whole, require an initial presumption that the error is prejudicial unless the rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>ord affirmatively shows that it did not affect the result. Although <em>Caldwell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 291, 269 S.E.2d 811 (1980), cited by the majority, speaks of a presumption of prejudice, numerous Supreme Court cases following it do not. Further, while <em>Caldwell </em>has been cited by the Court in some of its decisions, many more cases decided since <em>Caldwell </em>have employed other tests for the review of non-constitutional error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">I disagree with the majority\u2019s decision to single out and select the <em>Caldwell </em>standard as a new uniform standard for application of Code \u00a7 8.01-678, particularly since <em>Caldwell </em>provides a more strict standard than <em>Chapman. </em>As recently as <em>Mu\u2019Min v. Commonwealth, </em>239 Va. 433, 442 n.4, 389 S.E.2d 886, 892 n.4 (1990), the Supreme Court noted that use of the <em>Chapman </em>standard is not required in reviewing cases of non-constitutional error. Since use of the <em>Chapman </em>standard is not required here, I conclude that use of the more stringent <em>Caldwell </em>standard is likewise not required. For this reason, I do not join in adopting the majority\u2019s new test which effectively paraphrases <em>Caldwell.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">Applying the plain language of Code \u00a7 8.01-678 to the case before us, I would find that a fair trial was not had on the merits. Lavinder\u2019s credibility was critical because his testimony and the testimony of his witnesses directly contradicted the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. Therefore, the admission of the improper impeachment evidence does not, in my view, satisfy the standard of review provided in Code \u00a7 8.01-678. Accordingly, I concur in the majority\u2019s decision to reverse and remand this matter for a new trial if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b1058-12\"> Justice Keenan participated in the hearing and decision of this case prior to her investiture as a Justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
