State Water Control Bd. v. Appalachian Power Co., </em>9 Va. App. 254, 386 S.E.2d 633 (1989). A majority of the panel upheld the circuit court\u2019s ruling that the standards were invalid because the SWCB, before amending its water quality standards, failed to hold an evidential hearing as required by its basic law, Code \u00a7\u00a7 62.1-44.15(3a) and 9-6.14:8. We granted the Commonwealth a rehearing <em>en banc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">Initially, Appalachian Power Co. (APCo) contends that the issue whether the SWCB\u2019s water quality standards were valid is no longer justiciable because the SWCB promulgated new regulations (Virginia Register, Vol. 5, Issue 23, pp. 3535-3538), effective September 13, 1989, which replaced the regulations that APCo was challenging, thereby rendering moot the validity of the former regulations. Also, APCo contends that in 1989 the legislature amended Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15(3a), the basic law governing the SWCB, to provide that the SWCB must hold a formal evidential hearing only \u201cupon the request of an affected person or upon its own motion.\u201d Therefore, the issue whether the SWCB was required, or will be required for future regulations, to hold an evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>dential hearing has been mooted by the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-4\">We hold that the validity of the SWCB\u2019s regulation was not moot for two reasons. First, the issue before the Circuit Court of the City of Roanoke, and before us on appeal, was whether the regulations promulgated October 7, 1987, were valid and thereby restricted the amount of chlorine or other halogen compounds which APCo or others could legally discharge into Virginia waters after that date. The fact that superseding regulations may have been validly adopted on September 13, 1989, does not render moot whether the regulations of September 29, 1987, were valid and whether they controlled the extent of discharge into state waters from the date of enactment until 1989. While emergency standards were promulgated after the circuit court ruled the permanent standards invalid, the validity and applicability of the standards, at least for that period of time before the emergency standards were passed, is a significant and viable issue. Likewise, the 1989 amendment by the legislature to Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15(3a), while it may have a bearing upon the construction of the statute, does not render moot the issue whether the SWCB was required to hold an evidential hearing in 1987 in order to have promulgated a valid standard that would regulate those who discharged chlorine into Virginia waters between 1987 and 1989. In summary, the same controversy which existed between the parties throughout this litigation exists now; the validity of the regulations from 1987 through 1989 remains a viable and justiciable issue between the parties. \u201cAs long as the parties have a concrete interest in the outcome of the litigation, the case is not moot notwithstanding the size of the dispute.\u201d <em>Firefighters Local Union No. 1784 </em>v. <em>Stotts, </em>467 U.S. 561, 571 (1984) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Second, even where parties no longer have a legally cognizable interest in the outcome of the litigation, a court may proceed to adjudicate a controversy under the \u201ccapable of repetition, but evading review\u201d exception to the requirements of standing or justiciability. <em>Murphy v. Hunt, </em>455 U.S. 478, 481-82 (1982).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>the validity and enforceability of permanent agency regulations have been challenged in the courts, if the agency by enacting an emergency regulation renders moot the question of the validity of the permanent regulation, every challenged regulation which the agency has deemed it necessary to keep in force by emergency measures would be placed beyond review. The validity of all such regulations as they may apply to APCo and to others similarly situated is likely to arise again unless the questions raised by this litigation and the shadow which has been cast over the regulations are addressed and resolved. Thus, we find that a real controversy does exist between the parties to the extent that the validity of the regulation may bear upon pending controversies or enforcement procedures implemented by the SWCB against APCo or others who may have been subject to the regulation by discharging chlorine or halogen compounds into state waters after October 7, 1987. The regulation, if valid, would have been the only applicable and controlling regulation at various times between 1987 and 1989. Accordingly, we hold that the validity of the 1987 regulation is a justiciable issue which was not mooted when the SWCB promulgated its emergency or replacement regulation or by the General Assembly amending Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-4\">We turn to whether the Circuit Court of the City of Roanoke erred when it ruled that Code \u00a7\u00a7 9-6.14:8 and 62.1-44.15(3a) required the SWCB to hold an evidential hearing, even though not requested by an affected party, in order to validly amend its water quality standards. We affirm the judgment of the circuit court for the reasons stated in an opinion by the majority of a panel of this Court in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. State Water Control Board </em>v. <em>Appalachian Power Co., 9 </em>Va. App. 254, 386 S.E.2d 633 (1989). <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Chief Judge Koontz, joined by Judge Duff, dissents from this holding and would decide that the regulations were validly enacted for those reasons stated in <em>Appalachian Power Co., 9 </em>Va. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>App. at 262, 386 S.E.2d at 637. Judges Benton, Keenan, and Barrow do not reach this issue because they consider it to be a moot proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">On this record we find no basis to support a claim by APCo that the SWCB acted unreasonably in attempting to promulgate its water quality standards or in prosecuting its appeals. Accordingly, we deny its request under Code \u00a7 9-6.14:21 for costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Baker, J., Moon, J., Cole, J., and Willis, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b123-6\"> The validity of regulations from other agencies which must conform with the requirements of Code \u00a7 9-6.14:8 and which have provisions in their basic law paralleling Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15(3a) may have been called into question by the holding in <em>Commonwealth ex rel. State Water Control Board </em>v. <em>Appalachian Power Co., </em>9 Va. App. 254, 386 S.E.2d 633 (1989). While other agencies who are not a party to this proceeding and their regulations are not in issue, the SWCB and APCo, as well as other agencies, have a real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>interest in having a resolution of the question because the question is capable of repetition if the panel decision looms unresolved.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b124-7\"> The legislature amended Code \u00a7 62.1 -44.15(3a) in 1989 by deleting the requirement that the SWCB as part of its triennial review shall \u201chold hearings as hereinafter provided\u201d by the Administrative Process Act (\u00a7 9-6.14:1 <em>et seq.) </em>and provided that evidential hearings pursuant to \u00a7 9-6.14:8 shall be \u201cupon the request of an affected person or upon its [the SWCB\u2019s] own motion.\u201d Thus, under the 1989 amendment, the basic law governing the SWCB does not require an evidential hearing provided by \u00a7 9-6.14:8 except upon request or upon its own motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b125-7\">Benton, J., joined by Barrow, J., and Kennan, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AQi\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">A case is moot when, upon \u201cthe termination of the circumstances out of which a controversy arose ... an adjudication upon the merits could serve no useful purpose beyond the gratification of a litigious party\u2019s will to win.\u201d Note, <em>\u201cMoot\u201d Administrative Orders, </em>53 Harv. L. Rev. 628 (1940). \u201c \u2018The duty of this court as to every other judicial tribunal, is <em>to decide actual controversies by a judgment which can be carried in effect, </em>and not to give opinions upon moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare principals or rules of law which cannot affect the matter in issue in the case before it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Potts </em>v. <em>Mathieson Alkali Works, </em>165 Va. 196, 225, 181 S.E. 521, 533 (1935) (quoting <em>Mills v. Green, </em>159 U.S. 651, 653 (1895)) (emphasis added). I would hold that the matter at issue in this appeal is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">The mootness doctrine applies to administrative law cases whenever the record establishes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b125-10\">that after the rendition of the administrative determination from which relief is sought in a court, an event has occurred which renders moot what, except for such event, might be a controversy upon which judicial power could act. The intervening events which may render a case moot are of varied character, such as subsequent legislation. . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">2 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Administrative Law </em>\u00a7573 (1962); <em>see also Isbrandtsen-Moller Co. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>300 U.S. 139, 148-49 (1937); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alaska Steamship Co., </em>253 U.S. 113, 115 (1920); <em>Church of Scientology Flag Serv. Org. </em>v. <em>City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number><em>Clearwater, 777 </em>F.2d 598, 604-06 (11th Cir. 1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>476 U.S. 1116 (1986). A ruling should not be made on the merits of this appeal precisely because intervening events and a statutory change combined to terminate the controversy. The majority\u2019s ruling will decide no actual controversy and will provide neither party with any relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">The majority implies that the mootness doctrine should not apply when the issue is \u201ccapable of repetition, but evading review.\u201d However, the majority does not explain how that theory is applicable to the issues presented by this appeal. Although Virginia cases do not address in detail the concept that the majority espouses, the West Virginia Supreme Court has adopted a test that I believe is persuasive and workable. In determining whether issues are \u201ccapable of repetition, but evading review,\u201d that court has adopted a three-step analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b126-5\">\u201cFirst, the court will determine whether sufficient collateral consequences will result from determination of the questions presented so as to justify relief. . . . Second, while technically moot in the immediate context, questions of great public interest may nevertheless be addressed for the future guidance of the bar and of the public. . . . Third, issues which may be repeatedly presented to the trial court, yet escape review at the appellate level because of their fleeting and determinate nature, may appropriately be decided. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b126-6\"><em>Israel v. West Virginia Secondary Schools Activities Comm\u2019n, </em>388 S.E.2d 480, 483 (W. Va. 1989) (quoting <em>State v. Gleason, </em>404 A.2d 573, 578 (Me. 1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The application of that test to the circumstances of this case does not lead to the conclusion that the mootness doctrine should be avoided. The issue in this appeal concerns the interpretation of a portion of Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15 that addressed the Board\u2019s obligation in 1987 to hold an administrative hearing. Although the circuit court ruled that the Board violated the statute and voided the regulations adopted at the challenged hearing, the Board later met at a duly constituted, lawful meeting while this action was pending and adopted regulations virtually identical to the regulations voided by the circuit court. No challenge has been brought concerning the validity of that later meeting or the regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>adopted at that meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-4\">More significantly, on July 1, 1989, during the pendency of this action, the legislature amended Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15 by fundamentally changing that portion of the statute governing the Board\u2019s obligation to hold a hearing. All the parties concede that due to the amendment to Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15 the Board\u2019s obligation to hold an administrative hearing has been substantially and fundamentally changed. This Court\u2019s ruling concerning Code \u00a7 62.1-44.15, as it existed in 1987, no longer has any significance and certainly is irrelevant to any issues arising under the statute as it is now written.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">In addition, there is not, and cannot be, any suggestion that this Court\u2019s interpretation of the statute governing the Board\u2019s administrative hearing procedure, which has now been amended so as to fundamentally change the applicable procedure, raises an issue of great public interest. Likewise, no argument exists that this is an issue that may be repeatedly presented to the circuit court, yet escape review because of its fleeting nature. In summary, the theory that the majority relies upon to support its conclusion that the appeal is not moot simply cannot withstand analysis when tested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>upon the circumstances of this case. <em>See also Weinstein </em>v. <em>Bradford, </em>423 U.S. 147, 148-49 (1975) (\u201cin the absence of a class action, the \u2018capable of repetition, yet evading review\u2019 doctrine\u201d has limited application).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">Although I would hold that this action is moot, Appalachian is entitled to a decision concerning attorney fees. By its terms, Code \u00a7 9-6.14:21 allows a person who \u201ccontests any agency action . . . to recover . . . reasonable costs and attorney fees if such person substantially prevails on the merits of the case and the agency is found to have acted unreasonably, unless special circumstances would make an award unjust.\u201d Like 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988, an analogous attorney fee statute, nothing in the language of Code \u00a7 9-6.14:21 conditions the power of the court to award fees on full litigation of the issues. <em>Cf. Maher </em>v. <em>Gagne, </em>448 U.S. 122, 129 (1980). Thus, the awarding of costs and attorney fees is not contingent upon a determination whether an action is moot. <em>Exeter-West Greenwich Regional Sch. Dist. </em>v. <em>Pontarelli, </em>788 F.2d 47, 52 (1st Cir. 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">However, I believe that the majority improvidently decides the reasonableness of the Board\u2019s conduct. Whether the Board acted unreasonably is a question which involves in substantial measure issues of fact that should first should be determined by the trial court. Thus, I would further hold that Appalachian substantially prevailed and remand to the trial court the determination whether Appalachian is entitled to reasonable costs and attorney fees based upon the trial court\u2019s findings concerning whether the agency acted unreasonably and whether special circumstances prevailed. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 9-6.14:21.</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b127-6\"> Although the majority seems to suggest that a case is not moot when an agency enacts emergency measures to provide temporary relief while the validity of its permanent regulations is being judicially determined, we need not decide that issue because that is not this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">This action was originally brought in 1987 by Appalachian Power Company to challenge the validity of regulations adopted by the State Water Control Board. In sustaining a motion for summary judgment, the trial judge held that the meeting at which the regulations were adopted was not conducted in conformance with state law and that as a consequence the regulations were void. While the Board\u2019s appeal was pending in this Court, the Board met at a lawfully constituted meeting on September 27, 1988, and promulgated emergency regulations identical to those that had been adopted at the meeting that was deemed unlawful. Also while the appeal was pending the Board revised and repromulgated the regulations that the trial judge voided. Those revised and repromulgated regulations were enacted in accordance with statutory law as final regulations on September 13, 1989. No challenge was made to those meetings or to the final regulations that were enacted in 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">It should be noted, however, that the question at issue in the appeal to this Court does not concern the content of the regulations. The regulations are now in effect and have been so since 1988. The initial regulations were void only as a consequence of the trial court\u2019s ruling that the meeting at which they were adopted was unlawful. Thus, the gravamen of the legal challenge was, and remains, whether the 1987 Board meeting was held in conformance with the law. However, in 1989 the legislature amended the law governing the Board\u2019s procedure for holding such a meeting. It is this statutory change that causes this appeal to be moot. The statutory change is neither an emergency measure nor temporary.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
