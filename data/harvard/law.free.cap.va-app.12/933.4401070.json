We find that the commission applied an erroneous definition of full-time employment. Therefore, we reverse its decision and remand the case for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">The deputy commissioner cited two Industrial Commission opinions defining full-time employment. In <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Bowman, </em>57 O.I.C. 120 (1976), the commission held that \u201cfull-time\u201d meant employment \u201con a day to day basis for an indefinite period of time to operate [the] business.\u201d He cited <em>McGowan v. Heras deL\u2019Hermite, Inc., </em>61 O.I.C. 291 (1981), to define full-time as involving \u201csome degree of frequency.\u201d The latter definition did not address the term \u201cfull-time,\u201d but rather the term \u201cregularly employed.\u201d Thus, <em>Ferguson </em>sets forth the commission\u2019s only attempt to define full-time employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">The words \u201cfull-time\u201d have plain and common meaning. Suffice it to say that \u201cfull-time employment\u201d imports a sense of permanence coupled with a commitment between the employer and employee whereby the latter\u2019s normal employment capacity is essentially utilized.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">Code \u00a7 65.1-28 exempts from the operation of the Act a horticultural employer who does not \u201cregularly [have] in service more than two full-time employees.\u201d It is not disputed that this means that to fall under the Act, a horticultural employer must employ regularly three or more full-time employees. The commission applied the <em>Ferguson </em>and <em>McGowan </em>definitions, but also considered a \u201cnew standard in addition.\u201d It held that 2,000 hours of employment were equivalent to the employment of one full-time employee. It then considered the records of the employer to determine whether it had utilized employees for a total of 6,000 worker-hours or more in the year preceding the claimant\u2019s indus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number>trial accident of November 3, 1988. The total number of work hours fell short. The commission held that the evidence showed that the employer did not regularly have in service more than two full-time employees. It did not specify whether it arrived at this conclusion through application of the <em>Ferguson </em>and <em>McGowan </em>definitions or through application of its worker-hour equivalent standard. We hold the worker-hour equivalent standard to be erroneous. The term \u201cfull-time employee\u201d refers to a specific person whose employment satisfies the definition of full time. It does not define an aggregation of part-time employees. Since we cannot say from the record that the commission\u2019s decision was not tied to that standard, we reverse that decision and remand the case for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">The judgment of the Industrial Commission is reversed, and this case is remanded to it for reconsideration of the applicability of the Act in accordance with this holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b983-7\">Keenan, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and Cole, J.,<footnotemark>**</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b983-8\"> Justice Keenan participated in the hearing and decision of this case prior to her investiture as a Justice of the Supreme Court of Virginia.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b983-9\"> Judge Cole participated in the hearing and decision of this case prior to the effective date of his retirement on April 30, 1991 and thereafter by desigation pursuant to Code \u00a7 17-116.01.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
