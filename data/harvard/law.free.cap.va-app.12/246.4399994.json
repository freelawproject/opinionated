The trial court\u2019s order revoked Davis\u2019 driving privilege for a period of ten years, but contained no provision incorporating the requirement of Code \u00a7 46.1-387.9 (now Code \u00a7 46.2-358)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the revocation would remain in effect until the privilege was restored or until Davis petitioned the court at the expiration of the ten-year period in order to restore his driving privilege.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">Davis never petitioned the court to have his driving privilege restored. On April 25, 1989, he was stopped by an officer of the Lynchburg Police Department who noticed that Davis was driving a vehicle with an expired inspection sticker and which displayed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>only one Virginia license plate. Davis fled from his vehicle. When caught, Davis told the officer that he did not have a driver\u2019s license. The officer ran a check with the Department of Motor Vehicles and learned that Davis was classified as an habitual offender, having been so declared fourteen years earlier. Davis was arrested and charged with driving after having been declared an habitual offender. Following a bench trial, the Circuit Court of the City of Lynchburg found Davis guilty of driving after having been adjudicated an habitual offender in violation of Code \u00a7 46.1-387.8 (now Code \u00a7 46.2-357). Davis was sentenced to three years imprisonment with two years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">On appeal, Davis claims that because the language of the May 6, 1975, Charlotte County order merely revoked his license for ten years and contained no provision that the revocation would remain in effect under Code \u00a7 46.1-387.9 \u201cuntil the privilege ... to operate a motor vehicle in this Commonwealth has been restored\u201d his felony conviction for having driven fourteen years later is invalid. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">While habitual offender proceedings are civil in nature, <em>Bouldin </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va. App. 166, 170-71, 355 S.E.2d 352, 355 (1987), a proceeding under \u00a7 46.1-387.8 is criminal, and violations are punished as felonies. <em>See Virginia ex rel. Shifflett </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>333 F. Supp. 718 (W.D. Va. 1971). Therefore, Code \u00a7 46.1-387.8, as all penal statutes, \u201cmust be strictly construed against the state and limited in application to cases falling clearly within the language of the statute.\u201d <em>Crews </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>3 Va. App. 531, 536, 352 S.E.2d 1, 3, <em>appeal refused, </em>360 S.E.2d 715 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Code \u00a7 46.1-387.8 provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to operate any motor vehicle in the Commonwealth while the <em>order </em>of the court prohibiting such operation <em>remains in </em>effect.\u201d (emphasis added). This statute does not require restoration proceedings before the driving privilege may be resumed. While Code \u00a7 46.1-387.7 (now Code \u00a7 46.2-356) defines the period during which an habitual offender may not be issued a license,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> it has no bearing on the definition of the felony. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Code \u00a7 46.1-387.8 defines the felony in terms of the court\u2019s order and prohibits the person who has been declared an habitual offender from driving while the order remains in effect. The Charlotte County order revoked Davis\u2019 privilege to drive for ten years; the order contained no provision that the revocation would remain in force until the privilege was restored. Giving full force and effect to the order as it reads, we hold that it revoked Davis\u2019 license and prohibited him from driving for a period of ten years, which period of time has elapsed.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Our decision in no way alters the restoration requirements of the Habitual Offender Act, which Davis clearly did not follow. Had the order provided that the revocation would remain in force until the privilege was restored, the conviction would stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the felony conviction of Calvin Windell Davis.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Keenan, J., and Moon, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-11\"> Code \u00a7 46.1-387.9 Restoration of privilege of operating motor vehicle; WHEN PETITION MAY BE BROUGHT; TERMS AND CONDITIONS. - At the expiration O\u00cd ten years from the date of any final order of a court entered under the provisions if this article, finding a person to be an habitual offender and directing him not to operate a motor vehicle in this Commonwealth, such person may petition the court ... for restoration of his privilege to operate a motor vehicle in this Commonwealth.
