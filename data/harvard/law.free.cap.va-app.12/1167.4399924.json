Metropolitan contends: (1) the commission erred in holding that Crawley was an \u201cemployee\u201d in the performance of the similar employment, and (2) the commission erred in its computation of Crawley\u2019s average weekly wage from such similar employment. We reverse as to the first issue which renders the second issue moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b1216-11\">The claimant sustained an injury to her lower back on October 29, 1988, while employed as a custodian for Metropolitan. Metropolitan accepted the claim as compensable and paid benefits based on an average weekly wage of $109.32. Thereafter, claimant filed an application for a hearing to amend the calculation of her average weekly wage to include her earnings from household work for various homeowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>The evidence shows Crawley\u2019s work as a custodian for Metropolitan was performed at National Airport on the weekends. Her duties included mopping, cleaning bathrooms, emptying ashtrays, picking up trash, and dusting electrical units. During the week, she worked as a housecleaner for seven individual homeowners for fees ranging between $45 to $50 per house, per week. Her duties in this work involved general housecleaning, cleaning of bathrooms, windows, dusting, vacuuming and scrubbing floors. At one residence, she also took care of an elderly woman and made her bed. She testified that she could earn between $340 to $360 per week cleaning houses. Schedule C on her 1988 income tax return, introduced into evidence, showed her income from this source was $11,440.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-5\">At the hearing on claimant\u2019s application, the parties stipulated that Crawley performed her housecleaning duties as a sole proprietor. However, the deputy commissioner, relying on this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>First Virginia Banks, Inc. </em>v. <em>McNeil, </em>8 Va. App. 342, 381 S.E.2d 357 (1989), held that Crawley\u2019s income from her similar employment as a housecleaner could be included in calculating her average weekly wage. This ruling increased Crawley\u2019s average weekly wage to $446.82 ($109.32 from Metropolitan and $337.50 from the homeowners). Upon review, the full commission affirmed the deputy commissioner\u2019s decision based on a finding that Crawley was an employee, under the direct control of her employers both at Metropolitan and while working for the homeowners. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-6\">Metropolitan contends claimant\u2019s stipulation that her housecleaning work was performed as a sole proprietor indicates she was an independent contractor whose \u201cprofit\u201d or \u201cincome\u201d from her contracts should not be combined with her wages from Metropolitan. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1217-7\">The deputy commissioner, pursuant to the stipulation of the parties, found that the claimant\u2019s house-cleaning business constituted a sole proprietorship. However, the deputy further found that the sole proprietorship nature of Crawley\u2019s housecleaning did not disqualify her from combining her wages, based upon his interpretation of our decision in <em>McNeil. </em>In <em>McNeil, </em>we held an \u201cemployee\u2019s \u2018average weekly wages\u2019 also included an employee\u2019s earnings from similar services for employment not covered by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act.\u201d 8 Va. App. at 344, 381 S.E.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>358. However, we expressly declined to consider the issue of whether McNeil was an independent contractor or an employee while cleaning houses, since the appellant never argued that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-5\">The full commission recognized that <em>McNeil </em>did not apply to Crawley\u2019s case, and addressed the issue of whether Crawley was an employee or an independent contractor while cleaning houses. In reaching its decision, the commission considered the homeowner\u2019s right to control \u201cthe method and the means\u201d by which the work was performed. <em>See Phillips </em>v. <em>Brinkley, </em>194 Va. 62, 66-67, 72 S.E.2d 339, 341 (1952). The commission found the evidence in the record established that Crawley was employed as \u201ca day worker or a \u2018servant\u2019 rather than as an independent contractor.\u201d Moreover, the commission, citing <em>Phillips, </em>further held she was an employee based upon the fact that \u201cthe nature of the employment ... is the kind of work over which each employer had direct control.\u201d <em>See </em>194 Va. at 66, 72 S.E.2d at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-6\">\u201cFactual findings of the commission are binding on appeal. Code \u00a7 65.1-98. However, if no credible evidence exists in support of a factual finding, the issue of sufficiency of the evidence is one of law for this Court to decide.\u201d <em>Spruill v. C.W. Wright Constr. Co., </em>8 Va. App. 330, 333, 381 S.E.2d 359, 360 (1989). We find no evidence in the record to support the commission\u2019s finding that \u201cthe nature of the employment in which Crawley engaged ... is the kind of work over which each employer had direct contrpl.\u201d Moreover, the record is devoid of any evidence of the nature of control actually exercised by the homeowners. There is no evidence of the right to control Crawley. \u201cOne who seeks benefits under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act must show that he is an employee within the definition of Code \u00a7 65.1-4. He bears the burden of proving his entitlement.\u201d <em>Behrensen </em>v. <em>Whitaker, </em>10 Va. App. 364, 366, 392 S.E.2d 508, 509 (1990). The record, in fact, reveals that Crawley considered herself to be an independent contractor in her housecleaning business. She paid her own federal, state, and social security taxes on the income received from her housecleaning work.</p>\n<p id=\"b1218-7\">Of critical importance is the commission\u2019s failure to consider the stipulation entered into by the parties that the housecleaning work was performed by the claimant as a sole proprietor. We find that the stipulation was relevant to the issue of whether Crawley was an employee or an independent contractor while engaged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>her housecleaning work. Nothing in the record suggests that the stipulation meant other than what it stated \u2014 that claimant was operating as a sole proprietor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, the commission\u2019s failure to recognize this stipulation as an uncontroverted fact, and the conclusion that Crawley was an employee under these circumstances constituted error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-5\">Turning to the issue we declined to address in <em>McNeil, </em>we. hold that the wages of an employee may not be combined with income earned as an independent contractor even if the nature of the work is similar. Code \u00a7 65.1-6 defines \u201caverage weekly wages\u201d as \u201cthe earnings of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury.\u201d The term \u201cemployee\u201d includes \u201cevery person, including a minor, in the service of another under any contract of hire or apprenticeship, written or implied.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.1-4. Independent contractors do not qualify as employees. <em>Intermodal Servs., Inc. v. Smith, </em>234 Va. 596, 600, 364 S.E.2d 221, 223 (1988); <em>see Richmond Newspapers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>224 Va. 92, 294 S.E.2d 840 (1982). We hold that the plain meaning and intent of Code \u00a7 65.1-6 is to include as wages the income earned as an employee <em>only </em>and not profit or gain from an independent contractor or some other form of business entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-6\">Having held that Crawley\u2019s income from her housecleaning business cannot be combined with her wages earned from Metropolitan, the alleged error in computation of her total wages is moot. Accordingly, the opinion appealed from is reversed and remanded for the entry of an appropriate order not inconsistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-8\">Koontz, C.J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1219-12\"> <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>Fifth Edition, defines \u201csole proprietorship\u201d as \u201ca form of business in which one person owns all the assets of the business in contrast to a partnership and corporation. The sole proprietor is solely liable for all of the debts of the business.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b1219-9\">Barrow, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ahv\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-10\">The commission\u2019s factual finding that the appellee was an employee, not an independent contractor, is binding on this court. Therefore, I must dissent from the majority\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1219-11\">A sole proprietor is not necessarily an independent contractor. A sole proprietor may have employees who are subject to the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>visions of the Act. <em>See Smith </em>v. <em>Weber, </em>3 Va. App. 379, 381, 350 S.E.2d 213, 214 (1986). A sole proprietor may elect to be an employee covered by the Act. Code \u00a7 65.1-4.2. Whether a sole proprietor who does not so elect is an employee or an independent contractor depends upon whether the person who hires him or her retains the right to control the work to be performed. <em>See Intermodal Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>234 Va. 596, 601, 364 S.E.2d 221, 224 (1988). Whether such a person is an employee as defined by the law is usually a question of fact. <em>Id. </em>at 600, 364 S.E.2d at 224. The stipulation that the appellee was a sole proprietor is not, therefore, determinative of whether she is an employee or an independent contractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-5\">In addition to the stipulation, the commission had other evidence before it from which to determine if she was an employee or an independent contractor. There was evidence that the appellee \u201ccleaned, dusted, swept, mopped and vacuumed in addition to cleaning windows and washing cabinets\u201d for her other employers. In addition,- she assisted an infirmed employer in taking baths. At no time was she required to furnish her own tools or supplies. \u201cShe either reported to or was transported to the place of each employment where her work activity was pursued under the control of each employer.\u201d The commission found that \u201cthe nature of the employment in which [she] engaged ... is the kind of work over which each employer had direct control\u201d and that she was \u201cunder the control of the employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1220-6\">An award of the commission is \u201cconclusive and binding as to all questions of fact.\u201d Code \u00a7 65.1-98. The stipulation that the appellee was a sole proprietor and was taxed as such, although strongly probative of a factual finding that she was an independent contractor, was not conclusive as a matter of law on this issue. There was other evidence from which the commission could and did find that she was an employee. I would, therefore, affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
