We hold that, although the evidence had exculpatory value and should have been disclosed, when considered in the context of all of the evidence offered at trial, there is no reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result would have been different. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-12\">The defendant and his brother surrendered themselves to the police the night after the victim\u2019s murder. The brothers had been involved in an illegal drug transaction with the victim when a disagreement arose over payment for the drugs. An armed scuffle resulted among the defendant, his brother, and the victim. The defendant\u2019s brother, armed with a knife said to have a three-inch blade and a three-inch handle, first stabbed the victim. After falling to the ground, the victim arose from the ground bleeding from his stomach. The defendant then grabbed the victim by the shoulder and began stabbing him repeatedly in the chest with a knife with a twelve-inch blade. The victim again fell to the ground and died.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1142\">*1142</page-number>The autopsy revealed that the victim had been stabbed seven times and that the fatal wound was one which entered his heart. There was one large wound on the front of the heart twenty-five millimeters long and two smaller wounds ten millimeters long through the back of his heart. The medical examiner testified that, in his opinion, since the heart is three inches inside the body and another two to three inches thick, a five to six-inch blade was necessary to cause these wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">Defendant\u2019s discovery motion, including a request for exculpatory evidence, was granted by the trial court. The defendant specifically requested in his motion that all exculpatory evidence and any statements made by any witnesses to the murder be produced to permit him to determine if there were any inconsistencies in eyewitness accounts. Although the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney responded to the order requiring production of these materials, he did not produce a statement he obtained from a witness two days before the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-6\">This statement was obtained from a cellmate of the defendant\u2019s brother who said that the defendant\u2019s brother told him that he had stabbed the victim five or six times and that it felt like \u201chis hand was going all the way to his backbone.\u201d The defendant contends that this evidence was exculpatory since it favored the defendant\u2019s contention at trial that the fatal wound was inflicted by his brother rather than himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-7\">The defendant moved for a new trial because of the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to produce the cellmate\u2019s statement. The trial court denied the motion because the defendant\u2019s brother had been available to the defense for examination and because it was not \u201clikely that the disclosure of that information would have changed the jury verdict.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1190-8\">\u201c[Suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment. . . .\u201d <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963). Disclosure is required where the evidence is both (1) favorable to the defendant, and (2) material <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1143\">*1143</page-number>either to guilt or to punishment. <em>Keener </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>8 Va. App. 208, 212, 380 S.E.2d 21, 23 (1989) (citing <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. 667, 674 (1985)). Even though ordered to produce exculpatory material to the defendant, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney did not reveal the cellmate\u2019s statement to the defense. The question, then, is whether the statement was favorable to the defendant and material to guilt or punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">A confederate\u2019s statement that he \u201cactually killed the victim\u201d is favorable to a defendant charged with first degree murder. <em>White </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, 12 </em>Va. App. 99, 101, 402 S.E.2d 692, 694 (1991) <em>(reh\u2019g en banc granted) </em>(citing <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87). Such evidence is favorable to the defendant on the issue of guilt or innocence because it may have shown that someone else committed the crime. <em>Id. </em>at 101, 402 S.E.2d at 694. It is also favorable to the defendant on the issue of punishment because evidence that \u201cthe defendant was a principal in the second degree instead of the actual murderer was a circumstance in mitigation of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 102, 402 S.E.2d at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-6\">The Commonwealth argues that, since the jury was instructed that a principal in the second degree is liable for the same punishment as a principal in the first degree, it was irrelevant whether the fatal wound was inflicted by the defendant or his brother. Therefore, it argues, the statement was not exculpatory as to either guilt or punishment. However, the defendant\u2019s sentence of twenty years imprisonment, the maximum for a second degree murder conviction, may not have been as harsh had the jury concluded that a confederate, and not the defendant, inflicted the fatal blow.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-7\">Even if the statement is favorable to the defendant on the issue of guilt or punishment, it must also be material before the defendant is entitled to a new trial. Evidence is material \u201conly if there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the defense, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at 682.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Confidence in the outcome of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>the trial must be undermined for the \u201creasonable probability\u201d standard to be met. <em>Tatiano </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>4 Va. App. 342, 349, 358 S.E.2d 590, 593-94 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-5\">The cellmate\u2019s statement, when viewed in isolation, suggests an inference that the fatal blow may have been struck by the defendant\u2019s brother rather than the defendant; however, such an inference is inconsistent with the other evidence produced at trial. The defendant argues that had the victim\u2019s chest compressed sufficiently as a result of the power of the blow from the defendant\u2019s brother, his knife with a three-inch blade could have penetrated the victim\u2019s heart. This hypothesis is contradicted, however, by the medical examiner\u2019s testimony that a six-inch blade was necessary to cause the wounds to the heart. Furthermore, no evidence was presented at trial supporting a theory that the victim\u2019s chest would have compressed as now argued by the defendant. The defendant also argues that the brother\u2019s knife may have had a blade longer than three inches, but no evidence produced at trial supports that argument. Finally, the evidence at trial that the victim, after being stabbed by the defendant\u2019s brother, rose from the ground bleeding from his stomach and was then grabbed by the defendant who stabbed him in the chest, decidedly refutes the defendant\u2019s theory that the victim was killed by the defendant\u2019s brother. Therefore, even though the statement tended to be exculpatory, when viewed in context of all of the evidence presented at trial, there is no reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been any different. The judgment of conviction is, consequently, affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-7\">Benton, J., and Elder, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1190-9\"> The defendant contends that the trial court used an improper standard for considering his motion for a new trial. However, we need not address this issue since on review we are able to determine, using the applicable standard for materiality on direct appeal, that the trial court correctly denied the motion for a new trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1191-8\"> This test of materiality is applied by an appellate court reviewing a case in which the prosecution has failed to disclose exculpatory evidence. It does not provide an appropriate definition of \u201cmateriality\u201d for use pre-trial at the time disclosure is required since the test necessarily requires hindsight judgment, i.e., whether the non-disclosed evidence might have affected the outcome of the case. A prosecutor when asked to disclose evidence pretrial is not in a position to determine that question. In addition, even if the prosecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1144\">*1144</page-number>could make that determination, it would lead to the unacceptable conclusion that a prosecutor\u2019s disclosure obligation is less when his or her case is strong.</p>\n<p id=\"ACqD\">Prosecutors are also guided by their ethical responsibilities which require them to \u201c[m]ake timely disclosure to counsel for the defendant, or to the defendant if he has no counsel, of the existence of evidence, known to the prosecutor or other government lawyer, that <em>tends </em>to negate the guilt of the accused, mitigate the degree of the offense, or reduce the punishment.\u201d DR 8-102(A)(4) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
