L. 192), under which the fund now before the auditors is to be distributed, provides that distribution shall be made and preferred in the following order, namely:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-7\">\u201c1. To pay all deposits in the trust company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-8\">\u201c2. To the payment and discharge of all the remaining liabilities of such trust company or corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-9\">\u201c3. The residue, if any, shall be distributed to the shareholders of the trust company or corporation, according to their respective legal rights.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b183-10\">\u201cProvided, however, that all trust money and property shall be kept separate as provided by said act as supple-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>men ted, as aforesaid, and distributed to the beneficiaries accordingly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-3\">Among the large number of acts which are supplemented and repealed by the foregoing supplemental act, there seem to be but two acts which refer to the proviso in this act, the first being the Act of June 27, 1895 (P L. 399), which, in Section 25, Clause 5, contains the following provision:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-4\">\u201cThe said companies shall keep all trust funds and investments separate and apart from the assets of the companies and all investments made by the said companies as fiduciaries shall be so designated as that the trust to which such investment shall belong shall be clearly known.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-5\">The same provision is contained in the Act of May 9, 1889 (P; L. 159) ; the phraseology being the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-6\">The statutes contain a clear direction that trust companies shall keep all trust funds and investments separate and apart from the assets of the companies, and that all investments made by the said companies as fiduciaries shall be so designated that the trust to which the investments belong shall be clearly known; but in none of the foregoing acts is there any provision prescribing the consequences which shall follow if the statutory mandate is not complied with. It may, therefore, be asked what effect the failure to comply with the statutory provision relating to the keeping apart of trust funds has upon distribution as prescribed by the Act of May 8, 1907 (P. L. 192), the proviso in that act stating that trust moneys and property directed to be kept separate \u201cshall be distributed to the beneficiaries accordingly.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-7\">There are no statutory provisions relating to the dis-' tribution of the assets of insolvent trust companies prior to the Act of May 8,1907.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-8\">In Prudential Trust Company\u2019s Assignment, 223 Pa. 409, Elkin, J., said:'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-9\">\u201cIt may be stated as a general principle that, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>absence of legislation preferring certain creditors, no such preference exists. The legislature has passed many acts making a preference in the distribution of estates among creditors, this on the ground of public policy or to protect the natural and superior equities of parties; but the burden is always upon him who asserts a preference to point to the authority which gives it. In the present case the learned counsel for appellees attempt to meet this burden under the provisions of the Acts of 1844, 1850 and 1876, all of which relate either to banks of issue or to those of discount and deposit. Trust companies created under the provisions of the General Corporation Act of April 29, 1874 (P. L. 73), and deriving their privileges and powers from the Act of 1889, and other supplemental statutes, are neither banks of issue nor of discount and deposit within the meaning of the law, and, therefore, the acts relied on as giving a preference to bank depositors are not authority for the proposition that the same preference must be given to depositors in a title and trust'company, incorporated for a different purpose and being denied by the express language of the statute the right to engage in the business of banking.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b185-3\">Under the facts of that case, the court then considered whether distribution could be made under the Act of May 8, 1907, but, the assignment having been made before the act, the court held that it did not apply to that case. It appears that, at the date of the assignment, the appellant had the right to participate in the fund for distribution along with the depositors and other creditors in such proportion as his claim bore to the aggregate of all the claims. If, however, the Act of 1907 had applied, the depositors would have taken the whole fund and the appellant would have received nothing. It was held that the appellant was entitled to share in the distribution with the depositors and other creditors, without reference to the preference established by the Act of 1907.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>Where trust funds have been kept separate and apart there is, of course, no question; but where the funds have been mingled with the general assets of the insolvent trust company and the statutory provision has not been complied with, a question does arise. The statutes are silent as to what shall be done when the trust funds have not been kept separate and apart as provided by the act of assembly, and reference must then be had to the adjudicated cases governing such a situation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-4\">In Thompson\u2019s App., 22 Pa. 16 (1853), an individual as executor received moneys which he used in his own business and, being also otherwise indebted, he executed a voluntary assignment for creditors. It was held that the heirs of the decedent were not entitled to a preference in the distribution of the fund in the hands of the assignee, but only to a pro rata share with other creditors. Lewis, J., said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-5\">\u201cWhenever a trust fund has been converted into another species of property, if its identity can be traced it will be held in its new form liable to the rights of the cestui que trust. No change of its state and form can divest it of such trust. So long as it can be identified, either as the original property of the cestui que trust or as the product of it, equity will follow it and the right of reclamation attaches to it until detached by the superior equity of a bona fide purchaser for a valuable consideration without notice. The substitute for the original thing follows the nature of the thing itself so long as it can be ascertained to be such, but the right of pursuing it fails when the means of ascertaining it fail. This is always the case when the subject-matter is turned into money and mixed and confounded in a general mass of property of the same description.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b186-6\">[Here follows a detailed review of the following cases: Thompson\u2019s App., 22 Pa. 16; Miskimins\u2019s App., 114 Pa. 530; Columbian Bank\u2019s Est., 147 Pa. 422; Freiberg v.

The transaction was one which is commonly considered a deposit with the company for the purpose of making the settlement. The receipt issued by the company in such cases shows this to have been the practice. The settlement certificate recommends the purchase-price be \u201cdeposited.\u201d There is nothing inconsistent with this being both a trust fund and a deposit within the popular meaning of deposit for it cannot be better described than to call it a deposit for a special purpose, to wit, to make settlement, and the company in accepting it became a trustee to apply it in accordance with its receipt.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b188-4\">That special deposits of this kind are within the meaning of the Act of May 8, 1907, P.
