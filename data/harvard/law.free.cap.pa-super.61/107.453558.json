They are prepared under the first section of the Act of 1885 which provides: \u201cThat any person who takes a female child under the age of sixteen years for the purpose of prostitution or sexual intercourse, or, without the consent of her fathei\u2019, mother, guardian or other person having legal custody of her person, for the purpose of marriage, or who enveigles or entices any such minor female child into a house of ill-fame, or of assignation, or elsewhere, for the purpose of prostitution or sexual intercourse, shall, in every such case, be guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d Prior to the passage of this act there were penalties provided by law for persons who committed fornication, adultery or rape or attempted so to do \u2014 made the attempt but failed; but there was no penalty provided for a person who took females for prostitution or enticed them to go to such places such as this act provides. This act is directed against the male person and not against the female. It is a supplement to an act for the protection of children. It applies only to efforts made to induce female children under the age of sixteen years to engage in such business or to go to such places.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b152-5\">The first count in each of the indictments charges the taking of these girls for the purpose of prostitution or sexual intercourse. The second count charges the enticing of the children to a place for the purpose of- prostitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>tion or sexual intercourse. You may notice the difference. One relates to the taking of the children for the purpose of prostitution or sexual intercourse; the other relates to enticing the children to go to such place for the purpose of prostitution or sexual intercourse. The word \u201ctake\u201d as used in this connection is quite a comprehensive word. \u201cTake\u201d has a great many different shades of meaning. You may take a struggling athlete against all his resistance to a jail or lockup; and you can take a child to school or take her on a walk, which indicates two different shades of meaning of the term. The sense in which it is used here includes the milder as well as the stronger sense to which I have referred. It might include the taking of a child by physical force, or it might include the taking of a child with her consent or under the influence of promises or persuasion on the part of the pei\u2019son taking her. It is more comprehensive than the word \u201cincite\u201d because it implies the physical presence of the person taking her. A person may be incited to go to such a house and the' person who incites her might not go with her. By various means she may be persuaded to go \u2014 incited to go. In such case the latter provision would apply rather than the former. Prosecutions under this section have not been numerous; in fact I recall no case in this court. The terms of the statute, howevex*, appear quite clear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b153-3\">You will have noted from what I have already said, the statute being directed against the male and not against the female, that frequently it is not a matter of importance whether the female is willixxg at the outset to go or not. There may be a taking against the will of the person taken, or there may be a faking with her consent. When a person is incited to do a certain thing that fact includes the assumption that she goes willingly, under the influence, however, of the incitement. Whether or not the female child has the innocence of childhood or whether she be already treading the downward path the statute is provided for her protection. \u2022 If she be already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>on the downward way she would probably yield much more quickly and easily to persuasion and incitement than if she had never entered upon that way. But the act relates not to the character of the child but to the acts of the male, and the question which you have to determine is whether or not the defendant took these children as they were, or incited them as they were to the place where he is alleged to have taken them or to which it is alleged they went.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-3\">By Mr. McCracken, District Attorney: Your honor has been using the word \u201cincite\u201d and the word used in the act of assembly is \u201centice.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b154-4\">The Court: Where I have been using the word \u201cincite\u201d I should have been using the word \u201centice.\u201d (The first sentence of the act provides: \u201cThat any person who takes a female child under the age of sixteen years for the purpose of prostitution\u201d: it does not say where he takes her for th\u00e9 purpose of prostitution or sexual intercourse. Later it provides that one \u201cwho enveigles or entices any such minor female child into a house of ill-fame, or of assignation, or elsewhere, for the purpose of prostitution or sexual intercourse, shall, in every such case, be guilty of a misdemeanor.\u201d If he takes her for the purpose of prostitution or sexual intercourse he is guilty under this statute. [If he entices her to go to a house of prostitution or assignation or elsewhere for the purpose of sexual intercourse he is guilty. There is no particular plan of a house used for the purpose of prostitution or assignation; any house may be used for such a purpose. Any place may be used for such a purpose providing it is a convenient place for such a purpose. So the one who incites a child to go to a house of prostitution or assignation or elsewhere for the purpose of sexual intercourse is guilty under this statute, whether the \u201celsewhere\u201d be back of a wax-house, on a sidehill, in the woods or any place that is convenient for that purpose, and such a place as persons desiring to commit that offense would naturally resort to.] (5) The indictments, as we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>stated, contain two counts; and, as <em>y?e </em>have already indicated, the word \u201ctaking\u201d is more comprehensive than the word \u201cinciting\u201d; although ordinarily in every case of taking there is inciting also. A person may be incited by a promise of money or persuaded in any way and after being so acted upon they may be taken, and the inciting merges into the taking. Where there is only an inciting, however, with no taking the second count in the indictment only applies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-2\">Verdict of guilty upon which judgment of sentence was passed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b155-3\"><em>Error assigned, </em>amongst others, was (5) instructions as above, and in excluding evidence to the child\u2019s chastity.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b155-4\"><em>Edmond G.

The rule of construction is otherwise. What the legislature intended to prevent and punish was the enticing or enveigling of females of tender years into houses of ill-fame, or places of like character by the lures, wiles, snares and deceptions of designing and unscrupulous persons, whereby such houses were enabled to operate and keep going: Butler\u2019s App., 73 Pa. 448; Bucher v.

L. 142, entitled \u201cAn act to-protect children from neglect and cruelty, and relating to their employment, protection, and adoption,\u201d are radically enlarged by the supplementary Act of May 28, 1885, P. L. 27, under which this defendant was tried and convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">This change is effected by clear and easily understood words, and so far as this defendant is concerned, it means that it was unlawful for him to take a female child, under the age of sixteen years, either for the purpose of prostitution, as that word is defined in our decisions, or for individual sexual intercourse, or to enveigle or entice any such female Child into a house of ill-fame, or assignation, or elsewhere for the same purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">To hold otherwise, would be to take from the evident legislative intent, a very material feature of its primary purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The question was raised by the defendant\u2019s second point, viz: \u201cThe learned court is respectfully requested to instruct the jury as to what constitutes the house or place into which the female must be enticed or inveigled, under the second count of the indictment,\u201d which was answered as follows, in the general charge: \u201cIf he entices her to go to a house of prostitution, assignation or elsewhere for the purpose of sexual intercourse, he is guilty. There is no particular plan of a house used for the purpose of prostitution or assignation: any house may be used for such a purpose. Any place may be used for such a purpose, providing it is a convenient place for such a purpose. So, anyone who entices a child to go to a house of prostitution, or assignation or elsewhere for the purpose of sexual intercourse is guilty under this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>statute, whether the \u201celsewhere\u201d be back of a wax house, on a side hill, in the woods, or any place that is convenient for that purpose, or any place such as persons desiring to commit that offense would naturally resort to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\">The prohibition is directed against having sexual intercourse with a female child under the age of sixteen years; the place where the act is committed is not material under this statute, and in the very words of the statute the unlawful act may be committed \u201cin a house of ill-fame or assignation or elsewhere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">The word \u201celsewhere\u201d is significant, and is more comprehensive in meaning than the specially designated places preceding it. It is to be interpreted in its plain and dictionary sense \u2014 in another place, or in other places, somewhere or anywhere else, \u2014 than in a house of ill-fame or assignation. The ultimate design of the Act of 1885 was to safeguard female minors, under the age of sixteen years, from the baneful effects of, either indiscriminate prostitution, or of individual sexual intercourse, as the distinction between these terms is explained in Com. v. Lavery, 247 Pa. 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Every statute should be construed so as to vitalize, and not annul its prohibitions and mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">The cases relied on by the appellant, Butler\u2019s App., 73 Pa. 448; Pardee\u2019s App., 100 Pa. 408; Bucher v. Com., 103 Pa. 528, do not control in this one, as the legislative intent is made free from any uncertainty on the subject by the addition of the words \u201celsewhere\u201d and \u201csexual intercourse\u201d to the requirements of the earlier enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Nor is it material to investigate the reputation of the child for chastity.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">The protection is intended for chaste and unchaste. If she be chaste that she may continue a virgin, if she be unchaste, that she may not be further encouraged in her lawless course of living, and the evidence offered on this phase of the case was rightly rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">The other assignments of error were not pressed at. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>the agreement, and are fully covered in this opinion. All are overruled, and the judgment is affirmed. The record is remitted to the Court of Quarter Sessions of Venango County, with direction that the judgment there entered he fully carried into effect, and, to that end, that the defendant forthwith appear in that court, and that he be by that court committed to comply with such part of the sentence as had not been served and complied with at the time this appeal was made a supersedeas.</p>\n<judges id=\"b158-3\">Kephart and Trexler, JJ., dissent.
