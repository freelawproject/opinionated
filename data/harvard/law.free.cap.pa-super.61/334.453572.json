J., stated the facts to be as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-6\">\u201cIn the autumn of 1912, the plaintiff sold to A. Seaton two certain pieces of timber on a tract of land for the sum of eight hundred and fifty dollars, the contract being in parol, and the purchase-money being all paid at the time the contract was made. In and by the contract there was an immediate removal of the timber contemplated; and the defendant, A. Seaton, in pursuance of the contract, entered into possession of the timber and completed the removal of one part of it late in the fall of 1913. Shortly prior to July 7, 1914, the defendant, A. Seaton, and the other defendants named in the bill, who Avere his employees, entered upon the land for the purpose of removing the remining part of the timber; when the plaintiff undertook to resist their entry, and had them arrested on a writ of capias. The defendants, however, succeeded in entering into possession with their mill prior to the time the injunction was issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-7\">\u201cIt seems to us that there are two reasons why an injunction does not lie in this case: (a) In and by the terms of the verbal contract, which contemplated immediate removal of the timber, the sale was that of a chattel and not of an interest in the land; and (b) there is neither allegation in the bill nor anything in the evidence tending to prove that the defendant, A. Seaton, is not of sufficient financial ability to respond in damages for any injury which the plaintiff might sustain by the removal of the timber.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b379-8\">\u201cThe plaintiff contended that the defendant, A. Sea-ton, in and by the terms of the verbal contract was to have the timber removed not later than the year 1913; while the defendant testified that there was no specific time mentioned for its removal. However, a care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>ful consideration of the testimony will show that the contract was one for a full and valuable consideration, which was all paid at the time the contract was made, and for the immediate removal of the timber. An examination of the testimony will show that there was no covenant that the timber should be removed within a specified time; but the only logical view to be taken of the whole evidence is that it contemplated an immediate severance of the timber. As late as February 10, 1914, the plaintiff still conceded the right in the defendant, A. Seaton, to remove the timber, for, on the 18th day of February, 1914, he served a written notice, dated February 10,1914, on Seaton, notifying him to cut and remove the remaining part of the timber on or before the first day of April, 1914. However, in said notice it is set forth that the timber was to have been removed before the last of 1913.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-3\">\u201cThe plaintiff, on page 6 of the notes of testimony, when testifying in relation to the contract, said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-4\">\u201c \u2018When I sold it to him I said, \u201cNow, Mr. Seaton, how long a time do you want to get that timber out?\u201d He said, \u201cOh, well, that on the other side I will get out right away, and that on this side I Avill get off\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-5\">\u201c \u2018Mr. McConnel \u2014 Q.\u2014He said that he wanted to get the other out right away, for what reasons?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b380-6\">\u201c \u2018A.

Lehigh Co., 203 Pa. 474.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b381-9\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"A13\">Orlady, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">The court below granted a preliminary injunction to restrain the defendant from cutting and removing growing timber, and after a full hearing the injunction was dissolved, from which decree the plaintiff has taken this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">The court found, as a fact, that the timber in controversy, with other timber, had been sold by the plaintiff to the defendant under an entire contract, and that a full and valuable consideration had been paid for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>undivided body of growing trees. That while ah immediate removal of all the timber was talked about, it was not made an important or controlling part of the bargain, that all should be removed before the close of 1913, or within any specified time. Under the authority of Johnson v. Bumpus, 34 Pa. Superior Ct. 637, and Strause v. Berger, 220 Pa. 367, the timber involved in this controversy must be regarded as personal property. In the latter case it was stated, \u201cthe general rule undoubtedly is that, the specific performance of contracts for the sale of personal property will not be enforced, for the reason that ordinarily compensation for the breach of the contract may be had by way of damages,1\u2019 and cases are therein cited to vindicate the rule and the reason for certain exceptions to it. It is conceded that the defendant has paid the full purchase price of all the timber, and to prevent the removal of a part of it requires more definite proof of the plaintiff\u2019s contention than is presented in this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\">To justify us in reversing the finding of a chancellor on a question of fact, as we have often said, clear and plain error must be pointed out. It is not sufficient that our conclusions would be different on the testimony brought up on the record. Straus v. Berger, supra. The expression, immediate delivery, in such a contract, is to be construed in the light of the circumstances, having due regard to the subject matter, its location, the season, the difficulty of removal and the like, and in the light of the facts as found by the court, the entry on the land was under a sufficient claim of right. The defendant cannot under such facts have the aid of equity to enable him to keep both the timber and its purchase-price. The granting of an injunction is always the exercise of power to be cautiously used, and it should clearly appear that irreparable injury is likely to follow, and that there is no adequate remedy at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">A pending action of trespass, brought by the plaintiff, will afford him an ample opportunity to recover any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>damages he may have sustained by the defendant\u2019s delay of a few months in removing the trees that were left standing on a hillside, from which he alleges they could not be removed in the fall of 1913.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
