By the Act of April 13, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>1843, P. L. 218, the general supervision of the roads and bridges in each of the townships of that county was invested in the township commissioners (now the township supervisors) who were also authorized \u201cto lay out and alter\u201d the same in accordance with the proceeding in the act prescribed. The general authority to widen roads was given by the Act of May 8, 1850, P. L. 715, amending the General Road Law of June 13,1836, P. L. 555. This amendment limited the width of roads so widened to fifty feet. This law was changed by the Act of June 7, 1907, P. L. 452, so that the width of a public road was limited to eighty feet. These general laws did not have the effect to repeal the local Act of 1843 but control the width of a road. The case turns therefore on the extent of the power of the supervisors as expressed in the words \u201cto lay out and alter\u201d contained in the Act of 1843. It is clear that the legislative intention was to give to the township supervisors greater power than to \u201clay out\u201d new roads. They were invested with authority to \u201calter\u201d roads already laid out. The meaning of this word is not obscure. It signifies \u201cto change entirely or materially\u201d; \u201cto vary the arrangement of\u201d; \u201cto cause to be different in some respect.\u201d It is sufficiently comprehensive to cover the widening of a road within the restrictions imposed by the general law. The identical question arose in Loyalsock Township Road, 26 Pa. Superior Ct. 219, in which it was held that the word \u201caltering\u201d was sufficiently broad to cover the widening of a road. The opinion of President Judge Rice in that case fully vindicates the action of the court below. The Acts of March 18, 1901, P. L. 51, and April 3, 1903, P. L. 137, are general statutes not affecting the question of the power of the supervisors of a township in Erie County to widen a road. They are applicable when special local provision is not otherwise made for covering the conditions to which these acts apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-3\">The order is affirmed at the cost of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
