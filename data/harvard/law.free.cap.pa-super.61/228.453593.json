He had no other estate than that set forth in his father\u2019s will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-5\">The widow, Caroline Gelm, died on the 14th day of November, 1913, without having remarried. The estate of John Gelm therefore passes to the other three children, each an undivided one-fourth in his own right, and an undivided one-third of the one-fourth devised to the deceased son William; they take William\u2019s share as col-laterals through him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-6\">It is urged that there was no estate in William Gelm at the time of his death, and that, therefore, no tax is assessable because he did not die seized or possessed of the estate devised by his father. In support of this contention, Swann\u2019s Est., 1 D. R. 579, is cited. It has no application because it was clearly found that the estate was contingent; the same is true of Matthiessen\u2019s Est., 17 D. R. 201. While there seems to be some authority for appellant\u2019s contention in Gebhart\u2019s Est., 20 D. R. 529, it does not appear that the estate there in controversy was a vested estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-7\">The late case of Com. v. Thomas, 21 D. R. 350, is cited as direct authority for appellants\u2019 contention. In the absence of a Supreme Court case squarely sustaining the conclusion in the latter case above cited, we are of the opinion that the correct rule governing the case at bar is set forth in Dixon\u2019s Est., 53 P. L. J. 117, opinion by the late president judge of this court, who says:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b273-8\">\u201cWhile the theory of the defense that only those estates passing from a person who dies actually seized is liable to collateral inheritance tax, receives some support from the language of the first section of the Act of 1887, the third section shows very plainly that the legislature had in view constructive as well as actual possession; for that section makes express provision for payment of the tax when gifts Take effect in possession or come into actual enjoyment after the expiration of one or more life estates, or a period of years, and conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>quently after a previous existing charge. The possession of the life tenant is in the meantime the possession of the remainderman and answers the letter of the first section of the act. Where the gift is contingent upon surviving the life tenant, death before the happening of that event will, of course, defeat the tax; but where it is vested, death is immaterial; for the owner\u2019s title has a transmissible quality whether by sale, Cox\u2019s Est., 181 Pa. 369, by will, or intestacy; and the land passes subject to the tax: Finnen\u2019s Est., 196 Pa. 72.\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-4\">That the estate in the case at bar is vested cannot be questioned; it was in the decedent in fee, subject to the mother\u2019s life estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-5\">The share of William coming from his father passes to his brothers and sister through him; the collaterals could not take it in any other way. The purpose of the act is to impose a tax on all estates passing to collaterals. This estate is clearly within the spirit of the law, and by implication within its letter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-6\">Appeal is therefore dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b274-7\"><em>Error assigned </em>was decree dismissing the appeal.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b274-8\"><em>James A.

Ege, 23 Pa. 305.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b274-9\">The law providing for collateral inheritance tax should be strictly construed: Swann\u2019s Est., 1 D.

Com., 52 Pa. 181; Orcutt\u2019s App., 97 Pa. 179; Hood\u2019s Est., 21 Pa. 106; Short\u2019s Est., 16 Pa. 63.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-5\">That estates in remainder are properly taxable under the act see: Com. v.

C. 79.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-6\">The appellants\u2019 contention that William Gelm was not seized or possessed of an estate within the meaning of this act, is contrary to the plain provisions thereof: Wallace v.

Y. 585.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b275-7\">The remainder in question is taxable under the word \u201cpossessed\u201d alone: Grant v. Hathaway, 118 Mo. 604; City of Detroit v. Moran, 7 N. W. 180.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b275-8\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"Am2\">Orlady, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">In this case the only question involved, is the construction to be given the clause in the will of John Gelm, as quoted in the opinion of the court below, and to determine the character of the estate of William Gelm, a son, who died subsequent to his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">The Act of April 22, 1905, P. L. 258, Section 1, does not, in relation to the imposition of a collateral inheritance tax, modify the Act of May 6, 1887, P. L. 79, and as decided in Finnen\u2019s Est., 196 Pa. 72, \u201cIt is very manifest from the language of the statute, that the subject of the taxation enacted is the whole estate or interest that passes to the persons who are the recipients. An estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>in remainder is an estate or property within the meaning of the act just as much as if the decedent had been in the actual possession of it at the time of his decease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AcD\">The question was carefully considered by the Orphans\u2019 Court, and we agree with the conclusion it reached in holding that the estate in the case at bar was vested in the decedent in fee, subject to the mother\u2019s life estate. The share of William, coming from his father passes through him to his brothers and sisters, and the collaterals could not take it in any other way. That estates in remainder are properly taxable under the statute is shown by Com. v. Smith, 20 Pa. 100; Com. v. Eckert, 53 Pa. 102; Commonwealth\u2019s App., 127 Pa. 435. The purpose of the act is to impose a tax on all estates passing to collaterals. The estate involved in this case is clearly within the spirit of the law, and by evident implication within its letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
