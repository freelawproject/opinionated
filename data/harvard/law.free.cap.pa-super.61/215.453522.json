Evans, J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-9\">The plaintiff brought suit to recover damages for a breach of contract, alleging that he had entered into a contract for the purchase of a lot of ground from the defendant corporation on the fourth of October, 1902, a copy of which agreement is attached to the statement of claim. That certain oral representations were made to the plaintiff as an inducement to the execution of said written agreement and contemporaneous with the same. These oral contemporaneous agreements were:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-10\">That within two years the defendant company would erect an incline plane running from Colonial avenue to the top of the hill and connected with Charles street in said plan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-11\">That a street car line would be constructed on Colonial avenue to connect with a proposed line to Coraopolis.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-12\">That all the lots in Block No. 1 fronting on Colonial avenue, except No. 30, were then sold, and that all the lots in Block No. 2, with the exception of two or three lots, were sold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-13\">That the defendant company had certain men at work on the east side of the Lake Erie Railroad, and represented to the plaintiff that the work then in progress was the beginning of the erection of a large bridge works.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-14\">That he believed these statements to be true and, in consideration of them, entered into an agreement to pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>chase the said lot, averring that the oral representations and those printed' on said plan constituted a contemporaneous parol agreement with the written agreement and became a part of the written agreement between the parties plaintiff and defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-3\">The written agreement was as follows: \u201cIt is understood and agreed that when one-half of all lots fronting on any street in said plan are sold, the Colonial Land Company will enter into contracts for improving said streets by paving, curbing, sewering and laying of cement or flagstone sidewalks thereon.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-4\">Plaintiff alleges that the bridge works were not built, that the street car line was not built, that the incline plane was not built, and that Colonial avenue had not been improved, alleging, therefore, a breach of contract, and brought suit to recover damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-5\">At the trial of the case the trial judge was of the opinion that the evidence did not sustain the allegation as to the erection of the bridge works and the street railway line, there being no evidence that the agent of the company had alleged that the defendant company was building either the bridge works or the street car line, and the evidence being to the effect that the bridge works was then in course of erection, but had subsequently been abandoned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-6\">The two questions left to the jury were the question of the purpose to build an incline plane and the question as to whether or not the plaintiff had bought his lot on the strength of the representations that more than one-half of the lots on Colonial avenue were sold at that time. Defendant pleaded the statute of limitations; The plaintiff entered into his contract with the defendant on October 4,1902, and brought this suit on January 24,1913, eleven years after the execution of the contract. The contract was in writing and opposite the signature of \u201cBlack and Baird, Agents,\u201d and Peter Winter are seals in the shape of a scroll. There is nothing in the body of the contract which indicates that it is a contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>under seal; as, for instance, there is no clause of the contract as \u201cwitnesseth the hand and seal of the parties\u201d or any indication that the parties intended this to be a contract in specialty. And again, there was no evidence that Black and Baird, as agents for the Colonial Land Company, had any authority to execute a contract under seal for the corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-3\">At the trial of the case the point for binding instructions for the defendant was refused because the contract was in writing and had the seal opposite the names of the parties, and if it was a contract in specialty, then the statute of limitations, so far as the breach of that contract was concerned, would not bar an action within six years. The theory upon which the case was submitted to the jury, so far as the question of breach of contract in neglecting to graded pave, curb and sewer Colonial avenue, was that that agreement was in written contract, and if the plaintiff bought his lot on the strength of the representations of the agents of the defendant that one-half of the lots on Colonial avenue were sold, then the defendant was estopped from denying that one-half the lots were sold. So far as the breach of contract for the building of the incline plane is concerned, that was purely an oral representation, and under the testimony and allegation that incline plane was to be built within two years from the date of this contract, which would be 1904, or over eight years before the bringing of this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-4\">I am satisfied that so far as the defendant corporation is concerned, the contract for the sale of this land was not a contract in specialty, and, therefore, a claim for a breach of contract would be barred within six years from the date of the breach. In the first place, according to the plaintiff\u2019s allegation, this contract between plaintiff and defendant was partly oral and partly in writing, and that of itself would be sufficient to render the whole of the contract in parol so far as the application of the statute of limitations is concerned; and in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>the second place, so far as this defendant corporation is concerned, there is no evidence here sufficient to justify the court in finding that the written contract was a contract under seal. As I stated before, the contract on its face does not purport to be under seal. The fact that an agent signed that contract and put a seal opposite his name was not sufficient to bind the principal under a contract of specialty.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aj0v\">October 11, 1915:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-2\">And now, January 18,1915, motion ex parte defendant for judgment for the defendant non obstante veredicto is allowed and judgment is hereby entered for the- defendant non obstante veredicto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-3\"><em>Error assigned </em>was in entering judgment for defendant n. o. v.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b263-4\"><em>Frank Thomson, </em>with him <em>George C.

Hart, 109 Pa. 629; Lawell v. Rader, 24 Pa. 283; Carrier v. Dilworth, 59 Pa. 406; Vicary v.
