Before Brodhead, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b665-9\">At the trial the defendant testified that he gave the notes to plaintiff for hay which he had purchased from him, and that the hay was tainted and was of so poor quality that he had to buy other hay in its place; and that therefore the whole consideration for the notes failed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b665-10\">When Ashler Mutchler, a witness for defendant, was on the stand he was asked this question:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b665-11\">Q. Shortly after the eighth of July did you hear from Mr. Sulkin anything about the quality of the hay that Mr. Foelner had delivered to Mm?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>(By Mr. Laub) : That is objected to for the reason that it is incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial, and that it would be a conversation and a party not to this suit, and it would be in the nature of a self-serving declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-4\">(By Mr. Fox): This testimony is offered for the purpose of meeting the allegation of the plaintiff that the claim of the defendant is not made in good faith, and for the purpose of proving that it is not a recent fabrication, but that the complaint was made immediately after the eighth of July, and that the witness on the stand has knowledge thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-5\">(By the Court) : The objection is sustained on the ground that the declarations offered to be proven, made by the defendant in the absence of the plaintiff, are of a self-serving nature, and that there is no evidence in the case that the defense is of recent fabrication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-6\">(By Mr. Fox) : To which ruling defendant excepts, and asks for a bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b666-7\">(By the Court) : Bill sealed.

That testimony having been excluded it is manifestly unjust and unfair to permit counsel for the plaintiff to argue to the jury that point which the defendant was prevented from proving. '</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-3\">(By the Court) : The court having excluded the proposed testimony of Asher Mutchler relative to the declarations alleged to have been made by the defendant in this case, not in the presence of the plaintiff, declarations which tended to negative the allegation of a recent-fabrication, as a defense, upon the ground that no such allegation was made by the plaintiff, the court now instructs counsel for the plaintiff not to claim to the jury that the defense is of recent fabrication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b667-4\">Verdict and judgment for plaintiff for $103.44.

One of the exceptions to this general rule is that such evidence may be given in contradiction of evidence tending to show that the witnesses\u2019 testimony is a fabrication of recent date. It is claimed that the case at bar is within this exception. But we find no evidence tending to show that the defendant\u2019s testimony was a recent fabrication. There was, it is true, a conflict of testimony; but according to the great weight of authority a mere conflict of testimony was not alone a sufficient reason for the admission of the defendant\u2019s prior unsworn statements: Commonwealth v. Kay, 14 Pa. Superior Ct. 376, 389. The leading Pennsylvania cases on the subject are collected in Commonwealth v. Kay and the subject was again discussed in Commonwealth v. Brown, 23 Pa. Superior Ct. 470; and later very elaborately reviewed in Lyke v. Lehigh Valley Railroad Co., 236 Pa. 38. Further discussion of it is unnecessary; it is sufficient to say that the reasons assigned by the learned trial judge for rejecting the defendant\u2019s offers, amply vindicate his ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
