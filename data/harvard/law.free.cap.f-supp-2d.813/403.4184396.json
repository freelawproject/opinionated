By motion dated March 3, 2011, Defendant moves for a Judgment on the Pleadings pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\u201cFed. R. Civ.P.\u201d) Rule 12(c) dismissing all claims asserted by Plaintiffs in their complaint and granting judgment in favor of Defendant on its counterclaims. On March 29, 2011, Plaintiffs responded in opposition to the motion. On April 12, 2011, Defendant submitted reply papers. On August 3, 2011, this Court held oral argument on this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">For the foregoing reasons, Defendant\u2019s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">The underlying facts of this case are generally not in dispute. The 123 Washington Street Condominium is a newly constructed luxury high rise condominium building located at 123 Washington Street, New York, NY. (Declaration of Michael Fleiss (\u201cFleiss Decl.\u201d) dated March 2, 2011, Ex. 1(A) at \u00b6 18.) The building houses a W Hotel, restaurant, bar, and 222 residential condominium units. (Fleiss Decl., Ex. 1(B) at \u00b6 17.) On July 17, 2007, the residential condominium units were offered to the public by Defendant in an offering plan filed with the Attorney General of the State of New York. (Fleiss Decl., Ex. 1(A) at \u00b6 19.) Plaintiffs are a group of individuals and families who contracted to purchase condominium units in the 123 Washington Condominium in late 2007 and early 2008 for purchase prices exceeding $1,000,000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The units were not yet constructed at the time the purchase agreements were signed nor did the agreements require that construction would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>complete within two years. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 25, 36.) Plaintiffs seek rescission of their contract with Defendant on the basis that Defendant failed to perform certain duties as required by ILSFDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">A. ILSFDA</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">ILSFDA was enacted in 1968 and was \u201cdesigned to prevent false and deceptive practices in the sale of unimproved tracts of land by requiring developers to disclose information needed by potential buyers.\u201d <em>Flint Ridge Dev. Co. v. Scenic Rivers Ass\u2019n of Okla., </em>426 U.S. 776, 778, 96 S.Ct. 2430, 49 L.Ed.2d 205 (1976). The purpose of the Act was \u201cto protect purchasers from unscrupulous sales of undeveloped home sites, frequently involving out-of-state sales of land purportedly suitable for development, but actually under water or useful only for grazing.\u201d <em>Beauford v. Helmsley, </em>740 F.Supp. 201, 209 (S.D.N.Y.1990) (quoting <em>Winter v. Hollingsworth Properties, 111 </em>F.2d 1444, 1447 (11th Cir.1985)).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">ILSFDA requires developers selling \u201clots\u201d in a subdivision to register the sale of such lots with the Secretary of HUD. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1703(a)(1)(A), 1704-1706. Additionally, the developer must provide purchasers with a printed property report prior to the signing of a purchase agreement or contract. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1703(a)(1)(B), 1707.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Although originally concerned with the development of raw undeveloped land, in 1978 Congress amended ILSFDA in several respects. The \u201cImproved Lot Exemption\u201d found in \u00a7 1702(a)(2) provides that the provisions of ILSFDA shall not apply to \u201cthe sale or lease of any improved land on which there is a residential, commercial, condominium, or industrial building, or the sale or lease of land under a contract obligating the seller or lessor to erect such a building thereon within a period of two years.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702(a)(2); <em>Winter, </em>777 F.2d at 1447.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">Any contract or purchase agreement for the sale of a lot which does not meet the exemption requirements of \u00a7 1702<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and is in violation of ILSFDA is subject to rescission by the purchaser within a two year period from the date of signing. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1703(c). Furthermore, \u201cthe court may order damages, specific performance, or such other relief as the court deems fair, just, and equitable.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1709(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaints allege that Defendant failed to properly register with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d) as required by ILSFDA prior to entering into purchase agreements. (Def. Mem. at \u00b6 2.); <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1703(a)(1)(A), 1704-1706. On October 11, 2007, Defendant submitted its Initial Registration Application to HUD. (Fleiss Decl., Ex. 1(A) at \u00b6 78.) On November 7, 2007, however, HUD informed Defendant that the application was materially deficient. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 78-79.) Due to this deficiency, HUD ordered Defendant not to sell any of its lots until the deficiencies were remedied. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 79.) On December 5, 2007, HUD provided notice to Defendant that its registration had been accepted. <em>(Id. </em>at \u00b6 80.) Plaintiffs purchase agreements, however, were all signed and dated during the period in which the HUD suspension was in effect\u2014 thus in violation of HUD\u2019s prohibition against sales until these deficiencies were remedied. Plaintiffs seek to terminate the contract with the Defendant on this ground. Further, Plaintiffs contend that Defendant violated ILSFDA by failing to furnish the required property report to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Plaintiffs in advance of the signing of their purchase agreements. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1703(a)(1)(B), 1707. Plaintiffs argue that Defendant did not meet any of the exemption requirements under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702 and therefore must comply with the relevant sections of ILSFDA. (Fleiss Decl., Ex. 1(A) \u00b6\u00b6 33-51.)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Section 1703(c) requires that if the property report requirement of ILSFDA is not satisfied, purchasers or lessees may revoke their contracts or agreements within a statutorily prescribed two year period and must be apprised of this right in the purchase agreement. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1703(c). Plaintiffs Indomenico and Sook submitted them revocation notices in a proper manner within the two year period. (Fleiss Decl., Ex. 1(A) at \u00b6 53; Fleiss Decl., Ex. 4(A) at \u00b6 50.) Plaintiffs Joon, Yoo, Kim, Yi, Levy, and Zucker did not file timely revocations, but maintain that their purchase agreements should be equitably revoked due to the failure of the purchase agreements to apprise them of their statutory right to revoke within the two year period. (Fleiss Decl., Ex. 2(A) at \u00b6\u00b6 62-64; Fleiss Decl., Ex. 3(A) at \u00b6\u00b6 61-63; Fleiss Decl., Ex. 5(A) at \u00b6\u00b6 60-62; Fleiss Decl., Ex. 6(A) at \u00b6\u00b6 61-64; Fleiss Decl., Ex. 7(A) at \u00b6 62; Fleiss Decl., Ex. 8(A) at \u00b6 62.)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Defendant argues that ILSFDA does not apply to the sale of condominium units and therefore it has no obligation to comply with the requirements of the statute. (Defendant\u2019s Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant\u2019s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (\u201cDef. Mem.\u201d) at 2.) Defendant also argues that applying the requirements of ILSFDA to condominiums, namely \u00a7 1703(d)(1), would place ILSFDA in direct conflict with certain provisions of the New York Real Property Law and regulations promulgated by the New York State Attorney General which apply to condominiums located in New York. Defendant contends that this conflict results in an \u201cabsurd result\u201d which could not possibly have been the intent of Congress. (Def. Mem. at 13-15.)</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">The standard for granting a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Fed. R. Civ. P 12(c) \u201cis identical to that of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion for failure to state a claim.\u201d <em>Patel v. Contemporary Classics of Beverly </em>Hills, 259 F.3d 123, 126 (2d Cir.2001); <em>Sheppard v. Beerman, </em>18 F.3d 147, 150 (2d Cir.1994); <em>see also Irish Lesbian &amp; Gay Org. v. Giuliani, </em>143 F.3d 638, 644 (2d Cir.1998). \u201cIn both postures, the district court must accept all allegations in the complaint as true and draw all inferences in the non-moving party\u2019s favor.\u201d <em>Patel, </em>259 F.3d at 126. A Rule 12(c) motion should not be granted unless the Court is \u201csatisfied that the complaint cannot state any set of facts that would entitle [the plaintiff] to relief.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">Defendant urges this Court to disregard HUD\u2019s interpretation of ILSFDA and numerous judicial decisions holding that condominiums in New York City fall within the scope of the statute. Defendant argues that the plain language of the statute is clear and no further analysis is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">A. ILSFDA Applies to the Purchase and Sale of Condominium Units.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">1. Interpreting the Term \u201cLot\u201d in ILSFDA</p>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">At issue is whether condominium units are subject to the requirements of ILSF-DA and therefore whether Defendant was under a duty to register with HUD or provide Plaintiffs with a property report in their purchase agreement. (Def. Mem. at 7.) The crux of this case lies in the inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>pretation of the word \u201clot\u201d found in ILSF-DA. Defendant argues that the express terms of ILSFDA limits its applicability to \u201clots\u201d, a category of property which Defendant contends cannot include condominiums. (Id; Transcript of June 29, 2011 Oral Argument (\u201cTr.\u201d) at 4-7.)</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">ILSFDA provides that the sales of \u201clots\u201d within a \u201csubdivision\u201d are subject to certain requirements, however, the statute provides for no definition of the term \u201clots.\u201d ILSFDA does, however, define the term \u201csubdivision\u201d as \u201cany land which is located in any State or a foreign country and is divided or is proposed to be divided into \u2018lots\u2019, whether contiguous or not, for the purpose of sale or lease as part of a common promotional plan.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701(3). Defendant urges the Court to consider the definition of \u201clot\u201d by way of reference to ILSFDA\u2019s definition of \u201csubdivision\u201d. (Def. Mem. at 8; Tr. at 4.) Defendant argues that the word \u201cland\u201d in the definition of \u201csubdivision\u201d refers to a physical area or parcel on the earth\u2019s surface, which is not covered by water. Accordingly, Defendant contends that this definition cannot possibly encompass units in a condominium. <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">ILSFDA has been applied to the sale of condominiums in this district and the Court is not aware of any authority holding that condominiums fall outside the scope of the Act. <em>See Winter, </em>777 F.2d at 1447-48 (\u201cWe find that HUD\u2019s inclusion of condominiums within the ILSFDA is a reasonable interpretation of Congress\u2019 original intent in enacting the statute and the only defensible interpretation given subsequent events\u201d); <em>Nickell v. Beau View of Biloxi L.L.C., </em>636 F.3d 752, 754 (5th Cir.2011) (\u201cRegulations were adopted that included condominium units within the definition of \u2018lots\u2019 under ILSA [ILSFDA], a definition we conclude is consistent with the statute\u201d); <em>See also Bodansky v. Fifth on the Park Condo, LLC, </em>635 F.3d 75, 79 (2d Cir.2011); <em>Nu-Chan, LLC v. 20 Pine Street LLC, </em>No. 09-477, 2010 WL 3825734, at *2-*3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 30, 2010); <em>An v. Leviev Fulton Club, LLC, </em>No. 09-1937, 2010 WL 3291402, *1 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 10, 2010); <em>Cruz v. Leviev Fulton Club, LLC, </em>711 F.Supp.2d 329, 331 (S.D.N.Y.2010); <em>Beauford v. Helmsley, </em>740 F.Supp. 201, 209 (S.D.N.Y.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">2. HUD Has Determined that ILSFDA Applies to the Sale of Condominiums</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Under \u00a7 1715(a) of ILSFDA, the administration of the statute falls under the Secretary of HUD, including the powers of \u201cinvestigating, hearing, determining, ordering, or otherwise acting as to any work, business, or matter under this chapter.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715(a). HUD has promulgated regulations that define a \u201clot\u201d as \u201cany portion, piece, division, unit, or undivided interest in land if such interest includes the right to the exclusive use of a specific portion of the land or unit.\u201d 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 1710.1(b). A condominium purchase agreement does give the owner exclusive use of a specific portion of the unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Furthermore, the Office of Interstate Land Sales Regulation (\u201cOISLR\u201d), a division of HUD, issued an advisory opinion in 1972 which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-10\">We agree that the key term is \u201clots\u201d in determining whether the sale of a condominium unit can be equated with the sale of a lot in the subdivision within the meaning of the act. We do not, however, agree that the concepts and characteristics of a lot and a condominium are mutually exclusive and that, therefore, a \u201cunit\u201d in a condominium cannot be considered a \u201cLot.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b448-11\">OISLR Exemption Advisory Opinion No. 1710.1(k) at 5 (August 20, 1972) (quoted in <em>Winter v. Hollingsworth Properties, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number><em>Inc., </em>587 F.Supp. 1289, 1291 (S.D.Fla.1984)). Moreover, HUD has issued ILSFDA interpretive guidelines which further clarify \u201clot\u201d to mean \u201cany portion, piece, division, unit or undivided interest in land if such interest includes the right to the exclusive use of a specific portion of the land or unit. This applies to the sale of a <em>condominium </em>or cooperative unit or a campsite as well as a traditional lot.\u201d 61 Fed.Reg. 13602; <em>See Winter, 777 </em>F.2d at 1447-1449 (emphasis added). Moreover, since 1969 HUD has consistently maintained that condominiums are subject to ILSFDA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-5\">The application of the Act to condominiums has been consistent OILSR policy since the issue was first raised in 1969. The bases for this position are that condominiums carry the indicia of and in fact are real estate, whether or not the units therein have been constructed. A condominium is accordingly viewed by OILSR as equivalent to a subdivision, each unit being a lot. Adverse comment, particularly from builders, asserts that condominiums are equivalent to houses and the sale of houses was not intended to be covered by the Act. However, the right to condominium space is a form of ownership, not a structural description. This condominium concept is employed as an ownership form for completely horizontal developments and even for campgrounds. Congress recognized the need to exempt professional builders from the Act and provided an appropriate exemption (15 U.S.C. 1702[ (a)(2) ]). For a condominium unit sale to be exempted from the Act, it must accordingly qualify for exemption; i.e., either it must be completed before it is sold, or it must be sold under a contract obligating the seller to erect the unit within two years from the date the purchaser signs the contract of sale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-6\"><em>Winter, 111 </em>F.2d at 1447 (quoting 38 Fed. Reg. 23,866).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">3. HUD\u2019s Determination is Entitled to Deference</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Once a Court determines that a statute is ambiguous, it must determine the level of deference to be granted to the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute it administers. <em>UnitUed Airlines, Inc. v. Brien, </em>588 F.3d 158, 172 (2d Cir.2009). Defendant argues that HD\u2019s definition of \u201clot\u201d to include condominiums is inconsistent with the intent of Congress and thus is not entitled deference from this Court. (Def. Mem. at 20; Tr. at 11.) <em>Chevron, U.S.A. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), held that an agency that is charged with administration of a statute is entitled to deference as to their interpretation of that statute if certain circumstances are present. \u201cFirst, always, is the question whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue. If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 842-43., 104 S.Ct. 2778 If Congress has not spoken directly on the issue, a Court must determine whether the agency\u2019s interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statute. <em>Id. </em>at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. \u201cIn such a case, a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Agency interpretations are entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference only if they carry the force of law. Interpretations found in opinion letters, guidelines, manuals, and policy statements do not carry the force-of-law and are \u201centitled to respect ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>under <em>Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., </em>323 U.S. 134, 140, 65 S.Ct. 161, 89 L.Ed. 124 (1944), but only to the extent that those interpretations have the power to persuade\u201d <em>Christensen v. Harris County, </em>529 U.S. 576, 587, 120 S.Ct. 1655, 146 L.Ed.2d 621 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under either <em>Chevron </em>or <em>Skidmore </em>deference, this Court finds no reason why HUD\u2019s interpretation that condominiums fall under the auspice of ILSFDA, which has been followed by courts since 1969, should be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">4. Defendant\u2019s Statutory Interpretation Argument Fails</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Defendant argues the Plaintiffs\u2019 claims should be dismissed because ILSFDA by its plain and unambiguous terms does not apply to the sale of condominium units. Defendant asserts that the express terms of ILSFDA limit its applicability to \u201clots\u201d, a category of property which Defendant contends does not include condominiums. (Def. Mem. at 7; Tr. at 4.) As noted <em>supra, </em>Defendant attempts to equate the term \u201cland\u201d with the term \u201clot\u201d by way of mutual presence in the definition of \u201csubdivision\u201d found in ILSFDA. Defendant argues that \u201clots\u201d are parcels or pieces of \u201cland\u201d that when added together form a \u201csubdivision.\u201d (Def. Mem. at 8; Tr. at 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">In support of this argument, Defendant cites to numerous dictionary definitions which generally state that \u201cland\u201d is any part of the earth\u2019s surface that is not covered by a body of water. <em>(Id.) </em>Defendant therefore posits that a condominium unit could not possibly be construed as \u201cland\u201d if given its commonly understood meaning. Furthermore, Defendant argues that ownership of a condominium unit includes ownership of an undivided percentage interest in the condominium\u2019s common elements, including the land on which the condominium sits. (Def. Mem. at 10; Tr. at 5.) This feature of condominium ownership, Defendant asserts, precludes condominium owners from exclusive use of any of the common elements, including ownership of the land. <em>(Id.) </em>Therefore, Defendant argues that the plain meaning of the word \u201clot\u201d in the statute precludes the Court from deferring to HUD\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201clot\u201d as contrary to Congressional intent. <em>See Rubin v. United States, </em>449 U.S. 424, 430, 101 S.Ct. 698, 66 L.Ed.2d 633 (1981) (\u201cWhen we find the terms of a statute unambiguous, judicial inquiry is complete, except in rare and exceptional circumstances.\u201d) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Plaintiffs, however, counter that Defendant\u2019s focus on distinguishing condominiums from \u201cland\u201d is misplaced, because Defendant fails to include any alternate definitions of \u201cland.\u201d Plaintiff also cites to numerous dictionary definitions, including <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(9th Ed. 2009), which alternatively defines land as \u201can estate or interest in real property,\u201d a definition that would encompass an interest in a condominium unit. (Plaintiffs Memorandum of Law in Opposition to Defendant\u2019s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings (\u201cPl. Mem.\u201d) at 2-3; Tr. at 20.) Additionally, the legislative history of ILSFDA also employs both the terms \u201cland\u201d and \u201creal estate.\u201d <em>Winter, </em>777 F.2d at 1447 (citing Conf. Rep. No. 1785, 90th Cong., 2d Sess. (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">The Court also takes note of Congress\u2019 1978 Amendment to ILSFDA discussed <em>supra, </em>where the addition of \u201ccondominium\u201d to the \u201cimproved lot\u201d exemption would seem to suggest \u201cthat Congress has acquiesced to HUD\u2019s interpretation.\u201d <em>Nu-Chan, LLC, </em>2010 WL 3825734, at *3. Plaintiffs argues that Congress was aware of HUD\u2019s consistent interpretation and therefore exempted completed condominiums from the scope of ILSFDA thus indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>eating that Congress agreed ILSFDA did apply to uncompleted condominiums. (Pl. Mem. at 11-12; Tr. at 22-23.); <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1702(a)(2); <em>Winter, </em>777 F.2d at 1449-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">5. Conflict with New York Law is not Evidence of Congressional Intent</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Defendant argues that the application of ILSFDA to condominiums would result in \u201cpatently absurd\u201d consequences due to an overlap in the governing provisions of New York law. (Def. Mem. at 13.) While the Second Circuit has acknowledged that condominium sponsors could be burdened by two sets of law; it held that \u201cCongress was aware of such a possibility and explicitly provided a solution, allowing states to request HUD to certify that the state\u2019s disclosure requirements are \u2018at least substantially equivalent\u2019 to ILSA\u2019s [ILSFDA] disclosure requirements or otherwise \u2018provide sufficient protection for purchasers and lessees\u2019 with respect to such matters.\u201d <em>Bodansky, </em>635 F.3d at 86 (citing 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1708(c); 24 C.F.R. \u00a7 1710.500).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Ultimately, the Supremacy Clause dictates that a Federal Statute will preempt any such New York Law. U.S. Const. art. IV, cl. 2. The Supreme Court has held that \u201c[i]t is beyond peradventure that federal power over commerce is superior to that of the States to provide for the welfare or necessities of their inhabitants, however legitimate or dire those necessities may be.\u201d <em>Gonzales v. Raich, </em>545 U.S. 1, 29, 125 S.Ct. 2195, 162 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">Regardless, any such arguments which attempt to infer congressional intent based on conflicts between New York law and ILSFDA\u2019s requirements are not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b451-10\">The Court is satisfied that the legislative history and HUD\u2019s interpretative analysis amply dictate that ILSFDA applies to condominiums. The true reasoning behind Plaintiffs decision to rescind their contract is not for this Court to decide. Accordingly, Defendant\u2019s Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-11\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b445-6\">.
