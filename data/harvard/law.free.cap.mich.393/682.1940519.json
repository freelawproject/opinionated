S. Coleman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7f\">Plaintiffs appeal an order of the State Tax Commission (STC) regarding its equalization of property tax assessments in Washtenaw County. Adhering to the decision in <em>Cooper Twp v State Tax Commission, </em>393 Mich 58; 222 NW2d 900 (1974), we vacate the STC order and remand to the Tax Tribunal for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">On April 24, 1972, the Washtenaw County Board of Commissioners equalized the value of real property in the county.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Supervisor of Ypsilanti Township petitioned the STC for a review of this action<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> saying in part that it created \"non-uniformity of the tax burden between classes of property and communities within the county\u201d. The STC accepted the \"appeal from the 1972 equalization of Washtenaw County\u201d on May 8, 1972.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">The STC surveyed property in Washtenaw County. This study resulted in preliminary findings increasing the equalized value of every county unit except Ypsilanti Township. A hearing was set for August 7, 1973. Representatives of the newly aggrieved cities and townships had an opportunity to present evidence regarding the equalization of Washtenaw County by the STC. The hearing was continued to September 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>The Commission\u2019s final order was signed October 10, 1973. It briefly recited the chronology. It said the STC staff \"reviewed the statements made by the supervisors at the hearings\u201d. There was a \"field check\u201d made of some units \"after which the report was prepared showing some revision of valuation in some of the units from the preliminary findings\u201d. \"After reviewing the whole file and the voluminous material\u201d in its possession, the STC \"adopted a resolution determining the equalized valuation of the several townships and cities of Washtenaw County\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-4\">The Court of Appeals denied plaintiffs\u2019 application for leave to appeal and their application for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\"><em>Cooper Twp </em>concerned, as does the instant case, an appeal of equalization action taken by the county board of commissioners. The STC\u2019s final order in <em>Cooper Twp </em>failed to meet the requirements of MCLA 209.102; MSA 7.632<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and on remand we directed the STC to comply with this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>provision. The order in this case is likewise flawed and requires a remedial remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">The STC was also required by <em>Cooper Twp </em>to \"conduct the equalization hearing under the relevant provisions of the Administrative Procedures Act, MCLA 24.271-24.287; MSA 3.560(171)-3.560(187)\u201d. The form and substance of a \"final decision or order of an agency in a contested case\u201d are detailed by MCLA 24.285; MSA 3.560(185).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> These requirements were not met in this case.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">In <em>Cooper Twp </em>we remanded the matter to the newly created Tax Tribunal. MCLA 205.701-205.779; MSA 7.650(l)-7.650(79). Although we expressly gave \"no consideration * * * to the practices and procedures of the Tax Tribunal\u201d we did remand to that body \"for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">We cannot pass judgment on how the Tax Tribunal conducts its proceedings until we have such proceedings before us. However, MCLA 205.721; MSA 7.650(21) states that the Tribunal \"is a quasi-judicial agency\u201d. As such, we would expect it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>conform to procedures applicable to other such agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Plaintiffs have raised another question concerning equalization. Noting that the constitutional goal in taxation is uniformity,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> plaintiffs argue that the STC subordinated that principle by denying the relevancy of evidence concerning the equalization results and practices in other counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">In <em>Allied Supermarkets, Inc v Detroit, </em>391 Mich 460; 216 NW2d 755 (1974), we said that the \"process of equalization is designed to enhance the goal of uniformity\u201d. That goal is achieved by both intra-<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and inter-<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>county equalization, by uniformity within and between the counties.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>The STC\u2019s final order in this case intended to achieve uniformity within Washtenaw County. However, its final order resulted in an increase in the state equalized valuation of Washtenaw County.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In attempting to achieve uniformity within counties, it must be remembered that uniformity should also be maintained between counties. In balancing the one scale the other should not be unbalanced.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Remand to the Tax Tribunal for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b760-6\">T. G.
