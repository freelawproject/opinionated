Coleman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Avt\">Defendant appeals the decision of the Court of Appeals affirming his conviction for possession of heroin. See 46 Mich App 322; 208 NW2d 70 (1973). We conclude that under the facts of this case, the initial stop of the automobile in which defendant was a passenger was without a reasonable basis. Because all else flowed from this initial stop, defendant\u2019s conviction is reversed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>The case comes to this Court after defendant has been released from prison and is on parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">On October 27, 1969 a Saline police officer \"observed a black 1963 Ford 2-door traveling west on Michigan Avenue at 3 a.m. in the morning\u201d. There were \"four or five\u201d occupants. The Ford traveled through the center of the city at the proper 25 mph speed with the officer following. It proceeded through a 35-mph zone at the same speed and continued at 25 mph into the 45-mph zone. The officer testified that he followed the automobile about one and one-half miles \"[d]ue to the appearance of the occupants, they did appear young\u201d. He estimated them to be \"16 to 18 years old, possibly younger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">After the automobile left the city limits, it was stopped by the officer. The reasons for the stop are summarized in this conversation between the court and the officer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-8\"><em>\"The Court: </em>Let me satisfy myself, if I may, on this. As I understand your testimony then, Officer, you are saying that the reason or reasons that you stopped this vehicle were two; first, that the vehicle was travelling at a speed of 25 miles per hour in a 25 <em>[sic] </em>mile an hour zone; secondly, that the age of the occupants of the vehicle as you observed them led you to suspect that one or more of them might be under the curfew age then in effect for the City of Saline, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\"><em>\"A. </em>Yes, sir, also for safety\u2019s sake, the occupants, they were travelling slowly, a possibility they were sleeping or ill.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">As the officer approached the automobile, the driver rolled down the window. The officer \"detected a strong odor of marijuana coming from the vehicle or suspected marijuana.\u201d The officer called for assistance and when it arrived the occupants of the automobile were ordered to line up outside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>car. While one officer searched the car, the other noticed defendant throw an object into a field. It was retrieved and ultimately found to contain 2/ lOOths of a gram of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Defendant claims error in allowing the officer\u2019s testimony concerning the marijuana smell in the car. He also claims error in the judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury that they had to find a usable amount of heroin or the remnants of a usable amount to sustain the verdict of possession of narcotic drugs. Defendant further argues that the stop was improper under these circumstances and that the testimony and evidence should be suppressed because all else flowed from this stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">It is the latter issue to which we address ourselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">In <em>People v Whalen, </em>390 Mich 672; 213 NW2d 116 (1973), this Court clearly expressed the rules which \"apply today with respect to stopping, searching and seizing of motor vehicles and their contents\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">\"1. Reasonableness is the test that is to be applied for both the stop of, and the search of moving motor vehicles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">\"2. Said reasonableness will be determined from the facts and circumstances of each case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-9\">\"3. Fewer foundation facts are necessary to support a finding of reasonableness when moving vehicles are involved, than if a house or a home were involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-10\">\"4. A stop of a motor vehicle for investigatory purposes may be based upon fewer facts than those necessary to support a finding of reasonableness where both a stop and a search is conducted by the police.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">We recognize the enormity of the problem of narcotics control and the difficulties inherent in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>the apprehension of offenders. There is necessarily some conflict between the need to apply realistic standards of law enforcement in such cases and the need to protect citizens from unreasonable intrusions into their privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Here, three reasons were advanced as supporting the reasonableness of the stop. The first reason offered was that the car was going 25 mph in a 45-mph zone. Given the absence of a minimum speed requirement, erratic driving, interference with trafile or some other reason of substance, we must conclude that this alone was not sufficient to warrant a stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Second was a suspected violation of the Saline curfew ordinance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the occupants of the car were all over 16, and the curfew applies to those under 16, such a miscalculation of age might be understandable. However, the curfew prohibitions do not apply to those proceeding through the city in an automobile. It can hardly be found that these persons were loitering, idling or congregating on the streets through which they drove.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Finally, the officer who stopped the car said that he was concerned that the occupants were \"sleeping or ill.\u201d No physical observation was placed in evidence to support this concern excepting the 25-mph speed. There was no testimony indicating that the vehicle was operated in a manner posing a danger to person or property. Compare MCLA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>257.626; MSA 9.2326<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and MCLA 257.626b; MSA 9.2326(2)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>. The record does not afford sufficient indication that the reason expressed justified the stop of the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">In good conscience we cannot find that, as a totality, the three stated concerns of the police provide a reasonable basis for the stop under the facts presented. Over the years, stops similar to that in this case have failed to satisfy the standards of this Court. In <em>People v Roache, </em>237 Mich 215; 211 NW 742 (1927), defendant\u2019s car was stopped by a motorcycle policeman. The officer stopped the car because he \"suspected the men because they looked suspicious to me: they were watching me as I passed, as I went on the road on the motorcycle\u201d. He also felt that \"they were driving slower than an ordinary person, a person on the highway\u201d. A search of the car disclosed that defendant was illegally transporting intoxicants. In reversing the conviction, the Court, citing language from <em>People v Kamhout, </em>227 Mich 172; 198 NW 831 (1924) indicated that the facts of <em>Boache </em>would not lead \" 'a prudent and careful person, having due regard for the rights of others\u2019 to have reasonable and probable cause to believe that liquor was being unlawfully transported in defendant\u2019s automobile\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>The stop in <em>People v Stein, </em>265 Mich 610; 251 NW 788; 92 ALR 481 (1933), involved a taxicab in which defendant was riding. The officer\u2019s attention was drawn by the cab\u2019s speed (\"about 32 miles per hour\u201d) and a motion by defendant (\" 'as if he was taking something out of his pocket and putting it on the seat beside him\u2019 or behind him\u201d). The Court said the record left \"no doubt that the officers arrested defendants on general suspicion and not for a specific offense\u201d. The conviction was reversed because the \"general suspicion that, perhaps, a crime is being committed by defendants does not justify an arrest\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">No \"suspicious activity\u201d has been offered here nor any testimony providing a reasonable basis for stopping the automobile. The factual foundations for the decisions in <em>Terry v Ohio, </em>392 US 1; 88 S Ct 1868; 20 L Ed 2d 889 (1968) and <em>Adams v Williams, </em>407 US 143; 92 S Ct 1921; 32 L Ed 2d 612 (1972) are not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">We conclude that the reasons given for the stop, considered in the totality of the circumstances, were not sufficient to warrant a stop of the automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">The Court of Appeals is reversed and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b107-9\">T.
