We express no opinion on other issues raised by the parties not necessary to our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The Court of Appeals is reversed. This cause is remanded for new trial or other proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">I \u2014Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">On October 10, 1971, at dusk, Officer Logan Tisdale of the Michigan State Police, in the course of his patrol duties, observed a 1965 Pontiac with one inoperative taillight proceeding westbound on M-81 in Saginaw, Michigan. Trooper Tisdale turned his patrol car around, gave chase, and quickly stopped the offending vehicle. As the Trooper approached the car after the stop, he noticed a TV set resting on the back seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">While in the process of checking the driver\u2019s license and car registration, the beam of the trooper\u2019s flashlight fell upon a pistol partially hidden behind defendant Johnson\u2019s left foot. Johnson was sitting in the passenger seat of the Pontiac. Thereupon, defendant and the driver, Leroy Reed, were ordered out of the car at gunpoint, arrested, frisked, handcuffed to one another and placed in the rear of the patrol car. While accomplishing this task, Trooper Tisdale confiscated the weapon, a .38-caliber Smith &amp; Wesson top-break, he had observed behind defendant\u2019s foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">The trooper then radioed for assistance and for a wrecker. When a second State Police car arrived, the arresting trooper returned to the stopped automobile to remove the television set. In accomplishing that endeavor, Trooper Tisdale discovered under the front seat of the Pontiac two additional weapons, a .32-caliber automatic and a .38-caliber <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Smith &amp; Wesson side-break snub-nosed revolver. Both of these pistols were eventually confiscated.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Defendant was charged with the crime of carrying a concealed weapon. MCLA 750.227; MSA 28.424. A pretrial motion to suppress the weapons was denied by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">At trial, only two witnesses were called to the witness stand: Trooper Tisdale and defendant Johnson. The prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of defendant concentrated nearly exclusively<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on defendant\u2019s background and alleged predisposition to criminal activity. The cross-examination included reference to:</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">\n<em>his employment and education record:</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-9\"><em>\"Q: </em>Where were you working on the tenth of October?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-10\"><em>\"A. </em>I wasn\u2019t working.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-11\"><em>\"The Court: </em>Will you talk louder please, and answer louder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-12\"><em>\"Witness: </em>I wasn\u2019t working.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-13\"><em>\"Mr. Webber [assistant prosecuting </em>attorney](Con\u2019t.):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-14\"><em>\"Q. </em>Where are you working today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-15\"><em>\"A. </em>I am not working.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-16\"><em>\"Q. </em>How long has it been since you held a job?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-17\"><em>\"Mr. Geyer [defense counsel]: </em>Your Honor, I am going to object to this line of questioning.

Now, what are the proofs, you tell me. Think about it. <em>There\u2019s a man with two cents in his pocket and he hasn\u2019t worked for a long time, there\u2019s three guns, three </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number><em>fully loaded weapons in the vehicle. That is something that you can consider when you decide whether or not this defendant committed this particular violation.\u201d </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Defendant was jury-convicted of carrying a concealed weapon and was sentenced to a term of 2-1/ 2 to 5 years in prison. The Court of Appeals affirmed. 48 Mich App 50; 209 NW2d 868 (1973). We granted leave to appeal on January 28, 1974. 391 Mich 764.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">II \u2014Prosecutorial Questioning and Advice That Jury Can Consider Defendant\u2019s Poverty and Unemployment in Determining CCW Guilt Is Improper and Erroneous</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">In the prosecutor\u2019s argument quoted above, the prosecutor said in effect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-9\">\"[Y]ou can consider when you decide whether or not this defendant committed this particular violation [CCW] *\u2022 * * [that he is] a man with two cents in his pocket and he hasn\u2019t worked for a long time * * * .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">Obviously neither poverty nor unemployment is an element of the crime of carrying a concealed weapon. Either a poor man or a rich man may be either guilty or innocent of carrying a concealed weapon. Likewise whether a man is employed or unemployed is no proof or partial proof of carrying a concealed weapon. Neither does defendant\u2019s poverty or unemployment affect his testimonial credibility in this case. In short, these things neither in law nor in logic are evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence or his tendency to lie or tell the truth. To assert otherwise is to argue a <em>non sequitur.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Consequently this argument and advice to the jury by the prosecutor is erroneous and patently prejudicial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And in this connection so is the cross-examination leading up to this argument and advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Ill \u2014Prosecutorial Questioning and Argument Suggestive Defendant Was En Route to Committing Violent Crime Not Charged Improper and Erroneous</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s argument quoted above and the bulk of his cross-examination attempted to create in the minds of the jury the belief that defendant because of his poverty and unemployment plus the possession of three loaded weapons was en route to committing a robbery armed or some such crime. That this is what the prosecutor was about is clear on the face of the record and is reinforced by the following reaction of the trial judge, who noted in the sentencing proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-8\">\"It looked as if you were on the way to commit another crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-9\">We will not condone the prosecutorial effort to \"prove\u201d commission of an uncharged, unrelated \"Crime X\u201d in order to gain defendant\u2019s conviction of \"Crime Y\u201d. This is far from a novel proposition in Michigan.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Eighty-five years ago, this Court held unequivocally:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>\"Whatever latitude is proper in cross-examination to test veracity, it cannot properly introduce independent issues against the person who is both witness and respondent.\u201d <em>People v Pinkerton, </em>79 Mich 110, 114; 44 NW 180 (1889).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">Likewise, the prosecutor may not allude to such proscribed issues in closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">The passage of 85 years has not disturbed the validity of this maxim of evidentiary trial practice in the slightest. As recently as last year, we reaffirmed this proposition even where the witness is <em>not </em>a criminal defendant. <em>People v Whalen, </em>390 Mich 672, 683-687; 213 NW2d 116 (1973). See also: <em>People v Wright, </em>294 Mich 20, 27-30; 292 NW 539 (1940), and citations contained therein; and 1 Gillespie, Michigan Criminal Law &amp; Procedure, \u00a7 442, p 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">After scrupulous review of the record in this case, we find it undeniable that defendant\u2019s analysis of the courtroom atmosphere created by the prosecutor is correct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\">\"It is obvious that the cross-examination of Appellant was designed to create in the minds of the jury the inference that was later explicitly articulated by the prosecutor. The inference is as follows: An impoverished, unemployed man is found in a vehicle which also contained three guns. Having no money and no job, he is obviously on his way to commit a crime. He therefore must have known that the weapons were in the vehicle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">IV \u2014Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\">Whether defendant was rich or poor, employed or unemployed, has nothing to do with guilt in the instant case nor do allegations and insinuations of potential predisposition to commit a forcible crime <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>against persons or property go to proving the charged offense of carrying a concealed weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">That is not to say, however, that the trial court does not have considerable discretion in ruling on the relevance and materiality of argument coming before it. Clearly, the trial court has broad discretion in exercising its judgment whether a particular line of inquiry or argument is to be allowed before the jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>People v Dye, </em>356 Mich 271, 277; 96 NW2d 788 (1959). Yet there is an obvious limit to the exercise of such discretion in cases of abuse. <em>People v Dye, supra, </em>277.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">In the instant case, the trial court did indeed abuse its discretion in allowing the prosecutor free rein to cross-examine defendant (and to subsequently refer to such cross-examination in closing argument) through inquiries designed to demonstrate a causal connection between extraneous matters and guilt on the charge of carrying a concealed weapon, and through his attempt to convict defendant of the charged offense by means of persuading the jury that defendant was on his way to commit an altogether unrelated offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">It is the duty of the courts to keep prosecutorial \"character\u201d examination \"within reasonable bounds.\u201d <em>People v Gotshall, </em>123 Mich 474, 483; 82 NW 274 (1900). The instant case well illustrates the necessity for such constraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>We hold that the cross-examination of defendant in the instant case, and the subsequent prosecutorial reference thereto in closing argument, were prejudicially and reversibly erroneous. The trial court abused its grant of discretion in the instant case by allowing such irrelevant matters to be brought to the jury\u2019s attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The Court of Appeals is reversed. This cause is remanded for new trial or further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b572-7\">T. G. Kavanagh, C. J., and T. M. Kavanagh, Swainson, and Levin, JJ., concurred with Williams, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b565-22\"> All told, the prosecutorial questioning of appellant <em>other </em>than that which focuses on appellant\u2019s background and predisposition, constitutes only about one page of total testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b567-23\"> The prosecutor also questioned defendant about an alleged past nonsupport conviction not earlier raised by defense counsel. Due to our disposition of this matter today, there is no need to reach the issue of the propriety of impeachment through use of past conviction record. <em>Cf. People v Jackson, </em>391 Mich 323; 217 NW2d 22 (1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b569-10\">We note as well that had the reference to defendant\u2019s probationary status, and the subsequent reference thereto made in closing argument, been made in a trial taking place on or after November 20, 1973, such impeachment would have been clear error under <em>People v Rappuhn, </em>390 Mich 266; 212 NW2d 205 (1973), decided that date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b569-11\"> Nor is it novel in other jurisdictions. See as recent examples: <em>State v Beyor, </em>129 Vt 472; 282 A2d 819 (1971), and <em>People v Liapis, 3 </em>Ill App 3d 864; 279 NE2d 368 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b571-9\"> Appellee also argues that failure to request a curative instruction bars consideration on appeal of the \"prejudicial propensity\u201d of its line of questioning. Appellee cites for this proposition <em>People v Humphreys, </em>24 Mich App 411; 180 NW2d 328 (1970); <em>People v Majette, </em>39 Mich App 35; 197 NW2d 78 (1972); and <em>People v Sesson, </em>45 Mich App 288; 206 NW2d 495 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">Critical to the line of cases cited <em>supra, </em>was the absence of objection on the part of defense counsel, a factor <em>not </em>found in the instant case. At any rate, we are not persuaded that the \"prejudicial propensity\u201d of the improper questioning and argument in the instant case could have been eliminated no matter the amount of cautionary instruction. <em>Humphreys, supra, </em>415.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b572-8\">M.
