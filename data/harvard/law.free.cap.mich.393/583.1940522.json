In March, 1972, pursuant to provisions of the teachers\u2019 tenure act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> she was notified in writing that her contract would not be renewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Urka filed a grievance asserting that non-renewal of her contract violated the collective bargaining agreement. Urka was not satisfied with the resolution of her grievance and the union demanded arbitration pursuant to a provision of the agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">The board refused to submit to arbitration and sought injunctive relief in the circuit court. That court found that Urka\u2019s claim was not arbitrable under the agreement and entered a permanent injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">The Court of Appeals affirmed. We reverse and dissolve the injunction barring arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">Under the teachers\u2019 tenure act all teachers during the first two years of employment are on probation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As probationary teachers, their services may be discontinued on written notice at \"least 60 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>days before the close of the school year\u201d.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The board timely gave such notice. It is not contended that the proposed termination of Urka\u2019s employment violates the teachers\u2019 tenure act.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">It is, rather, the claim of the union and Urka that under the collective bargaining agreement the board limited its right under the act to discontinue the employment of a probationary teacher. The board counters that the right under the act not to renew the contract of a probationary teacher is explicitly reserved to the board under the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">All agree that the question of arbitrability is for a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Arbitration is a matter of contract.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A party cannot be required to arbitrate an issue which he has not agreed to submit to arbitration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The collective bargaining agreement between the union and the board provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-8\">\"ARTICLE XIV.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">\"Professional Grievance Procedure</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-10\">\"A.

No teacher shall be disciplined, reprimanded, reduced in rank or compensation, or deprived of any professional advantage without just cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-10\">The board\u2019s complaint in the circuit court alleged that when Urka was notified in writing that her services would be discontinued she was advised that her services were \"not satisfactory\u201d.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-11\">The union and Urka contend that the non-renewal of Urka\u2019s contract violated Art XI(C) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>collective bargaining agreement<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that pursuant to Art XIV(E), there having occurred a failure to resolve a grievance involving the interpretation, application and an alleged violation of a specific article and section of the agreement, they are entitled to go to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The board responds that Urka\u2019s claim is nonarbitrable under Art II where the board reserved to itself without limitation all powers, rights and authority conferred upon and vested in it by the laws of this state, including the right to \"hire all employees\u201d and to determine \"the conditions for their continued employment or their dismissal or demotion\u201d, the exercise of which powers, rights and authorities \"shall be limited only by the specific and express terms hereof\u2019 in conformance with the Constitution and laws of this state and the United States. The board would have a court decide that, by reason of Art II, non-renewal of a probationary teacher\u2019s contract does not violate Art XI(C) and that it did not agree to submit to arbitration a claim inconsistent with its rights under Art II.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">This collective bargaining agreement was entered into in accordance with the public employment relations act (PERA).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In construing the provisions and ramifications of the PERA, this Court has frequently looked to decisions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>Federal courts which construe and apply the National Labor Relations Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-4\">The policy favoring arbitration of disputes arising under collective bargaining agreements, as enunciated by the United States Supreme Court in the Steelworkers\u2019 Trilogy,* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is appropriate for contracts entered into under the PERA.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">In <em>United Steelworkers of America v American Manufacturing Co, </em>363 US 564, 568; 80 S Ct 1343 4 L Ed 2d 1403 (1960), the Court said that while the question whether a dispute is arbitrable is for a court, the judicial inquiry \"is confined to ascertaining whether the party seeking arbitration is making <em>a claim which on its face </em>is governed by the contract. Whether the moving party is right or wrong is a question of contract interpretation for the arbitrator.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">The union and Urka contend that \"on its face\u201d her <em>claim </em>is \"governed by the contract\u201d, the collective bargaining agreement. The board contends that it is not asking the Court to interpret or apply any provision of the agreement because Urka\u2019s claim \"on its face\u201d is not governed by the agreement but by the reserved rights of the board, including its rights under the teachers\u2019 tenure act. Urka\u2019s <em>claim </em>is not based on the teachers\u2019 tenure act but on the collective bargaining agreement. Whether she has a valid <em>claim </em>is \"governed by the contract\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>In <em>United Steelworkers of America v Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co, </em>363 US 574, 582-583; 80 S Ct 1347; 4 L Ed 2d 1409 (1960), the collective bargaining agreement provided for arbitration of differences concerning the meaning and application of provisions of the contract except matters which are \"strictly a function of the management\u201d. The Court held that, despite the \"function of management\u201d reservation clause, the issue of contracting out work formerly done by employees was arbitrable. The Court said, \"An order to arbitrate the particular grievance should not be denied unless it may be said with positive assurance that the <em>arbitration clause </em>is not susceptible of an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute. Doubts should be resolved in favor of coverage.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Absent an <em>\"express provision </em>excluding [a] particular grievance from arbitration\u201d or the <em>\"most forceful evidence </em>of a purpose to exclude the claim\u201d, (emphasis supplied) the matter should go to arbitration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">\"Accordingly, 'strictly a function of management\u2019 must be interpreted as referring only to that over which the contract gives management complete control and unfettered discretion. Respondent claims that the contracting out of work falls within this category. Contracting out work is the basis of many grievances; and that type of claim is grist in the mills of the arbitrators. A specific collective bargaining agreement may exclude contracting out from the grievance procedure. Or a written collateral agreement may make clear that contracting out was not a matter for arbitration. In such a case a grievance based solely on contracting out would not be arbitrable. Here, however, there is no such provision. Nor is there any showing that the parties designed the phrase 'strictly a function of management\u2019 to encompass any and all forms of contracting out. In the absence of any express' provision excluding a particular grievance from arbitration, we think only the most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>forceful evidence of a purpose to exclude the claim from arbitration can prevail, particularly where, as here, the exclusion clause is vague and the arbitration clause quite broad. Since any attempt by a court to infer such a purpose necessarily comprehends the merits, the court should view with suspicion an attempt to persuade it to become entangled in the construction of the substantive provisions of a labor agreement, even through the back door of interpreting the arbitration clause, when the alternative is to utilize the services of an arbitrator.\u201d <em>United Steelworkers of America v Warrior &amp; Gulf Navigation Co, supra, </em>pp 584-585.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">The board did not specifically reserve from arbitration claims arising under Art XI(C). There is no evidence, forceful or otherwise, of a purpose to \"exclude\u201d from arbitration claims based on Art XI(C).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>The circuit and appeals courts, asserting that Urka\u2019s claim \"on its face\u201d was not governed by the agreement, decided the merits of the dispute in concluding that the language \"disciplined, reprimanded, reduced in rank or compensation, or deprived of any professional advantage\u201d in an article of the agreement concerning \"teacher evaluation\u201d of both probationary and tenured teachers might not cover non-renewal of a probationary teacher\u2019s contract for the reason that her services had not been \"satisfactory\u201d and that a construction in favor of coverage was necessarily precluded by the management-rights provision although, in terms, that provision is limited by the \"specific and express terms\u201d of the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The agreement of the parties indeed includes a forceful reservation by the board of rights in certain matters. Arguably, in such a situation a court should have leeway to weigh the competing claims and determine whether the reservation of rights by the board, if not expressly, at least impliedly covers the disputed matter. That approach, however, gives to the court the task assigned to the arbitrator \u2014 namely, the interpretation and application of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">In deciding whether a dispute involving an issue of contract interpretation is arbitrable, a court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>should guard against the temptation to make its own interpretation of the substantive provisions of the contract encompassing the merits of the dispute. If the parties have agreed that an arbitrator shall decide questions of contract interpretation, the merits of the dispute are for the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">Where a court finds itself weighing the pros and cons of each party\u2019s interpretation of substantive provisions of the contract, it is likely that the court has gone astray. The question for the court is not whether one interpretation or another is correct, but whether the parties have agreed that an arbitrator shall decide which of the competing interpretations is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Our holding is a most limited one. We intimate nothing about the possible merits of Urka\u2019s claim. It may well be that the construction placed on the agreement by the circuit and appeals courts is correct \u2014 non-renewal of Urka\u2019s contract did not violate Art XI(C) and was a right reserved to the board under Art II. But it may not be said \"with positive assurance\u201d that the <em>arbitration </em>clause\u2014 which covers alleged \"violation, misinterpretation or misapplication of <em>any </em>provision\u201d (emphasis supplied) of the agreement \u2014 is \"not susceptible of an interpretation that covers\u201d Urka\u2019s dispute. Whether the union\u2019s and Urka\u2019s contention that the non-renewal of her contract violates Art XI(C) is a correct interpretation and application of the agreement is a question for the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The rule promulgated by the United States Supreme Court puts the burden on the party who would exclude a matter from a general arbitration clause to do so expressly and explicitly. We adopt that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">We reverse the Court of Appeals and dissolve the injunction restraining arbitration of Urka\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>grievance for the reason that Urka\u2019s claim does not pertain to a matter the parties specifically excluded from arbitration.</p>\n<judges id=\"b668-6\">T.

Menasco decided to close one of Howmet\u2019s plants because it was operating at a substantial loss. Menasco and the union representing employees at that plant were unable to agree on severance and vacation pay, job transfer and preferential hiring at other Menasco plants and payments to the pension plan.
