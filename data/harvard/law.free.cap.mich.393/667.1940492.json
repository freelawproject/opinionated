He was convicted by jury verdict. The Court of Appeals affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction in a brief per curiam opinion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but remanded for resentencing under \u00a7 41 of the new Controlled Substances Act, MCLA 335.341; MSA 18.1070(41) pursuant to <em>People v Lorentzen, 387 </em>Mich 167; 194 NW2d 827 (1972). We granted leave to appeal. Defendant raises 11 allegations of error. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Prior to the commencement of trial defense counsel made a motion to amend the information before the trial court to have a count of possession of marijuana added in order that defendant might plead guilty to the added count. The prosecutor informed the court and defense counsel that the people would not be satisfied with a plea to possession and wanted to go to trial on the charge of sale of marijuana. The court at this point informed defendant and his counsel that if they tendered a plea of guilty to possession of marijuana the prosecutor would still retain the right to go to trial on the charge of sale of marijuana. Prior to the acceptance of his plea, defendant was again informed that a plea of guilty to possession of marijuana would not dispose of the principle charge of sale of marijuana and that trial on that charge would proceed. Defendant\u2019s plea of guilty to pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>session of marijuana was then accepted by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">At trial, Pamela Dinsmore, a police undercover agent, testified that she purchased two lids of marijuana from defendant on January 19, 1971, stating that she had made arrangements to purchase marijuana from him on the previous day. Prior to the transaction she had known defendant casually. She testified that defendant, on January 18, 1971, had indicated that he did not have any marijuana but stated that he would have some the next day. He told her to call him on the 19th regarding the purchase of marijuana. She called defendant and prearranged the purchase. Then, cooperating with the police, Dinsmore went to defendant\u2019s residence with the intention of purchasing one lid of marijuana.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She spent approximately 45 minutes at defendant\u2019s residence, during which defendant persuaded her to purchase a second lid of marijuana and completed the sale of the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">Linda Taylor, a friend of defendant who was at defendant\u2019s residence at the time of the sale, testified that Mrs. Dinsmore asked defendant if she could purchase marijuana and defendant said he could get her some. She indicated Mrs. Dinsmore initiated the purchase of a second lid of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">Defendant testified that in response to Mrs. Dinsmore\u2019s request for marijuana on January 18, 1971 he responded that he was not interested in selling marijuana to her. By his account he went out to purchase marijuana for his own use on the evening of the 18th and only sold to Mrs. Dins-more on the 19th because she \"begged\u201d him and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>he wanted to \"get her out of [his] hair\u201d. Defendant stated that he charged Pamela Dinsmore the same price which he had paid for the marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Defendant first contends that the trial court erred when it refused to allow the testimony of an excused juror, Lois Vertako, to be presented to the jury. Juror Lois Vertako was excused when she recollected that she had had previous contact with key prosecution witness Pamela Dinsmore. Defendant contended at trial that the testimony of ex-juror Vertako should have been permitted into evidence for purposes of impeaching Pamela Dins-more. In order to evaluate defendant\u2019s contention a separate record was made at trial. In this record witness Vertako testified that approximately a year earlier and for several years prior to that she had had occasional contact with witness Dinsmore on Saturday mornings at the Overpass Bar, a place where she had been employed. On one occasion certain members of the company witness Dinsmore kept created a disturbance and caused Lois Vertako difficulty. She further indicated that there was an unfavorable attitude toward witness Dinsmore by some of the patrons at the bar, although she acknowledged that Pamela Dinsmore stayed more or less with her own companions while at the bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">Defense counsel asked witness Dinsmore during cross-examination whether she had been a party to creating a disturbance at the Overpass Bar some five years earlier. Mrs. Dinsmore denied that she had been a party to the creation of a disturbance. While she denied participation on this occasion, witness Dinsmore acknowledged that she had been to the Overpass Bar \"once or twice\u201d. Defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>counsel subsequently sought to place ex-juror Vertako on the witness stand to impeach witness Dinsmore in two respects:</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">(1) to contradict the testimony of witness Dins-more that she had not been in the Overpass Bar on the occasion five years previously when the disturbance had been created; and</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">(2) to establish the witness\u2019s poor reputation in the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">The trial court refused to permit the ex-juror\u2019s testimony because the event which occurred some five years ago was not sufficiently relevant to witness Dinsmore\u2019s present credibility to gain admission. Inquiry with respect to reputation was refused when the court ascertained from witness Vertako that she merely overheard \"gossip and rumors\u201d at the bar where she worked and was only generally aware of an \"unfavorable\u201d attitude of some patrons of the bar toward witness Dins-more. We cannot say that the trial court, aware of the collateral nature of defendant\u2019s inquiry, abused its discretion in refusing to permit the testimony of this witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">Defendant\u2019s second contention is that the trial court erred in failing to grant a mistrial due to prejudicial answers given by key witness Pamela Dinsmore. Witness Dinsmore was an experienced witness who at certain times anticipated the reach of defense questioning, giving nonresponsive and no doubt unwanted answers. With respect to most such answers given by the witness, no objection was raised by defense counsel, although on one occasion with respect to an answer given, defense counsel did move for mistrial \"on that answer\u201d. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>this instance the trial judge denied the defense motion. The cross-examination of witness Dins-more covers some 65 pages of the trial court record. Review of this cross-examination confirms the trial court determination that the nature of the witness\u2019s testimony did not unduly prejudice defendant and warrant declaration of mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Defendant next claims that certain statements made in final argument by the prosecuting attorney constituted reversible error. The statements complained of were not specifically objected to by defense counsel. Moreover, certain of the complained-of statements were invited by defendant\u2019s closing argument. The trial court meticulously instructed the jury that it was the court\u2019s role to instruct on the law and further indicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-8\">\"Now, as I told you before, in making a decision you make it on the basis of the evidence in the case. Now, the evidence is the testimony as given by the witnesses. It is not the statements or arguments of the attorneys and that isn\u2019t evidence, but what the attorneys say and what they argue to you may be very helpful for your purposes in deciding what that evidence was, but their statements aren\u2019t evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-9\">We conclude that prosecutorial argument did not here give rise to a miscarriage of justice within the meaning of that phrase as defined in <em>People v Robinson, </em>386 Mich 551; 194 NW2d 709 (1972). MCLA 769.26; MSA 28.1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-10\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b747-11\">Four allegations of error raised by defendant concern certain instructions given by the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>court. It is defendant\u2019s contention that these instructions require reversal. One of the allegations made by defendant pertains to the trial court\u2019s reading of the language of the sale of marijuana statute, MCLA 335.152; MSA 18.1122. At trial the people alone objected to the reading of this statute on the ground that it incorrectly placed the issue of penalty before the jury. No objections were in other respects made by defendant. The other supposed instances of error for the most part strike us as picayune and certainly cannot be said to contaminate the instructions. It is apparent there was no miscarriage of justice. MCLA 769.26; MSA 28.1096.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Defendant argues that the evidence in this case indicates the existence of entrapment as a matter of law, citing <em>People v Turner, </em>390 Mich 7; 210 NW2d 336 (1973). The people counter that the test for entrapment set forth in <em>Turner </em>should be applied prospectively to police conduct arising after the date of the decision, thereby denying defendant the benefit, if any, from application of the \"objective\u201d test for entrapment set forth in <em>Turner.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">The test for determining whether a rule is to be applied retrospectively or prospectively is set forth in <em>People v Hampton, </em>384 Mich 669, 674; 187 NW2d 404 (1971), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-9\">\"The United States Supreme Court has discussed various factors to be used in determining whether a law should be applied retroactively or prospectively. There are three key factors which the Court has taken into account; (1) the purpose of the new rule; (2) the general reliance on the old rule; and (3) the effect on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>administration of justice. See, <em>e.g., Linkletter v Walker </em>(1965), 381 US 618 (85 S Ct 1731, 14 L Ed 2d 601); <em>Tehan v United States ex rel Shott </em>(1966), 382 US 406 (86 S Ct 459, 15 L Ed 2d 453).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">The purpose of the \"objective\u201d test for entrapment adopted in <em>Turner </em>is to focus upon and discourage as a matter of policy \"actions of the police [which are] reprehensible under the circumstances\u201d, <em>Turner, supra, </em>22. It is at once apparent that retrospective application of the rule of <em>Turner </em>would not serve to implement the purpose of the rule because the rule can only have a prospective effect upon police conduct. The justifiable reliance of law enforcement officials argues for prospective application. The ends of the administration of justice as well are best served by prospective application, for retrospective application would require in many cases new trials with the tremendous obstacle of reassembling now stale evidence. The salutary effects of the new rule in <em>Turner </em>are not of such nature as to require retrospective application. We conclude that the rule of <em>Turner </em>shall apply prospectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The existence of entrapment was submitted to the jury under instructions. The people\u2019s principle witness, Pamela Dinsmore, gave testimony, the thrust of which was to indicate that the criminal intent to sell marijuana originated in the mind of the defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While defendant and his witnesses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>contradicted this account, the question was jury-decided adversely to defendant. There was no entrapment as a matter of law, the question properly being for the jury under applicable <em>pre-Turner </em>law.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">Defendant also argues that his theory that he was a procuring agent was not given to the jury in the instructions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s own testimony, however, indicated that he obtained the marijuana for his own personal use. By his own admission he was not a mere conduit. Cognizant of such testimony and aware that defendant neither requested an instruction on the procuring agent theory nor objected to the omission of such an instruction, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">Defendant claims that the representation by counsel he enjoyed at trial was constitutionally inadequate. It is true that defense counsel had little time to prepare for trial. He conducted the defense, however, in a thorough and controlled manner, extensively cross-examining prosecution witnesses and effectively presenting and arguing defendant\u2019s case to the jury. No instance of serious error of counsel is noted by defendant. We find no violation of a constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">Defendant complains that the Court of Appeals erred in ordering defendant resentenced under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>\u00a7 41 of the Controlled Substances Act of 1971, MCLA 335.341; MSA 18.1070(41), pursuant to <em>People v Lorentzen, </em>387 Mich 167; 194 NW2d 827 (1972). Defendant\u2019s principal complaint is that the Court of Appeals by its action convicted defendant on a charge not made, thus violating due process. Defendant\u2019s contention is answered in \u00a7 61 of the Controlled Substances Act, MCLA 335.361; MSA 18.1070(61), where it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">\"(1) * * * If, before the effective date of this act, a person has committed an offense similar to an offense set out in chapter 4 but has not been sentenced as of that date, the sentencing judge shall not impose a sentence in excess of the penalty prescribed in chapter 4 [including MCLA 335.341; MSA 18.1070(41)] for the similar offense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Defendant was convicted of sale of marijuana, a violation of MCLA 335.152; MSA 18.1122, and pursuant to <em>People v Lorentzen </em>and legislative mandate (see above) was resentenced in accordance with MCLA 335.341; MSA 18.1070(41), the pertinent section \u00f3f the new act describing a \"similar\u201d offense. He was never convicted under that statute. It is within the legislative power to prescribe, as in this instance, penalties for statutory offenses. We find no violation of due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">Defendant complains that the trial court committed reversible error in failing to instruct the jury on the lesser included offense of possession of marijuana.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defense counsel did point out to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>trial court its failure to instruct. The trial court, however, refused to instruct on possession because defendant had already pled guilty to this offense prior to trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">In <em>Genesee Prosecutor v Genesee Circuit Judge, </em>391 Mich 115; 215 NW2d 145 (1974), the authority of the trial judge to accept defendant\u2019s plea over the objection of the prosecuting attorney was discussed. Defendant\u2019s (there, Hoskins) plea of guilty in that case to manslaughter was accepted by the trial judge over the objection of the prosecution. An information charging murder was involved. The facts in <em>Genesee Prosecutor </em>involved, among others, the situation where a plea of guilty to a lesser included offense is accepted by the court. The Court commented as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\">\"Implicit in this controversy is Hoskins\u2019 expectation that if his plea of guilty to manslaughter is accepted he would not stand trial for murder. Hoskins would, upon compliance with the guilty plea procedures, have the right, without the consent of the prosecutor, to plead guilty to the charge of manslaughter as long as it was clear that, nevertheless, he must stand trial for murder.\u201d <em>Genesee Prosecutor, supra, </em>119.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">Defendant\u2019s plea to possession of marijuana was taken in accord with our prescription in <em>Genesee Prosecutor. </em>The applicability of the lesser included offense of possession was foreclosed by virtue of the plea. Defense counsel argued to the jury defendant\u2019s contention that he had pled guilty to possession and was in fact guilty of only possession and not sale. The jury clearly rejected defendant\u2019s contention. Absent the plea, the trial court would have been obligated, upon proper request, or objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>tion, to instruct on lesser included offenses. Given the plea, no instruction on possession was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b753-7\">T. G. Kavanagh, C. J., and T. M. Kavanagh, Swainson, Williams, Levin, and M. S. Coleman, JJ., concurred with J. W. Fitzgerald, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b743-6\"> The Court of Appeals in its opinion only discusses one of the many issues raised by defendant and discussed in this opinion.

Under this test entrapment existed only if the trier of fact determined that criminal intent did not originate in the mind of defendant but was rather the product of active measures on the part of the authorities \"inspiring\u201d criminal conduct. The authorities could furnish the opportunity to commit crime. They could not, however, be the prime motivating force respecting participation in criminal activity without \"entrapping\u201d the defendant. Pamela Dinsmore\u2019s testimony was such as to negate the existence of entrapment under the then-existing test.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b750-11\"> The \u201cprocuring agent\u201d defense was first acknowledged by Michigan courts as a valid defense in <em>People v Turner, </em>38 Mich App 479; 196 NW2d 799 (1972), reversed on other grounds in <em>People v Turner, </em>390 Mich 7, <em>supra. </em>This Court has not passed on the validity of the \"procuring agent\u201d defense.
