If the employee is disciplined by his employer for striking, he is entitled, on request, to a determination whether he violated the provisions of the act. The request is to be made \"within 10 days <em>after </em>regular compensation of such employee has ceased or other discipline has been imposed\u201d. (Emphasis added.)

The Court of Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">We conclude that a teacher, including a teacher on continuing tenure, who strikes in violation of the PERA may be disciplined without a prior hearing, and we reverse the circuit court and the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">The Crestwood Education Association (the union) and the Board of Education of the School District of Crestwood (the school board) have been involved in a prolonged labor dispute. There has been no collective bargaining agreement since August, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">When the school year commenced on September 3, 1974, the teachers, members of the union, did not report for work. This action was brought against the union and the school board on September 30, 1974, by the plaintiffs as homeowners, taxpayers and parents. By subsequent stipulation, the plaintiffs were dismissed and the litigation has continued on the cross-complaint of the school board.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-10\">Injunctive orders were issued in October and classes resumed. In December the teachers again did not report for work and classes were suspended. Contempt proceedings followed. Thereafter the school board adopted a resolution requiring the teachers either to report for work or to submit a letter of resignation by December 27, 1974, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>failing which their employment would be terminated. Thirty-eight teachers reported for work, one submitted a letter of resignation and the remaining 184 were, by school board resolution of December 30, 1974, deemed to have terminated their employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">The school board hired substitute teachers and attempted to operate the schools.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The union had theretofore filed unfair labor practice charges with the Michigan Employment Relations Commission (MERC). The union then filed an amended charge complaining that the school board had not bargained in good faith and was attempting to destroy and interfere with the union. The teachers sought individual \u00a7 6 hearings on January 6, 1975. On January 10th the circuit court set aside the school board\u2019s resolution of December 30, 1974 and directed reinstatement of the teachers and the resumption of classes. The Court of Appeals aifirmed. The teachers returned to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">The PERA defines \"strike\u201d,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> prohibits strikes by public employees,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and interdicts any public employer from authorizing a strike.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>Section 6 of the PERA empowers the officer or body generally having disciplinary authority over an employee to terminate the employment of or impose other discipline on an employee who strikes in violation of the PERA. In providing that an employee\u2019s request for a hearing to determine whether he did violate the PERA be filed within ten days <em>after </em>regular compensation has ceased or other discipline has been imposed, the Legislature manifested an intention that the officer or body may impose discipline without a prior hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Section 6 begins with the words \"[notwithstanding the provisions of any other law\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">The Legislature, recognizing the diversity of legislation concerning public employees, provided in \u00a7 6 a specific, unitary procedure for the discipline of public employees who strike superseding the diverse procedures applicable to different public employees where the basis for discipline is a ground other than striking.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">Section 6 further provides that the proceeding for the determination whether the public employee violated the provisions of the PERA shall be \"appropriate\u201d to a proceeding for the removal of the employee (fn 3), and thus, in the case of a tenured teacher, consonant with the tenor of the procedures spelled out in the teachers\u2019 tenure act. But to the extent there is conflict \u2014 and manifestly there is conflict as the teachers\u2019 tenure act provides that discipline may be imposed only after charges, notice, hearing and determination, while the PERA contemplates imposition of discipline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>before a determination of whether the act has been violated and provides for a hearing only on request of the employee after the imposition of discipline \u2014 the PERA is to govern \"[Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">In enacting the PERA, the Legislature did not, apart from the \"[Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law\u201d clause of \u00a7 6, specifically provide that the PERA supersedes or replaces existing laws which arguably also govern public employee labor relations. The union contends that the quoted clause modifies only the first sentence of \u00a76.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">This Court has consistently construed the PERA as the dominant law regulating public employee labor relations. In <em>Detroit Police Officers Association v Detroit, </em>391 Mich 44; 214 NW2d 803 (1974), we held that residency and retirement benefits are mandatory subjects of collective bargaining under the PERA, although provisions of a city\u2019s ordinance and charter, promulgated under the home-rule act,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> would otherwise govern. Earlier, in <em>Regents of the University of Michigan v Employment Relations Commission, </em>389 Mich 96; 204 NW2d 218 (1973), this Court \"harmonized\u201d the constitutional authority of the Regents to supervise the university<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and the authority of the Legislature to provide for the resolution of public employee disputes,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> holding that interns and residents in the University of Michigan Hospital were entitled to engage in collective bargaining. In <em>Wayne County Civil Service Commission v Board of Supervisors, </em>384 Mich 363, 374; 184 NW2d 201 (1971), this Court held that the original authority and duty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>the Wayne County Civil Service Commission \"was diminished <em>pro tanto\u201d </em>by the PERA \"to the extent of free administration of the latter\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">The analysis is the same whether we label this reconciliation repeal by expression or by implication, <em>pro tanto </em>diminishing or harmonizing. The supremacy of the provisions of the PERA is predicated on the Constitution (Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 48) and the apparent legislative intent that the PERA be the governing law for public employee labor relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">The teachers\u2019 tenure act was not intended, either in contemplation or design, to cover labor disputes between school boards and their employees. The 1937 Legislature in enacting the teachers\u2019 tenure act could not have anticipated collective bargaining or meant to provide for the resolution of labor relations disputes in public employment. This Court\u2019s observation in <em>Wayne County Civil Service Commission, supra, </em>is pertinent: \"In [no] instance could collective bargaining by public employees have been in the minds of the people, or of the [1937] legislators. The thought of strikes by public employees was unheard of. The right of collective bargaining, applicable at the time to private employment, was then in comparative infancy and portended no suggestion that it eventually might enter the realm of <em>public </em>employment.\u201d (Emphasis by the Court.)</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">The State Tenure Commission has no authority to entertain an unfair labor practice charge against a school board. Its jurisdiction and administrative expertise is limited to questions traditionally arising under the teachers\u2019 tenure act.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">MERC alone has jurisdiction and administrative expertise to entertain and reconcile competing allegations of unfair labor practices and misconduct under the PERA.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>There is no provision in the teachers\u2019 tenure act analogous to \u00a7 16(h) of the PERA (see Part VI, <em>infra) </em>providing for temporary relief by a circuit court pending consideration of an unfair labor practice charge. The circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction under the teachers\u2019 tenure act does not arise until appeal from a decision of the State Tenure Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">All teachers do not have rights of continuing tenure. Yet both tenured and non-tenured teachers are in a single public employee bargaining unit and have the same rights and obligations under Michigan\u2019s labor relations statutes.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">A construction of the statutes providing uniform treatment of all public employee labor relations questions is more likely to e\u00edfect a sound and expeditious resolution of labor disputes. Requiring hearings under both the teachers\u2019 tenure act and the Michigan labor relations statutes, with review of the former by the circuit court and of the latter by the Court of Appeals, could result in competing claims and conflicting adjudications with untoward and costly delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Public employees may be disciplined under \u00a7 6 of the PERA only for engaging in <em>concerted </em>strike action,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> while most disciplinary actions subject to the jurisdiction of the State Tenure Commission concern individual teachers. It should therefore be a rare case where the line separating disputes subject to the jurisdiction of the State Tenure Commission from those subject to the jurisdiction of the MERC will be unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>The Crestwood teachers have asserted that they justifiably withheld their services because they had not been able to negotiate a new labor contract since August, 1973. No claim is or could be made that the discharges were occasioned by any cause other than the labor dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Excluding from the jurisdiction of the State Tenure Commission discharges for concerted strike action will not impede the goals sought to be achieved by enactment of the teachers\u2019 tenure act. These goals, as set forth in <em>Rehberg v Ecorse School Dist No 11, </em>330 Mich 541, 545; 48 NW2d 142 (1951), quoting cases from foreign jurisdictions, are to \"maintain an adequate and competent teaching staff, free from political and personal arbitrary interference\u201d; to promote \"good order and the welfare of the State and of the school system by preventing removal of capable and experienced teachers at the personal whims of changing office holders\u201d; and \"to protect and improve State education by retaining in their positions teachers who are qualified and capable and who have demonstrated their fitness, and to prevent the dismissal of such teachers without just cause\u201d.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">This construction of the two acts will not enable MERC to circumvent, at the request of school boards, the protection provided tenured teachers by the teachers\u2019 tenure act. If the school board claims that a teacher was discharged for striking, the appeal is to the circuit court, not to MERC. If the school board claims that the teacher was dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>charged for a reason other than striking, MERC\u2019s jurisdiction is invoked only if the teacher claims he was discharged for activity protected under the PERA and the teacher himself files an unfair labor practice charge with the MERC; such a charge would not preclude the teacher from also defending against the discharge at a teachers\u2019 tenure act hearing on the ground that it was not supported by reasonable and just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Whether a teacher\u2019s employment can be terminated, consistent with the Due Process Clause, without a hearing need not be decided. The PERA provides for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">The claim that the Due Process Clause requires a <em>prior </em>hearing in every case of deprivation of a property right has been rejected by the United States Supreme Court.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">When the government seeks to deprive a person of a property right \u2014 and we accept, <em>arguendo, </em>that a teacher\u2019s statutory rights under the teacher\u2019s tenure act constitute property \u2014 due process requires a \"hearing appropriate to the nature of the case.\u201d <em>Mullane v Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co, </em>339 US 306, 313; 70 S Ct 652; 94 L Ed 865 (1950). \"The formality and procedural requisites for the hearing can vary, depending upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>importance of the interests involved and the nature of the subsequent proceedings.\u201d <em>Boddie v Connecticut, </em>401 US 371, 378; 91 S Ct 780; 28 L Ed 2d 113 (1970). \"The types of 'liberty\u2019 and 'property\u2019 protected by the Due Process Clause vary widely, and what may be required under that clause in dealing with one set of interests which it protects may not be required in dealing with another set of interests.\u201d <em>Arnett v Kennedy, </em>416 US 134, 155; 94 S Ct 1633; 40 L Ed 2d 15, 34 (1974). \"The very nature of due process negates any concept of inflexible procedures universally applicable to every imaginable situation.\u201d <em>Cafeteria Workers v McElroy, </em>367 US 886, 895; 81 S Ct 1743; 6 L Ed 2d 1230 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">In its most recent expression on the subject, the Supreme Court in <em>Arnett v Kennedy, supra, </em>rejected a due process challenge to a statute allowing the discharge of a Federal employee without a pre-disciplinary evidentiary hearing. A variety of rationales were espoused, but the uniform thrust of each opinion, including the dissents, is that the constitutional necessity of a pre-disciplinary hearing must be determined by balancing the competing interests of the government and employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">\"We have repeatedly observed that due process requires that a hearing be held 'at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner,\u2019 <em>Armstrong v Manzo, </em>380 US 545, 552 [85 S Ct 1187; 14 L Ed 2d 62] (1965), but it remains for us to give content to that general principle in this case by balancing the Government\u2019s asserted interests against those of the discharged employee.\u201d <em>Arnett v Kennedy, supra, </em>416 US 134, 212 (Marshall, J., dissenting with Brennan and Douglas, JJ.).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">When public employees strike, the public employer must, like a private employer, be able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>hire substitute employees so that the public business is not interrupted. In order to hire competent replacements, it may be necessary for the public employer to offer permanent employment and thus displace strikers. Where essential services have been suspended, the hiring of replacements often cannot await time-consuming adjudicatory processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">The predominant interest secured by pre-disciplinary hearings, as advanced in <em>Arnett, supra, </em>is protection against removal of the wrong person and, assuming ultimate employee vindication, protection against interim financial deprivation.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The possibility of removal of a non-striker is minimized when, as here, the school board gives each striking teacher personal notice of the opportunity to return to the classroom before disciplinary action is taken. While on strike, a teacher receives no compensation; striking teachers do not suffer additional interim financial deprivation when disciplined.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The union contends, and we agree, that by striking, the teachers did not cease to be employees.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Their employment could only be terminated in accordance with the procedures set forth in \u00a7 6 of the PERA.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">The Michigan labor relations acts are modeled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>on the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In the private sector, the use of economic pressure by the parties to a labor dispute \"is part and parcel of the process of collective bargaining\u201d. <em>NLRB v Insurance Agents International Union, </em>361 US 477, 495; 80 S Ct 419; 4 L Ed 2d 454 (1960). Under the NLRA and the Michigan labor mediation act, the term \"employee\u201d includes an employee on strike. Both acts define \"employee\u201d as including:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">\"any individual whose work has ceased as a consequence of, or in connection with, any current labor dispute or because of [under the NLRA, \"any unfair labor practice\u2019Vunder the labor mediation act, \"any act which is illegal hereunder\u201d], and who has not obtained any other regular and substantially equivalent employment.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">In construing the Michigan labor mediation act and the PERA, this Court has frequently been guided by the construction placed on the analogous provisions of the NLRA by the NLRB and the Federal courts.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">The NLRB and the Federal courts have developed an intricate body of law concerning the reinstatement of strikers. There are many permutations, but certain general principles have emerged. The Federal cases recognize an employer\u2019s right to hire replacements for strikers.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \"Economic strik<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>ers\u201d have limited rights of reinstatement.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \"Unfair labor practice\u201d strikers have an absolute right to reinstatement \u2014 unless guilty of misconduct<footnotemark>22</footnotemark>\u2014 even if the employer has hired permanent replacements.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Although a strike begins as an economic strike, if it is determined that the employer engaged in an unfair labor practice, the strike may be held to be an unfair labor practice strike and the striking employees entitled to reinstatement.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Since an economic strike is protected concerted activity under the NLRA and the Michigan labor mediation act, it is an unfair labor practice for a private employer to discharge an employee for engaging in an economic strike before the employee has been replaced.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The Crestwood school board discharged the school teachers before hiring replacements. However, in contrast with the NLRA and the Michigan labor mediation act, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>PERA prohibits strikes in public employment; public employee strikes, therefore, are not protected \"lawful concerted [activity] for the purpose of collective negotiation or bargaining or other mutual aid and protection\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 9 of the PERA,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> modeled on \u00a7 8 of the Michigan labor mediation act<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and \u00a7 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">The Federal courts have held that a strike may be unlawful either because it has an unlawful purpose or unlawful means are used to accomplish a lawful purpose and strikers who engage in unlawful strike activity may be discharged.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-7\">The action of the Crestwood school board in discharging teachers for striking in violation of the provisions of the PERA prior to the hiring of replacements was not violative of that act. It does not necessarily follow, however, that these teachers may not be entitled to reinstatement should MERC determine that the school board engaged in an unfair labor practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-8\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b710-9\">The union filed an unfair labor practice charge with the MERC which has not been considered on its merits. Its amended charge, filed after the December 30, 1974 discharge of the teachers, asserts that \"[a]ny interruptions in the performance of teaching duties by teachers in such district have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>been directly provoked and instigated by the unfair labor practices of respondent employer\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">If MERC should determine that the employing school district committed an unfair labor practice, MERC <em>may, </em>despite the illegality of the teachers\u2019 strike, order reinstatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">The distinction between administrative agencies and equity courts in the application of the \"clean hands\u201d doctrine was early recognized by the NLRB and the Federal courts in implementing the Congressional mandate that upon the finding of an unfair labor practice the board \"take such affirmative action including reinstatement of employees with or without back pay, as will effectuate the policies of the [NLRA].\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> \"Equally untenable is the contention that the strikers are not entitled to reinstatement because they have not come into court with clean hands. This principle is not applicable to a proceeding in which a governmental agency is seeking enforcement of its order in the public interest.\u201d <em>Republic Steel Corp v NLRB, </em>107 F2d 472, 479 (CA 3, 1939) <em>modified on other grounds, </em>311 US 7; 61 S Ct 77; 85 L Ed 6 (1940).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">The language of the Michigan labor mediation act spelling out the remedial authority of the MERC upon finding an unfair labor practice is identical to the corresponding language of the NLRA.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">If the MERC finds that an unfair labor practice or other misconduct was committed by both sides, it should balance the competing equities to reach a result best effectuating the goals of the act.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b712-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>\"Where an employer who has committed unfair labor practices discharges employees for unprotected acts of misconduct, the Board must consider both the seriousness of the employer\u2019s unlawful acts and the seriousness of the employees\u2019 misconduct in determining whether reinstatement would effectuate the policies of the Act. Those policies inevitably come into conflict when both labor and management are at fault. To hold that employee 'misconduct\u2019 automatically precludes compulsory reinstatement ignores two considerations which we think important. First, the employer\u2019s antecedent unfair labor practices may have been so blatant that they provoked employees to resort to unprotected action. Second, reinstatement is the only sanction which prevents an employer from benefiting from his unfair labor practices through discharges which may weaken or destroy a union.\u201d <em>Local 833, UAW-AFL-CIO, etc v NLRB, </em>112 US App DC 107, 110-111; 300 F2d 699, 702-703 (1962). Upon remand <em>Kohler Co, </em>148 NLRB 1434 (1964); <em>aff'd </em>120 US App DC 259; 345 F2d 748 (1965); <em>cert den </em>382 US 836; 86 S Ct 82; 15 L Ed 2d 79 (1965).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">In this case, teachers sought review under \u00a7 6. Because of the pendency of this litigation, \u00a7 6 hearings have not been conducted. The hearings may now proceed or, if the parties agree, be deferred until determination by MERC of the unfair labor practice charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">A \u00a7 6 hearing is of limited inquiry. Its sole purpose is to determine whether the employer correctly identified the particular employee as a violator of the act\u2019s prohibition against striking. Since the hearing will ordinarily be conducted by the employer, as the officer or body having general disciplinary authority, a \u00a7 6 hearing is not an appropriate forum for the employee to assert in defense the employer\u2019s violation of the act. Allegations of or defenses premised upon employer misconduct are the exclusive province of the MERC to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>resolve upon the filing of an unfair labor practice charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\">Even if it should be determined in \u00a7 6 hearings that particular teachers have violated the provisions of the PERA by striking and those determinations are sustained on review, if MERC orders reinstatement of striking teachers because it determines that this affirmative action will best \"effectuate the policies of the act\u201d and that determination is sustained on review, the teachers shall be reinstated.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The status of the teachers presently in the class<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>rooms pending resolution by MERC of the unfair labor practice charges is of considerable importance to the school children, parents, and school board, as well as to the teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The teachers were reinstated pursuant to the Court of Appeals order of January 17, 1975. In granting leave we did not stay that aspect of that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Section 16(h) of the PERA<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> provides that MERC shall have the power, upon issuance of a complaint charging that any person has engaged in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice, to petition the circuit court for \"appropriate temporary relief or restraining order\u201d and that the circuit court shall have jurisdiction to grant \"to the board [MERC]\u201d such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">When the union filed with MERC the amended unfair labor practice charge against the school board on January 6, 1975, it requested the Commission to seek immediate relief in the circuit court pursuant to \u00a7 16(h). The director of the MERC responded the same day: \"It has been the consistent policy of this Commission to refrain from petitioning for temporary relief or a restraining order under the provisions of Section 16(h) of the act. Therefore, your request is denied and the charges filed in the matter will be processed in accordance with established statutory procedures.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">Whatever the reasons for this policy \u2014 financial or personnel limitations or other \u2014 the Commission may not properly adopt an arbitrary policy of refusing to consider exercising, without regard to the circumstances, power conferred upon it by the PERA.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>The Commission should consider and decide the union\u2019s request. If the Commission persists in its refusal to act on the request, it would appear that an order should enter directing it to do so.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>VII</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">The Court of Appeals ordered the school board and the union to submit this dispute to compulsory arbitration. The union defends this directive on the ground that, having sought equity, the school board may appropriately be required to do equity. It is asserted that a court of equity has the power to grant \"complete relief\u2019, to \"order done what ought to be done\u201d, and to enter such orders as may be in the \"public interest\u201d and as \"appeal to the conscience of the chancellor\u201d so as to provide a remedy consonant with its directive that the teachers \"work under conditions they had never agreed to and which remain patently obsolete in a period of mounting inflation. The court refused to impose continued 'involuntary servitude\u2019 without providing a rational means of resolving the impasse between two stubborn parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-7\">The Court of Appeals order was predicated on its court-rule-conferred power to \"[g]ive any judgment and make any order which ought to have been given or made, and make such other and further orders and grant such relief as the case may require\u201d,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> and its statutory power \"to issue any writs, directives and mandates that it judges necessary and expedient to effectuate its determination of cases brought before it\u201d.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b716-8\">The union relies on cases where special masters, receivers or monitors were appointed. But in every such case, the person so appointed was authorized to exercise a power which the judge, if not otherwise preoccupied, could himself exercise. A special master, receiver or monitor exercises the powers conferred upon him subject to the judge\u2019s power to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>substitute his own independent judgment at any time for the judgment of the special master, receiver or monitor unimpeded by the limitations generally pertaining when a court sits in judicial review of an arbitrator\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">If the compulsory arbitration ordered by the Court of Appeals contemplated the kind of supervision a judge exercises over a special master, receiver or monitor or the kind of plenary equitable power a chancellor possesses, then, in the final analysis, the court itself would be called upon to decide the contract terms, to write a contract for the parties. If it was contemplated that the court would sit in judicial review of the compulsory arbitrator\u2019s decision, then the special master-receiver-monitor analogy is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">While the PERA obliges a public employer to bargain collectively with the representatives of its employees, it is further provided that \"such obligation does not compel either party to agree to <em>\u00fa </em>proposal or require the making of a concession\u201d.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">The Constitution provides that it is the Legislature, not the judiciary, that has the power to \"enact laws providing for the resolution of disputes concerning public employees\u201d.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The Legislature has chosen to provide for the resolution of impasses in collective bargaining only in the case of municipal police and fire departments.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Apart from that enactment, there is no statute for the resolution of impasses in either public Or private collective bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">A court is without power to make a contract for parties or to confer on someone else the power to make a contract for them. By like token, it cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>compel the parties to confer on someone else the power to make a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">A court, in law or equity, may indeed enter all appropriate orders, but only those consistent with the proper discharge of its judicial responsibility. It has been said that there is not a judicial remedy for every wrong or shortcoming in society or in a statutory scheme. The Legislature has left the resolution of collective bargaining impasses in limbo and there the matter shall remain until it chooses to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Reversed.

In resolving the questions presented, the Crestwood school situation places this Court once again in its historic role of preserving traditional rights and fundamental values of the past while accommodating newer rights and requirements dictated by the necessities of the present and the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-8\">The ultimate and publicly understood issue in this case is \u2014 can the school board discharge allegedly unlawfully<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> striking teachers without prior notice and hearing?</p>\n<p id=\"b719-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>This ultimate issue, however, totally depends upon a threshold issue. The threshold and dispositive issue is narrow and technical \u2014 to what extent has the public employment relations act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> [hereafter \"PERA\u201d] repealed the teachers\u2019 tenure act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> [hereafter \"TTA\u201d] by implication, because TTA would clearly provide prior notice and hearing in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">The narrow, technical issue in turn depends upon whether the alleged repealing legislation, PERA, contains a discharge provision in conflict with the clear and detailed discharge provisions in TTA so that it can be said that the conflicting PERA provision repeals the TTA provisions by implication because PERA is subsequent legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">To begin with then, the <em>dispositive issue </em>in this case <em>is </em>\u2014 is <em>there a discharge provision in PERA that con\u00f1icts with and repeals the discharge provisions in TTA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\"><em>The fact of the matter is that there is not a single word in PERA affirmatively providing for a discharge procedure. </em>On the contrary, there is a PERA provision that refers outside of PERA to a separate discharge procedure clearly indicating that there is none in PERA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As a consequence, it is neither legally nor logically appropriate to say that there is a discharge provision in PERA that conflicts with, and hence repeals by implication, the discharge provisions of TTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>The school board and Justice Levin\u2019s opinion, however, attempt to <em>infer </em>a conflicting discharge provision in PERA, since they cannot refer to any provision which in so many words sets up a discharge provision, for the simple reason that, in fact, there isn\u2019t any. It is submitted that it is legally unacceptable to construe repeal of a well-established statutory provision by a mere inference in a subsequent statute, especially when the meaning of that inference is dubious at the best.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">As to the dispositive issue, bearing in mind this Court\u2019s duty to reasonably and harmoniously construe legislation bearing on the same subject matter, and bearing in mind as well our duty to protect basic rights once granted by legislation or otherwise, it is our opinion that there is no PERA discharge provision that conflicts with, and hence repeals by implication, the traditional rights of notice and hearing prior to discharge which are at the heart of TTA. As a consequence, we affirm the Circuit Court order of January 10, 1975, and the Court of Appeals result minus \"compulsory\u201d arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">I <em>\u2014Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">Our Brother Levin cogently recites the factual background in this case in Section I of his opinion. It is worth noting, in addition to that recitation, that the circuit court based its order of January 10, 1975, setting aside the board\u2019s discharge resolution of December 30, 1974, and reinstating the teachers, on the failure of the board to follow the procedural requirements of TTA, which a majority of that Court, Judges Bowles and Roumell,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>to be controlling in this situation. The Court of Appeals, while unanimous in its affirmation of the circuit court order and finding of procedural infirmity, based its decision not on TTA alone but rather on a blend of the requirements of TTA and PERA \u00a7 6,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the latter, the Court holding, being controlling in the two \"irreconcilable\u201d instances of conflict which it found.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">II <em>\u2014Pertinent Statutory Provisions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">The critical statutory provisions of TTA and PERA read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">\n<em>TTA</em>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-7\">\"The controlling board, if it decides to proceed upon * * * charges, [against a teacher] shall furnish the teacher with a written statement of the charges including a statement of the teacher\u2019s rights under this article, and shall, at the option of the teacher, provide for a hearing to take place not less than 30 nor more than 45 days after the filing of such charges.\u201d MCLA 38.102; MSA 15.2002.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-8\">\"Any hearing held for the dismissal or demotion of a teacher, as provided in this act, must be concluded by a decision in writing, within 15 days after the termination of the hearing.

As we said in <em>Rathbun v State of Michigan, </em>284 Mich 521, 544; 280 NW 35 (1938), quoting 59 CJ, p 1051:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b725-8\">\"it will not be presumed that the legislature, in the enactment of a subsequent statute, intended to repeal an earlier one, <em>unless it has done so in express terms </em>* * * .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b725-9\">Without question, PERA provides no specific repeal of TTA discharge procedure. Does PERA repeal TTA\u2019s discharge procedure by implication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>by setting up a discharge procedure in direct, unavoidable conflict? The answer is that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Nowhere in PERA is any discharge procedure set up. PERA does not specify that there must be notice and hearing before discharge. PERA does not specify that notice and hearing are not necessary before discharge. PERA \u00a7 6 does not provide in any way, shape, or fashion the mechanism or authority for a discharge or disciplinary proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">What PERA does set up is a procedure in its own words to be \"a determination as to whether he [the alleged striker] did violate the provisions of this act\u201d. The pertinent language is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-6\">\"[the alleged striker] shall be. entitled to a determination as to whether he did violate the provisions of this act. The request shall be filed in writing within 10 days after regular compensation of such employee has ceased or other discipline has been imposed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">This hearing obviously is not a discharge or discipline hearing because it is only requested <em>after </em>discharge or discipline. In establishing the rules of conduct for such a determination, there is specific reference to a body of rules outside of PERA, which, in this case, Justice Levin\u2019s opinion agrees is TTA. The text here referred to is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-8\">\"In the event of such request [for a determination whether or not there was a violation of the PERA anti-strike provision] the officer or body shall within 10 days commence a proceeding for the determination of whether the provisions of this act have been violated by the public employee, <em>in accordance with the law and regulations appropriate to a proceeding to remove the public employee. \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>In short, since PERA does not set up a discharge procedure itself and specifically refers outside of PERA for such a procedure, it cannot be said, following the rules of statutory construction set out in Part III of this opinion, that PERA by implication has repealed the discharge procedure in TTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\">As a matter of fact, not only is there no statutory repugnancy here, it is perfectly possible and reasonable to read these statutes together, <em>i.e., </em>a PERA hearing shall occur only after there has been discipline imposed following the procedural dictates of TTA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We recognize that some might feel that the TTA time limits and requirements, though not by any means unduly long, might better be shortened to meet the exigencies of strike situations. This approach was in fact taken by the Court of Appeals in this case. However, we do not write legislation; the time periods involved are properly matters for legislative consideration and action.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Accordingly, as outlined above, we hold that the Crestwood Board of Education erred in discharging the subject teachers summarily, without prior notice and hearing, and without reference to the applicable provisions of TTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">V <em>\u2014Contrary Contention</em></p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">The opinion of our learned Brother Levin, however, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-8\">\"Section 6 of the PERA empowers the officer or body generally having disciplinary authority over an employee to terminate the employment of or impose other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>discipline on an employee who strikes in violation of the PERA. In providing that an employee\u2019s request for a hearing to determine whether he did violate the PERA be filed within ten days <em>after </em>regular compensation has ceased or other discipline has been imposed, the Legislature manifested an intention that the officer or body may impose discipline without a prior hearing.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The conclusion reached in the first sentence is inferred in the second sentence from the following language in PERA \u00a7 6:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b728-6\">\"Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, any person holding such a position who, by concerted action with others * * * absents himself * * * shall be deemed to be on strike but the person,- upon request, shall be entitled to a determination as to whether he did violate the provisions of this act. The request shall be filed in writing, with the officer or body having power to remove or discipline such employee, within 10 days after regular compensation of such employee has ceased or other discipline has been imposed. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">Nowhere in this PERA language is there any description of a removal procedure. All there is is a description of a procedure for a determination as to violation of the PERA anti-strike provision <em>after </em>there has been a removal proceeding in no way described in PERA.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-8\">Consequently, the best that can be said for the conclusion in our Brother Levin\u2019s opinion that PERA provides a procedure for discharge is that it is based on an inference. It certainly is not set out in so many words in PERA.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-9\">So the first question is \u2014 can there be a repeal by implication where the conflicting provision proposed to substitute for a well-established and precise provision is no more than a possible inference? Let us recall the direct <em>Rathbun </em>reference to this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>\"[I]t will not be presumed that the legislature, in the enactment of a subsequent statute, intended to repeal an earlier one, <em>unless it has done so in express terms </em>* * * (Emphasis added.) 284 Mich 521, 544.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">But the second question is even more damaging \u2014can there be an inference from the above quoted PERA language that not only is there a removal procedure specified but that what is specified is discharge without prior notice and hearing? Surely this is too much \u2014 a true <em>non sequitur.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Certainly the fact that an alleged striker has the right to contest the alleged violation of PERA within ten days after he has been disciplined, discharged or his pay stopped says nothing as to how his discipline or discharge was accomplished, <em>i.e., </em>with or without prior notice or with or without prior hearing. This is the pertinent language of the act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-6\">\"[The alleged striker] shall be entitled to a determination as to whether he did violate the provisions of this act.

This is a concern, as Justice Levin\u2019s opinion points out, that this Court as a whole shares, and this specific opinion agrees with. However, in his opinion, Justice Levin has pushed this concern further than the Legislature has given any warrant, and at too great a cost in established human rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">It must be recognized that there is at least one significant difference between the NLRA/NLRB and PERA/MERC patterns, that is that the Congress in establishing the self-contained NLRA/ NLRB system specifically recognized and bottomed the system on the right to strike to balance employer power and labor power.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> As the United States Supreme Court noted in <em>Division 1287, Amalgamated Association of Street, Electric Railway &amp; Motor Coach Employees v Missouri, </em>374 US 74, 82; 83 S Ct 1657; 10 L Ed 2d 763 (1963), <em>reh den, </em>375 US 870; 84 S Ct 29; 11 L Ed 2d 100 (1963):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-8\">\"Collective bargaining, with the right to strike at its cor\u00e9, is the essence of the federal scheme.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>On the other hand, the Michigan Legislature in PERA \u00a7 6 went back to the Hutchinson Act which was specifically \"[a]n act to prohibit strikes by certain public employees\u201d.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> To compensate for the lack of strike power, the Legislature over the years had guaranteed to public employees specific rights and procedures, among them those outlined in TTA. These rights and procedures, to a greater or lesser extent, carried over with PERA.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-4\">Historically and legally, therefore, while PERA was a big step forward by the Legislature in responding to the constitutional mandate to establish a system of collective bargaining for public employees,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> it is common knowledge that PERA did not in and of itself establish a clear, unified system but rather staked out a new system coexisting with an old system, with a murky gray area of operation and applicability in between them.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The all too vivid judicial history in recent years of conflicting and ineffectual reactions to ever-worsening school labor relations has highlighted and increased public awareness and understanding of the legislative hiatus in the interlock between PERA and TTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Justice Levin has courageously applied his very considerable legal and forensic talents to terminate this legislative mish-mash. His opinion has produced a new order under the aegis of PERA/ MERC, but at the cost of eliminating the important and traditional rights of notice and hearing before discharge and at the further cost of blinking at the recognized rules of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>We concede that the result of our opinion is not as tidy as that of Justice Levin\u2019s opinion and leaves much for the Legislature to do.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We reach this result not out of any overwhelming reluctance to utilize the full potential of judicial power but through the recognition that the proper balance of administrative order and efficiency on the one hand, and personal rights on the other, necessary to meet the complex demands of teacher \u2014 school board relations at this time of extreme tension is not a matter that lends itself to the limited options of judicial construction of the material before us but requires the most comprehensive, as well as the wisest, employment of the Legislature\u2019s political and drafting skills. As a matter of fact, the Legislature is this very moment vigorously and exhaustively examining the subject, and the media have expressed the hope that a new solution carefully balancing all the equities is in the making. Under these circumstances and at this time, we feel the Legislature is best equipped to tackle the larger policy decisions and this Court can better serve the public by solving this case on the fundamentals of legislative construction, pointing out such anomalies in the PERA/TTA interlock as this case has brought to our attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">VI <em>\u2014Teachers Remained Employees Under Tenure Act While on Strike</em></p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The Crestwood School Board further contends <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>that the discharged teachers, by striking \"discontinued their services\u201d within the meaning of Art V, \u00a7 1 of the teachers\u2019 tenure act, MCLA 38.111; MSA 15.2011,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> thereby forfeiting the procedural safeguards of that act. This is an issue which this Court specifically reserved for decision in <em>Shiffer v Board of Education of Gibraltar School Dist, </em>393 Mich 190, 201-203; 224 NW2d 255 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">We agree with Justice Levin\u2019s analysis on this point, in Section IV of his opinion, concluding that \"by striking, the teachers did not cease to be employees\u201d. In addition, we note that in this case there was a contractual employment relationship between the board and the teachers during the fall of 1974, though the specific terms of that contractual relationship were court-ordered, and that the teachers had actually been working on the job.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>School Dist for the City of Holland v Holland Education Association, </em>380 Mich 314; 157 NW2d 206 (1968) (Opinions of O\u2019Hara, Souris and Kelly, JJ.). <em>Cf. </em>OAG 1969-1970, No 4704, p 150 (June 24, 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">VII <em>\u2014Probationary v Tenured Teachers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">The Crestwood School Board further contends that the circuit court and the Court of Appeals erred in their opinions in failing to distinguish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>between probationary and tenured teachers with respect to the applicability of the procedural provisions of TTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">Article II, \u00a7 4 of the TTA, MCLA 38.84; MSA 15.1984 reads in its entirety as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-6\">\"Articles 4, 5, and 6 shall not apply to any teacher deemed to be in a period of probation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Articles 4 and 6 contain the hearing, review, and other procedural protections and rights guaranteed by law to tenure teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">The fact that probationary teachers are not included in those specific sections does not mean, however, that probationary teachers have no procedural rights at all. As this Court has previously noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b734-9\">\"[T]he intent of the <em>entire </em>[teachers\u2019 tenure] act was to eliminate capricious and arbitrary employment policies of local school boards. <em>This includes the probationary as well as the tenure period of employment. \u201d </em>[Latter emphasis added.] <em>Munro v Elk Rapids </em>Schools; 383 Mich 661, 688, 691; 178 NW2d 450 (1970) (Dissenting opinion of T.

Such review does not involve the same level of employment termination protection afforded tenure teachers by statute.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Tenure teachers may only be discharged for \"reasonable and just cause\u201d. MCLA 38.101; MSA 15.2001. The discharge of a probationary teacher, however, in the absence of specific legislation or contractual provision on point, is permissible only where it is neither unreasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>nor arbitrary nor beyond the scope of the board\u2019s authority. <em>Caddell, supra, </em>636.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Similarly, we hold today, in the absence of specific legislation on point, that probationary teachers have a right to notice and a hearing prior to discharge. Again, probationary teachers are not thereby converted into tenure teachers by virtue of this right \u2014 the hearing, if requested promptly, would only be concerned with the issues of whether the employment termination was arbitrary and unreasonable, or whether it was action outside the scope of the board\u2019s authority, rather than the broader issues of \"reasonable and just cause\u201d for discharge in the case of tenure teachers who have been given broader statutory protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the Crestwood Board of Education erred, <em>inter alia, </em>in discharging <em>both </em>its probationary and tenured teachers without prior notice and hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">VIII <em>\u2014Circuit Court Injunction Properly Issued</em></p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">The board also contends that, in any case, the teachers were not entitled to equitable relief in the form of an injunction due to their lack of \"clean hands\u201d in violating a previous circuit court injunctive order of October 22, 1974. The teachers respond, <em>inter alia, </em>that appellant school board likewise violated injunctive orders in the course <em>of </em>these protracted proceedings and, accordingly, has no cause to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">The Court of Appeals agreed with the teachers, noting that \"[a]ll three judges in the trial court agreed that both parties were in 'open, flagrant defiance and in violation of [Judge Rashid\u2019s] orders\u2019 \u201d. 57 Mich App 636, 647.

As we have previously ruled in <em>Thompson v Enz, </em>385 Mich 103, 110; 188 NW2d 579 (1971):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">\"[A]s a general rule, equity will administer such relief as the nature, rights, facts, and exigencies of the case demand at the close of the trial or at the time of the making of the decree.\u201d Quoting from 27 Am Jur 2d, Equity, \u00a7 248, p 818.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">The circuit court acted within its discretion in issuing its injunction and order of January 10, 1975.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-8\">IX <em>\u2014Court of Appeals Compulsory Arbitration Order Improper</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-9\">We do not believe that the <em>sua sponte </em>order of the Court of Appeals requiring compulsory arbitration was a proper exercise of judicial discretion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-10\">X <em>\u2014Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-11\">We hold, as did the circuit court majority and the Court of Appeals, that appellee teachers were discharged in a procedurally improper manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-12\">Accordingly, we affirm the Circuit Court order of January 10, 1975.
