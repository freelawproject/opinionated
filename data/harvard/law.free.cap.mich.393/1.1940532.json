Kavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AF8\">Defendant appeals his conviction of uttering and publishing a forged check.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He makes five assertions of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">One assertion of error has to do with the constitutionality of the uttering and publishing statute, and that subject is controlled by our decision in <em>People v Hall, </em>391 Mich 175; 215 NW2d 166 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">We granted leave in order to determine whether it is error to admit a statement made by a defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>ant which had been ruled inadmissible in a prior <em>Walker </em>hearing* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> held in connection with a different charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The facts which are necessary to consider in this regard are the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Defendant was arrested near a certain market where he had negotiated a check. Upon his arrest, after being advised of his rights according to the testimony of one of the arresting officers, the defendant stated that his name was \"Joses Anderson\u201d the payee of the check which name the defendant had endorsed on the check in order to cash it in the store.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Defendant was taken to the sheriff\u2019s office in the Kalamazoo County Building where, according to the police, he was again advised of his rights, and made a second statement in which he admitted cashing the check and told the officers where he had put the proceeds of the check. Approximately a half hour later when they could not find the money in the place described in the defendant\u2019s statement, the police questioned the defendant for the third time in a \"holdover\u201d cell in the jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-9\">During this third interrogation the defendant appeared to be ill. He stated that he was a heroin addict and had methadone in his possession. He was taken to the hospital. Subsequently he was charged with unlawful possession of a narcotic.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-10\">In the prosecution on the narcotic charge, a <em>Walker </em>hearing was held, and the court determined that the last two statements were not voluntary and accordingly granted the motion to suppress them.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-11\">In the trial of the uttering and publishing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>charge the first two statements were admitted without objection on the part of defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">It is urged on appeal that to admit the second statement after it was determined to be not voluntary is error, for under the doctrine of collateral estoppel that issue can never be re-litigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">The prosecutor maintains that a <em>Walker </em>hearing does not result in final determination of fact to which the doctrine of collateral estoppel applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">We disagree with the prosecutor that a <em>Walker </em>hearing does not result in a final determination of fact. In <em>People v Robinson, </em>386 Mich 551; 194 NW2d 709 (1972) we held that the determination of involuntariness at a <em>Walker </em>hearing was a factual determination. As such we are satisfied that it should be binding on the people for all purposes under the doctrine of collateral estoppel. We see no good purpose to be served by re-litigating the question of voluntariness when that matter has been fully and fairly presented to competent authority for determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">But saying this does not mean that we agree with the defendant that error was committed in this case by the use of the defendant\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">If the defendant had objected to their introduction by moving to suppress them as involuntary, certainly the second statement which had been held involuntary in the <em>Walker </em>hearing should have been suppressed and another <em>Walker </em>hearing ordered on the first statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-11\">However, in the circumstances of this case it was not error to admit these statements in the absence of objection. There was no attempt at re-litigation of the issue of voluntariness, for the theory of defense on which the case was tried was that because of a heroin high the defendant lacked the requisite criminal intent. In this circumstance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>whether to let the statements in or keep them out was undoubtedly a matter of complete indifference to the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">The other issues raised on appeal were adequately treated by the Court of Appeals, and we find no error in their disposition of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b75-8\">T.
