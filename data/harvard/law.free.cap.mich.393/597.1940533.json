We hold that police records are not encompassed within the meaning of the given statute and that plaintiffs have not demonstrated their inability to pursue their legal remedies. There is no need to decide whether plaintiffs are \"persons having a legitimate interest\u201d in the court files.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">The decisions of the courts below are vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The pertinent facts of the case are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Plaintiff insurance companies are subrogees of policyholders who suffered property losses allegedly caused by juveniles. In each case, juveniles were apprehended by municipal police departments in Oakland County. While attempting to discover the names of the juveniles and their parents, plaintiffs were denied access to the police records. They then requested access to the juvenile court files of those children (unknown to them) who had committed certain described offenses, claiming to be \"persons having a legitimate interest\u201d in the children\u2019s records. The court denied plaintiffs access to its records. The circuit court affirmed that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">The Court of Appeals reversed<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but limited plaintiffs\u2019 access to the court files. Plaintiffs were to see only the identities of the children and their parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">There is no dispute concerning the statutory right of plaintiffs to sue the parents of children who indulged in vandalism which caused extensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>damage.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Plaintiffs contend that they will be unable to pursue their legal remedies under the \"parental responsibility\u201d act and that public policy as enunciated by the Legislature will be abused if they are not allowed access to the juvenile court records. However, the original police records are not in the juvenile court files and defendants correctly make no claim under MCLA 712A.28 that the juvenile court has control over access to those original records in the police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Police records do not come within the meaning of the statute cited. Plaintiffs have not demonstrated an inability to pursue their legal remedy. Therefore, we perceive no need to address the question of whether plaintiffs are \"persons having a legitimate interest\u201d in juvenile court records.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">The decisions of the probate court, circuit court and Court of Appeals are hereby vacated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b672-8\">T.
