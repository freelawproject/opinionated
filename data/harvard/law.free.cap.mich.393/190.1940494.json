He reasons from these premises that to \"introduce the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>common law breach of contract theory of mitigation of damages\u201d, a \"commercial doctrine\u201d, into the Teachers\u2019 Tenure Act would be \"alien to [and would] certainly do nothing for legislation dedicated to taking teachers out from under the thumb of arbitrary action by school boards\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">This case, like many which raise issues of statutory construction, can be decided either way. What is \"plain and unambiguous\u201d often depends on one\u2019s frame of reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">If one assumes that whenever a teacher prevails on appeal to the Tenure Commission and the courts the school board\u2019s action in suspending or discharging him was \"arbitrary\u201d, then it may appear \"plain\u201d that the Legislature intended to impose a financial penalty on the school board for failing to justify its disciplinary action.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">If, on the other hand, one, while recognizing that some school boards sometimes act arbitrarily, does not regard a teacher\u2019s success before the Tenure Commission and the courts as determinative of whether the school board acted in good faith in disciplining or discharging him, then what the Legislature intended \u2014 if it had any intention in this regard at all \u2014 may not appear so \"plain and unambiguous\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">It has been said that \"[i]n many instances, expressions of the plain meaning rule may be a kind of verbal table thumping to express or reinforce confidence in an interpretation arrived at on other grounds instead of a reason for it\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Similarly, Professor Corbin wrote that statements about \"plain and clear\u201d meaning of a writing \"assume a uniformity and certainty in the meaning of language that do not in fact exist\u201d.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>In the context of an effort to determine the amount of a back-pay award, the words \"all salary lost as a result of such suspension\u201d are not free of ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">We agree with our colleagues that it is possible to regard the words as meaning all salary wrongfully denied the teacher by the school board during the period of his suspension. The plausibility of this one reading does not, however, negate all other possible constructions and free the words of any or all ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Equally maintainable is a construction which regards \"all salary lost\u201d as a \"net loss\u201d concept. Under this view, wages a teacher actually earns or could have earned during his period of suspension are deducted from the suspended teacher\u2019s \"salary\u201d in arriving at the net or actual amount of \"salary lost\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">Courts in other jurisdictions which have enacted similar legislation have considered whether the mitigation doctrine is applicable in determining the amount of a back-pay award to a wrongfully discharged teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">The language of these statutes is similar to Michigan\u2019s. A New Hampshire statute provides for back pay \"to the extent of the full salary for the period for which such teacher was engaged\u201d. A California provision requires that a wrongfully discharged teacher be paid his \"full salary for the period of his suspension\u201d. Similarly, the Pennsylvania Teachers\u2019 Tenure Act provides that in the event of reinstatement and a back-pay award \"there shall be no abatement of salary or compensation\u201d. (See Part IV for statutory references.) If one is inclined to view the similar Michigan language (\"all salary lost as a result of such suspension\u201d) as \"plain and unambiguous in its terms\u201d, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>then one would expect a uniform rejection of the mitigation doctrine by the courts of these states.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">However, none of these courts have construed their statutes in the manner which our colleagues regard as the only possible construction. Each has construed its statute as meaning the teacher\u2019s \"net loss\u201d and applied general mitigation principles in determining back-pay awards. (See Part IV for citations of decisions.)</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Our reference to opinions of other state courts construing similar statutory language is not, as our colleagues suggest, to imply that these opinions \"accurately reflect the intention of the Michigan Legislature\u201d. These cases are cited to illustrate the fallacy of attaching the label \"plain meaning\u201d to the words \"all salary lost\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">It is frequently instructive to examine the reasoning and attempt to understand the practice in other jurisdictions. \"Countless avenues and forms of communication and interaction among the jurisdictions lead to so much parallelism among the laws of different states as the result of emulation, adaptation, and outright copying that common patterns and standard modes of dealing with common problems become evident. Where that is the case, the phraseology and language of similar legislation in other jurisdictions is deserving of special consideration not only in the interests of uniformity, but also for the purpose of determining the general policy and objectives of a particular course of legislation.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">On its face and in its operation, Michigan\u2019s Teachers\u2019 Tenure Act closely resembles other remedial legislation such as the National Labor Relations Act, the Michigan Employment Rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>tions Act and civil rights statutes designed to protect workers from certain discriminatory practices in hiring, promotions, and firing. The usual statutory remedy for wrongful suspension or discharge is reinstatement with back pay and, in determining the amount of the back-pay award, general principles of mitigation are <em>uniformly </em>applied.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">The mitigation doctrine has been applied by the United States Supreme Court in construing the words \"back pay\u201d,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by other Federal courts in administering like remedial legislation, and by state courts construing teacher tenure legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The principle of mitigation is a thread permeating the entire jurisprudence. It is not solely a \"breach of contract\u201d or \"commercial\u201d doctrine; it is part of the much broader principle of \"avoidable consequences\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Professor McCormick\u2019s statement of the general principle of avoidable consequences is unqualified in its application: \"Where one person has committed a <em>tort, </em>breach of contract, or other <em>legal wrong </em>against another, it is incumbent upon the latter to use such means as are reasonable under the circumstances to avoid or minimize the damages. The person wronged cannot recover for any item of damage which could thus have been avoided.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>The rights protected by the mitigation doctrine are not just those of contracting parties, commercial litigants, tort victims or tortfeasors but, rather, the rights of all society: \"Legal rules and doctrines are designed not only to prevent and repair individual loss and injustice, but to protect and conserve the economic welfare and prosperity of the whole community.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">Mitigation of damages is, thus, the \"machinery by which the law seeks to encourage the avoidance of loss\u201d.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">Our colleagues\u2019 exclusion of the mitigation doctrine from the administration of the Teachers\u2019 Tenure Act represents an unprecedented anomaly.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">The doctrine of avoidable consequences/mitigation of damages takes into account the unique problem facing teachers in obtaining substitute employment. The common law does not \"burden\u201d them \"with the task of scrounging around for other employment while challenging an unjust suspension\u201d. The common law recognizes that besides the difficulty of obtaining midyear employment, for many teachers their former employer is the only employer in town. The common law recognizes these problems and imposes no duty on teachers to accept employment outside of the teaching profession, or to accept a teaching position in another community, or at a lower status. See <em>Edgecomb v Traverse City School Dist, </em>341 Mich 106; 67 NW2d 87 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b270-9\">Practically speaking, the minimal duty imposed by the common law on teachers to seek substitute employment combined with today\u2019s depressed market for teachers -means that few, if any, discharged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>teachers will be required to take undesired employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\">In most instances economic necessity will force a discharged teacher to seek alternative employment. The backlog of cases pending before the Tenure Commission and the unfortunately slow appellate process means that it will often be years before teachers who ultimately prevail are reinstated. Shiffer, for example, was reinstated four years after his suspension. The teacher in <em>Rumph v Wayne Community School Dist, </em>31 Mich App 555; 188 NW2d 71 (1971) (held in abeyance pending decision in this case) was suspended eight years ago.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Applying the mitigation doctrine in teacher tenure controversies will not require teachers to scrounge around; rather, it will conform the economic damages awarded to the economic damages suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">The amounts involved are not inconsiderable. In Shiffer\u2019s case, the amount potentially involved is four years\u2019 salary; in Rumph\u2019s, eight years\u2019.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">Having in mind the pattern of like remedial legislation and the uniform construction placed on such legislation by other courts, we cannot ascribe to the Legislature a purpose of awarding such large amounts without regard to actual economic loss to teachers who, while they ultimately prevail, may not be wholly blameless in the controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">The wrongfully discharged teacher should be reinstated and he should be compensated for the excess of the amount of his salary over whatever he actually earned or could have earned; th\u00e1t is sufficient triumph and sufficient vindication of a teacher\u2019s tenure rights. It is not necessary to go further and award large sums unrelated to actual loss to teachers who become involved in prolonged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>controversy with school districts; doing so will not, in our opinion, advance \"the future of our children, the efficacy and dignity of the teaching profession and the welfare of our state\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Shiffer and other teachers engaged in a strike against the School District when efforts to negotiate a contract failed in the fall of 1968. On December 26, the striking teachers, including Shiffer, returned to work but without a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">The strikers had previously received from the School District a letter dated November 27, stating, \"you have terminated your employment by discontinuing your services with the school district and have also forfeited your rights to continuing tenure\u201d. This letter was predicated on Art V, \u00a7 1 of the teachers\u2019 tenure act:<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-9\">\"No teacher on continuing tenure shall discontinue his services with any controlling board except by mutual consent, without giving a written notice to said controlling board at least 60 days before September first of the ensuing school year. Any teacher discontinuing his services in any other manner than as provided in this section shall forfeit his rights to continuing tenure previously acquired under this act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">No reference was made to the November 27 letter when the strikers returned to work in December.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">Subsequently, on March 12, 1969, Shiffer was suspended for alleged acts of misconduct and insubordination and, on April 7, discharged. On March 21 and April 11, Shiffer\u2019s attorney requested in writing a public hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>The school district\u2019s attorney claimed that he telephoned Shiffer\u2019s attorney on April 13 to set a hearing date. A school board resolution of May 12 extended to Shiffer a hearing, upon request, \"public or private at his discretion\u201d. Shiffer\u2019s attorney responded with a letter of May 21 referring to his April 11 letter and requesting notification of the date of the public hearing. The school district\u2019s attorney claimed that in June he again telephoned Shiffer\u2019s attorney to set a date.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">No hearing was held. In November, Shiffer filed an appeal with the Tenure Commission asserting that the board had failed to pay him during the period of suspension or to provide him with written charges and a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The board defended that Shiffer was not entitled to the statutory protections of a tenured teacher because, by striking, he had \"discontinued his services\u201d. It also challenged the jurisdiction of the Tenure Commission because Shiffer had failed to appeal the board\u2019s decision within 30 days.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">We consider first the school district\u2019s contention that a public school teacher who strikes thereby \"discontinues\u201d his services under Art V, \u00a7 1 and may be disciplined or discharged without regard to the procedural safeguards of the teachers\u2019 tenure act.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">Prior to Shiffer\u2019s disciplinary discharge in March-April, 1969, Shiffer and the other striking teachers had appealed to the Tenure Commission from the School District\u2019s notice of November 27, 1968 which asserted that by striking the teachers had forfeited their rights to continuing tenure. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>The Tenure Commission ruled for the teachers, holding that the Legislature had indicated, by legislation adopted subsequent to the teachers\u2019 tenure act, a \"legislative intent to not deny previous acquired tenure rights to striking employees\u201d. It \"ordered that the decision of the Gibraltar School District to take back the striking teachers in any other status than they held, be reversed: and that the tenure status of the teachers once reemployed would be comparable to their status had there been continued employment with the school district in the absence of a strike\u201d. <em>Chester Skubik, et al v Gibraltar School Dist, </em>State Tenure Commission, Docket No. 68-22, February 12, 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The circuit court affirmed the Commission\u2019s decision. No further appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The school district\u2019s argument that a teacher who strikes thereby discontinues his services under Art V, \u00a7 1 and is not entitled to the protection of the teachers\u2019 tenure act can be addressed in a number of different ways:</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">(a) Factually, the school district rehired Shiffer and the other striking teachers thereby, arguably, waiving any right it may have had to treat the strike as a discontinuance of service;</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">(b) The decision in <em>Skubik </em>is res judicata;</p>\n<p id=\"b274-10\">(c) Art V, \u00a7 1 does not apply to discontinuance of service as a result of a strike, at least where there is no contract;<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>(d) Even if Art V, \u00a7 1 applies to discontinuance of service as a result of a strike, there is no automatic forfeiture of tenure or of rights under the act, and none results unless a formal written charge is filed against the teacher which, in the event of appeal, is sustained by the Tenure Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">Because the Attorney General is not before us representing the Tenure Commission in an appeal from a decision of that commission, we defer to another time deciding whether Art V, \u00a7 1 applies to discontinuance of service as a result of a strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">We hold that the decision in <em>Skubik </em>is res judicata and that the school district is precluded in this case from relitigating the question whether Shiffer lost his tenure rights by striking.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">The school district also challenges the jurisdiction of the Tenure Commission because Shiffer failed to appeal the school board\u2019s decision within 30 days.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">The Tenure Commission found that the school board had offered to hold a hearing and that Shiffer had demanded one. The Tenure Commission concluded that it has jurisdiction \"if it makes a finding that any delay in the appeal resulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>from the conduct of the Gibraltar school board rather than the want of due diligence by [Shiffer]\u201d. It found that the conduct of the school district, indicating an intention to provide Shiffer a hearing, but then failing to follow through on it, \"made it impossible\u201d for Shiffer to \"determine precisely when\u201d the school district made the \"final decision to discharge him permanently without a hearing\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">The burden of providing a hearing rests on the School District. Shiffer demanded a hearing. Only the School District could provide one.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The Tenure Commission, on the facts of this case, did not exceed its statutory jurisdiction by accepting Shiffer\u2019s appeal even though he was suspended almost eight months before he filed his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">The Tenure Commission\u2019s decision ordered Shiffer \"reinstated and paid all lost wages\u201d. The circuit court, in affirming the Tenure Commission\u2019s order reinstating Shiffer, held that under the tenure act \"there is no duty to mitigate damages\u201d. The Court of Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">The School District did not reinstate Shiffer until March 12, 1973, subsequent to the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">Shiffer did not testify before the Tenure Commission. He did, however, in responding to a question addressed to his attorney, state that he had been employed during the period of suspension. Shiffer\u2019s attorney elaborated: \"[Shiffer] has been employed. Not as a teacher. He has been employed in private industry.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Article IV, \u00a7 3 of the teachers\u2019 tenure act (MCLA 38.103; MSA 15.2003) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">\"On the filing of charges in accordance with this section, the controlling board may suspend the accused teacher from active performance of duty until a decision is rendered by the controlling board, but the teacher\u2019s salary shall continue during such suspension: <em>Provided, </em>That if the decision of the controlling board is appealed and the tenure commission reverses the decision of the controlling board, the teacher shall be entitled to all salary lost as a result of such suspension.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The School District contends that the common-law rule of mitigation of damages, applicable in instances of contract breach <em>(Edgecomb v Traverse City School Dist, </em>341 Mich 106; 67 NW2d 87 [1954]), should be applied in determining the amount of \"salary lost\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Shiffer responds that an action before the Tenure Commission is not governed by the common-law rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">The words \"all salary lost\u201d are ambiguous. Isolating the word \"salary\u201d, it is arguable that the Legislature did not intend that mitigation, actual or possible, be considered in awarding back pay. However, if the modifying word \"lost\u201d is also considered, the alternative view that it was intended that mitigation evidence be considered appears \u2014 on the face of the statute \u2014 to be equally maintainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">The school district cites cases in which other state courts, construing similar statutory language, have applied the principle of mitigation of damages and reduced back-pay awards accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">A New Hampshire statute provided that the school district was liable to a wrongfully dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>charged teacher \"to the extent of the full salary for the period for which such teacher was engaged\u201d. The New Hampshire Supreme Court held that \"the words 'to the extent of were intended to fix the 'full salary\u2019 as the outside limit of recovery, rather than to require that it measure the damages without regard to aggravation or mitigation thereof.\u201d <em>Spencer v Laconia School Dist, </em>107 NH 125, 129; 218 A2d 437, 440 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The California Supreme Court has similarly ruled that earnings from other employment may properly be deducted in determining a back-pay award under a statute requiring that a wrongfully discharged teacher be paid his \" <em>full salary </em>for the period of his suspension.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mass v The Board of Education of the San Francisco United School Dist, </em>61 Cal 2d 612, 623; 39 Cal Rptr 739, 746; 394 P2d 579, 586 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Although the Pennsylvania Teachers\u2019 Tenure Act provided that \"there shall be no abatement of salary or compensation\u201d, a Pennsylvania appellate court held that earnings from other employment should be deducted from a back-pay award:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-8\">\" 'Damages are the loss suffered by one person by reason of the breach of contract on the part of another and if the school teacher receives the same compensation for his work during the period of improper dismissal as he would have received if he had continued in the position from which he was improperly dismissed, he has suffered no damages except such as may arise from matters involving other elements than loss of salary.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coble v Metal Twp School Dist, </em>178 Pa Super 301, 305; 116 A2d 113, 115-116 (1955).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b278-10\">Shiffer contends that these statutory constructions are not pertinent because the Michigan act, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>in contrast with the statutes of these other states, was intended to be \"an abrogation of the common law\u201d. He argues that the Legislature, by establishing an administrative tribunal, intended to free teacher tenure controversies from the delays associated with civil litigation and that allowing the Tenure Commission to consider mitigation evidence would frustrate the statutory purpose of expeditious administrative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The principle of mitigation is applied in back-pay awards by the administrative tribunals charged with the administration of the National Labor Relations Act<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and the Michigan labor mediation act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> By reason of the procedures these agencies have adopted for determining back-pay awards, consideration of mitigation evidence has not been a cause of delay. These agencies defer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>determination of the amount of a back-pay award until conclusion (including appeal) of the liability phase of the controversy. Their experience is that once the liability phase is completed, the amount of back pay is resolved readily by the parties \u2014 only rarely is it necessary for the tribunal itself to take testimony and adjudicate the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">We see no reason to treat the improper discharge of a teacher differently than improper discharge or discriminatory failure to hire<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> is treated in determining back-pay awards under other protective legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">The objective of an expeditious administrative resolution of tenure controversies can be accomplished by having the Tenure Commission similarly defer determination of back pay until after completion of the liability phase. There is no need to jettison the sound principles of mitigation of loss generally applied by courts and administrative tribunals throughout the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">Deferring determination of the amount of a back-pay award will facilitate resolution of the liability phase by freeing the commission from consideration of interlocutory evidence on the back-pay issue. An effort by the Tenure Commission to determine back-pay before a definitive ruling on liability will often be premature.

I fully concur in the reasoning and holdings in Parts II and III of his opinion. I respectfully disagree with his conclusion that the Legislature intended to introduce the common-law breach of contract theory of mitigation of damages into the teachers\u2019 tenure act, MCLA 38.71 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 15.1971 <em>et seq., </em>the teachers\u2019 Magna Charta.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Mitigation of damages is a useful and honorable mechanism in its place. However, it is alien to, is not specifically mentioned in, and certainly does nothing for legislation dedicated to taking teachers out from under the thumb of arbitrary action by school boards.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">There are two reasons for my conclusion. First, when the Legislature said in Art IV, \u00a7 3 of the teachers\u2019 tenure act, MCLA 38.103; MSA 15.2003 \"the teacher shall be entitled to <em>all salary lost as a </em>result of such [erroneous school board] suspension\u201d, it meant what it said, \"all salary lost as a result of such suspension\u201d not \"all salary lost less other income earned\u201d. Second, the Legislature\u2019s whole purpose in the teachers\u2019 tenure act was to preserve the integrity of the teacher\u2019s tenure, or <em>right to continue in his job. </em>The mitigation of damages principle does not strengthen that right but acts in derogation of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">I. Plain Language</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">When the Legislature said in Art IV, \u00a7 3 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>teachers\u2019 tenure act \"the teacher shall be entitled to all salary lost as a result of such [erroneous school board] suspension\u201d, it meant what it said, \"all salary lost as a result of such suspension\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Except for the doubt cast by my Brother Levin\u2019s opinion, I would hold without question that the language of the Legislature in this section was both \"plain and unambiguous in its terms, * * * [and we] have nothing to do but to obey it\u201d. <em>Nordman v Calhoun, </em>332 Mich 460, 465; 51 NW2d 906 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The plain language of the clause \"the teacher shall be entitled <em>to all salary lost as a result of such suspension\u201d </em>is reinforced by an analysis of the meaning of the word \"lost\u201d in the phrase \"salary lost\u201d. My Brother Levin finds that the word \"lost\u201d introduces ambiguity into the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">Without the word \"lost\u201d the phrase \"the teacher shall be entitled to all salary * * * as a result of such suspension\u201d is rendered meaningless. Obviously \"salary [does not] result [from] such suspension\u201d. Salary results from employment not suspension from employment. Reinsertion of the word \"lost\u201d restores sense to the phrase and makes the whole clause meaningful.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">The Court of Appeals accurately stated the only possible interpretation of the passage in question when it held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">\" 'shall be entitled to all salary * * * \u2019 can only refer to the salary that would be due to the teacher had the board seen fit to allow him to continue teaching. The statute does not say all damages or all salary minus, such other income as was or could reasonably be earned by other employment.\u201d <em>Shiffer v Board of Education of Gibraltar School Dist, </em>45 Mich App 190, 193-194; 206 NW2d 250 (1973).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>II. Legislative Purpose</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">The Legislature\u2019s whole purpose in the teachers\u2019 tenure act was to preserve the integrity of the teacher\u2019s tenure, or <em>right to continue in his job </em>and thus protect the vital instruction of teaching from arbitrary and political interference and from dismissals without just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The first clause in the title of the teachers\u2019 tenure act describes the Legislature\u2019s purpose. It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">\"An Act relative to continuing tenure of office of certified teachers in public educational institutions * # sjc &gt;&gt;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">There is much history behind the teachers\u2019 tenure act. Before that act some school boards for favoritism, politics or other invalid reasons hired and fired teachers in an arbitrary and capricious manner without real regard either to the education of the pupils involved or to the teachers concerned. This was equally injurious to the future of our children, the efficacy and dignity of the teaching profession and the welfare of our state. Only by establishing the right of the teacher during competence and good behavior to continue in his job once he had proven himself worthy and well qualified could parents and the state be assured their children would receive the education necessary to achieve fulfillment and to fit them to play their full roles in our society. The teachers\u2019 tenure act assures that job right.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See <em>Rehberg v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number><em>Board of Education of Melvindale, Ecorse Twp School Dist No. 11, Wayne County, </em>330 Mich 541, 545; 48 NW2d 142 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The entitlement \"to all salary lost as a result of such suspension\u201d on successfully winning an appeal is a strong weapon to enforce the teacher\u2019s right to continue in his job. A school board that might be tempted to act arbitrarily and contemptuously in derogation of this right could well be persuaded to act otherwise knowing that the machinery of the teachers\u2019 tenure act would not only eventually restore the teacher to his rights but that the school board would have to pay that teacher \"all salary lost\u201d as a result of such arbitrary and contemptuous action. The Legislature clearly intended to make the teachers\u2019 tenure act work, and this intended provision would effectively help it to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">On the other hand, the gratuitous judicial introduction of the common-law commercial doctrine of mitigation of damages would substitute a weak reed for a stout and just enforcement weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The mandate of the teachers\u2019 tenure act and the common-law principle of mitigation of damages are repugnant to one another and cannot stand together. It would be incongruent to conclude that a statute designed to protect teachers from harassment and to preserve their integrity would at the same time require teachers to burden themselves with the task of scrounging around for other employment while challenging an unjust suspension. Yet this is the very conclusion reached by my Brother Levin\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">The pl\u00e1in meaning of the language used in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>teachers\u2019 tenure act and the legislative intent behind the passage of the act should govern; mitigation of damages should not be considered where it is neither specifically required nor intended by the Legislature. The Court of Appeals decision denying the applicability of the common-law principle of mitigation in this case should be affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b286-4\">T. M. Kavanagh, C. J., and Swainson, J., concurred with Williams, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b282-9\"> Had the plaintiff initiated his action in a court of law based upon strict breach of contract theory, mitigation of damages would not only be appropriate, it would be required. <em>Edgecomb v Traverse City School Dist, </em>341 Mich 106; 67 NW2d 87 (1954). However, plaintiffs suit is not based upon a breach of contract theory, but is based upon a violation of rights created by the teacher tenure act, MCLA 38.71 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 15.1971 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b284-9\"><em> </em>My Brother Levin makes learned reference to labor relations and labor mediation cases. Suffice it to say that in those cases there is no question of the same kind of tenure as the teachers\u2019 tenure act guarantees teachers. Without considering whether language in the other state teachers\u2019 tenure acts are dispositively similar, it is not considered that the results reached in the referenced case in other jurisdictions accurately reflect the intentions of the Michigan Legislature.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
