The Court of Appeals affirmed in an unreported memorandum opinion, but did not discuss the issues now presented which were subsequently raised by a post-conviction petition for a writ of habeas corpus which we treated as a motion for reconsideration of a previous denial of leave and granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">Following his arrest, Milton was bound over by a district court to circuit court for trial. He asserts that 1968 PA 154, creating the district court and providing whatever jurisdiction it may have to bind over felons, violates Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 24, the title-body clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-11\">\"No law shall embrace more than one object which shall be expressed in its title\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">and that this unconstitutionality and resulting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>lack of jurisdiction renders void the criminal prosecution against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">We hold that the district court act does not violate the title-body clause and affirm Milton\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">The Revised Judicature Act, 1961 PA 236,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> superseded the Judicature Act enacted in 1915. The RJA, as did the 1915 Judicature Act, contains provisions concerning the organization and powers of the Supreme Court and, in a separate chapter, of the circuit court. A chapter concerning the organization and powers of the Court of Appeals was added in 1964. The RJA also contains chapters concerning proceedings and procedures in the courts and at least one chapter concerning an extra-judicial procedure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">In 1968 the Legislature added Chapters 81-86 and other sections to the RJA thereby establishing the district court and providing for its jurisdiction and powers. In addition to civil jurisdiction in cases where the amount in controversy does not exceed $3,000,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the act confers criminal jurisdiction to try certain misdemeanors and to hold preliminary examinations in felony cases.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Milton contends that the title of the RJA and its statutory scheme evidence an intent that its provisions pertain only to civil matters. He asserts that statutory provisions defining criminal jurisdiction belong in the Code of Criminal Procedure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He asks us to hold that the 1968 act creating the district court is defective insofar as it purports to vest criminal jurisdiction in that court because criminal jurisdiction is not germane to the RJA and statutory provisions defining criminal jurisdiction should be set forth in the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Read literally, the subject matter of the 1968 addition (district court act) to the RJA, placed alongside the title of that act, does not violate the title-body clause. While the entitlement of the RJA does refer to the \"forms and attributes of <em>civil </em>claims and actions; the time within which <em>civil </em>actions and proceedings may be brought in said courts; pleading, evidence, practice and procedures in <em>civil </em>actions and proceedings in said courts\u201d (emphasis supplied), these clauses follow the opening language of the title: \"AN ACT to revise and consolidate the statutes relating to the organization and jurisdiction of the courts of this state; the powers and duties of such courts, and of the judges and other officers thereof\u2019. The words \"organization and jurisdiction\u201d and the words \"powers and duties\u201d are not qualified by the word \"civil\u201d. The literal meaning of those words manifestly is sufficiently broad to include criminal as well as civil jurisdiction, powers and duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Milton responds that the title of the RJA must be read in conjunction with the title of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that when so read \"[i]t can only be concluded that each act seeks to define <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>the jurisdiction of courts in their respective spheres; that is, that the Revised Judicature Act defines the jurisdiction of civil courts while the Code of Criminal Procedure defines the jurisdiction of criminal courts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> * * * The Revised Judicature Act title speaks <em>generally </em>of jurisdiction, but then proceeds to catalogue purely civil procedure\u201d while \"the title to the Code is much more specific.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">Milton\u2019s contentions find support in <em>People v Stanley </em>344 Mich 530; 75 NW2d 39 (1956), in which this Court ruled violative of the title-body clause an amendment to the 1915 Judicature Act providing that a writ of error to the Supreme Court shall issue as a matter of course following final judgment in a criminal case involving the personal liberty of the appellant. The title of the 1915 Judicature Act and of the RJA are in all material respects identical.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">In reaching its conclusion, the <em>Stanley </em>Court reasoned, much as does appellant Milton:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-9\">\"The title of the judicature act negatives a conclusion that it was intended by the legislature to apply to procedure in criminal cases. The later enactment of the code of criminal procedure, without making reference to the judicature act, shows the legislative intent. These 2 acts were obviously intended by the legislature to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>apply to the practice and procedure in civil cases separate from that in criminal cases. A mere reading and comparison of the titles of the judicature act and of the code of criminal procedure can lead to only one conclusion \u2014 one was intended by the legislature to refer to practice and procedure in civil cases, and the other to criminal procedure.\u201d <em>People v Stanley, supra, </em>540.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">In support of its reasoning, the Supreme Court referred to the three clauses in the title, previously quoted, where the word \"civil\u201d appears,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> adding: \"Nowhere does the title of the act, nor the provisions in the act itself, expressly apply to appeals in criminal cases. To the contrary, the legislature, as before indicated, subsequently enacted the code of criminal procedure, applying specially and solely to that subject.\u201d <em>People v Stanley, supra, </em>539.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The <em>Stanley </em>Court nowhere acknowledged or otherwise adverted to the opening clauses of the title of the 1915 Judicature Act, the clauses not qualified by the word \"civil\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">The Attorney General, emphasizing the opening clauses of the RJA\u2019s title, argues that <em>Stanley </em>voids only RJA provisions concerning criminal <em>procedure </em>and not those pertaining to criminal <em>jurisdiction.. </em>Milton responds that the proffered jurisdiction-procedure dichotomy is \"facile\u201d, \"illusory\u201d, \"transparent\u201d and \"intellectually dishonest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">We agree with Milton that the distinction between jurisdiction and procedure would not be a sound basis of reconciling our conclusion that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>inclusion of criminal jurisdiction provisions in the RJA does not violate the title-body clause, with <em>Stanley\u2019s </em>conclusion that the inclusion of an appeal as of right in criminal cases violated the Judicature Act, both acts bearing the same title.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">We are of the opinion that the <em>Stanley </em>analysis is incorrect in considering the entitlement of another act (the Code of Criminal Procedure) in deciding whether the subject matter of the challenged act (the 1915 Judicature Act) was within and germane to the object expressed in its title.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">When passing new legislation, the Legislature is free either to enact an entirely new and independent act or amend <em>any </em>act to which the subject of the new legislation is \"germane, auxiliary or 'incidental\u201d.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">Not infrequently there will be a number of existing acts to which the new legislation would be germane, auxiliary or incidental. The legislative choice will not be held invalid merely because an alternative location for the new legislation might appear to some more appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">In <em>Detroit Board of Street Railway Commissioners v Wayne County, </em>18 Mich App 614, 622-623; 171 NW2d 669 (1969), the Court of Appeals rejected a claim of the DSR that a statutory provision imposing liability for ad valorem taxes on public transportation facilities acquired by home rule cities violated the title-body clause because the amendment to the home-rule act imposing the liability should properly have been located in the property tax law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-10\">\"It might have been better draftsmanship to have placed the provision concerning the taxability of municipal transportation utilities in the general property tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>law (where one might expect to find it) rather than in the home rule act. There is, however, no constitutional requirement that the legislature do a tidy job in legislating. It is perfectly free to enact bits and pieces of legislation in separate acts or to tack them on to existing statutes even though some persons might think that the bits and pieces belong in a particular general statute covering the matter. The constitutional requirement is satisfied if the bits and pieces so enacted are embraced in the object expressed in the title of the amendatory act and the act being amended.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">No purpose would be served by perpetuating the <em>Stanley </em>analysis. The constitutional validity of an amendatory statute does not turn on an appraisal of whether it was located in the most appropriate of the possibly many statutes to which it is germane.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Nor does <em>Stanley </em>stand up when analyzed in the light of the facts as they were when the Judicature Act was enacted. In 1915 there was no codification of criminal procedure. The legislation on criminal procedure, while compiled as Part Two of Title XV of the Compiled Laws of 1915, was not a codification, but rather consisted of provisions of the Revised Statutes of 1846 interspersed with numerous subsequent enactments. When the 1915 Judicature Act was adopted, the Legislature could not have had any intention with regard to a Code of Criminal Procedure enacted in 1927 \u2014 12 years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Contrary to Milton\u2019s assertions, the 1915 Judica<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>ture Act did contain provisions concerning criminal procedure. It was provided that \"[t]he Supreme Court shall have ** * * jurisdiction of suits, actions and matters brought before it by writ of certiorari or writ of error, when the same shall be allowed by law to any inferior court, to magistrates and other officers, as well in cases of prosecution for any offense, misdemeanor or penalty, in the name of the people of this state * * * \u2019<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AA9\">The civil jurisdiction of the circuit courts was indeed expressly stated, but the Judicature Act also provided: \"Said court shall also have and exercise all the powers usually possessed and exercised by courts of record at the common law * * * \u201d except as modified by statute or rule of the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The statutory provisions eliminating the common-law disability of defendants in criminal cases from testifying in their own defense were also part of the 1915 Judicature Act.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Additionally, the 1915 Judicature Act states the disqualification of a married person from testifying against his or her spouse with the exception for cases of \"prosecution for bigamy\u201d and for \"a crime committed against the children of either or both\u201d.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>Manifestly, the <em>Stanley </em>Court erred in ascribing to the 1915 Legislature an intent to confine the Judicature Act to strictly civil matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">We appreciate that it is arguable that the statutory references in the Judicature Act to the jurisdiction of this Court and the circuit court were unnecessary as the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and of the circuit court in civil and criminal matters was provided for in the 1908 Constitution at least to the extent not divested by law.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Be that as it may, the Legislature did specifically provide for this Court\u2019s jurisdiction in criminal matters and did specifically cover at least two evidentiary questions arising in criminal cases; we cannot properly ascribe to the Legislature an intent to confine the Judicature Act strictly to civil matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">Nor was the 1968, district court act, amendment to the RJA the first inclusion in the RJA of language concerning criminal jurisdiction. In addition to the continuing inclusion of the evidentiary provisions referred to, there is again a reference to the jurisdiction of this Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-8\">\"The supreme court has jurisdiction and power over:,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-9\">\"(1) Any matter brought before it by appropriate writ to any inferior court, magistrate or other officer.\u201d MCLA 600.215; MSA 27A.215.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">This reference to a magistrate clearly refers to criminal matters. \"Any matter\u201d would include criminal as well as civil matters. In addition to the express statement that the circuit court has original jurisdiction to determine civil claims and remedies,<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number><footnotemark>17</footnotemark> reiterated again is that court\u2019s power and jurisdiction to the extent \"possessed by courts of record at the common law as altered by the constitution and laws of this state and the rules of the supreme court\u201d.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The language concerning the jurisdiction of the courts to try criminal cases embodied in the Code of Criminal Procedure is so general that one cannot readily determine whether the circuit court\u2019s jurisdiction in criminal cases is constitutionally vested, derives from the common law, the Judicature Act (and its successor, the Revised Judicature Act), or the Code of Criminal Procedure.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">More saliently, in 1964 the Legislature added Chapter 3 to the RJA, thereby establishing the Court of Appeals. In contrast with the Supreme Court and the circuit court, the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals is entirely statutory.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> RJA 308 provides the Court of Appeals with jurisdiction on appeal from:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">\"All final judgments from the circuit courts, court of claims, and recorder\u2019s court, except judgments on ordinance violations in the traffic and ordinance division of recorder\u2019s court.\u201d MCLA 600.308; MSA 27A.308.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">Manifestly, this confers jurisdiction on the Court of Appeals in criminal cases. <em>There is no other source of its jurisdiction.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">Either the Court of Appeals has jurisdiction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>criminal appeals under the RJA or this Court is obliged to take all criminal appeals to secure the right in every criminal prosecution \"to have an appeal as a matter of right\u201d.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">It is indeed ironic that this matter has come full circle. In <em>Stanley, </em>by finding a violation of the title-body clause, this Court avoided appeals as of right in criminal cases.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> If we adhere to <em>Stanley, </em>then, perforce, this Court was obliged, until the legislative response,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> to grant appeal as of right in every criminal case and the Court of Appeals was relieved of that jurisdiction \u2014 the very jurisdiction which prompted the creation of that Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">Milton further contends that the title to the RJA does not provide adequate notice to the public or the Legislature<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> that the RJA contains provisions affecting jurisdiction in criminal matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">This Court has had frequent occasion to consider like claims. It is now well established that the title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>need not serve as an index<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> of all that the act contains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-5\">\"An abridgement of all those sections is not essential to a sufficient title. While it contains various related provisions not directly indicated or enumerated in the title, under the construction of this constitutional requirement, as many times reviewed by this court, if the act centers to one main general object or purpose which the title comprehensively declares, though in general terms, and if provisions in the body of the act not directly mentioned in the title are germane, auxiliary, or incidental to that general purpose, the constitutional requirement is met.\u201d <em>Loomis v Rogers, </em>197 Mich 265, 271; 163 NW 1018 (1917).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">More recently, in <em>Advisory Opinion re Constitutionality of1972 PA 294, </em>389 Mich 441; 208 NW2d 469 (1973), Justice M. S. Coleman\u2019s and my opinions addressed similar challenges to the no-fault automobile liability act. Justice Coleman wrote at pp 464-465:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-7\">\"It is and was reasonable and logical for the Legislature to classify the matter herein referred to as related to the Insurance Code. Such action cannot be said to have been prompted by deceit or some ulterior motive. * * * The amendment in question cannot be said to have allowed the passage of a law not fully understood (although the subject matter may be complex and difficult for a layman to understand), or that the amendment brought into the Code subjects having no connection with the Insurance Code. The Legislature and the public were well aware of the intention and context of this legislation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">I wrote at 389 Mich 488-489:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b319-9\">\"The word 'object\u2019 expresses an intrinsically elastic concept. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>\"Codification of multifarious enactments would be impossible if the constitution obliges the Legislature to define the object of a codification in narrow terms. Especially in the case of a codification, the Legislature is free to conceive of the object of its endeavors in terms of a common denominator and to express that conception in umbrella words.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">In <em>Regents of the University of Michigan v Pray, </em>264 Mich 693, 697; 251 NW 348 (1933), this Court said: \"Title to a codification statute can scarcely be expected to embody reference to every detail of the act\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">Just as the title of the RJA is adequate notice of the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and the circuit court, to the extent there stated, and of the Court of Appeals, so too it is adequate notice of the civil and criminal jurisdiction of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">In conclusion, the correct question is not whether the Legislature might have included provisions concerning the criminal jurisdiction of the district court in the Code of Criminal Procedure, but rather whether provisions establishing criminal jurisdiction are germane to the general purpose of the RJA.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">While there are specific and therefore limiting clauses in the entitlement of the RJA, the more general, opening clauses of the entitlement speak of the \"organization and jurisdiction\u201d and \"powers and duties\u201d of the courts of this state and are not confined to civil matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-10\">The RJA centers on one main general object or purpose which the title comprehensively declares, though in general terms.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The provisions conferring criminal jurisdiction on the district court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>although not directly mentioned in the title, are germane to that general purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">1968 PA 154 does not violate Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 24.
