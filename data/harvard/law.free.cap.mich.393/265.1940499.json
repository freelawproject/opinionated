We affirm earlier decisions in deciding that the bargaining parties basically utilized correct procedures, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>we reach no conclusion as to the reasonableness or necessity of the contractual provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">On September 22, 1972, the Michigan Employment Relations Commission (MERC) certified Michigan Council 55, AFSCME, AFL-CIO, as a bargaining representative for a unit of district and circuit court employees in Livingston County. No one has challenged the appropriateness of that unit in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The bargaining representative, employees, and representatives of the judiciary then engaged in bargaining over a contract. This was to be expected, and was correct, in light of this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Judges of the 74th Judicial District v Bay County, </em>385 Mich 710; 190 NW2d 219 (1971). During bargaining, according to the complaint and answer filed in this cause, it appears that a representative of the Board of Commissioners was excluded from the bargaining room. The specific details of the reasoning behind such exclusion are not set forth. This Court believes the best practice, in general, especially at initial bargaining sessions, is for the local judiciary to invite a representative of the commissioners to appear personally at such sessions. The commissioners\u2019 representative cannot actively bargain, of course, but such representative may present relevant data as to other county employees, <em>e.g., </em>wage levels for comparable jobs, provisions in other labor contracts, general county benefits, and county budget information.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The bargaining parties arrived at a contract on June 22, 1973. Circuit Judge Paul R. Mahinske issued an administrative order implementing the contract on July 16, 1973, and then on July 18, 1973, he submitted such order to the Court Administrator for approval, pursuant to this Court\u2019s Administrative Order No. 1971-6, 386 Mich xxix. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>This Court affirms those actions as being correct. The order of July 16, 1973, might not in some cases be necessary, but if it is, then review by the Court Administrator becomes a step in insuring the reasonableness and necessity of the contractual provisions. It was conceded by appellants, at oral argument, that their representatives were invited to the Court Administrator\u2019s office for a presentation of the commissioners\u2019 views on the contract. But it appears that the commissioners did not participate in a point-by-point, clause-by-clause, discussion of the contract, as this Court hoped would be the case under Administrative Order 1971-6. The reason for such nonparticipation appears to lie with the judgment of the commissioners\u2019 representatives, and their decision does not aid their argument that they have been denied due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Appellants now advance two basic arguments: that separation of powers has been violated, and that due process and equal protection have been denied because they have not been afforded a neutral forum in which to determine whether or not the provisions of the contract are reasonable and necessary. But the bargaining process used here does not violate the explanation of separation of powers set forth in <em>Wayne Circuit Judges v Wayne County, </em>386 Mich 1; 190 NW2d 228 (1971), <em>cert den </em>405 US 923; 92 S Ct 961; 30 L Ed 2d 794 (1972), and <em>Commonwealth, ex rel Carroll, v Tate, </em>442 Pa 45; 274 A2d 193 (1971), <em>cert den </em>402 US 974; 91 S Ct 1665; 29 L Ed 2d 138 (1971), and we continue to adhere to those precedents.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The reasonableness and necessity of such contracts are subject to review in Michigan. We already have provided for an administrative check on reasonableness through Administrative Order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>1971-6. In addition, once the Court Administrator has approved a contract the Board of Commissioners may institute adversary court proceedings to test the reasonableness and necessity of the contract if it appears that the budget reflecting the contract will exceed the total appropriation. The commissioners may file suit promptly for injunctive relief in circuit court in their own county. Since the purpose of such suit would be to enjoin an administrative order of a judge of that very county, the commissioners may seek designation by the Court Administrator of a disinterested judge to decide the case on its merits. In order to expedite the settlement of disputes over wages and working conditions, any appellate review of the decision of the circuit court shall be by direct application for leave to appeal to this Court, and no writ of mandamus shall lie under Administrative Order 1971-6 until such proceedings, promptly begun and diligently pursued, are terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">By such holding, this Court\u2019s intent is to afford the legislative body a neutral forum in which reasonableness and necessity may be determined after adversary hearings. This Court is aware that this procedure may prolong public employee collective bargaining, and thus may disappoint the union and its membership. This Court also is aware that the commissioners may claim that any proceeding presided over by a judge will not be a neutral forum, and thus the commissioners may also be disappointed. The Court reminds the parties, however, that the Legislature has based public employee collective bargaining in Michigan on an industrial model. Such a model contains inherent difficulties when the ultimate public employer, the voting public, has elected representatives to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>three separate units in order to govern itself fairly.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The Court of Appeals was correct in dismissing plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 complaint for superintending control, and is affirmed, without prejudice to the filing by plaintiffs-appellants of an appropriate circuit court action within 20 days of the issuance of this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b347-6\">T.

The resolution of this question neither affects nor is affected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>by the asserted inherent power of the court to require the expenditure of public funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The Livingston County Board of Commissioners challenges a collective bargaining agreement between the \"Court System of Livingston County\u201d, as \"public employer\u201d, and Livingston County Court Employees\u2019 Chapter of Local No. 2652, the bargaining representative of the employees of the \"Court System\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The agreement recognizes the union and establishes wages, hours and fringe benefits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">We would hold that Livingston County is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>public employer of the employees who perform services for the circuit and probate courts of that county. We adhere to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Judges of the 74th Judicial District v Bay County, </em>385 Mich 710; 190 NW2d 219 (1971), holding, in effect, that the district court is the public employer of certain persons performing services for that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The basis for this distinction is that the district court act,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as construed in <em>Bay County, </em>obliges the district control unit to appropriate a lump sum for the compensation of district court employees and empowers district judges to decide how that sum shall be expended. The Legislature has not required counties to appropriate lump sums for the operation of the circuit or probate courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">In <em>Bay County, </em>this Court affirmed a circuit court decision that certain persons performing services for a district court were employees of that court and not of the county.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Bay County </em>does not, as has been asserted, hold that every court or the One Court of Justice<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> is the \"public employer\u201d under the PERA of all court employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-8\"><em>Bay County </em>was predicated on the statutory authority of the district court: \"Except as otherwise provided, the judges of the district court <em>shall appoint the employees thereof and \u00f1x their com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number><em>pensation </em>within appropriations provided by the governing body of each district control unit.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">While circuit courts have the statutory authority to appoint and fix the compensation of a few specified employees, within amounts appropriated therefor by the county, that statutory authority, in contrast with the statutory authority of the district court, does not extend to most circuit court employees.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The probate court has no statutory authority to fix the compensation of any court employee.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Simultaneously with <em>Bay County, </em>this Court upheld a circuit court decision authorizing a writ of mandamus directing Wayne County to provide funds to hire law clerks, a judicial assistant and additional probation officers. <em>Wayne Circuit Judges v Wayne County (On Rehearing), </em>386 Mich 1, 9; 190 NW2d 228 (1971). The Court \"ordered that the Dethmers-Black opinion of 1969 [on original submission]<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> be and become the opinion of the Court on rehearing\u201d.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>\n<em>Wayne Circuit Judges has been read by some as an assertion of \"inherent power\u201d in the judiciary to determine the day-to-day budgetary needs of the One Court of Justice and to require the other branches of government to fund those needs.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">The Dethmers-Black analysis was in terms of <em>\"critical </em>judicial needs\u201d, the <em>\"urgency </em>of the situation\u201d, <em>\"emergently </em>requires\u201d (see fn 13), and does not support a claim that inherent power may be invoked in support of routine budgeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>Negoti\u00e1tion of a collective bargaining agreement should pose no threat to the ability of the judiciary to function \"serviceably as a co-equal branch of Michigan\u2019s government\u201d. <em>Wayne Circuit Judges v Wayne County, </em>383 Mich 10, 33; 172 NW2d 436 (1969). A new collective bargaining agreement ordinarily creates no \"urgency\u201d or \"emergency\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Concededly, an \"emergency\u201d, justifying the invocation of inherent power, may result if the public employer is unable or unwilling to offer court employees compensation and benefits sufficient to retain their services or obtain the services of competent replacement or additional personnel. It is not claimed that such an \"emergency\u201d prompted the actions of the Livingston County judges in this case nor has it been shown that the increases in wages and benefits in this contract are necessary to retain or obtain the services of the requisite number of competent personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The fleeting reference to the inherent power of a court in <em>Bay County </em>neither requires nor justifies inherent power analysis of the question of who is the public employer of court employees. <em>Bay County </em>was predicated on statutory authority, not inherent power. The circuit court\u2019s statement in <em>Bay County </em>that district judges have \"both the inherent and statutory right\u201d to hire and fire personnel and to establish classifications and wages, was qualified by adding \"within the appropriation of its district control unit and as may be fixed by statute\u201d.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>This Court\u2019s statement in <em>Bay County </em>that its decision in that case was wholly \"consonant with the constitutionally-prescribed functioning of the courts under inherent powers\u201d as elucidated in the companion opinion in <em>Wayne Circuit Judges,</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> was, like the circuit court\u2019s statement, explicitly limited to the amount of funds appropriated by the district control unit:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\">\"If, however, the statute means what it says, <em>i.e., </em>that the judges are to fix the compensation of their employees, then it follows that the language 'within appropriations\u2019 simply means that the judges\u2019 statutory power to employ personnel and fix their compensation <em>must be exercised within the overall limits of funds appropriated by the district control unit or units, </em>for the operation and maintenance of the district court.\u201d <em>Bay County, supra, </em>p 726. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">It has been noted that often \"where a court has used sweeping language [regarding its inherent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>power] when granting monies requested, its holding is more appropriately explained in terms of a statutory grant of fiscal authority to a court, or a specific state constitutional mandate<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> directed at the judiciary\u201d.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">In <em>Wayne Circuit Judges, </em>statutes authorized the hiring of law clerks, a judicial assistant<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and, as construed by the Court of Appeals,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the requisite number of probation officers.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Prior to <em>Bay County </em>and <em>Wayne Circuit Judges, </em>this Court, in <em>Wayne County Civil Service Commission v Board of Supervisors, </em>384 Mich 363, 367; 184 NW2d 201 (1971), addressed the question of who is the public employer of all or particular county employees, the Wayne County Civil Service Commission, the Wayne County Board of Supervisors (its Wayne County Labor Relations Board) or the Wayne County Board of Road Commissioners:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">\"Two admittedly conflicting statutes compete in litigious depth for jurisdiction over the process of collective bargaining by Wayne County employees with their employer (or employers).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">This Court determined that, with the exception of the Wayne County Road Commission (found to be the public employer of its employees) and except as \"[f]urther litigation may indeed be necessary to settle the status of other such divisions or classes\u201d, the Board of Supervisors of Wayne County was the public employer of the employees of Wayne County.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">In ascertaining the public employer of persons who perform services for the circuit court and probate court, we are similarly confronted with competing statutes. The PERA secures to public employees the right of collective bargaining. Additionally, there are general and specific statutes authorizing the county, and in some instances the courts, to appoint and fix the compensation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>public employees who perform services for the courts.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>While circuit judges are statutorily authorized to fix the compensation of a few specified employees, the statutes vest the board of supervisors (now the board of commissioners) or board of auditors with authority to determine the compensation of most circuit and probate court employees. See fn 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">A major issue in <em>Bay County </em>was whether a district control unit may line-item budget a district court. This Court held that it could not, and that the district judges may decide how the funds appropriated will be expended \"within the overall limits\u201d of the appropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The Legislature has not authorized the circuit court or the probate court, in contrast with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>district court, to \"appoint the employees thereof and fix their compensation\u201d within appropriations provided by the governing body of the county. There is no \"overall limit\u201d, there is no lump-sum appropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">Such authority as has been conferred on circuit judges to fix the compensation of specified judicial employees has been limited to the amount appropriated \"therefor\u201d \u2014 for the specified employee(s)\u2014 by the board of commissioners. See fn 23. Line-item budgeting of the circuit and probate courts is contemplated by the statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Determination of the identity of the public employer requires, as this Court recognized in <em>Wayne County Civil Service Commission, supra, </em>pp 367-368, \"the ascertainment of legislative intent when there is no evidentiary or other reasonably authoritative guide to pertinent meaning or purpose of the legislators. For such difficulty Cardozo has provided our first and most dependable range light (The Nature of the Judicial Process, pp 14, 15, published 1921):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">\" 'Interpretation is often spoken of as if it were nothing but the search and the discovery of a meaning which, however obscure and latent, had none the less a real and ascertainable pre-existence in the legislator\u2019s mind. The process is, indeed, that at times, but it is often something more. The ascertainment of intention may be the least of a judge\u2019s troubles in ascribing meaning to a statute. \"The fact is\u201d, says Gray in his lectures on the \"Nature and Sources of the Law\u201d, \"that the difficulties of so-called interpretation arise when the legislature has had no meaning at all; when the question which is raised on the statute never occurred to it; when what the judges have to do is, not to determine what the legislature did mean on a point which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>present to its mind, <em>but to guess what it would have intended on a point not present to its mind, if the point had been present. \u2019 </em>\"(Emphasis by the Court.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">With that guideline, the Court concluded (p 373):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">\"In the words of Cardozo, we are left to <em>guess </em>what the 1965 legislature [which enacted the PERA] would have done had the point come to attention, and our <em>guess </em>is that it would have advised all established county civil service commissions as we now do by today\u2019s judgment.\u201d (Emphasis by the Court.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">In this case, our task is similarly to <em>guess </em>whether the 1965 Legislature, \"had the point come to attention\u201d, would have designated the court or the board of commissioners as the public employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">Our <em>guess </em>is that the Legislature would have designated the board of commissioners, not the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">While circuit and probate judges have the authority to fix court hours, hours of employment are not usually a matter of dispute. The critical issues are generally wages and other financial benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">The statutory authority conferred on circuit judges to fix the compensation of a few specified employees is limited to the amount appropriated \"therefor\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">This Court has held that retirement programs for public employees are a mandatory subject of collective bargaining.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Local court employees are not covered by separate judicial retirement programs but receive benefits under programs estab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>lished by local units of government which also cover nonjudicial governmental employees or, in the case of state-compensated local court employees, state retirement programs. The bargaining agreement presently challenged obliges the Court System to make contributions for the court employees to the Livingston County Employees Retirement Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">The PERA requires a public employer to bargain with the representatives of its employees with respect to wages, hours and other terms and conditions of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">In such negotiations, the employees\u2019 representative is expected to urge, and the public employer is expected to consider, claims for increased compensation and benefits and other improvements in the conditions of employment. While circuit judges, iii implementation of the legislative mandate on the counties or in the exercise of inherent power, may properly require the provision of funds adequate to hire and retain competent personnel <em>(Wayne Circuit Judges), </em>a judge may not on the basis of that authority properly require expenditures beyond those minimum amounts necessary to achieve that goal.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Collective bargaining contemplated by the PERA cannot take place where the negotiating public employer, because of the impecuniosity or attitude of the appropriating authority, has no negotiating leeway.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">In determining the amounts to be appropriated for judicial needs, a board of commissioners necessarily considers other county needs and the wage levels of other employees paid with county funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Having in mind those factors and the statutory pattern, our \"guess\u201d is that the Legislature would have designated the board of commissioners, not the court, as the public employer to bargain collectively concerning wage levels and other benefits to be paid to circuit and probate court employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Designation of the county as the public employer of court employees neither places the courts at the \"mercy\u201d of the board of commissioners nor negates or denies the existence of a court\u2019s inherent power in cases of emergency, urgency, or necessity to compel appropriation of funds <em>necessary </em>to <em>preserve </em>the operation of the court. If collective bargaining between the county and the representative of court and other employees results in an inadequate compensation and benefit level causing resignations and precluding the hiring of competent court employees, the circuit court can intervene under the legislative mandate on the counties or under inherent power and require the payment of such amounts as may be <em>necessary </em>to hire and retain the services of competent personnel.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The record in this case presents no challenge to the fundamental powers of any court. There is understandable desire to preserve judicial prerogatives, but that should not affect analysis of the narrow question of statutory construction presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">In conjunction with <em>Wayne Circuit Judges (On Rehearing), </em>this Court promulgated an administrative order prohibiting any judge \"by peremptory writ or otherwise\u201d from ordering the expenditure of public funds for any judicially required purpose \"until he has submitted his proposed writ or order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>to the constitutional office of Court Administrator\u201d.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">This review procedure was established as a constraint on the improvident exercise by judges of the inherent power, asserted in <em>Wayne Circuit Judges (On Rehearing), </em>to promulgate orders in emergency situations. It was not designed to review collective bargaining agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">After the collective bargaining agreement in this case was signed, the circuit judge issued an administrative order implementing the agreement and submitted the order to the Court Administrator for approval. The Court\u2019s opinion in this case \"affirms those actions as being correct. The order [of the circuit judge in this case] might not in some cases be necessary, but if it is, the review by the Court Administrator becomes a step in insuring the reasonableness and necessity of the contractual provisions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The Court concludes: \"Once the Court Administrator has approved a contract the Board of Commissioners may institute adversary court proceedings to t\u00e9st the reasonableness and necessity of the contract if it appears that the budget reflecting the contract will exceed the total appropriation. The commissioners may file suit promptly for injunctive relief in circuit court in their own county. Since the purpose of such suit would be to enjoin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>an administrative order of a judge of that very county, the commissioners may seek designation by the Court Administrator of a disinterested judge to decide the case on its merits. In order to expedite the settlement of disputes over wages and working conditions, any appellate review of the decision of the circuit court shall be by direct application for leave to appeal to this Court, and no writ of mandamus shall lie under Administrative Order 1971-6 until such proceedings, promptly begun and diligently pursued, are terminated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The preceding statements further support our <em>guess </em>that the 1965 Legislature would not have designated the circuit or probate courts as the public employer. Collective bargaining subject to Court Administrator review, disinterested judge review and direct appellate review by this Court is not the kind of collective bargaining contemplated by the PERA.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">It is no answer to say that while the Court \"is aware that this procedure may prolong public employee collective bargaining, and thus may disappoint the union and its membership\u201d, it \"reminds the parties, however, that the Legislature has based public employee collective bargaining in Michigan on an industrial model. Such a model contains inherent difficulties when the ultimate public employer, the voting public, has elected representatives to three separate units in order to govern itself fairly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">The difficulty arises not from the Legislature\u2019s choice of the \"industrial model\u201d, but rather from the desire of the judiciary to control the budgeting process. That objective may be sound and its achievement beneficial to the proper functioning of our judicial system. But the desirability of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>objective and of state-wide financing and of unitary budgeting are not appropriate considerations in resolving the issue of statutory construction before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Any change in the method of financing or budgeting the judicial branch is a legislative, not a judicial, responsibility. However desirable or beneficial the sought-for change may be, it does not create an emergeny justifying invocation of inherent power \u2014 a power to be \"cautiously exercised\u201d per Dethmers-Black <em>(Wayne County Judges v Wayne </em>County, 383 Mich at 33). Although the present system of local financing supplemented by state financing may not be optimally efficient and may allocate and distribute revenue in a less than satisfactory manner, it has enabled the one court of justice to function \"serviceably as a co-equal branch of Michigan\u2019s government\u201d for 138 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">It appears that there were adequate funds, at least temporarily, to pay the additional wages and benefits provided by the challenged collective bargaining agreement. A surplus developed because the county appropriated more than was expended for indigent defendants\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees and jurors\u2019 fees. The Livingston County Circuit Court has diverted funds appropriated for one purpose to another. The message to the counties is clear, and a rueful precedent has been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">This collective bargaining agreement requires expenditures for increased wages and benefits greater than the amounts appropriated <em>therefor. </em>Livingston County asserts that the agreement provides greater compensation and benefits than other county employees receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>Allowing a court to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement requiring expenditures beyond legislative appropriations eliminates the balance the Legislature has always provided whenever it has authorized a judge \u2014 district or circuit \u2014 to appoint employees and fix compensation. That balance has been generally expressed with the words \"within amounts appropriated\u201d. Even if judges and courts are to become \"public employers\u201d, now or in the future, the limit on the financial obligations they may properly assume in a collective bargaining agreement is the amount appropriated by a legislative body.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">Courts do not possess inherent power to appropriate money or require expenditures for whatever needs the judge, the Court Administrator, and this Court on review, determine are reasonable. Inherent power exists only for true emergencies. We beguile ourselves, the unions and their members if we assert otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">We would enter an order declaring that the public employer of circuit court and probate court employees of Livingston County is the Board of Commissioners of that county and that the 53rd District Court is the public employer of district court employees, set aside the orders entered by the circuit judge and the Court Administrator and remand to the circuit court for such further proceedings as may appear appropriate; pending the negotiation of new agreements or until the expiration of 180 days from decision in this Court, whichever is sooner, the employees affected to receive benefits under the collective bargaining agreement made effective January 1, 1973.</p>\n<judges id=\"b365-6\">T.
