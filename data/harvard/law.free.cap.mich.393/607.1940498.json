He contends that Holiday\u2019s \"dress code\u201d violates \u00a7 146, which he characterizes as \"The Michigan Equal Accommodations Act\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-15\">The trial court found that \u00a7 146 proscribed only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>discrimination in public accommodations based on race, creed or color, and that Riegler\u2019s complaint was not within the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\">The Court of Appeals reached the same conclusion and so do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The parties in their pleadings, the trial court and the Court of Appeals have limited this case to the construction of the statute; no constitutional issue is presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Holiday Skating Rink did not file a brief in the Court of Appeals and has not filed one in this Court. Holiday wrote a letter to this Court explaining that it is a small business and cannot afford to hire a lawyer to protect its interests.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Resolution of the question presented requires a determination whether the \"race, creed, color\u201d limitation which appeared in \u00a7 147 and \u00a7 148 of the Penal Code should be read into \u00a7 146.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Riegler contends that the intent of \u00a7 146 is to provide equal accommodations for \"all persons\u201d and to proscribe any and all types of discrimination against any and all persons. He finds support for this argument in the express language of \u00a7 146 (\"[a]ll persons * * * shall be entitled to full and equal accommodations * * * subject only to the conditions and limitations established by law and applicable alike to all citizens and to all citizens alike, with uniform prices.\u201d) and the absence in that section of the qualifying words \"race, creed or color\u201d. He argues that the explicit use of \"race, creed, color\u201d in \u00a7\u00a7 147 and 148 shows that when the Legislature intends to limit the scope of the prohibition to discrimination based on \"race, creed, color\u201d, it says so.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">He acknowledges that the Legislature had a special concern for eliminating discrimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>based on \"race, creed, color\u201d, but argues that concern is evidenced by the provision of criminal sanctions in \u00a7\u00a7 147 and 148. Nothing in \u00a7\u00a7 147 or 148 indicates an intention to limit \u00a7 146 to discrimination based on race, creed, color. Section 146 establishes \"a statutory civil right\u201d guaranteeing \"all persons\u201d access to public accommodations free of any discrimination whatsoever.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">We agree with the trial and appeals courts that the three sections should be read together and that so read \u00a7 146 was qualified by the limiting language of \u00a7\u00a7 147 and 148 restricting the scope of the prohibition to denials of equal accommodations based on race, creed or color.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">The three sections were first enacted in 1885 and were directed at discrimination based on \"race or color\u201d:<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\">\"Section 1. <em>The People of the State of Michigan enact, </em>That all persons within the jurisdiction of said State shall be entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities, and privileges of inns, restaurants, eating-houses, barber shops, public conveyances on land and water, theatres, and all other places of public accommodation and amusement, subject only to the conditions and limitation established by law and applicable alike to all citizens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-9\">\"Sec. 2. That any person who shall violate any of the provisions of the foregoing section, by denying to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>citizen, except for reasons applicable alike to all citizens of every race and color, and regardless of color or race, the full accommodations, advantages, facilities, or privileges in said section enumerated or by aiding or inciting such denial, shall for every such offense be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not to exceed one hundred dollars, or shall be imprisoned not more than thirty days, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-6\">\"Sec. 3. That no citizen of the State of Michigan, possessing all other qualifications which are or may be prescribed by law, shall be disqualified to serve as grand or petit juror in any court of said State on account of race or color, and any officer or other person charged with any duty in the selection or summoning of jurors, who shall exclude or fail to summon any citizen for the cause aforesaid, shall, on conviction thereof, be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and be fined not more than one hundred dollars, or imprisoned not more than thirty days, or both.\u201d 1885 PA 130.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">This Court has previously indicated its understanding of the legislative purpose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-8\">\"The act in question is usually called the 'civil rights act.\u2019 <em>Its purpose is apparent. </em>While it applies to 'all persons in the jurisdiction of this State,\u2019 it cannot be doubted that <em>it was enacted with special reference to those of African descent. \u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.) <em>Bolden v Grand Rapids Operating Corp, </em>239 Mich 318, 321; 214 NW2d 241; 53 ALR 183 (1927).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b684-9\">\"This statute exemplifies the changed feeling of our people towards the African race, and places the colored man upon a perfect equality with all others, before the law in this State.\u201d <em>Ferguson v Gies, </em>82 Mich 358, 364; 46 NW 718 (1890).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">By subsequent amendment the protection of the act was expanded to cover discrimination based on \"creed\u201d.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This Court said, <em>'[t]he intent and purpose </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number><em>of the legislature in its enactment cannot be doubted. </em>* * * when the public are invited to attend places of public accommodation, amusement and recreation, there shall be no discrimination among those permitted to enter because of <em>race, creed or color\u201d. </em>(Emphasis supplied.) <em>Bolden v Grand Rapids Operating Corp, supra, </em>p 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\">The foregoing expressions by the <em>Bolden </em>Court in 1927 were after the act took its present form in 1919 (see fn 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">After Riegler filed his complaint, \u00a7\u00a7 146 and 147 were amended. Section 147 was broadened to proscribe discrimination based on \"national origin\u201d, \"sex\u201d, or \"blindness\u201d, as well as discrimination based on \"race\u201d, \"creed\u201d (now \"religion\u201d), or \"color\u201d. 1972 PA 116. The following sentence was added at the end of \u00a7 146:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">\"Rooming facilities at educational, religious, charitable or nonprofit institutions or organizations, and restrooms and locker room facilities in places of public accommodation may be separated according to sex.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-7\">If we were to accept Riegler\u2019s construction of the statute, that each section should be read without reference to the limitations expressed in the other sections, then it might be argued that the Legislature intended that criminal penalties be imposed for separating according to sex \"rooming facilities at educational, religious, charitable or nonprofit institutions and organizations, and restrooms and locker room facilities in places of public accommodation\u201d, as that limitation is not contained in \u00a7 147, only in \u00a7 146. We would not ascribe to the Legislature such an intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">We conclude, based on the history of this legislation, the language of the statute, and earlier expressions of this Court, that the nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>right secured by \u00a7 146 cannot be defined without reference to \u00a7\u00a7 147 and 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">The question whether a similarly situated male would have a valid action for sex discrimination under the amended statute is not before us. We, therefore, do not consider this complaint in those terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">The circuit court and the Court of Appeals are affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b686-6\">T. G. Kavanagh, C. J., and T. M. Kavanagh, Swainson, Williams, M. S. Coleman, and J. W.

In the event that any person violating this section is operating by virtue of a license issued by the state, or any municipal authority, the court, in addition to the penalty prescribed above, may suspend or revoke such license.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-8\">\"Sec. 148.
