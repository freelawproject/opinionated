While standing on an A-frame <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>ladder and pulling wires through a drop ceiling, plaintiff felt the ladder start to \u201cwalk\u201d out from under him. The ladder and plaintiff then fell to the floor. As a result of injuries sustained in the fall, plaintiff commenced this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-4\">Both RSM and Advance moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. Plaintiff cross-moved for summary judgment on the issue of liability. Supreme Court partially granted defendants\u2019 motions by dismissing plaintiffs claims alleging common-law negligence and violations of Labor Law \u00a7\u00a7 200 and 241 (6), but denied summary judgment on plaintiffs Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) claim. The court also denied plaintiffs cross motion in its entirety. Defendants appeal from the partial denial of their motions and plaintiff cross-appeals from the partial grant of summary judgment to defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">Supreme Court properly granted defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment dismissing the Labor Law \u00a7 200 claim. In support of their motions, defendants submitted portions of plaintiffs deposition transcript wherein he testified that the ladder was not defective and he did not recall any problems with the surface of the floor where he placed the ladder. Although plaintiff submitted an affidavit in response to the motion, he did not controvert or address his prior testimony. Defendants also submitted the affidavit of an expert engineer who found no defects after examining the floor and ladder. As plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact concerning whether defendants provided a safe work site, the court properly dismissed his Labor Law \u00a7 200 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">Defendants were similarly entitled to summary judgment on plaintiffs Labor Law \u00a7 240 (1) claim. While the record does not reveal any defect in the ladder itself, the statute requires more than the provision of any safety device; \u201c[defendants had the statutory obligation to provide a safety device <em>appropriate to the </em>task\u201d <em>(Cohen v Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Ctr., </em>50 AD3d 227, 230 [2008]). Defendants\u2019 expert engineer opined, after examining the scene of the incident as well as plaintiff\u2019s employer\u2019s ladders, that the subject ladder \u201cwas appropriate, safe and proper equipment\u201d to perform the task at issue. Defendants also submitted an affidavit from plaintiffs supervisor\u2014which was not contradicted by plaintiffs affidavit\u2014attesting that plaintiff \u201creported his ladder fell as he had not set the side bars properly when he moved the ladder from one location to the next.\u201d Given the unrefuted expert opinion and plaintiffs admission that he did not use the ladder properly, Supreme Court should have granted defendants\u2019 motions in their entirety <em>(see Robinson v East Med. Ctr., LP, </em>6 NY3d 550, 554 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>[2006]; <em>Torres v Mazzone Admin. Group, Inc., </em>46 AD3d 1040, 1041 [2007], <em>lv denied </em>10 NY3d 706 [2008]; <em>Albert v Williams Lubricants, Inc., </em>35 AD3d 1115, 1117 [2006]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-3\">Spain, J.P., Lahtinen, Malone Jr. and Stein, JJ., concur. Ordered that the order is modified, on the law, with one bill of costs to defendants, by reversing so much thereof as partially denied defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment; motions granted in their entirety and complaint dismissed; and, as so modified, affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
