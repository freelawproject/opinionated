Cain, Jr., Appellant.</parties>\n<citation id=\"AgB\">[864 NYS2d 346]</citation>\n\n\n\n<opinion><p id=\"A16v\">Appeal from a judgment of the Niagara County Court (Angelo J. Morinello, J.), rendered May 16, 2007. The judgment convicted defendant, upon his plea of guilty, of attempted assault in the second degree.</p><p id=\"b1313-6\">It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously affirmed.</p><p id=\"b1313-7\">Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him upon his plea of guilty of attempted assault in the second degree (Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 110.00, 120.05 [2]). The valid waiver by defendant of the right to appeal encompasses his challenge to the severity of the sentence <em>(see People v Hidalgo, </em>91 NY2d 733, 737 [1998]; <em>People v Burney, </em>41 AD3d 1221 [2007], <em>lv denied </em>9 NY3d 863 [2007]; <em>People v Stanton, </em>31 AD3d 1219 [2006]). In any event, the sentence is not unduly harsh or severe. Although the further contention of defendant that he was denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial survives his waiver of the right to appeal and the guilty plea, that contention is without merit <em>(see People v Barnes, </em>41 AD3d 1309 [2007], <em>lv denied </em>9 NY3d 920 [2007]; <em>Stanton, </em>31 AD3d 1219 [2006]).
