Upon a motion by the child\u2019s Law Guardian, Family Court dismissed the petition, concluding that the doctrine of equitable estoppel precludes genetic testing of the child. Petitioner appeals and we now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-4\">We \u201chave long recognized the availability of the doctrine of equitable estoppel as a defense in a paternity proceeding\u201d <em>(Matter of Kristen D., v Stephen D., </em>280 AD2d 717, 719 [2001]; <em>see Matter of Shondel J. v Mark D., </em>7 NY3d 320, 326 [2006]; <em>Matter of Peter BB. v Robin CC., </em>256 AD2d 889, 889-890 [1998]). Indeed, Family Ct Act \u00a7 532 (a) provides in particular that a genetic marker test shall not be ordered if the court finds that it is not in the best interests of the child based upon, among other things, equitable estoppel. Here, the child was adopted shortly after his birth in 2004. Although respondent allegedly informed petitioner of her pregnancy in December 2003, there is no indication in the. record that petitioner took any steps to assert his rights as a putative father, participate in or contribute to respondent\u2019s prenatal care, or otherwise maintain contact with respondent during her pregnancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-5\">Moreover, while petitioner asserts that he immediately sought to establish paternity upon learning that the then two-year-old child might be his, he indicates that he has not decided whether he will seek to assume a parental role in the child\u2019s life; he simply wishes to learn whether he is the child\u2019s biological father. As stated by the Court of Appeals, \u201c[t]o conclude that petitioner acted promptly once he became aware of the child is to fundamentally misconstrue whose timetable is relevant. Promptness is measured in terms of the baby\u2019s life not by the onset of the father\u2019s awareness\u201d <em>(Matter of Robert O. v Russell K., </em>80 NY2d 254, 264 [1992]). Under the circumstances here and given the need to \u201c \u2018prevent unwanted intrusion by the child\u2019s former biological relatives to promote the stability of the new adoptive family,\u2019 \u201d Family Court properly dismissed the petition <em>(Matter of Peter Z. v Nilda C., </em>46 AD3d 696, 697 [2007] [citation omitted]; <em>see Matter of Vernon J. v Sandra M., </em>36 AD3d 912, 913 [2007]; <em>Matter of John Robert P. v Vito C., </em>23 AD3d 659, 661-662 [2005]; <em>Matter of Peter BB. v Robin CC., </em>256 AD2d at 890; <em>see also Matter of Female Infant B., </em>51 AD3d 419, 422-423 [2008]; <em>cf. Matter of Gutierrez v (Gutierrez-Delgado, </em>33 AD3d 1133, 1134-1135 [2006]).</p>\n<p id=\"b1051-6\">Peters, Spain, Malone Jr. and Stein, JJ., concur. Ordered that the order is affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
