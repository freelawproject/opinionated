The Home Co-Operative Company et al. </em>Indeed this action is but a continuation of the other, the plaintiff here being the assignee of the purchaser at the trustee\u2019s sale, which sale we held invalid in our opinion in the other, or main, case, <em>ante, </em>p. 71. The judgment of the district court in that case which adjudicated that sale valid was reversed by us, and it necessarily follows from our judgment of reversal therein,. as counsel for appellee here concedes, that the judgment of the district court in the case at bar, which merely followed the pr\u00e9vious judgment in the main case by adjudicating good the title which the purchaser at that sale obtained, must also be reversed, and an order to that effect is hereby entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b96-10\">Mr. Justice 'Gabbert and Mr. Justice Bailey concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
