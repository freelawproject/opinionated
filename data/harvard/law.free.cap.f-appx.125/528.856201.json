We review the district court findings of fact for clear error and its conclusions of law <em>de novo. See Roberts v. Dretke, </em>381 F.3d 491, 497 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">The trial court\u2019s denial of Hernandez\u2019s motion for a mistrial justifies federal habeas corpus relief only if it was \u201cerror ... so extreme that it constitutes a denial of fundamental fairness under the Due Process Clause.\u201d <em>See Bridge v. Lynaugh, </em>838 F.2d 770, 772 (5th Cir.1988). In order to obtain relief, Hernandez must show that the trial court\u2019s error had a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>See Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 623, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993). Hernandez must show that \u201cthere is more than a mere reasonable possibility that [the error] contributed to the verdict. It must have had a substantial effect or influence in determining the verdict.\u201d <em>Woods v. Johnson, </em>75 F.3d 1017, 1026 (5th Cir.1996)(emphasis omitted). In determining harm, this court should consider (1) the importance of the witness\u2019s testimony; (2) whether the testimony was cumulative, corroborated, or contradicted; and (3) the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. <em>See Sherman v. Scott, </em>62 F.3d 136, 142 n. 6 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-15\">McDaniel testified that Hernandez grabbed his weapon and leveled it at his chest. McDaniel\u2019s testimony was corroborated by that of bail bondsman Dan Cook. McDaniel\u2019s testimony also was corroborated, in part, by the testimony of Hernandez\u2019s wife. Given the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case, Hernandez has not shown that the offending testimony has a substantial and injurious effect in determining the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See Brecht, </em>507 U.S. at 623, 113 S.Ct. 1710. Moreover, the jury is presumed to have followed the trial court\u2019s instruction not to consider the offending testimony. <em>See Galvan v. Cockrell, </em>293 F.3d 760, 766 (5th Cir.2002). Accordingly, we conclude that the denial of the motion for a mistrial did not violate Hernandez\u2019s right to due process, and we affirm the denial of Hernandez\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b567-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
