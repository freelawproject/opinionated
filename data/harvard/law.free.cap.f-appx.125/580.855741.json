Knight appeals from the district court\u2019s judgment affirming the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s decision denying disability insurance benefits (\u201cDIB\u201d) and Supplemental Security Income (\u201cSSI\u201d). The Commissioner concluded that she was disabled as of August 12, 1997, but, because Knight\u2019s was \u201clast insured\u201d on June 30, 1996, she was not entitled to benefits. <em>See Loza v. Apfel, </em>219 F.3d 378, 394 (5th Cir.2000). On September 14, 1995, the Commissioner had denied Knight\u2019s first application for DIB and SSI, wherein she had alleged a disability-onset date of October 1, 1995. Although in the instant case Knight again asserted that her disability-onset date was October 1, 1992, the Commissioner ruled that the first administrative decision was res judicata as to the period before and including September 14, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-21\">For the first time on appeal, Knight argues that the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) erred in concluding that the prior administrative decision was res judicata as to the period before and including September 14, 1995. Arguments raised for the first time on appeal are not reviewed absent \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d <em>see Castillo v. Barnhart, </em>325 F.3d 550, 553 (5th Cir.2003), which Knight has not alleged. In any event, absent a \u201ccolorable constitutional claim,\u201d an ALJ\u2019s dismissal of a claimant\u2019s case on res judicata grounds is \u201cunreviewable.\u201d <em>Brandyburg v. Sullivan, </em>959 F.2d 555, 561 (5th Cir.1992). Knight has not asserted a colorable constitutional claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-22\">Knight also argues that the ALJ failed to follow several Social Security rulings and \u201cestablished Social Security law,\u201d that the decision was not supported by substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>tial evidence, that the ALJ erroneously assessed her credibility, and that the ALJ arbitrarily determined that she was disabled as of August 12, 1997, when the record reflected that her condition was no different on that date than the date before. After reviewing the briefs and the record, we conclude that the ALJ applied the correct legal standards and that the decision was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Greenspan v. Shalala, </em>38 F.3d 232, 237 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Knight\u2019s October 18, 2004, \u201cMotion to Submit Additional Excerpts\u201d is DENIED as unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b618-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
