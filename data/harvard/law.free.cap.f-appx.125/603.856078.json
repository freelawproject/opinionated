Wiley asks that the defendants, employees of the C.T. Terrell Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice\u2014Institutional Division, be ordered to provide him with access to a handicapped shower facility until completion of his civil action. Because Wiley is no longer incarcerated at the C.T. Terrell Unit, his claim for injunctive relief is moot. <em>See Cooper v. Sheriff, Lubbock County, Tex., </em>929 F.2d 1078, 1084 (5th Cir.1991); <em>Bailey v. Southerland, </em>821 F.2d 277, 279 (5th Cir.1987). Consequently, the order of the district court denying Wiley\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-22\">Wiley also contends that the district court erred in denying relief on his civil rights claims. The district court has not yet addressed the merits of these claims, and we therefore need not consider these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-23\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b641-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
