We have reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs and the joint appendix and find no reversible error. We agree with Bongam that his testimony was subject to more than one interpretation and, therefore, that judgment as a matter of law based upon contributory negligence was not appropriate. <em>Ocheltree v. Scollon Prods., Inc., </em>335 F.3d 325, 331 (4th Cir.2003) (en banc) (\u201cJudgment as a matter of law is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>proper only if \u2018there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)), <em>cert. denied, </em>540 U.S. 1177, 124 S.Ct. 1406, 158 L.Ed.2d 77 (2004). We nevertheless affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on alternative grounds. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>395 F.3d 516, 518-19 (4th Cir.2005) (\u2018We are not limited to evaluation of the grounds offered by the district court to support its decision, but may affirm on any grounds apparent from the record.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Our review of the trial testimony leads us to conclude that, had the jury considered the testimony relating to Bongam\u2019s claim of negligence, the jury could have drawn only one reasonable conclusion\u2014 that Bongam faded to establish a prima facie case of negligence. <em>See Horridge v. St. Mary\u2019s County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>382 Md. 170, 854 A.2d 1232, 1238 (2004) (discussing prima facie case); <em>Moulden v. Greenbelt Consumer Servs., Inc., </em>239 Md. 229, 210 A.2d 724, 725-26 (1965). Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
