Rahim appeals the district court\u2019s affirmance of the Commissioner\u2019s denial of his claim for Supplemental Secu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>rity Income benefits. Rahim contends that the Commissioner erred by finding (1) that he was not disabled during the relevant period and (2) that such a finding is improper without the Commissioner\u2019s discussing in the written decision six evidentiary factors set forth in <em>Loza v. Apfel, </em>219 F.3d 378 (5th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Based on our review of the record, we conclude that the Commissioner\u2019s decision regarding Rahim\u2019s complaints of pain and the severity of his impairments is supported by substantial evidence. The record also shows that the Administrative Law Judge fully developed the record and considered all of the medical evidence under the appropriate standard before rendering his decision, which the Commissioner adopted. <em>See Stone v. Heckler, </em>752 F.2d 1099, 1101 (5th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b562-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
