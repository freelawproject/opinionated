Evans contends that amendment 505 to the Sentencing Guidelines should be applied retroactively to reduce his sentence; that his offense level should be reduced because the relevant sentencing facts were not alleged in his indictment or proved to the jury; and that the adjustment to his offense level for his role in the offense should be invalidated pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Evans\u2019s motion for leave to file a supplemental brief to raise his <em>Booker </em>contention is GRANTED. The Government moves for the dismissal of Evans\u2019s appeal as frivolous; the Government\u2019s motion is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-27\">Evans\u2019s contention regarding amendment 505 previously has been decided adversely to him; the previous determinations of the district court and of this court stand as the law of the case. <em>See United States v. Becerra, </em>155 F.3d 740, 752-53 (5th Cir.1998). Evans\u2019s remaining contentions are outside the scope of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-28\">Although we deny the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal as frivolous, we note that Evans has filed five unsuccessful 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions raising amendment 505, and he has pursued relief from sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 on three occasions. Evans is warned that future challenges to his sentence\u2014whether those challenges are governed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241 and 2255, or any other statutory provision\u2014will invite the imposition of sanctions against him. Those sanctions could include a monetary penalty and/or limitations on Evans\u2019s ability to challenge his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-29\">All other pending motions are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-30\">AFFIRMED. SANCTIONS WARNING IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b607-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion <em>should not be </em>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
