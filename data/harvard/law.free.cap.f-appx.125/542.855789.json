Lucas was granted a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the sole issue: whether in his convictions in Cause Nos. 78994, 78996, and 78997, the lack of an admonishment regarding the 25-year minimum sentence, which is applicable in the case of a defendant with two previous felony convictions, violated Lucas\u2019s constitutional rights and resulted in the entry of involuntary and unknowing pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Lucas contends that at his plea hearings, the trial court informed him that the minimum applicable sentences in Cause Nos. 78994 and 78997 were five years of imprisonment and that in Cause No. 78996, the minimum applicable sentence was two years of imprisonment. Lucas asserts that, because he admitted to previous convictions, he was subject to the 25-year minimum sentence provided in Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 12.42(d) (West 1997, 1998). Lucas contends that the trial court\u2019s erroneous admonishments prevented him from understanding the consequences of his pleas, led him to believe that he remained eligible for probation, and caused him to enter involuntary and unknowing guilty pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The record shows that Lucas was sentenced as a repeat felony offender pursuant to the provisions of Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 12.42(a)(8), (b) (West 1997,1998) and not as an habitual offender under Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 12.42(d) (West 1997, 1998). The sentencing ranges for his convictions in Cause Nos. 78994 and 78997 for burglary of a habitation were increased pursuant to Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 12.42(b) (West 1997, 1998) from the range that is applicable to second-degree felonies, <em>ie., </em>two to twenty years of imprisonment, to the range that applies to first-degree felonies, <em>ie., </em>five to 99 years of imprisonment or life. Tex. Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 12.32, 12.33 (Vernon 1997). The sentencing range for Lucas\u2019s conviction for attempted burglary of a habitation in Cause No. 78996 was increased pursuant to Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 12.42(a)(3) (West 1997, 1998) from the range that is applicable to a third-degree felony, <em>ie., </em>two to ten years of imprisonment, to the range that applies to a second-degree felony, <em>ie., </em>two to twenty years of imprisonment. <em>See </em>Tex. Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 12.33, 12.34, 12.42(a)(3) (Vernon 1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Lucas concedes that the trial court informed him of the five-year minimum sentences in Cause Nos. 78994 and 78997 and of the two-year minimum sentence in Cause No. 78996. The record supports the factual determination that Lucas was sentenced as a repeat felony offender. Determinations of factual issues made by a State court \u201cshall be presumed to be correct.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1). Lucas has not rebutted this presumption of correctness. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b580-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.,5 the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
