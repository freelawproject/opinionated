Buggs argues that her sentence is illegal in view of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Because Buggs did not raise this issue in the district court, review is limited to plain error. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002). After the district court sentenced Buggs, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), applying its Sixth Amendment holding in <em>Blakely </em>to the United States Sentencing Guidelines. The Supreme Court held that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Even if there was <em>Booker </em>error, however, Buggs cannot show plain error. Because Buggs\u2019s sentence was based on the 12.5 grams of cocaine base that, as part of her plea agreement, she admitted distributing, Buggs cannot demonstrate that her sentence would likely have been different if the judge had sentenced her under the <em>Booker </em>advisory regime. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 515 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>No. 04-9517 (U.S. Mar. 31, 2005). Therefore, Buggs\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b637-43\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
