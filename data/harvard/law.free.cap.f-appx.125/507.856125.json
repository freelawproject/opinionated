To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for relief, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable fact-finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude Takou fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief that he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-19\">Additionally, we uphold the immigration judge\u2019s denial of Takou\u2019s request for withholding of removal. \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum\u2014even though the facts that must be proved are the same\u2014an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004). Because Takou fails to show he is eligible for asylum, he cannot meet the higher standard for withholding of removal. Because Takou did not specifically challenge on appeal to the Board the denial of relief under the Convention Against Torture, review of that claim is waived. <em>Gonahasa v. INS, </em>181 F.3d 538, 544 (4th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-20\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We grant the Government\u2019s motion to strike pages 264-296 of Takou\u2019s brief. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-21\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
