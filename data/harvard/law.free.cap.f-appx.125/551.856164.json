On remand, the district court again dismissed Vineyard\u2019s petition as time-barred, concluding that Vineyard had failed to produce \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that he was \u201cdeliberately or negligently informed by his [retained counsel Lance] Hall that\u201d a petition for discretionary review (\u201cPDR\u201d) was still pending in the Texas Court of Crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>nal Appeals, on direct appeal of Vineyard\u2019s 1994 conviction of possession of child pornography, or that Hall had misinformed Vineyard that he was working on Vineyard\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. For the second time, we have granted Vineyard a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the issue whether he was entitled to equitable tolling of the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">Vineyard has not denied that his conviction became \u201cfinal\u201d for purposes of the limitations provision on March 9, 1999, upon the expiration of the time for filing a petition for writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court, following the December 9, 1998, refusal of his PDR by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals. <em>See Flanagan v. Johnson, </em>154 F.3d 196, 197 (5th Cir.1998). Absent equitable tolling, Vineyard\u2019s petition was due on March 9, 2000. Vineyard has consistently argued, however, that he was entitled to equitable tolling of the period, based on the following allegations: Throughout 1999 and early 2000, Vineyard\u2019s retained counsel, Hall, falsely led him to believe that his PDR was still pending and told Vineyard that he should \u201cwait\u201d; Vineyard did not learn of the PDR\u2019s denial until June 9, 2000, when a deputy sheriff arrested him and caused him to be returned to prison; and Hall subsequently assured Vineyard and Vineyard\u2019s sister that he would file a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition on Vineyard\u2019s behalf, but failed to do so. Vineyard has alleged that he diligently filed his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition pro se in 2001, within weeks after learning that Hall had only \u201ccompleted\u201d such a petition but not filed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">As we observed in our earlier opinion remanding this case, an attorney\u2019s misrepresentations may be grounds for equitable tolling. <em>See United States v. Wynn, </em>292 F.3d 226, 230 (5th Cir.2002). In <em>Wynn, </em>a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 movant alleged that: Wynn\u2019s appellate attorney had told him on January 6, 1999, that he would file a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion on his behalf; the attorney told Wynn in May 1999 that he had filed the motion; in October 1999, Wynn wrote a letter to the clerk of court inquiring about the status of his \u00a7 2255 motion and was told that it was not on file; and, when Wynn\u2019s father asked the attorney about this matter, the attorney stated that he had filed the \u00a7 2255 motion directly with the district judge, that he was waiting for a response, and that \u201c \u2018we must be patient.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228-29. We held that an allegation by a movant \u201cthat he was deceived by his attorney into believing that a timely \u00a7 2255 motion had been filed on his behalf presents a \u2018rare and extraordinary circumstance\u2019 beyond [movant\u2019s] control that could warrant equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 230. Accordingly, we remanded to the district court \u201cfor a hearing on these issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">In our prior opinion in the instant case, we observed that Vineyard had asserted under penalty of perjury that on specific dates during the limitations period, Hall deliberately or negligently misinformed him that his PDR was still pending. We also noted that Vineyard had also presented affidavit and documentary evidence that Hall subsequently misled him and his sister to believe that Hall was going to prepare and file a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition, further delaying Vineyard\u2019s filing of a pro se petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">On remand, the district court solicited an affidavit from attorney Hall, who attested that he timely notified Vineyard of the denial of the PDR \u201cshortly after [he] received notice that was mailed ... on December 9, 1998.\u201d Hall also attested that he never told Vineyard he was working on a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition on his behalf. This affidavit contradicted the unsworn declaration and affidavits that Vineyard had already filed. The district court, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>ever, concluded that Vineyard had failed to produce \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that he was misled by Hall that his PDR was still pending in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals or that Hall was working on a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Vineyard\u2019s unsworn declaration under penalty of perjury was competent sworn testimony under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746, and it carried the same \u201cforce and effect\u201d as an affidavit. <em>See Hart v. Hairston, </em>343 F.3d 762, 764 n. 1 (5th Cir.2003). Moreover, the district court never explicitly discredited the affidavit filed by Vineyard\u2019s sister, other than to observe in a footnote that it had been handwritten by Vineyard and that copies of letters on which the affidavit was purportedly based had not been produced by Vineyard. \u201cWhen the issue is one of credibility, resolution on the basis of affidavits can rarely be conclusive.\u201d <em>See </em>Rule 7, Rules Governing Section 2254 Proceedings, Advisory Committee Notes; <em>see also Jordan v. Estelle, </em>594 F.2d 144, 145-46 (5th Cir.1979) (\u201cAlthough a habeas petition may be decided on the basis of affidavits, contested facts ordinarily may not be decided on the basis of affidavits alone[.]\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Noting that Vineyard was incarcerated in December 1998 and January 1999, at the time the PDR was issued, the district court also emphasized that, although Vineyard had submitted copies of correspondence from prison officials \u201cindicating that, according to the prison mail log, he did not receive correspondence from January 15, 1999, to February 18, 1999, no evidence was submitted to support his claim that he did not receive mail from December 9, 1998, to January 14, 1999.\u201d As suggested above, Vineyard\u2019s unsworn declarations <em>were </em>evidence that he did not receive notification of the denial of the PDR until 2000. In any event, Vineyard submitted additional correspondence from prison officials showing that officials refused to provide him with any other information about his prison mail logs.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">The district court also cited a several decisions to support an implication that, even if Vineyard\u2019s equitable-tolling allegations were true, he would not be entitled to equitable tolling. For instance, the district court cited <em>Turner v. Johnson, </em>177 F.3d 390, 392 (5th Cir.1999), for the proposition that a lack of representation during the limitations period did not warrant equitable tolling; <em>Fierro v. Cockrell, </em>294 F.3d 674, 683 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>538 U.S. 947, 123 S.Ct. 1621, 155 L.Ed.2d 489 (2003), for the notion that an attorney\u2019s erroneous interpretation of the limitations provision was not an excuse for timely filing a \u00a7 2254 petition; <em>Cousin v. Lensing, </em>310 F.3d 843, 849 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>539 U.S. 918, 123 S.Ct. 2277, 156 L.Ed.2d 136 (2003), for the proposition that \u201cmere attorney error or neglect\u201d is not an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d warranting equitable tolling; and <em>Moore v. Cockrell, </em>313 F.3d 880 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>538 U.S. 969, 123 S.Ct. 1768, 155 L.Ed.2d 526 (2003), for the holding that an attorney\u2019s delay in notifying a petitioner of the result of his direct appeal did not warrant equitable tolling. All of these decisions are distinguishable from the circumstances alleged by Vineyard, who has asserted that Hall <em>affirmatively misinformed </em>him that his PDR was still pending and thus caused him to refrain from taking matters into his own hands. <em>Wynn, </em>which involved similar allegations to Vineyard\u2019s, still appears to be the most apposite decision from this circuit. <em>See Wynn, </em>292 F.3d at 228-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-11\">\u201cPrior to the enactment of the AEDPA, we consistently held that when there is a factual dispute which[,] if resolved in the petitioner\u2019s favor, would entitle [the petitioner] to relief and the state has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>afforded the petitioner a full and fair hearing, a federal habeas corpus petitioner is entitled to discovery and an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>Clark v. Johnson, </em>202 F.3d 760, 766 (5th Cir.2000) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). This is essentially the standard set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Townsend v. Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293, 312, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963), and cited in the Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 8 of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Proceedings. As amended by the AEDPA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(e)(2) now states that, \u201c[i]f the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in State court proceedings,\u201d a federal habeas court shall hold an evidentiary hearing only in very limited circumstances. Section 2244(e)(2), however, does not appear to address scenarios like the one in the instant case, in which the factual dispute concerns not a substantive constitutional claim but the federal court\u2019s application of a nonconstitutional rule. <em>See Cristin v. Brennan, </em>281 F.3d 404, 412-13 (3d Cir. 2002) (holding that \u00a7 2254(e) does not apply to issue of propriety of evidentiary hearing \u201con excuses for procedural default\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">Based on the foregoing, we again VACATE the district court\u2019s dismissal and REMAND the case for further findings of fact relevant to Hall\u2019s alleged misrepresentations and the reasonableness of Vineyard\u2019s reliance upon them with regard to equitable tolling of the one-year limitation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b589-17\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
