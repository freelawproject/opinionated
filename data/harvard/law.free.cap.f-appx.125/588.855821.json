Irvine does not dispute that he has failed to comply with the requirements of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), but he argues that the dismissal of his complaint with prejudice for purposes of proceeding in forma pauperis violates his right of access to the courts. Irvine also challenges the district court\u2019s decision to sever and transfer his claims against defendants employed at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Wynne Unit to the Southern District of Texas, which is where those claims arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">We find no error in the dismissal of claims for failure to exhaust prison administrative remedies. <em>Porter v. Nussle, </em>534 U.S. 516, 532, 122 S.Ct. 983, 152 L.Ed.2d 12 (2002); <em>Booth v. Churner, </em>532 U.S. 731, 741, 121 S.Ct. 1819, 149 L.Ed.2d 958 (2001). The dismissal will have no effect on Irvine\u2019s ability to bring a paid complaint raising the same allegations. <em>Underwood v. Wilson, </em>151 F.3d 292, 296 (5th Cir.1998). The decision to sever and transfer certain of Irvine\u2019s claims was within the district court\u2019s broad discretion. <em>Mills v. Beech Aircraft Corp., </em>886 F.2d 758, 761 (5th Cir.1989); <em>Williams v. Hoyt, </em>556 F.2d 1336, 1341 (5th Cir.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b627-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
