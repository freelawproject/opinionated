Rivera\u2019s motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) is also GRANTED. Rivera\u2019s motion for certification of a question to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals or, in the alternative, for an order for the respondent to produce the state-court record or, in the alternative, for supplementation of the record on appeal is DENIED. Rivera challenges his state-court murder conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-21\">Rivera alleges that he filed his state habeas application in November 2003, and not on January 14, 2004, as he acknowledges he alleged in the district court, and he contends that his state habeas application was timely to toll the limitations period and render his federal habeas application timely. A COA may issue only if Rivera makes \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). \u201cThe COA determination under \u00a7 2253(c) requires an overview of the claims in the habeas petition and a general assessment of their merits.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). Because his habeas application was dismissed on procedural grounds, Rivera also must demonstrate \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">The record indicates that Rivera\u2019s state habeas application was received and filed in the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals on January 14, 2004. However, the date that the application was filed in the court of conviction is unclear from the record. <em>See </em>TexCode Crim. P. Ann. art. 11.07 \u00a7 3(b)(Vernon supp.2004). We therefore cannot determine whether or not Rivera\u2019s federal habeas application was time-barred. It is conceivable that Rivera filed his state habeas application in time to toll the one-year limitations period of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1) and render his federal habeas corpus application timely. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). We therefore grant Rivera\u2019s COA motion, vacate the order dismissing his habeas application, and remand the case for further proceedings in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">COA GRANTED; IFP GRANTED; MOTION TO CERTIFY QUESTION, ORDER PRODUCTION OF RECORD, OR SUPPLEMENT RECORD DENIED. VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b565-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
