In his petition for review, Oyibo challenges the immigration judge\u2019s determination that he failed to establish his eligibility for asylum. To obtain reversal of a determination denying eligibility for asylum, an alien \u201cmust show that the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u201d <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We have reviewed the evidence of record and conclude that Oyibo fails to show that the evidence compels a contrary result. Accordingly, we cannot grant the relief he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-19\">Nor can Oyibo show that he is entitled to withholding of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3) (2000). \u201cBecause the burden of proof for withholding of removal is higher than for asylum\u2014even though the facts that must be proved are the same\u2014an applicant who is ineligible for asylum is necessarily ineligible for withholding of removal under [8 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1231(b)(3).\u201d <em>Camara v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 361, 367 (4th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-20\">Oyibo next contends that the immigration judge erred in denying his claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture. We have reviewed the administrative record and conclude that Oyibo did not exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to this claim because he did not present it in his appeal to the Board. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (2000); <em>Asika v. Ashcroft, </em>362 F.3d 264, 267 n. 3 (4th Cir. 2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 861, 160 L.Ed.2d 769 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-23\">Accordingly, we deny Oyibo\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-24\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
