Rios contends that federal officials subsequently mishandled his mail and legal materials, thereby hindering his refiling of a proper complaint. Rios seeks a remand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>and an opportunity to file an amended complaint. However, he fails to identify any specific defendant or violation of a constitutional right in connection with the dismissed action. He thus has identified no error in the district court\u2019s dismissal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), 1915A(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b642-32\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
