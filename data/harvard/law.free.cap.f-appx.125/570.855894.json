The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants, dismissing Ms. Stanton\u2019s claims. Ms. Stanton now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>drawing all inferences in favor of the nonmoving party. <em>Fraire v. Arlington, </em>957 F.2d 1268, 1273 (5th Cir.1992). In order to prevail on a \u00a7 1983 claim based on the alleged failure of law enforcement officials to prevent the suicide of a pretrial detainee, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the officials acted with deliberate indifference to the detainee\u2019s needs. <em>Flores v. County of Hardeman, </em>124 F.3d 736, 738 (5th Cir. 1997). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Ms. Stanton, we con-elude that the actions of Deputies Hokett and Voisin did not rise to the level of deliberate indifference. It follows that Harris County cannot be liable. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b609-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
