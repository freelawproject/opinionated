Turner alleged that the defendants failed to protect him from an attack by a fellow inmate.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-17\">By moving to proceed IFP, Turner is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal was not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(3). Our review of the record indicates that Turner\u2019s allegations state a failure-to-protect claim under the Eighth Amendment. <em>See Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 842, 838, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Whether the facts ultimately will prove a failure-to-protect claim is not a question to be answered at this stage of the proceedings. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-18\">Accordingly, the motion to proceed IFP is GRANTED. The judgment and certification decision are VACATED. The case is REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b613-15\"> Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
