Knight\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating there were no meritorious grounds for appeal, but suggesting the district court abused its discretion in sentencing Knight. Although informed of his right to do so, Knight has not filed a supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-23\">We review a district court\u2019s order imposing a sentence after revocation of supervised release for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995). Moreover, because Knight\u2019s sentence does not exceed the maximum under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (2000), we review the sentence to determine only whether it is plainly unreasonable. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4) (2000). Upon review of the record, we conclude Knight\u2019s sentence is not plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-24\">In accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm Knight\u2019s sentence. This court requires counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
