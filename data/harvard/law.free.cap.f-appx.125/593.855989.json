Alexander does not challenge the district court\u2019s determination that his motion for a new trial was not filed timely. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-19\">We apply less stringent standards to parties proceeding pro se than to parties represented by counsel, and we liberally construe the briefs of pro se litigants; however, pro se parties must still brief the issues and reasonably comply with the requirements of Fed. R.App. P. 28. <em>Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995). When an appellant fails to identify any error in the district court\u2019s analysis, it is the same as if the appellant had not appealed that judgment. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). \u201cFed. R.App. P. 28(a)[ (9)(A) ] requires that the appellant\u2019s argument contain the reasons he deserves the requested relief with citation to the authorities, statutes and parts of the record relied on.\u201d <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-22\">Because Alexander does not address the district court\u2019s reason for denying his new trial motion, he has abandoned the only issue on appeal. <em>Brinkmann, </em>813 F.2d at 748. Alexander\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and, therefore, is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Alexander is warned that further frivolous filings in this court will subject him to sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-23\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b631-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
