Rahim contends that the district court erred when it denied him an evidentiary hearing and presumed the state habeas judge\u2019s factual findings to be correct. Ra-him has not shown that the district court erred in applying the presumption of correctness. <em>See Valdez v. Cockrell, </em>274 F.3d 941, 949-51 (5th Cir.2001). As the district court properly applied a presumption of correctness to the state habeas judge\u2019s factual findings, Rahim has failed to show that the district court abused its discretion in denying an evidentiary hearing. <em>Murphy v. Johnson, </em>205 F.3d 809, 815 (5th Cir.2000); <em>McDonald v. Johnson, </em>139 F.3d 1056, 1059-60 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-24\">Rahim also contends that the state habeas judge\u2019s factual findings were an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented. Rahim has failed to show that the district court erred in concluding that the state habeas judge\u2019s factual findings based on his credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>determinations were reasonable in light of the evidence presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Last, Rahim argues that the state appellate court\u2019s determination that the admission of a non-testifying co-defendant\u2019s confession was harmless error was an unreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court precedent. Rahim has failed to show that the district court erred in concluding that the state appellate court\u2019s analysis of the evidence and application of the Supreme Court\u2019s harmless eiTor standard was objectively reasonable. <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). Moreover, the admission of the confession did not have a substantial and injurious effect or influence on the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993). The judgment of the district court is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b568-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
