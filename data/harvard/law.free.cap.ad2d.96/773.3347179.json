The only issue which divides us is whether respondent was properly served with a notice of the time and place of the arbitration hearing. We affirm, since this record is barren of any competent evidence that respondent changed its address from the second floor, Klongton House, 982 Sukhumvit Soi 71, Bangkok, Thailand, to 956 Sukhumvit 71 (Prakanong-Klongton) on November 17, 1981, or that Mr. Sudjai Limwathanagura, upon whom personal service was effected by hand delivery to someone in his office, did not return to his office until June 9,1982, as contended. These allegations appear in an \u201cAnswering Affidavit\u201d by an associate in respondent\u2019s law firm, who obviously has no personal knowledge and makes no pretense that she does. They also appear in an unverified six-page document denominated \u201cCross-Motion for Order to Vacate Arbitration Award.\u201d While there is a so-called verification in the record, it is worthless. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>is executed by one Narumol Limwathanagura, allegedly an authorized director of respondent, and purports to verify an \u201cAnswer to the Order to show cause, and the Petition for Order to vacate\u201d, of which there is neither in this record. Interestingly enough, Mr. Sudjai Limwathanagura, the peripatetic director \u2014 whose good fortune it was to be away until June 9, two days after the arbitration hearing, and presumably a relative of Miss Narumol Limwathanagura \u2014 did not execute the verification or submit an affidavit. Respondent\u2019s claim of lack of notice of the time and place of the arbitration hearing should be considered in light of its past performance in these proceedings \u2014 it failed to respond to the notice of intent to arbitrate (sent to No. 982 Sukhumvit 71 on July 29, 1981, where, concededly, respondent did business at the time), and it subsequently defaulted on the petition to compel arbitration (again the papers were sent to No. 982 Sukhumvit 71 at a time before respondent allegedly moved).

J., and Silverman, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AbG\">dissent in a memorandum by Silverman, J., as follows: We think enough has been shown to warrant a hearing as to whether the required notice of the arbitration hearing (CPLR 7506, subd [b]) was properly addressed to respondent, and if it was not, as to whether respondent in fact received notice of the arbitration hearing in time to do anything about it, and we would remand for a hearing on that issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
