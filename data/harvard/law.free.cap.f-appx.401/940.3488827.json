He argues that the presumption of reasonableness does not apply to his \u2022within-guidelines sentence because the illegal reentry guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is not supported by empirical data. Vasquez also argues that the sentence is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He contends that the sentence fails to account for the remoteness of his most serious offenses, fails to account for his lost opportunity to serve his state and federal sentences concurrently, and overstates the seriousness of his illegal reentry offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-18\">As Vasquez concedes, his argument that the presumption of reasonableness does not apply because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically-based is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009), and <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338-39 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-21\">Vasquez\u2019s substantive reasonableness argument is likewise unavailing. Vasquez\u2019s arguments fail to overcome the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See Duarte, </em>569 F.3d at 529-31. Vasquez\u2019s argument that the mitigating factors presented for the district court\u2019s consideration at sentencing should have been balanced differently is insufficient to disturb the presumption. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b969-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b969-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
