We granted a certificate of appealability on the issue of \u201c[w]hether the district court erred when it failed to address Gibson\u2019s argument that counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate his parole, probation, or supervised release status at the time of the instant offense, in violation of <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925, 936 (11th Cir.1992).\u201d On appeal, the government concedes Gibson\u2019s argument that the district court did not specifically address his claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate the status of his state-court sentence at the time of his instant federal offense. After careful review, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">On appeal from the denial of relief under \u00a7 2255, we review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and questions of law <em>de novo. Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">Expressing \u201cdeep concern over the piecemeal litigation of federal habeas petitions,\u201d we have exercised our supervisory authority over district courts and instructed them to resolve all claims raised in habeas petitions, whether habeas relief is granted or denied. <em>Clisby, </em>960 F.2d at 935-36 (involving a petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254). A \u201cclaim for relief\u2019 is defined as \u201cany allegation of a constitutional violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 936. When a district court fails to address all of the claims in a habeas petition, we \u201cwill vacate the district court\u2019s judgment without prejudice and remand the case for consideration of all remaining claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 938. We have also held that district courts must resolve all claims for relief raised in \u00a7 2255 motions, in compliance with <em>Clisby, </em>because the legal principles applicable to \u00a7 2254 proceedings generally apply to \u00a7 2255 motions to vacate. <em>Rhode v. United States, </em>583 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-12\">As the government concedes, the district court did not specifically address Gibson\u2019s claim that his counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate the status of his state-court sentence at the time of his instant federal offense. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s dismissal of Gibson\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion without prejudice, and remand for consideration of his failure-to-investigate claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-13\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
