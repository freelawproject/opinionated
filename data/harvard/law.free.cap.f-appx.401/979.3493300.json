Fisher, </em>22 F.3d 574, 576 (5th Cir.1994). As a three-time felony drug offender, Fisher was sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment. <em>See id.; </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Fisher\u2019s conviction and sentence were affirmed by us in 1994. <em>See Fisher, </em>22 F.3d at 576-80. Fisher has been unsuccessful in seeking relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-21\">Fisher filed a petition for a writ of audita querela in the district court challenging the legality of his sentence in light of <em>Burgess v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 124, 129, 128 S.Ct. 1572, 170 L.Ed.2d 478 (2008). The district court found that relief pursuant to a writ of audita querela was not available because Fisher had recourse under \u00a7 2255. The district court denied and dismissed Fisher\u2019s petition on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1007-22\">Fisher contends in this appeal that he should be permitted to assert his <em>Burgess </em>claim via a petition for a writ of audita querela because <em>Burgess </em>was decided after he was sentenced and had the effect of lowering his sentence. Although the writ of audita querela \u201cpermits a defendant to obtain relief against a judgment because of some legal defense arising after the judgment,\u201d <em>United States v. Banda, </em>1 F.3d 354, 355 (5th Cir.1993), a prisoner may not seek a writ of audita querela if he \u201cmay seek redress under \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The fact that a prisoner cannot meet the requirements for bringing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion does not render the \u00a7 2255 remedy unavailable. <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 878 (5th Cir.2000). Because Fisher\u2019s remedy is under \u00a7 2255 and he has not obtained leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"980\">*980</page-number>to file a successive \u00a7 2255 motion, the district court did not err in dismissing his petition. The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-4\">We have previously warned Fisher that he would face sanctions, including monetary sanctions and denial of access to the judicial system, if he continued to file unauthorized or frivolous challenges to his conviction and sentence. <em>See United States v. Fisher, </em>202 Fed.Appx. 834 (5th Cir.2006). We have also sanctioned Fisher $250 for failing to heed our warnings. <em>See United States v. Fisher, </em>No. 07-10161 (5th Cir. Dec. 11, 2007). Because Fisher continues to ignore our warnings, Fisher is ORDERED to pay a monetary sanction in the amount of $500, payable to the clerk of this court. Fisher is BARRED from filing in this court or in any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction any pleadings that challenge the aforementioned conviction and sentence until the sanction is paid in full. If Fisher attempts to file such pleadings in this court without proof of satisfaction of this sanction, the clerk will docket them for administrative purposes only. Any such submissions which do not show proof that the sanction has been paid will be neither addressed nor acknowledged. Fisher is further CAUTIONED that any future frivolous or repetitive filings in this court or any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction will subject him to additional sanctions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1007-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
