He claimed that he had been falsely arrested and prosecuted in Florida for grand theft of assets of his deceased common-law wife. He claimed that his Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated when the state failed to recognize his Georgia common-law marriage. The district court dismissed Bisso\u2019s complaint because (1) the complaint did not explain how or whether defendants acted under the color of state law; (2) to the extent the named lawyers acted under color of state law, they were entitled to immunity; and (3) Bisso\u2019s challenges to his criminal proceedings were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-21\">On appeal, Bisso makes arguments about rulings in his criminal trial and maintains that he and his late wife had a common-law marriage. He also argues that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance and that the district court should have ordered an evidentiary hearing on this issue. But Bisso makes no arguments about the district court\u2019s rulings on his section 1983 complaint: he does not challenge the district court\u2019s conclusions that no defendant acted under color of state law, that the lawyers were immune from suit, or the applicability of the <em>Heck </em>bar. As such, Bisso has abandoned any challenge to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his section 1983 complaint. <em>See Horsley </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number><em>v. Feldt, </em>304 F.3d 1125, 1131 n. 1 (11th Cir.2002) (explaining that issues not argued on appeal are deemed waived by a <em>pro se </em>litigant).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b509-17\">.
