Mancera-Patino has already benefit-ted from one motion to reduce his sentence. He contends that he is entitled to have his sentence reduced further because he continued to substantially assist the government even after he was convicted and sentenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-14\">On August 20, 2008, Mancera-Patino was indicted for one count of possession of methamphetamine with intent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(B)(viii), one count of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i), and one count of possession of a firearm by an illegal alien, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(5) and 924(a)(2). At a hearing on November 25, 2008, he pleaded guilty to all three counts. There was no plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-15\">The Presentence Investigation Report indicated that Mancera-Patino\u2019s total offense level for the counts of drug distribution and possession of a firearm by an illegal alien was 25 and that he had a criminal history category of II. This placed him in a guidelines range of 63-78 months. He was also subject to a consecutive 60-month mandatory minimum sentence on the \u00a7 924(c) conviction. Before the sentence hearing the government filed a motion under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5K1.1 to reduce Mancera-Patino\u2019s sentence based on his substantial assistance. The motion noted that he had assisted with a state prosecution in Whitfield County, Georgia, and it recommended a two-level departure in his offense level for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-16\">At the sentence hearing Mancera-Patino argued that he actually deserved a greater departure because he was also helping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>with an ongoing narcotics investigation in Atlanta. Defense counsel specifically noted that he was making that argument so that Mancera-Patino would get credit for his assistance in both the Whitfield County and Atlanta cases; that way, he would not need to rely on the government to file an additional motion for substantial assistance later. The court accepted that argument and departed four levels instead of two, taking Mancera-Patino\u2019s total offense level on the counts of drug distribution and possession of a firearm by an illegal alien down from 25 to 21, which lowered the guidelines range from 63-78 months to 41-51 months. The court then sentenced him to 41 months on his convictions for drug distribution and possession of a firearm by an illegal alien and 60 months to run consecutively on his conviction for possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime. That made for a total sentence of 101 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">In December 2009 Mancera-Patino filed a <em>pro se </em>motion titled \u201cPetition for a court order compelling the government to submit a Rule 35(b) nunc pro tunc or a petition pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 3553(e) for defendant\u2019s substantial assistance or in the alternative to grant an evidentiary hearing.\u201d He argued that his guilty plea and later cooperation with the government had been motivated by the promises of various law enforcement agents, who had offered him \u201cthe moon and the sky\u201d and had assured him that his federal charges would \u201cdisappear like a puff of smoke\u201d if he helped them. In addition to alleging those clich\u00e9s, he argued that his \u201creasonable understanding\u201d of his guilty plea was that was that the government had agreed to seek an additional reduction of his sentence at a later date. He insisted that his sentence \u201cmust be vacated\u201d because he did not receive \u201cthe benefit of his bargain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">The government\u2019s response contended that Mancera-Patino\u2019s arguments were wholly without merit. First, it observed that the discretion to file a motion for substantial assistance lies wholly with the government. Second, it noted that since there was no plea agreement in Mancera-Patino\u2019s case, his arguments that the government must be bound to its \u201cbargain\u201d and fulfill the terms of its \u201cagreement\u201d were baseless. Third, it pointed out that Mancera-Patino already had received the full benefit of his substantial assistance when the sentencing court granted a four-level downward departure, two levels more than the government itself had recommended. The district court agreed with the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">Now contending that the district court erred in denying his motion, Mancera-Patino raises and expands upon many of those points he first set out in his motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He argues to this Court that his reasonable understanding \u201cof the plea at the Rule 11 colloquy\u201d was that the government would submit another motion to reduce his sentence later on, and when it did not, his \u201cdue process right[s]\u201d were violated because he was denied \u201cthe benefit of the bargain into which he entered.\u201d He also argues that the government has acted \u201cin bad faith\u201d and \u201ccapriciously\u201d by not filing a motion for substantial assistance after sentencing. Finally, he asserts that a brief statement from the prosecutor at the sentence hearing amounted to a plea agreement, which we will recount later.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">As an initial matter, even though Mancera-Patino has styled his motion and brief as seeking to compel a Rule 35(b) <em>or </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>\u00a7 3553(e) motion, only the 35(b) motion is technically possible here. A motion under \u00a7 3553(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence for substantial assistance is filed by the government when a sentence is imposed; Rule 35(b) \u201cprovides the only avenue\u201d for reducing a federal sentence after it has been legally imposed. <em>United States v. Orozco, </em>160 F.3d 1309, 1313 n. 6 (11th Cir.1998). We point out that procedural detail for the sake of clarity, but it does not affect our analysis of the merits because a Rule 35(b) motion is the post-sentencing equivalent of a motion under \u00a7 3553(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1. <em>See United States v. McNeese, </em>547 F.3d 1307, 1308-09 (11th Cir.2008) (applying the Supreme Court\u2019s rationale in <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992), regarding a \u00a7 3553(e) motion to find that the government had discretion to direct a 35(b) motion to a specific count); <em>see also United States v. Aponte, </em>36 F.3d 1050, 1052 (11th Cir.1994) (\u201cGiven that Rule 35(b) and section 3553(e) utilize the same language to achieve the same end, we accord them the same interpretation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Rule 35(b) gives to the government the sole discretion over whether to file a motion for substantial assistance, and both this court and the Supreme Court \u201clong have recognized\u201d that this discretion is \u201cvast.\u201d <em>McNeese, </em>547 F.3d at 1309 (citing <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185, 112 S.Ct. at 1843). As a result, \u201cfederal district courts may review the government\u2019s refusal to file a substantial-assistance motion only if the defendant first makes a \u2018substantial threshold showing\u2019 that the refusal was based upon an unconstitutional motive, such as the defendant\u2019s race or religion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1308 (quoting <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-86, 112 S.Ct. at 1843-44). We have declined to extend the scope of the district court\u2019s inquiry to include arguments that the government acted \u201cin bad faith\u201d in refusing to file a substantial assistance motion. <em>See United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1502 n. 5 (11th Cir.1993); see <em>also United States v. Nealy, </em>232 F.3d 825, 831 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The district court did not err in dismissing Mancera-Patino\u2019s motion. First, he did not allege that the government\u2019s failure to file a Rule 35(b) motion was based on a constitutionally impermissible motive. Instead, he merely alleged that law enforcement officers had made a variety of promises to him that had gone unfulfilled. Even if those allegations were true, they would amount to nothing more than bad faith on the part of the government, and we \u201climit our review of the government\u2019s refusal to file substantial assistance motions to claims of unconstitutional motive.\u201d <em>Nealy, </em>232 F.3d at 831. Second, to the extent Mancera-Patino has alleged the existence of a plea agreement with the government, this allegation is directly contradicted by his own statements during the plea colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\">THE COURT: I want to advise you at this time that plea agreements or plea bargains are permissible in this court and that you, your lawyer, the Government lawyer, defense lawyer, all others who may know anything about any plea agreement or plea bargain in this case are required and compelled to inform the court as to the terms and conditions of any such plea bargain or plea agreement. Now does your willingness to plead guilty in this case result from any written plea agreement or oral plea agreement in your case, other than the fact that you\u2019re pleading guilty to Counts One, Two, and Three of the indictment in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH2f\">MANCERA-PATINO: No, I\u2019m guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjH\">THE COURT: Well, has anybody promised you any light sentence of probation or a concurrent sentence to get you to plead guilty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>MANCERA-PATINO: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Despite these clear denials of the existence of a plea agreement, Mancera-Patino\u2019s brief to this Court makes much of a passing statement from the government at the sentence hearing. After the court granted a four-level downward departure, the government said: \u201cIf the defendant\u2019s further cooperation is needed related to any other ongoing investigation, we\u2019ll be back before the [c]ourt to revisit it at that point.\u201d In addition to the fact that this statement preserved the government\u2019s discretion about whether to seek a sentence reduction under Rule 35(b), it also was made <em>after </em>Mancera-Patino had already pleaded guilty, so it cannot possibly have induced the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Finally, we briefly address the district court\u2019s denial of Mancera-Patino\u2019s motion for an evidentiary hearing on the government\u2019s decision not to file a Rule 35(b) motion. A defendant\u2019s mere allegations of having provided substantial assistance to the government \u201cwill not entitle a defendant to a remedy or even to discovery or an evidentiary hearing.\u201d <em>Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 186, 112 S.Ct. at 1844. We have held that \u201cjudicial review is appropriate only \u2018when there is an allegation <em>and </em>a substantial showing that the prosecution refused to file a substantial assistance motion because of a constitutionally impermissible motivation.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Dorsey, </em>554 F.3d 958, 961 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Forney, </em>9 F.3d at 1502). Because Mancera-Patino has not even alleged an unconstitutional motive, let alone made a substantial showing of one, the district court did not err by refusing to grant an evidentiary hearing on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b517-6\">. We have clarified and summarized the essential arguments of Mancera-Patino\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief, consistent with our obligation to construe these briefs \"liberally.\u201d <em>McBride v.
