We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See Allah v. Seiverling, </em>229 F.3d 220, 223 (3d Cir.2000). For the reasons detailed below, we will uphold the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Burton\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">Because we write for the parties, we will forgo a lengthy recitation of the facts. In his complaint, Burton claimed that Kenny Smith, a correctional officer at Sussex, \u201copened [Burton\u2019s] cell door for Jeffrey Kindle [a fellow inmate] to enter [Burton\u2019s] room and attack [him] with a master lock inside of a sock.\u201d Compl. at 4. Burton alleged that in this attack he sustained injuries to his face and body, and subsequently experienced lingering headaches.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-16\">After filing an unsuccessful grievance with Sussex, Burton initiated this federal action. Burton named Kindle, Smith, and Michael Deloy, the warden of Sussex, as defendants, and requested compensation for his pain and suffering, protection from dangerous inmates, and transfer to another facility. He also sought leave to proceed <em>informa pauperis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-17\">The District Court granted Burton\u2019s <em>in forma pauperis </em>motion, but then dismissed the complaint <em>sua sponte </em>pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915(e) and 1915A(b). The Court held that Burton could not state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against Kindle, because he failed to allege that Kindle was a state actor, or against Deloy, because he did not allege that Deloy was personally involved in the alleged misconduct. Finally, the Court held that Burton had, at most, alleged that Smith\u2019s conduct was negligent, which was not sufficient to sustain a \u00a7 1983 claim. The Court concluded that any amendment would be futile and thus dismissed the complaint without providing leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-18\">We agree with the District Court\u2019s determination that Burton\u2019s complaint fails to state a claim against any of the three appellees. A \u00a7 1983 claim has two essential elements: (1) the conduct complained of must be \u201ccommitted by a person acting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>under color of state law\u201d; and (2) this conduct must \u201cdeprive[ ] a person of rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States.\u201d <em>Kost v. Kozakiewicz, </em>1 F.3d 176, 184 (3d Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). Kindle, a fellow prisoner, is a private party. While a private party can qualify as a state actor when there \u201cis a sufficiently close nexus\u201d between the state and the private party\u2019s conduct, <em>id., </em>Burton has alleged no such connection here. Burton has thus not stated a viable claim against Kindle.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">We similarly see no error in the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Burton\u2019s allegations failed to state a claim against Deloy. We have consistently held that \u201c[a] defendant in a civil rights action must have personal involvement in the alleged wrongs; liability cannot be predicated solely on the operation of <em>respondeat superior.\u201d Rode v. Dellarciprete, </em>845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir.1988). Burton has not claimed that Deloy was personally involved in the attack that forms the basis of his complaint; he seems to have named Deloy solely based on Deloy\u2019s position as warden at Sussex. This claim therefore also fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">Finally, we agree that Burton has failed to state a claim against Smith. As did the District Court, we construe Burton\u2019s claim as alleging that Smith failed to protect him from Kindle\u2019s attack. We have long recognized the legal viability of such claims. <em>See, e.g., Davidson v. O\u2019Lone, </em>752 F.2d 817, 821 (3d Cir.1984) (en banc). Typically, prisoners raise these claims under the Eighth Amendment\u2019s Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause. <em>See, e.g., Hamilton v. Leavy, </em>117 F.3d 742, 746 (3d Cir.1997). In these circumstances, the legal framework is clear: to establish a failure-to-protect claim, inmates must demonstrate that (1) they are \u201cincarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm\u201d; and (2) the prison official acted with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to their health and safety. <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 834, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">However, Burton is situated differently from the parties who brought the above-cited cases: Burton is a pretrial detainee as opposed to a convicted-and-sentenced prisoner. As a pretrial detainee, Burton\u2019s challenges to the conditions of his confinement must be prosecuted under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as opposed to the Eighth Amendment. <em>See Bell v. Wolfish, </em>441 U.S. 520, 535-36, 99 S.Ct. 1861, 60 L.Ed.2d 447 (1979). Under the Due Process Clause, \u201cthe proper inquiry is whether [the challenged] conditions amount to punishment of the detainee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 535, 99 S.Ct. 1861. Thus, sentenced prisoners are protected from only punishment that is \u201ccruel and unusual,\u201d while pretrial detainees are protected from any punishment. <em>See Hubbard v. Taylor, </em>399 F.3d 150, 166-67 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">\u201cWhile we have not previously addressed the standard governing a pretrial detainee\u2019s failure-to-protect claim, we have stated in dicta that the state of mind requirement for prisoners\u2019 claims \u2014 \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d \u2014 applies also to pretrial detainees\u2019 claims. <em>See Colburn v. Upper Darby Twp., </em>946 F.2d 1017, 1024 (3d Cir. 1991). It is well established that merely negligent misconduct will not give rise to a claim under \u00a7 1983; the state defendant must act with a higher degree of intent. <em>See, e.g., County of Sacramento v. Lewis, </em>523 U.S. 833, 849, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998) (\u201c[Liability for negligently inflicted harm is categorically beneath the threshold of constitutional due process.\u201d). In assessing where on the state-of-mind continuum misconduct must fall to establish a \u00a7 1983 claim, we have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>settled on \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d both in cases involving prisoners, <em>see, e.g., Hamilton, </em>117 F.3d at 746 (failure to protect), and pretrial detainees, <em>see Colburn, </em>946 F.2d at 1024 (detainee suicide). We have similarly adopted that standard when addressing, through a due process prism, a sentenced prisoner\u2019s failure-to-protect claim. <em>See Davidson, </em>752 F.2d at 828. We discern no basis to apply a different standard here.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">This standard is consistent with the dictates of <em>Bell. </em>There, the Supreme Court emphasized that pretrial detainees must be free from \u201cpunishment.\u201d 441 U.S. at 537, 99 S.Ct. 1861. As the Supreme Court has since stressed, \u201c[i]f the pain inflicted is not formally meted out <em>as punishment </em>by the statute or the sentencing judge, some mental element must be attributed to the inflicting officer before it can qualify.\u201d <em>Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 300, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991); <em>see also id. </em>(explaining that \u201cif a guard accidentally stepped on a prisoner\u2019s toe and broke it, this would not be punishment in anything remotely like the accepted meaning of the word\u201d (internal alterations, quotation marks omitted)). The Cqyrt in <em>Bell </em>did not explicate the requisite mental element, presumably because the challenged actions \u2014 for instance, the correctional facility\u2019s replacing the single bunks in many cells with double bunks \u2014 were unquestionably performed intentionally.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, in cases like this one, where pretrial detainees attack not the \u201cgeneral conditions, practices, rules, or restrictions of pretrial confinement,\u201d but instead \u201ca jail official\u2019s episodic acts or omissions,\u201d <em>Hare v. City of Corinth, </em>74 F.3d 633, 643 (5th Cir.1996) (en banc), the official\u2019s mental state requires further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that a pretrial detainee presenting a failure-to-protect claim must plead that the prison official acted with deliberate indifference to the detainee\u2019s health or safety. This conclusion is consistent with the holdings of numerous of our sister circuits. <em>See, e.g., Caiozzo v. Koreman, </em>581 F.3d 63, 71 (2d Cir.2009); <em>Tesch v. County of Green Lake, </em>157 F.3d 465, 475 (7th Cir.1998); <em>Hare, </em>74 F.3d at 645. Here, Burton has failed to allege that Smith behaved with deliberate indifference in unlocking Burton\u2019s cell. The complaint sets forth no facts to suggest that Smith knew that Kindle would attack Burton. Therefore, Burton has failed to plead a cognizable claim under \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">For the reasons given, we perceive no error in the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Burton failed to state a viable claim. We will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b666-5\">. The Court provided a standard to assess whether a prison official intended for a condition to serve as punishment, <em>see Bell, </em>441 U.S. at 538-39, 99 S.Ct. 1861, but this question is separate from the preliminary issue of whether the official actually intended to impose that condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b666-10\">. Like the District Court, we do not read Burton's statements about his medical treatment or his stay in detention as alleging different claims than those addressed above.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
