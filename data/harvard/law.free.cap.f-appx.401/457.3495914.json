Dick, and his former attorneys John A. Tinney and Deborah Hill Biggers as defendants. On appeal, Springer generally argues that the district court erred in dismissing his case because his constitutional rights were violated, the judges and attorneys involved with his ease conspired to prevent his case from moving forward, he was entitled to a jury trial as secured by the Seventh Amendment, and it \u201cwas totally unfair\u201d for his case to be compared to the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-24\">We review \u201cdismissals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo.\u201d Nicholson v. Shafe, </em>558 F.3d 1266, 1270 (11th Cir.2009). <em>\u201cPro se </em>pleadings are held to a less stringent standard than pleadings drafted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>attorneys and will, therefore, be liberally construed.\u201d <em>Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, 1263 (11th Cir.1998). The party invoking federal subject matter jurisdiction bears the burden of proving its existence. <em>See Sweet Pea Marine, Ltd. v. APJ Marine, Inc., </em>411 F.3d 1242, 1247 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine provides that \u201clower federal courts are precluded from exercising appellate jurisdiction over final state-court judgments.\u201d <em>Nicholson, </em>558 F.3d at 1268 (quotation omitted). In <em>Exxon Mobil v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., 544 </em>U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005), the Supreme Court cautioned against broadly construing <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>and held that the doctrine be confined only to \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries cause by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\"><em>Rooker-Feldman\u2019s </em>reach extends to federal claims raised by the state-court loser that are deemed to be \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the state court judgment. <em>Casale v. Tillman, </em>558 F.3d 1258, 1260 (11th Cir.2009). We have advanced two scenarios where a federal claim is considered inextricably intertwined with the state court judgment: (1) where the success of the federal claim would \u201ceffectively nullify\u201d the state court judgment; and (2) where the federal claim \u201csucceeds only to the extent that the state wrongly decided the issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Here, the district court did not err in concluding that <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>barred Springer\u2019s civil rights complaint because, squarely within the language of <em>Exxon Mobil, </em>he was a state-court loser who sued in federal court to complain of injuries caused by the state-court judgment that was rendered before the filing of his federal complaint. <em>See Nicholson, </em>558 F.3d at 1268, 1270. To the extent that Springer couches his complaint in terms of independent constitutional claims against the defendants, we hold that those federal claims are inextricably intertwined with the Randolph County circuit court\u2019s granting of the motion to enforce the settlement and, thus, still fell within the confines of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>jurisdictional bar. <em>See Casale, </em>558 F.3d at 1261. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-17\">. <em>Rooker v.
