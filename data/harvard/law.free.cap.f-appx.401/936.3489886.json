For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-15\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b965-16\">In 2004, the City entered into an agreement with the Dallas Cowboys Football Club (\u201cCowboys\u201d) whereby the City would become the owner of a newly constructed sports stadium, leased by the Cowboys. Because stadium events were expected to substantially impact traffic in the surrounding area, prior to the stadium\u2019s opening in 2009, the Cowboys submitted a proposed traffic management plan (\u201cTMP\u201d) to the City. The City reviewed and modified the Cowboys\u2019 proposed TMP before approving it.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-17\">Next to the Cowboys\u2019 stadium is a three-hundred-and-forty-eight unit apartment complex owned by Enclave. The entrance to the Enclave complex is on Randol Mill Road, which lies between the Enclave complex and the stadium. Legends Way intersects Randol Mill Road on the east side of the Enclave complex. Due to the large number of pedestrians that converge at the corner of Legends Way and Randol Mill Road during events, the TMP limits vehicular access to Randol Mill Road and other streets around the stadium. The TMP allows an individual to access the Enclave complex by placing a \u201chang tag\u201d in the car or by informing a police officer on duty that the Enclave complex is his or her destination. Some residents have reported delays when attempting to enter or leave the Enclave complex during events and some have complained about traffic and noise.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-18\">In a lawsuit filed against the City, Enclave alleged a substantive due process violation pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>unreasonable seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment, regulatory and physical takings in violation of the Fifth Amendment, and a private nuisance claim. It also requested preliminary and permanent injunctions. After a hearing, the district court denied Enclave\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction. On July 24, 2009, the City filed for summary judgment. Enclave filed two successive motions for a continuance pursuant to Rule 56(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which the district court granted. Subsequently, Enclave filed a third Rule 56(f) motion requesting an additional thirty days to respond, which the district court denied in part, allowing only a fifteen-day continuance. After receiving Enclave\u2019s opposition, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the City.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">A. Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo.\u201d Fahim v. Marriott Hotel Servs., Inc., </em>551 F.3d 344, 348 (5th Cir.2008). Summary judgment is appropriate only \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">i. <em>Enclave\u2019s Fourth Amendment Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b966-8\">The Fourth Amendment, made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Ker v. California, </em>374 U.S. 23, 30, 83 S.Ct. 1623, 10 L.Ed.2d 726 (1963), provides in relevant part that the \u201cright of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. The Fourth Amendment applies to civil as well as criminal seizures. <em>Severance v. Patterson, </em>566 F.3d 490, 501 (5th Cir.2009). A \u201cseizure\u201d of property occurs when \u201cthere is some meaningful interference with an individual\u2019s possesso-ry interests in that property.\u201d <em>United States v. Jacobsen, </em>466 U.S. 109, 113, 104 S.Ct. 1652, 80 L.Ed.2d 85 (1984); <em>Soldal v. Cook County, </em>506 U.S. 56, 61, 113 S.Ct. 538, 121 L.Ed.2d 450 (1992). Only if a court concludes that a seizure has occurred will it then consider the seizure\u2019s reasonableness, a determination requiring \u201ca careful balancing of governmental and private interests.\u201d <em>Soldal, </em>506 U.S. at 71, 113 S.Ct. 538; <em>Freeman v. City of Dallas, </em>242 F.3d 642, 649 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">Enclave contends that the district court applied an incorrect standard of law by requiring a physical dispossession of Enclave\u2019s property, rather than considering whether the City\u2019s actions amounted to \u201cmeaningful interference with [Enclave\u2019s] possessory interests in that property.\u201d <em>See Jacobsen, </em>466 U.S. at 113, 104 S.Ct. 1652; <em>see also Thomas v. Cohen, </em>304 F.3d 563, 572 (6th Cir.2002) (\u201c[A]n act [need not] embody physical displacement of property in order to constitute a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d). However, the district court applied the correct standard of law, recognizing that \u201c[w]hile complete \u2018dispossession\u2019 may not be required ... [Enclave] has failed to establish any seizure that meaningfully interfered with its possessory interests.\u201d <em>Enclave Arlington Assoc. Ltd. P\u2019ship v. City of Arlington, </em>669 F.Supp.2d 735, 740-41 (N.D.Tex.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">According to Enclave, the City effected a seizure by denying residents access to and from the Enclave complex during stadium events. However, \u201cFourth Amendment rights are personal rights, which may be enforced only by the person whose rights were infringed.\u201d <em>United States v. Pack, </em>612 F.3d 341, 341 (5th Cir.2010) (citation omitted); <em>see also Rakas v. Illi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number><em>nois, </em>439 U.S. 128, 133-34, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978) (\u201cFourth Amendment rights are personal rights which, like some other constitutional rights, may not be vicariously asserted.\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>Club Retro, L.L.C. v. Hilton, </em>568 F.3d 181, 195 n. 5 (5th Cir.2009) (holding that a nightclub did not have standing to assert Fourth Amendment rights on behalf of its patrons); <em>San Jacinto Sav. &amp; Loan v. Kacal, </em>928 F.2d 697, 704 (5th Cir.1991) (\u201cBecause the record in this case is devoid of any evidence that [the plaintiff] was personally subjected to an illegal search or seizure, [the plaintiff] has no standing to assert the rights of third parties who may have been subjected to such searches or seizures while at [the plaintiffs store].\u201d). Enclave may not assert a Fourth Amendment claim based on the rights of third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-5\">Citing <em>Gonzalez v. City Plan Commission, </em>2006 WL 278985, at *3 (N.D.Tex. Feb.3, 2006), for the proposition that \u201c[c]ourts have found seizures when personal property has been destroyed or devalued by state action,\u201d Enclave alleges that the City\u2019s actions amount to \u201cmeaningful interference\u201d with Enclave\u2019s possessory interests because its property has been devalued by the City\u2019s actions. <em>Gonzalez, </em>an unpublished case from the Northern District of Texas, is not binding precedent. Moreover, Enclave failed to direct the court to summary judgment evidence showing that its property has been devalued as a result of the City\u2019s actions. Although Enclave has presented evidence showing that six residents filed \u201cNotices of Intent to Move Out,\u201d citing traffic as a reason for their move, it has not presented evidence raising an issue of material fact that the loss of six residents in a three-hundred-and-forty-eight unit apartment complex amounted to a devaluation of its property.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Further, Enclave alleges that the City\u2019s actions have meaningfully interfered with its \u201cuse and enjoyment\u201d of the property due to the \u201ctens of thousands of pedestrians and vehicles\u201d that pass near the Enclave complex on event days, the \u201cpartying\u201d and \u201cloud and boisterous conduct\u201d in the stadium parking lot, and the noise caused by stadium events. Enclave fails to cite any authority supporting its contention that these inconveniences amount to a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. Because Enclave has failed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact on its Fourth Amendment claim, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\">ii. <em>Enclave\u2019s Remaining Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">In its opening brief, Enclave did not state that it was appealing the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on its Fifth Amendment, \u00a7 1983, and private nuisance claims. Although Enclave averred in its reply brief that it was not waiving these claims and was appealing the entirety of the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment, it offered no argument or discussion as to the merit of these claims. \u201cA party waives an issue if he fails to adequately brief it on appeal.\u201d <em>Sanders v. Unum Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>553 F.3d 922, 926 (5th Cir.2008) (citation omitted); <em>see also Edwards v. Johnson, </em>209 F.3d 772, 776 n. 1 (5th Cir.2000) (holding that if petitioner does not assign error to certain findings of the district court in its initial brief on appeal, then \u201cany challenge to these findings has been abandoned on appeal\u201d). \u201cMerely mentioning a claim does not constitute a supported argument or adequate briefing.\u201d <em>Sanders, </em>553 F.3d at 926. Enclave has waived these claims and the district court\u2019s judgment as to Enclave\u2019s Fifth Amendment, \u00a7 1983, and private nuisance claims is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>B. Rule 56(f) Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">This court next determines whether the district court erred when it denied Enclave\u2019s third request for a thirty-day continuance and merely allowed Enclave a fifteen-day continuance. The denial of a Rule 56(f) motion is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Steams Airport Equip. v. FMC Corp., </em>170 F.3d 518, 534 (5th Cir.1999). The party seeking Rule 56(f) relief \u201cmay not simply rely on vague assertions that additional discovery will produce needed, but unspecified, facts.\u201d <em>Raby v. Livingston, </em>600 F.3d 552, 561 (5th Cir.2010) (citing <em>SEC v. Spence &amp; Green Chem. Co., </em>612 F.2d 896, 901 (5th Cir.1980)). A request to stay summary judgment under Rule 56(f) must \u201cset forth a plausible basis for believing that specified facts, susceptible of collection within a reasonable time frame, probably exist and indicate how the emergent facts, if adduced, will influence the outcome of the pending summary judgment motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>C.B. Trucking, Inc. v. Waste Mgmt. Inc., </em>137 F.3d 41, 44 (1st Cir.1998)).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">In its third Rule 56(f) motion, Enclave stated that it sought \u201climited depositions of certain representatives of the City and Dallas Cowboys.\u201d The motion did not state the names of the individuals it wanted to depose, what the depositions might reveal, or how that evidence would impact the outcome of the pending summary judgment motion. During a hearing conducted by the district court via telephone, Enclave\u2019s attorney stated that additional time for discovery was necessary to identify evidence that would demonstrate that the Dallas Cowboys \u201cdictat[ed] [to the City] the process of which properties to condemn [and] ... the process of the traffic flow plan.\u201d In response, the City, through counsel, informed the district court that it was not aware of any documents that indicated that the Cowboys were controlling the City\u2019s decision making. Enclave\u2019s Rule 56(f) motion and representations to the district court consisted of vague assertions. The district court did not abuse its discretion in granting Enclave a fifteen-day, rather than a thirty-day, continuance, and we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">The district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the City and its partial denial of Enclave\u2019s Rule 56(f) motion are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b965-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
