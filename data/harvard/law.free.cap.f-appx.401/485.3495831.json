The government considered this route \u201chigh risk\u201d because it was often used to smuggle drugs into the United States. When Merelan\u2019s flight arrived, customs officials x-rayed all the luggage from that flight and noticed that one of Merelan\u2019s bags was unusually dense. Custom and Border Protection Officer Barzelay opened the bag and discovered a gift-wrapped wooden plaque. As officials inspected the plaque, they noticed a white powder residue that field tested positive for cocaine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They re-wrapped the plaque, replaced it in the bag, and sent the bag to baggage claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">After Merelan picked up the bag, along with another piece of luggage, Officer Navedo stopped and questioned him. Merelan stated that the bags were his and that he was not carrying anything for anyone else. When Navedo opened the bag and asked about the plaque, Merelan stated that it was a gift for his girlfriend. During further questioning, Navedo conducted another field test in front of Merelan; Merelan did not respond when the field test showed the powder to be cocaine. Merelan was arrested and given his Miranda<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> rights, after which Merelan explained that a man had given him the bag to bring to the United States. Merelan could not describe the man and did not know what the man had been wearing, nor did he know the man\u2019s name. While Merelan was being processed, Navedo overheard him say that he was carrying the bag for someone else but he never mentioned the person\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-10\">In his own testimony, Merelan stated that he was traveling to the United States to visit his wife and children. At the airport in Haiti, a friend named Roman, accompanied by another man Merelan did not know, asked Merelan to carry his bag so that he could avoid the excess baggage fee. Roman showed Merelan the contents of the bag and said that the plaque was a Bible. An immigration officer advised him that the bag had been checked and was safe to carry.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-11\">When asked about his statements to customs officials after his arrival, Merelan responded that he had said the bag was his because he did not believe there was anything illegal in the luggage and he did not want Roman to be charged for the extra bag. He explained that he told Navedo that the plaque was a gift for his girlfriend because Navedo had admired the plaque and he was very proud. He further explained that he cooperated with Navedo\u2019s investigation because he believed there was nothing illegal in the bags. After he learned that officials had found cocaine on the plaque, he panicked because he would not have brought drugs into the United States. He then admitted to officials that was carrying the bag for another man that he had met at the airport.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-12\">During cross-examination, Merelan stated that he was going to visit his wife, but he did not know her current address. He explained that his brother-in-law was to give him the address when he arrived. He stated that he did not give Roman\u2019s name to the customs agents because they did not ask for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-13\">Based on this evidence, the jury convicted Merelan of importing 500 grams or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>more of cocaine, but acquitted him of the second charge-possessing with intent to distribute cocaine. The court sentenced Merelan to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. Merelan now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">We review the sufficiency of the evidence supporting a criminal conviction <em>de novo. United States v. Khanani, </em>502 F.3d 1281, 1293 (11th Cir.2007). When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, all evidence and all reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the government. <em>Id. </em>Because the jury is free to choose among reasonable constructions of the evidence, we must accept the jury\u2019s credibility determinations and inferences. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The government is required to prove each element of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt to sustain a conviction. <em>United States v. Rogers, </em>94 F.3d 1519, 1524 (11th Cir.1996). To establish importation of 500 or more grams of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a) the government must prove (1) the defendant imported cocaine into the United States from a place outside thereof, (2) he did so knowingly and willfully, and (3) the weight of the cocaine imported by the defendant was in excess of 500 grams. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez-Suarez, </em>856 F.2d 135, 140 (11th Cir.1988). At issue in this case is whether the evidence was sufficient to establish Merelan\u2019s knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">To establish that the defendant acted knowingly, the government must prove that the defendant had knowledge of a controlled substance in his possession. <em>United States v. Mercer, </em>541 F.3d 1070, 1076 (11th Cir.2008). \u201cDirect evidence of knowledge, however, is not necessary to sustain [the defendant\u2019s] conviction; the government may prove its case through circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Quilca-Carpio, </em>118 F.3d 719, 721 (11th Cir.1997). When a defendant testifies, the jury is \u201cfree to reject\u201d that testimony and can infer that the opposite is true. Moreover, the jury may consider such evidence as substantive evidence of guilt. <em>United States v. Jiminez, </em>564 F.3d 1280, 1285 (11th Cir.2009) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">Here, the evidence at trial established that Merelan picked up the bag containing the cocaine from the baggage claim, and that he initially claimed ownership both of the bag and of the plaque inside the bag. In his testimony, Merelan stated that he did not believe there was anything illegal in the bag and explained that he would not have brought drugs into the United States. The jury was free to disbelieve Merelan\u2019s testimony and consider it is substantive evidence of his guilt. Moreover, the jury, when faced with the various inconsistencies in Merelan\u2019s explanations, could have found his testimony incredible. We will not disturb the jury\u2019s credibility findings. Accordingly, we conclude the evidence established Merelan\u2019s knowing importation of cocaine. His conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b514-7\">.
