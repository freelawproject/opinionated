Ford, who was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, is serving a 236-month term of imprisonment for distributing crack cocaine within 100 feet of a school.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-18\">By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Ford is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal would be frivolous and not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Ford argues that the district court erred in determining that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, the Sentencing Guideline governing \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings, did not authorize a reduction in his sentence because his guidelines range was not derived from the quantity of crack cocaine involved in his offense, but rather from his career offender status. Ford contends that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), made application of \u00a7 1B1.10 advisory only. He argues that the district court could have reduced his sentence based on its disagreement with the career offender guideline.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-19\">The district court correctly concluded that it was not authorized to reduce Ford\u2019s sentence because Ford was sentenced as a career offender. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>591 F.3d 789, 790-91 (5th Cir.2009). Ford\u2019s argument that <em>Booker </em>had the effect of rendering \u00a7 1B1.10 advisory is foreclosed. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). To the extent Ford\u2019s arguments may be construed as challenging the district court\u2019s original decision to sentence him as a career offender, they are not cognizable in his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number><em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010-1011 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">Ford has not shown that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his motion for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED. Ford\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel also is DENIED. Because Ford\u2019s appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b991-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
