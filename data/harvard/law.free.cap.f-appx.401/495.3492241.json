Schultz, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Miami, FL, for Respondent-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<judges data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b523-19\">Before TJOFLAT, EDMONDSON and MARTIN, Circuit Judges.</judges>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b523-20\">PER CURIAM:</author>\n<p id=\"b523-21\">This is an appeal of the denial of a motion to vacate filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 by Nelson Cintron. We construe the certificate of appealability that issued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-22\">Whether Cintron was denied due process of law when the district-judge denied his motion to recuse based on bias, prejudice, and/or lack of impartiality, and/or whether Cintron was denied his due process rights due to presumed judicial bias and prejudice during his guilty plea and sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-23\">Before he denied Cintron\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, the district judge denied Cintron\u2019s motion that the judge recuse on the ground that a close relative of the judge had been the victim of a crime similar to the underlying offense that Cintron committed. Cintron argues that the judge could not be impartial in his case because of the similarity between his case and an incident involving the judge\u2019s close relative. He contends that he was denied his statutory rights under under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 455(a) and 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-24\">We review for abuse of discretion a judge\u2019s denial of a motion to recuse. <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 828 (11th Cir.2007). A district judge abuses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>his discretion when he \u201capplies the wrong law, follows the wrong procedure, bases its decision on clearly erroneous facts, or commits a clear error in judgment.\u201d <em>Tran v. Toyota Motor Corp., </em>420 F.3d 1810, 1315 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a), a judge shall \u201cdisqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d Recusal is appropriate under \u00a7 455(a) only if \u201can objective, disinterested, lay observer fully informed of the facts underlying the grounds on which recusal was sought would entertain a significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d at 828 (quotation omitted). As a general rule, \u201ca judge\u2019s rulings in the same case are not valid grounds for recusal.\u201d <em>Loranger v. Stierheim, </em>10 F.3d 776, 780 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144, recusal of a district judge is required when a party \u201cmakes and files a timely and sufficient affidavit that the judge has a personal bias or prejudice either against him or in favor of an adverse party.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144. In other words, to warrant recusal under \u00a7 144, \u201cthe moving party must allege facts that would convince a reasonable person that bias actually exists.\u201d <em>Christo v. Padgett, </em>223 F.3d 1324, 1333 (11th Cir.2000). Moreover, \u201cunsupported, conclusory, or tenuous allegations\u201d are not sufficient to warrant disqualification. <em>Giles v. Garwood, </em>853 F.2d 876, 878 (11th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Because Cintron failed to meet the statutory requirements to warrant recusal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 455(a) and 144, the district judge did not abuse his discretion in not disqualifying himself from passing on Cintron\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
