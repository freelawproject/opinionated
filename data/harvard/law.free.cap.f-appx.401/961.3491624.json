He argues that the district court should not have denied his motion solely on the basis of his pre-sentencing conduct. Gray also moves for the appointment of appellate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">Section 3582(c)(2) permits the discretionary modification of a defendant\u2019s sentence in cases like Gray\u2019s which involve the amendments the Guidelines crack cocaine provisions. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). In such cases, the district court may reduce the sentence after considering the applicable 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the pertinent guideline policy statements. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). \u201c[A] reduced term of imprisonment [is not] a matter of right,\u201d however. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment, (baekg\u2019d.); <em>see Doublin, </em>572 F.3d at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">We review the district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). If the record shows that the district court gave due consideration to the motion as a whole and implicitly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, then there is no abuse of discretion. <em>See id. </em>at 673-74; <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1010 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">In the instant case, thg district court expressly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the policy statements, emphasizing the nature and circumstances of the offense of conviction and Gray\u2019s significant criminal history. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in declining to reduce Gray\u2019s sentence. <em>See Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673-74; <em>Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d at 1010. The district court\u2019s judgement is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-11\">Gray\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel on appeal is DENIED. <em>See Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d at 1011. Gray\u2019s request for oral argument is also DENIED. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b989-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
