On appeal, River-as raises two arguments. First, he argues that the district court clearly erred in applying a three-level managerial-role enhancement, per U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), upon finding that Riveras was a manager or supervisor. Second, Riveras argues that his 235-month sentence was substantively unreasonable because it resulted in an unwarranted sentencing disparity as compared to the sentences received by his codefendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">When reviewing a sentence, we must first determine that the \u201cdistrict court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We review the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Lee, </em>427 F.3d 881, 892 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cA district court\u2019s upward adjustment of a defendant\u2019s Guidelines offense level ... under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 is a finding of fact reviewed only for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Phillips, </em>287 F.3d 1053, 1055 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cThe government bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant had an aggravating role in the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Yeager, </em>331 F.3d 1216, 1226 (11th Cir.2003). The government meets this burden \u201cby presenting reliable and specific evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Lawrence, </em>47 F.3d 1559, 1567 (11th Cir.1995). The district court \u201cmay consider relevant information without regard to its admissibility under the rules of evidence applicable at trial, provided that the information has sufficient indicia of reliability to support its probable accuracy.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Under \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), a three-level enhancement is appropriate where \u201cthe defendant was a manager or supervisor (but not an organizer or leader) and the criminal activity involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(b). Factors relevant to whether a managerial responsibility enhancement is applicable include</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-6\">the exercise of decision making authority, the nature of participation in the commission of the offense, the recruitment of accomplices, the claimed right to a larger share of the fruits of the crime, the degree of participation in planning or organizing the offense, the nature and scope of the illegal activity, and the degree of control and authority exercised over others.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-11\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1, comment (n.4). To qualify for an enhancement under \u00a7 3Bl.l(b), the defendant need only manage or supervise one other participant. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.1 comment, (n.2).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-12\">Riveras contends that, the district court clearly erred in imposing a three-level enhancement pursuant to USSG \u00a7 3B1.1 because its finding that he played a managerial or supervisory role in the offense was based upon contested facts not set forth in the PSI, which the government failed to prove by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-13\">This is not so. After defense counsel objected to the government\u2019s reliance on facts not set forth in the PSI as a basis for the enhancement, the district court expressly disavowed an intention to \u201crely upon any testimony that wasn\u2019t in the PSI that you didn\u2019t have a chance to cross examine that you have objected to.\u201d The district court\u2019s subsequent ruling on the role enhancement reveals that it adhered to this decision with one exception,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that, when defense counsel called this to the court\u2019s attention, the court immediately offered to \u201cvacate the sentence, reset the sentencing hearing, start anew, [River-as] can make [his] objections, [the prosecutor] can bring in whatever additional testimony he may or may not want to bring in, and we can start all over again in the future.\u201d At that point, defense counsel and Riveras conducted a private conversation, after which counsel announced that \u201cMr. Riveras doesn\u2019t want to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>Under these circumstances, Riveras is not entitled to any relief. Any objection he may have had to the tape recording was waived by his affirmative rejection of the district court\u2019s offer to cure the defect in sentencing by vacating and resetting the sentencing. Riveras cannot now profit from the error he so invited. <em>See United States v. Masters, </em>118 F.3d 1524, 1526 (11th Cir.1997). The invited error doctrine precludes reversal. <em>See United States v. Silvestri, </em>409 F.3d 1311, 1327-28 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">Furthermore, even if Riveras did not waive the objection, the alleged error was harmless. At the change-of-plea hearing, Riveras explicitly admitted that he told the undercover agent that \u201cthey planned on stealing the cocaine and kidnaping the guards to the stash house to secure the payment of ransom money for their release.\u201d The same allegation was recited in the PSI and Riveras did not contest that allegation in his PSI objections. Riveras\u2019 admissions relieved the government of any obligation to produce evidentiary support for the allegation and provided an independent and reliable basis for the district court to conclude that he bore responsibility. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir. 2005). Accordingly, any procedural error resulting from the court\u2019s reliance on the tape recording was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">The district court\u2019s application of a three-level aggravating-role enhancement, per \u00a7 3B 1.1(b), was supported by the record, which established that Riveras was a manager or supervisor of criminal activity that involved five or more participants. We shall affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">We review the sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). Reasonableness review is \u201cdeferential,\u201d and \u201cthe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788. If we conclude that the district court made no procedural errors, we \u201cthen consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. We will remand for resentencing only \u201cif we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1191 (11th Cir.2008) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense, (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (5) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (7) the need to provide restitution to victims. See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). As to the sixth factor, there cannot be an unwarranted sentencing disparity between defendants who are not similarly situated. <em>United States v. Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d 1236, 1252 (11th Cir.2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-12\">Riveras\u2019 sentence is not substantively unreasonable because he was not similarly situated to his co-defendants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>As the district court observed in addressing Riveras\u2019 objections to the PSI regarding the applicable advisory guideline range, one of his co-defendants was less culpable than he, and the other provided assistance to the government. Nor was Riveras similarly situated to the remaining co-defendants because, unlike them, he held a supervisory position in the criminal enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Therefore, Riveras was not similarly situated to his co-defendants and the resulting disparity between his 235-month sentence and theirs was not substantively unreasonable. Accordingly, we shall affirm as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Based on our review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm Riveras\u2019 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-7\">. The district court relied in part on a tape recording in which Riveras told an undercover agent that they should kidnap and hold for ransom certain people.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
