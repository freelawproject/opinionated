Driessen\u2019s complaint, filed in 2010, essentially raises the same claims as the complaint she filed in 2009. In fact, much of her 2010 complaint explicitly states that it is based on her 2009 complaint. For example, paragraph twelve of her 2010 complaint states it is \u201cbased on paragraph 21 of the June 4, 2009 Complaint,\u201d and paragraph thirteen states it is \u201cbased on paragraphs 26-30 of the June 4, 2009 Complaint,\u201d and paragraph fourteen states it is \u201cbased on paragraphs 31-38 of the June 4, 2009 Complaint,\u201d and the next paragraph \u2014 also numbered as paragraph fourteen \u2014 states it is \u201cbased on paragraphs 34-36 of the June 4, 2009 Complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">In Driessen\u2019s earlier case we held that her \u00a7 1983 claims were barred by the statute of limitations, and we affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of her complaint. <em>Driessen v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Children and Families, </em>351 Fed.Appx. 355 (11th Cir.2009) (unpublished). <em>\u201cRes judicata </em>bars the filing of claims which were raised or could have been raised in an earlier proceeding.\u201d <em>Ragsdale v. Rubbermaid, Inc., </em>193 F.3d 1235, 1238 (11th Cir.1999). Res judicata applies when \u201c(1) there is a final judgment on the merits; (2) the decision was rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (3) the parties, or those in privity with them, are identical in both suits; and (4) the same cause of action is involved in both cases.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because Driessen\u2019s complaints meet all of these requirements for res judicata, her 2010 complaint was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
