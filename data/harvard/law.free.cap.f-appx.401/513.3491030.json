Pinder claims his sentence is unreasonable because the district court used his statements regarding other drug trafficking schemes to deny his request for a sentence below the Guideline range. Specifically, Pinder claims he assisted the Government by providing information used by the Government to object to the presentence investigation report (PSI) for Pinder\u2019s codefendant, Parson Exana. After review, we affirm Pinder\u2019s sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>To encourage cooperation with the government, Section 1B1.8 of the Guidelines provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-4\">Where a defendant agrees to cooperate with the government by providing information concerning unlawful activities of others, and as part of that cooperation agreement the government agrees that self-incriminating information provided pursuant to the agreement will not be used against the defendant, then such information shall not be used in determining the applicable guideline range, except to the extent provided in the agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.8(a). The Guideline applies only to the provision of information concerning the unlawful activities of others, not to \u201can agreement by the defendant simply to detail the extent of his own unlawful activities.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.8 comment, (n.6). Additionally, \u2018\u201cinformation post-dating the agreement and obtained from independent sources is not barred.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Pham, </em>463 F.3d 1239, 1243-44 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>United States v. Baird, </em>218 F.3d 221, 231 (3d Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">We conclude the district court did not err by relying on Pinder\u2019s previous drug smuggling experience to deny his request for a downward variance. Although U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.8 does prohibit the district court from relying on information provided to the Government as part of a cooperation agreement, Pinder has failed to identify any cooperation agreement with the Government. The record lacks any mention of such an agreement, and instead shows the Government learned of Pinder\u2019s prior drug smuggling trips from taped conversations during Pinder\u2019s commission of the offense. <em>See Pham, </em>463 F.3d at 1244 (\u201c[S]o long as the information is obtained from independent sources or separately gleaned from codefendants, it may be used at sentencing without violating \u00a7 1B1.8.\u201d). Further, the district court relied on factual allegations in Pinder\u2019s PSI, which Pinder failed to object to and thus admitted for sentencing purposes. <em>See United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006). Accordingly, we affirm Pinder\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-9\">. We review a final sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). Reasonableness review is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>akin to the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 40, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Under the abuse-of-discretion standard, we reverse only if the district court\u2019s ruling constitutes a clear error of judgment. <em>United States v. Frazier, </em>387 F.3d 1244, 1259 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
