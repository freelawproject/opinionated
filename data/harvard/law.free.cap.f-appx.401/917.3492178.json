Coleman moves for permission to appeal in forma pauperis (IFP). The district court has certified that the appeal is not in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-7\">Coleman argues that the Government breached the plea agreement by allowing him to be sentenced based upon an incorrect drug quantity. He also contends that the district court abused its discretion by denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion because his 210-month sentence was greater than necessary to meet the goals of sentencing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-8\">We need not address whether the Government breached the plea agreement because that issue is beyond the scope of the guidelines amendment and is therefore not cognizable in a \u00a7 3582 motion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 674 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010); <em>United States v. Shaw, </em>30 F.3d 26, 29 (5th Cir.1994). Moreover, the denial of Coleman\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion was not an abuse of discretion, as the district court explicitly based its decision on the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors. <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237-38 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). Coleman has failed to show that he will raise a nonfrivolous issue on appeal. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, his motion to proceed IFP is DENIED. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b946-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
