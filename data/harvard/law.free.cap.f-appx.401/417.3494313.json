The issue certified for appeal is whether Mathis received ineffective assistance of counsel when his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>attorney on direct appeal failed to argue that Mathis\u2019s sentencing enhancement under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 851 increased his minimum term of supervised release from five to ten years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">In 2004, Mathis was convicted in federal court of several drug and money-laundering offenses. After he was indicted, the government filed an information notifying Mathis that it would seek a sentencing enhancement based on a 1987 state felony drug conviction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mathis then returned to state court and succeeded in having the state conviction vacated. Once the state conviction had been vacated, Mathis objected to the sentencing enhancement by arguing that there was no longer any conviction on which to base an enhanced sentence. The government responded that Mathis was barred from challenging the validity of the state conviction because it was more than five years old when the government filed its information.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court rejected Mathis\u2019s argument and applied the enhancement, sentencing him to concurrent terms of 260 months\u2019 imprisonment and ten years of supervised release on the drug counts. Mathis also received concurrent sentences of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment and three years of supervised release on the money-laundering charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Mathis raised his sentencing-enhancement argument on direct appeal, but a panel of this court concluded that any error from the enhancement was harmless because the enhanced statutory minimum was equal to the term of imprisonment Mathis received for his conviction on the money-laundering charges, which he had not challenged. <em>United States v. Mathis, </em>239 Fed.Appx. 513, 518 (11th Cir.2007). Mathis now argues that he received ineffective assistance from his appellate counsel because his lawyer failed to inform this court that the enhancement also resulted in a higher minimum term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"ARi\">We review an ineffective-assistanee-ofcounsel claim on appeal from a district court\u2019s denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion <em>de novo. Gordon v. United States, </em>518 F.3d 1291, 1296 (11th Cir.2008). To demonstrate that his counsel was ineffective, Mathis must prove both that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced him. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Mathis must show that his attorney\u2019s performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness in light of prevailing professional norms to establish deficient performance. <em>Cummings v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of </em>Corn, 588 F.3d 1331, 1356 (11th Cir.2009). To establish prejudice, Mathis must prove by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>reasonable probability that but for his counsel\u2019s errors, the outcome of his case would have been different. <em>Holladay v. Haley, </em>209 F.3d 1243, 1248 (11th Cir.2000). If the defendant cannot show deficient performance, we need not consider whether he was prejudiced. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">Mathis argues that his appellate counsel\u2019s performance was deficient because he failed to inform this court that the sentencing enhancement increased Mathis\u2019s minimum term of supervised release from five to ten years. Although Mathis\u2019s counsel did not specifically detail how his client was affected by the sentencing enhancement, he did object to the enhancement generally. And this general objection alerted this court to both the higher minimum term of imprisonment and the higher minimum term of supervised release. Mathis\u2019s counsel was not required to go any further and spell out how the enhancement affected his client. And when viewed in the context of Mathis\u2019s case, his lawyer\u2019s decision not to do so seems not only reasonable but wise.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Mathis\u2019s enhancement argument was a novel one in this circuit. The only authority he had to support the argument was not binding, and even that cases\u2019s reasoning was suspect as it was issued over a very strong dissent. <em>See United States v. McChristian, </em>47 F.3d 1499 (9th Cir.1995). That Mathis\u2019s counsel devoted no more of his brief than necessary to sufficiently raise the argument and instead focused on other, stronger arguments was well within the bounds of competent and effective representation. <em>Jones v. Barnes, </em>463 U.S. 745, 751-52, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983) (\u201c[Experienced advocates ... have emphasized the importance of winnowing out weaker arguments on appeal....\u201d). As such, his counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient and we need not consider prejudice. <em>Holladay, </em>209 F.3d at 1248. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b446-6\">. Mathis raises other issues in his appeal that we need not address because they were not included in the certificate of appealability. <em>Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b446-7\">. If a person is convicted under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) for an offense involving five or more kilograms of cocaine \u2014 as was Mathis \u2014 he or she must be sentenced to no less than ten years\u2019 imprisonment and at least five years\u2019 supervised release. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). If that same defendant also has a prior felony drug conviction, his or her minimum sentence increases to twenty years' imprisonment and ten years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b446-11\">.21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(e) (\"No person who stands convicted of an offense under [21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841] may challenge the validity of any prior conviction alleged under this section [that] occurred more than five years before the date of the information alleging such prior conviction.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
