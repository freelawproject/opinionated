A jury convicted Misher of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine; he is serving 360 months of imprisonment. Misher argues that crack cocaine, in addition to powder cocaine, was used to determine his base offense level, and therefore the district court erred in its determination that the crack cocaine amendments were inapplicable in his case. Misher also challenges the district court\u2019s reliance on pre-incarceration conduct to deny his Section 3582(c)(2) motion. Misher has filed a motion for the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-22\">By moving to proceed IFP, Misher is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). \u201cAn investigation into the [IFP] movant\u2019s objective good faith, while necessitating a brief inquiry into the merits of an appeal, does not require that probable success be shown.\u201d <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Rather, this court\u2019s inquiry into an appellant\u2019s good faith \u201cis limited to whether the appeal involves legal points arguable on their merits (and therefore not frivolous).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted)</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>This court reviews the district court\u2019s \u201cdecision whether to reduce a sentence under Section 3582(c)(2) for abuse of discretion,\u201d while its interpretation of the Guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo </em>and its findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009) (citations omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010). \u201cA district court abuses its discretion if it bases its decision on an error of law or a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 486-87 (5th Cir.2005) (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-6\">Any error in the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines amendments to Misher does not warrant reversal. The district court stated in its denial of Misher\u2019s Section 3582(c)(2) motion that \u201c[e]ven if the Court were to determine that the amendments applied to Defendant, the Court would exercise its discretion to not grant a reduction in this case due to Defendant\u2019s violent criminal background.\u201d This language clearly indicates that the district court\u2019s denial of Misher\u2019s motion did not result from any purported error in the district court\u2019s application of the crack cocaine amendments to the Guidelines. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Bonilla, </em>524 F.3d 647, 656-57 (5th Cir.2008) (holding, in direct criminal appeal, that procedural error did not require vacating sentence where the sentence imposed did not result from the Guidelines error).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-7\">Furthermore, Misher presents no meaningful argument that suggests that his post-sentencing conduct contradicts the district court\u2019s determination that he is a public safety risk. The record shows that the district court gave due consideration to Misher\u2019s motion and considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in its determination that Misher\u2019s early release would clearly constitute a danger to the community. The district court\u2019s decision therefore was not an abuse of discretion. <em>See Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>Evans, </em>587 F.3d at 673; U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. l(B)(i)-(iii) (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1010-11\">Misher has failed to demonstrate that his appeal involves non-frivolous legal issues. <em>See Howard, </em>707 F.2d at 220. Accordingly, his IFP motion is DENIED. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. Misher\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is DENIED. <em>See United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1009-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
