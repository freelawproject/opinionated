He sought monetary damages as well as unspecified injunctive, declaratory, and prospective relief. The district court dismissed Martinez\u2019s suit as frivolous on the basis that it is barred under the doctrine of <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Martinez now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">A prisoner may not seek monetary damages or declaratory relief under \u00a7 1983 based on the procedures used in a disciplinary conviction until that disciplinary conviction has been reversed, expunged, or otherwise declared invalid if a favorable judgment would necessarily imply the invalidity of the disciplinary conviction. <em>Clarke v. Stalder, </em>154 F.3d 186, 189 (5th Cir.1998) (en banc); <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364. A prisoner also may not recover good time credits in a \u00a7 1983 suit. <em>Clarke, </em>154 F.3d at 189. Martinez has failed to specify what prospective relief he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">In light of the foregoing, Martinez\u2019s appeal is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983). Thus, it is dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous counts as a strike for purposes of the in forma pauperis (IFP) provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the district court\u2019s dismissal of Martinez\u2019s complaint. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). We have also dismissed as frivolous Martinez\u2019s appeal in Case No. 10-10563. Accordingly, Martinez has accumulated more than three strikes and is now barred from proceeding IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b888-35\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
