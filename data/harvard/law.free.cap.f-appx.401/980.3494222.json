California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Harris has not filed a response. Our independent review of the record and counsel\u2019s brief discloses no non-frivolous issue for appeal. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the AP<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>PEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-5\">The record does reveal a clerical error in the judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 36. Although the transcript of the June 26, 2009, revocation hearing clearly reflects that the Government withdrew the charge that Harris violated Standard Condition No. 10 of his supervised release by associating with a person convicted of a felony, the district court\u2019s judgment nevertheless indicates that Harris violated this condition. This matter is REMANDED for correction of the clerical error.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1008-6\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
