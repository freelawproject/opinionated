McCoy now moves for leave to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for a reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). To obtain leave to proceed IFP on appeal, McCoy must show that he is a pauper and that he will present a nonfrivolous issue for appeal. <em>See Carson v. Polley, </em>689 F.2d 562, 586 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-17\">McCoy argues that the district court erred in its determination that he was ineligible for a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). He argues that after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory and that the career offender enhancement can no longer exclude him from a reduction under the crack cocaine amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-18\"><em>Booker </em>does not apply to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. McCoy\u2019s argument that he is now eligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because the Guidelines are advisory under <em>Booker </em>has been rejected and is foreclosed. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2692, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 236-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b971-23\">McCoy has not shown that he will present a nonfrivolous issue for appeal, and his request for leave to proceed IFP is DENIED. <em>See Carson, </em>689 F.2d at 586. Because his appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). McCoy\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>542 F.3d 1045, 1051-52 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b971-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
