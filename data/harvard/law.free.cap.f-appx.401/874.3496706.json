In this appeal, Burton challenges the district court\u2019s order denying his motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) pursuant to recent amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines applicable to crack cocaine offenses. The district court determined that the amount of crack cocaine involved with his offense (4.7 kilograms) rendered Burton ineligible for \u00a7 3582(c) relief. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. Supp. to App\u2019x C, Amend. 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">Burton contends that the drug amount attributable to him was calculated erroneously and that he should have been responsible for 4,337.25 grams of cocaine base only. He invokes <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and also argues that the disparity in the record with respect to drug quantity should be resolved in his favor under the rule of lenity. In the alternative, he requests an evidentiary hearing. These arguments are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-11\">The record reflects that the district court determined correctly that Burton was sentenced based on the 4.7 kilogram quantity. <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable in \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceedings. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-93, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010). Burton has not shown that the district court abused its discretion by denying his \u00a7 3582(c) motion. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b903-20\">The district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED. Burton\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus and motion requesting the court to expedite the appeal and to remand the case for an evidentiary hearing are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b903-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
