Martinez argues that the district court improperly enhanced his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(D) based on its determination that his prior Texas conviction for cocaine possession was a felony as defined by the Sentencing Guidelines. More specifically, Martinez contends that the district court erred because its conclusion that his prior state conviction was for a felony offense relied exclusively upon the characterization of his offense in the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-19\">Martinez did not object to the characterization of his prior conviction as a felony or challenge the imposition of the four-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(D). Accordingly, we review only for plain error. <em>United States v. Garda-Arellano, </em>522 F.3d 477, 480 (5th Cir.2008). Our determination whether there is error is \u201cbased on the record before us as supplemented with the state-court documents\u201d related to Martinez\u2019s prior conviction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b963-20\">Guideline \u00a7 2L1.2 provides for a four-level increase if the defendant has been previously convicted of a felony offense. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(D). State-court documents for Martinez\u2019s prior conviction, with which the Government has supplemented the record on appeal, show that Martinez pleaded guilty to possession of less than one gram of cocaine, a violation of Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \u00a7 481.115(b). This offense is a state jail felony punishable by no less than 180 days nor more than two years in prison. <em>See </em>\u00a7 481.115(b); Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 12.35(a). Accordingly, the offense qualifies as a \u201cfelony\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 2L1.2. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment, (n.2); <em>United States v. Riverar-Perez </em>322 F.3d 350, 352 (5th Cir.2003). The application of the four-level enhancement was not error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b963-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
