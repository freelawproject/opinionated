Kenemore, </em>No. 96-11029, 1997 WL 574971, at *1 (5th Cir. Aug.28, 1997) (unpublished). Kenemore filed a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, arguing that his money-laundering conviction should be invalidated in light of <em>United States v. Santos, </em>553 U.S. 507, 128 S.Ct. 2020, 170 L.Ed.2d 912 (2008). The district court dismissed the petition because Kenemore did not meet the requirements for proceeding under the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 as set forth in <em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001). For the denial of habeas corpus relief, the district court\u2019s findings of facts are reviewed for clear error, issues of law <em>de novo. Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">The district court limited the application of <em>Santos </em>to cases of illegal gambling and did not have the benefit of <em>Garland v. Roy, </em>615 F.3d 391 (5th Cir.2010), when it reached that conclusion. Under <em>Garland, id. </em>at 402-04, the district court\u2019s narrow interpretation of <em>Santos, </em>limiting it to illegal gambling, is not correct. Accordingly, the judgment of dismissal of Kenemore\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is VACATED. Kenemore\u2019s motion for remand is GRANTED, and the matter is REMANDED to determine whether, consistent with <em>Garland, </em>his claim falls within the savings clause of \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-11\">Kenemore\u2019s motion to have the court take notice of two letters pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j) is GRANTED. His motion for release pending appeal is DENIED. <em>See Calley v. Callaway, </em>496 F.2d 701, 702 (5th Cir.1974).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1004-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
