Traylor, </em>85 F.3d 581, 586 (11th Cir.1996). <em>Id. </em>at 586. In that appellant was convicted, he cannot establish an essential element of the tort \u2014 that his prosecution terminated in his favor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His complaint was therefore due to be dismissed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-8\">. As a preliminary matter, we decline to reconsider our previous determination that Hunter\u2019s appeal is timely because the district court did not enter its final judgment in a separate document. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(7)(A)(ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b452-17\">. Under Florida law, to establish the tort of malicious prosecution, a plaintiff must establish each of six elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-18\">(1) an original judicial proceeding against the present plaintiff was commenced or continued; (2) the present defendant was the legal cause of the original proceeding; (3) the termination of the original proceeding constituted a bona fide termination of that proceeding in favor of the present plaintiff; (4) there was an absence of probable cause for the original proceeding; (5) there was malice on the part of the present defendant; and (6) the plaintiff suffered damages as a result of the original proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-24\"><em>Kingsland v. City of Miami, </em>382 F.3d 1220, 1234 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b452-25\">. In light of this conclusion, we need not consider whether appellant\u2019s claim was barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
