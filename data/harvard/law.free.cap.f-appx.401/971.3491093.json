By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Black is challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">Black argues that he has a constitutional right to appeal IFP. He also argues the merits of his substantive claims that his constitutional rights were violated because he was not appointed counsel for his parole revocation hearing. He seeks appointment of counsel on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">There is no constitutional right to proceed in a civil action without paying the proper filing fee; the ability to proceed IFP is a privilege that may be extended or withdrawn. <em>Norton v. Dimazana, </em>122 F.3d 286, 290 (5th Cir.1997). While Black argues the merits of his substantive claims, he does not address the reasoning behind the district court\u2019s dismissal, that his claims were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). As Black does not address the district court\u2019s rationale for dismissing his \u00a7 1983 action, he has waived any challenge he could bring to the dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 action. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">Black\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The IFP motion is denied, and the appeal is dismissed. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Black\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is also denied. <em>See Cooper v. Sheriff, Lubbock County, Tex., </em>929 F.2d 1078, 1084 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">Black is cautioned that the dismissal of this appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint both count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). He is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will be unable to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b999-35\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
