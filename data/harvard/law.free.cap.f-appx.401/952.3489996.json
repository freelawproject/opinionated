He argues here that the district court failed to set forth reasons for its denial of IFP status and that it improperly granted the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment because there existed a material factual dispute, regarding whether he was receiving pain medication during his complaints of dental pain, that precluded summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">This court reviews the grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Dillon v. Rogers, </em>596 F.3d 260, 266 (5th Cir.2010). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 56(c)(2)</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">Prison officials violate the constitutional prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment when they demonstrate deliberate indifference to a prisoner\u2019s serious medical needs, constituting an unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain. <em>See Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 297, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991). The Supreme Court has adopted \u201csubjective recklessness as used in the criminal law\u201d as the appropriate test for deliberate indifference. <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 839-41, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). A prison official acts with deliberate indifference if he \u201cknows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">A delay in medical care violates the Eighth Amendment only if it is due to deliberate indifference and the delay results in substantial harm. <em>Mendoza v. Lynaugh, </em>989 F.2d 191, 195 (5th Cir.1993). Negligence and medical malpractice do not give rise to a \u00a7 1983 cause of action, and an inmate\u2019s disagreement with his medical treatment does not establish a constitutional violation. <em>Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-10\">While we do not agree that the claim is frivolous, we are persuaded that the district court did not err in granting defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. <em>See </em>Rule 56(c)(2). Given that there is no dispute that Smith\u2019s medical records reveal that he had been prescribed pain medication for other ailments while he also sought dental treatment, Smith has established that at most Drs. Harris and Shah were negligent in failing also to prescribe him pain medication, which does not give rise to a deliberate indifference claim. <em>See Mendoza, </em>989 F.2d at 195. Because Nurse Slaughter could not write prescriptions, Smith has likewise failed to show that she acted with deliberate indifference by failing to prescribe him pain medication. <em>See id. </em>Smith also has not shown that the delay in extracting his teeth was due to deliberate indifference by the defendants. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b981-11\">We therefore GRANT Smith\u2019s motion to proceed IFP on appeal and AFFIRM the judgment in favor of all defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b980-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
