Reid and Delmar James paid Sterling Christie to smuggle them in to the United States by boat from the Bahamas. All three were apprehended at the time of entry. James was not charged with an offense, but was administratively deported. Christie, who had no criminal history, ultimately pled guilty to alien smuggling and received a guideline-sentence of 10 months\u2019 imprisonment. Reid received a 57-month sentence, which, due in large part to three prior drug-trafficking convictions, represented the low-end of his guideline range. On appeal, Reid argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable, because it resulted in an unwarranted sentencing disparity in light of the sentences imposed on Christie and James.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-14\">We review the reasonableness of a sentence under a \u201cdeferential abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). One factor that the district court must consider is \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">In this case, the district court properly considered and rejected Reid\u2019s sentencing-disparity argument. Reid\u2019s argument incorrectly assumes that he is \u201csimilarly situated\u201d to both James and Christie. <em>See United States v. Spoerke, </em>568 F.3d 1236, 1252 (11th Cir.2009). But James is not a \u201cvalid comparator for \u00a7 3553(a)(6) purposes\u201d because he was never charged with an offense, let alone \u201cfound guilty of similar conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1241 (11th Cir.2006). And Reid and Christie plainly do not have \u201csimilar records.\u201d Reid has three prior drug-trafficking convictions and has previously been deported; Christie, on the other hand, has no criminal history at all. Thus, even if, as Reid argues, the government was lenient with James and Christie, the government\u2019s alleged failure to afford Reid similar leniency did not result in an unwarranted sentencing disparity. Accordingly, we affirm Reid\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
