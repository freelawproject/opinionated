On appeal, Martinez-Caceres contends that the district court erred by imposing an enhanced sentence based on a felony conviction that was not set forth in the charging information. He recognizes that <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) holds that a prior conviction is not an element of the offense under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), but he argues that <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) and subsequent cases have called the validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>into question. He asserts that we should not apply <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>to the \u201cdistinguishable facts\u201d of his case. For the reasons stated below, we affirm Martinez-Caceres\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">We review constitutional issues <em>de novo. United States v. Steed, </em>548 F.3d 961, 978 (11th Cir.2008). In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>the Supreme Court explained that a prior conviction used to enhance a sentence under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is not an element of the offense, and, therefore, it need not be alleged in the indictment or found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 226-27, 118 S.Ct. at 1222. Although <em>Apprendi </em>and subsequent decisions have cast doubt on the reasoning of <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>we have repeatedly explained that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding precedent unless and until that case is expressly overruled by the Supreme Court. <em>Steed, </em>548 F.3d at 979-80; <em>United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273-76 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1246-47 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">Martinez-Caceres\u2019s argument that the district court erred by enhancing his sentence based on a prior conviction not charged in the information is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 226-27, 118 S.Ct. at 1222. As noted above, <em>Almendarez-Tor-res </em>remains binding precedent in this Circuit unless and until it is overruled by the Supreme Court. <em>See Steed, </em>548 F.3d at 979-80; <em>Greer, </em>440 F.3d at 1273-76; <em>Gibson, </em>434 F.3d at 1246-47. Although Martinez-Caceres suggests that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is distinguishable, he does not point to any differences between that case and his own. <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>addressed the same legal question and the same statute that are at issue in this case. <em>See Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 226-27, 118 S.Ct. at 1222. <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>is directly on point, and, under that decision, the district court did not err by imposing an enhanced sentence based on a conviction not alleged in the information. Accordingly, we affirm Martinez-Caceres\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
