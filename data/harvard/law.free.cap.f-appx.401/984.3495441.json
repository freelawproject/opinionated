He was sentenced to 160 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release. Forge appeals the denial of his pro se 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 motion in which he argued that his sentence should be reduced based on retroactive amendments to the Guidelines for crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-21\">Forge\u2019s argument that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel when it denied his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion without first appointing counsel because the right to counsel attached under the advisory sentencing scheme is unavailing. A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding is not a full resentencing. <em>Dillon v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 2683, 2691-94, 177 L.Ed.2d 271 (2010); <em>United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 238 (5th Cir.2009). A motion for reduction of sentence is not an ancillary matter under the Criminal Justice Act, and Forge \u201chas no constitutional right to appointed counsel for the purpose of bringing a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion.\u201d <em>United States v.
