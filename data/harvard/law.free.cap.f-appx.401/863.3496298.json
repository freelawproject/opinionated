Webster was convicted after a jury trial of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of \u201ccrack\u201d cocaine. He was sentenced to life in prison after the district court found that he should be held accountable for 16 kilograms of crack cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-19\">By moving to proceed IFP, Webster is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision that his appeal was not taken in good faith because it is frivolous. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Webster argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion without first appointing him counsel and holding a hearing and that it abused its discretion in denying his motion without first converting the amount of drugs attributable to him to a marijuana equivalency pursuant to Amendment 711 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines. He argues that the district court failed to consider resentencing him under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. He also argues that the sentencing court plainly erred in assigning him four criminal history points.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-24\">The record indicates that the district court reduced Webster\u2019s base offense level to 38. His total offense level of 41, when combined with his criminal history category of III, yielded a recommended offense level of 360 months to life. The district court decided that because the amount of drugs distributed by Webster and the other members of the conspiracy was more than three times the top amount noted in the drug quantity table, it would not exercise its discretion to reduce Webster\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-25\">Webster was not entitled to a hearing or appointed counsel in connection with his \u00a7 3582(c) proceeding. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim. P. 43(b)(4); <em>United States v. Patterson, </em>42 F.3d 246, 248-49 (5th Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Hereford, </em>385 Fed.Appx. 366 (5th Cir.2010); <em>United States v. Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d 1007, 1011 (5th Cir.1995). In addition, Webster has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>that, based upon the amount of drugs involved in the conspiracy, his sentence should remain the same. <em>See United States v. Evans, </em>587 F.3d 667, 672-74 (5th Cir.2009), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 3462, 177 L.Ed.2d 1064 (2010); <em>Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d at 1010.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Webster\u2019s argument that, based upon <em>Kimbrough </em>and <em>Booker, </em>the district court should have sentenced him below the revised guidelines range is unavailing. <em>See United States v. Doublin, </em>572 F.3d 235, 237-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 130 S.Ct. 517, 175 L.Ed.2d 366 (2009). In addition, because Webster\u2019s sentence was based upon an amount of crack cocaine, the district court was not obligated to convert any drug amount to marijuana when determining his revised base offense level. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, comment, (n. 10(B), (D)). Notably, Webster may not, in the context of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, challenge the sentencing court\u2019s finding that any powder cocaine attributed to him was converted to crack cocaine for sale to others. <em>See Whitebird, </em>55 F.3d at 1010. He also cannot challenge his criminal history calculation in the context of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">As Webster has failed to show that his appeal involves a nonfrivolous issue, <em>see Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 220 (5th Cir.1983), his motion for IFP is DENIED. Because the appeal is frivolous, it is DISMISSED. See 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b891-20\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
