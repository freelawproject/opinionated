Price filed for benefits on account of diabetes, joint pain, a bad back, fatigue, depi'ession, high blood pressure, and difficulty sleeping. The Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits was upheld by the ALJ, and Price requested review of the ALJ\u2019s decision by the Appeals Council, which refused to reverse the decision of the ALJ. Price sought judicial review in the district court, which, relying on the recommendation of the magistrate judge, affirmed the decision of the ALJ. Price timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-15\">Our review of the denial of disability benefits, like that of the district court, is limited to determining whether substantial record evidence exists to support the Commissioner\u2019s decision to deny benefits and whether the ALJ misapplied the law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We will neither make credibility determinations nor re-weigh the evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The ALJ does not need to comment on every piece of evidence, but only must build an accurate and logical bridge between the evidence and the final determination.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The ALJ must consider the testimony of the claimant, but need not accept the claimant\u2019s contention as to the severity of his condition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1014-16\">The ALJ determined that Price was able to engage in substantial gainful activity because he could perform work in light of his residual functional capacity (RFC).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"987\">*987</page-number>Sufficient evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that Price had the residual capacity to perform work. The ALJ engaged all of the relevant evidence, made credibility determinations, and explained reasons for discounting some of the evidence in the record. We will not second guess these determinations on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-5\">The ALJ specifically noted Price\u2019s back and leg pain, as well as Price\u2019s testimony concerning his limitations. The ALJ did not find the testimony entirely persuasive, noting that Price can cook, do housework, and drive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The ALJ observed that an MRI in 2007 evidenced only mild degeneration in the lumbar spine. The ALJ discussed how Price responded positively to Ultram, thus determining that Price\u2019s claims of the intensity of his pain were not entirely credible. The ALJ also discussed the pain and limitations in Price\u2019s right shoulder, and noted that treatment has been somewhat successful and that Price himself noted improvement in his shoulder functioning. The ALJ mentioned Price\u2019s sleeping problems and reasonably concluded that Price should not perform exertion-ally demanding work or work involving the lifting or carrying of items in excess of 20 pounds. The ALJ also addressed Price\u2019s claim that he had to keep his feet elevated and found these claims unsupported by the record and less than credible. Neither did the ALJ believe that Price\u2019s depression was significantly limiting, noting that Price had stated that psychotropic drugs had improved his depression and that Price was able to function while living on his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">We do not agree with Price that the ALJ failed to rely on the reports and opinions of the treating physicians. It is legal error for an ALJ to give more weight to a non-treating physician than to a treating physician,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> but the ALJ need not give controlling weight to a treating physician\u2019s determination if it is contradicted by the record.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Price\u2019s treating doctors do not make any claim that he is disabled; they merely discuss the symptoms described by Price and addressed by the ALJ. In light of the record as a whole, the ALJ could reasonably have determined Price\u2019s limitations in the way that he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-11\">A vocational expert\u2019s opinion must be based on appropriate hypothetical questions.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We are convinced that the hypothetical question posed by the ALJ was appropriate, and thus that the vocational expert\u2019s opinion was sufficient to constitute substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1014-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
