But with the credits allowed by the 1937 Revision, 11:27-2 and 11:27-3, to a veteran with a record of disability prosecutor\u2019s position became No. 12 and was so certified. Appointments to the force were actually made to and beyond that number. The commissioner, after a personal interview with prosecutor, addressed this communication to the Civil Service Commission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-6\">\u201cReplying to your letter of July 23d, returning certification for the position of Motor Vehicle Inspector, I have to advise that I concluded- \u2014 after a lengthy interview with Ira Collins \u2014 that he lacked the business capacity to fill the position of Motor Vehicle Inspector.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">We think that that communication recorded a finding of fact and was, further, in legal effect, a certification of that finding, namely, that the prosecutor lacked the business capacity essential to one who would fill the position of motor vehicle inspector. Prosecutor argues that in point of fact the commissioner could not so find and that the statute (1937 Revision 11:27-4) gives a presumption of capacity. A degree of discretion is lodged in an appointing official with respect to the business qualifications and fitness of a candidate certified by the Civil Service Commission. The statute is not conclusive. <em>McGlinchey </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>12 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>188; <em>Edell </em>v. <em>McDermott, </em>11 <em>Id. </em>272. See, also, <em>Horowitz </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission, </em>12 <em>Id. </em>190; <em>affirmed, </em>112 <em>N. J. L. </em>499, and <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Orlando, </em>119 <em>Id. </em>227. The record does not, in our opinion, disclose an abuse of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">If we are correct thus far, it follows that prosecutor, in failing of the appointment, was not deprived of any of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">The writ of <em>certiorari </em>will be dismissed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
