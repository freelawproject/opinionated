When the train stopped at the Journal Square station plaintiff walked to a regular door provided for the entrance and exit of passengers. The door opened \u201cabout a foot\u201d and then remained open for about \u201ca second or two.\u201d The door apparently stuck, and desiring to make her exit plaintiff pushed the door open wider \u201cwhen all of a sudden\u201d the door \u201cslammed back\u201d and injured her \u201cright hand across the knuckles\u201d inflicting injuries for which she sought damages by this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">Although plaintiff testified that immediately after the accident she told the trainman \u201cyou slammed the door on my hand,\u201d and the trainman replied, \u201cI am sorry,\u201d the defendant, without denying or admitting the plaintiff\u2019s presence on the train, denied that she or anyone else made any such complaint. The testimony of defendant\u2019s physician, however, corroborated plaintiff\u2019s injuries to her hand. There was ample proof before the trial judge, as the trier of the facts, to support his findings that defendant was negligent and that plaintiff was free from contributory negligence or from assumption of risk. The trial judge was, therefore, correct in denying defendant\u2019s motions to nonsuit and to direct a verdict. <em>Cf. Tarnow </em>v. <em>Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Co., </em>120 <em>N. J. L. </em>505, lA-2d, 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">Defendant next argues that the court erred in permitting plaintiff to testify as to the amount paid by her for medical attention. The error charged is that there was no proof to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>support the necessity of treatment or fairness of the charges made. <em>Peterson </em>v. <em>Zaremba, </em>110 <em>N. J. L. 529; </em>166 <em>Atl. Rep. 527. </em>But that case is without application; it is clearly distinguishable. There bills alone were offered in evidence for nursing and medical expenditures. And the court held-\u2014 in the absence of the \u201cslightest proof of the necessity or fairness of these bills\u201d \u2014 that they \u201cdid not prove themselves\u201d and were, therefore, \u201cimproperly admitted.\u201d Not so here. Plaintiff properly and in the orderly course of submitting her proof testified to the fact that she was treated by her family physician. She described the treatment, the number of visits and the amount of the bill incurred. Such proof was held to be proper and competent in <em>Brodsky </em>v. <em>Red Raven Rubber Co. (Court of Errors and Appeals), </em>111 <em>N. J. L. </em>453, 455; 168 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>440, 441. But even if it be assumed that the safer or better practice is to produce supplemental proof as to the necessity and reasonableness of the doctor\u2019s services and charges, defendant is not, under the proofs of the case at bar, in a position to challenge plaintiff\u2019s failure to supply such proofs. Eor as pointed out by Mr. Justice Parker for the Court of Errors and Appeals in <em>Keber </em>v. <em>American Stores Co., </em>116 <em>N. J. L. </em>437; 184 <em>Atl. Rep. </em>795 (at <em>p. </em>440) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-4\">\u201c* * * The ordinary practice is. of course, that where there is testimony which is incompetent, unless supplemented by other testimony, the trial court is entitled to assume for the time being that the supplementary testimony will be produced before the party closes his case; and hence error cannot be predicated upon the refusing to strike out the testimony before such supplemental testimony is either furnished or the case is closed without it. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Here defendant did not move at the end of plaintiff\u2019s case, or at any time, to strike her testimony as incomplete although it did object and except to the admission of plaintiff\u2019s proof. Defendant is not entitled, therefore, to allege error on that score. <em>Keber </em>v. <em>American Stores Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">Judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
