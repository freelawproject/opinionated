It will be noted that Magiera, the plaintiff below, is the prosecutor of this writ. The sole question before us on this motion is whether or not the statute requires the filing of a bond where a writ of <em>certiorari </em>was allowed, as in the instant ease, upon application of the plaintiff in the action in which the order was made which is sought to be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">The statute in question, <em>R. 8. 2:32-217, </em>218, in our view, does not distinguish between plaintiffs or defendants in the action below, nor does it relate to judgments only. It provides that a bond is required from \u201cthe party applying\u201d for the removal of \u201ca judgment, order or proceeding of a District Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-12\">While we feel obliged, therefore, to rule that a bond is necessary in the instant case, we will grant the motion to dismiss the writ only in the event that the statutory bond be not filed forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
