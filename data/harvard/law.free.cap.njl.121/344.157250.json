The mortgage was conditioned upon the payment of the principal sum of $400, with interest. No definite day of payment was prescribed. According to the affidavit annexed in compliance with the statute, this sum was loaned to the mortgagor by the mortgagee on July 8th, 1935, to be repaid \u201cwithin thirty days.\u201d The mortgage was recorded on the day of its date, and possession remained in the mortgagor.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-11\">The essential points now in contention are (a) whether there was compliance with the rule respecting demand for possession of the chattel prior to the commencement of this action, and (b) whether plaintiff\u2019s mortgage is void as to defendant for failure of execution in conformance with chap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>ter 166 of the laws of 1931, relating to bills of sale for motor vehicles. <em>Pamph. L. </em>1931, <em>p. </em>312; 2?. <em>S. </em>1937, 39:10-1 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The Common Pleas judge, sitting without a jury by consent, ruled that, as regards plaintiff, defendant\u2019s \u201cpossession of the ear was illegal;\u201d that a demand for possession was in fact made before the issuance of the writ, and that, in any event, plaintiff in the particular circumstances \u201chad a right to assume that a formal written demand would have been futile, of no benefit to defendant or obeyed by it;\u201d and that \u201ca chattel mortgage properly executed and recorded is effective upon an automobile * * * even though the provisions\u201d of the act adverted to \u201chave not been performed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Defendant appeals from the consequent judgment of possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">The point first made is decisive, and there is therefore no occasion to consider the second.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">These are the pertinent facts: The writ of replevin was issued and served upon defendant on November 8th, 1937. It is stipulated that the service was accompanied by \u201ca written demand\u201d upon defendant \u201cfor the immediate possession and surrender of said automobile.\u201d And the under-sheriff testified that after the writ of replevin, \u201csigned and sealed by the County Clerk\u201d and having attached thereto the written demand for possession, was handed to him for service upon defendant, he communicated by telephone \u2014 at the request of plaintiff\u2019s attorney \u2014 with a clerk (who was not an attorney-at-law) in the office of defendant\u2019s attorneys retained in the matter of the execution of the judgment, and asked whether defendant would \u201crelease the ear\u201d without service of the writ, and received a reply in the negative. Service was thereupon made upon the clerk. Being in doubt as to its validity, he recovered the writ and the accompanying demand for possession, and immediately served them upon defendant\u2019s treasurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">Whatever may be the rule in other jurisdictions, the principle is firmly embedded in our jurisprudence that a chattel mortgage, like one covering lands, is in its essence a mere security for the payment of the mortgage debt. The mort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>gagor, before and after default \u2014 until divested by grant, release or foreclosure \u2014 has an estate which the law recognizes as the proper subject of seizure and sale under the ordinary process of law. It is likewise such an estate as is in law capable of conveyance and mortgage. This rule obtains both as to realty and personalty. The property in the mortgaged chattels does not, upon default, become absolute in the mortgagee. If, after condition broken, the mortgagee takes the chattels into possession, he cannot keep or dispose of them as his absolute property. If he retains them, they are subject to redemption by the mortgagor, and, upon satisfaction of the mortgage debt, his title terminates. <em>Woodside </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>40 <em>N. J. L. </em>417; <em>Doughton &amp; Wilson </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>10 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>323; <em>Luse </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>39 <em>N. J. L. </em>707; <em>Outcalt </em>v. <em>Durling, </em>25 <em>Id. </em>443; <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>17 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>44; <em>Bird </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>14 <em>Id. </em>467. See, also, <em>Sears, Roebuck </em>&amp; <em>Co. </em>v. <em>Camp. </em>124 <em>Id. </em>403.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">It is a corollary of the foregoing that the mortgagee also has an action for any substantial injury to his interest. If, in the assertion of a right against the mortgagor, there be a seizure and sale of the mortgaged chattels by a third party, in defiance or to the exclusion or prejudice of the rights of the mortgagee, there is such an exercise of dominion as constitutes an actionable invasion of the mortgagee\u2019s rights. <em>Woodside </em>v. <em>Adams, supra; Miller </em>ads. <em>Pancoast, </em>29 <em>N. J. L. </em>250; <em>Charter </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>3 <em>Denio </em>33; <em>Wheeler </em>v. <em>McFarland, </em>10 <em>Wend. </em>318.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">So viewed, defendant\u2019s possession of the mortgaged automobile was lawful. The taking of possession of the chattel under the execution was not, <em>per se, </em>a hostile act as respects plaintiff\u2019s mortgage. So far as is disclosed, the purpose was to reach only the leviable interest of the mortgagor in the chattel. There is no proof of an intention to sell and dispose of the vehicle in disregard of plaintiff\u2019s rights under his mortgage. To borrow the language of Mr. Justice Depue in <em>Woodside </em>v. <em>Adams, supra </em>(at <em>p. </em>420), the levy was not accompanied <em>\u201cby </em>such acts or conduct as evince an intention to assert under it a right hostile to the rights of the mortgagee. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>The placing of a levy on the mortgaged property is, <em>per se, </em>no more a trespass or conversion, or intermeddling with the property of the mortgagee, than the taking of a second mortgage, or a conveyance of property, real or personal, which is subject to a prior mortgage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Defendant having come into lawful possession of the chattel, it was incumbent upon plaintiff to prove an unlawful detention. This he failed to do. \u201cThere must be an actual conversion, or a refusal to deliver on demand, which is evidence of conversion, before the detention becomes unlawful. To constitute a conversion of goods there must be some repudiation by the defendant of the owner\u2019s right, or some exercise of dominion over them by him inconsistent with such right, or some act done which has the effect of destroying or changing the quality of the chattel.\u201d <em>Woodside </em>v. <em>Adams, supra </em>(at <em>pp. </em>430, 431). See, also, <em>Crown Co. </em>v. <em>Reilly, </em>88 <em>N. J. L. </em>590; <em>Resnick </em>v. <em>Jefferson Holding, &amp;c., Association, </em>14 <em>N. J. Mis. R. </em>875; <em>Veader </em>v. <em>Veader, </em>87 <em>N. J. L. </em>140; <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>De Leuce, </em>89 <em>Id. </em>161; <em>Voorhees </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>107 <em>Id. </em>134; <em>F. A. North Co. </em>v. <em>McClellan, </em>116 <em>Id. </em>145. There was no demand for possession of the chattel before the commencement of the action. The demand upon the lawyer\u2019s clerk, assuming for present purposes he bore to defendant the requisite relationship, and it was otherwise efficacious, was made subsequent to the institution of suit. There is nothing in the proofs to suggest that if plaintiff, asserting the validity of the mortgage and his intention to enforce it, had made a timely demand for possession, defendant would not have rendered compliance. And so there is no basis for the finding below that a formal written demand would have been futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The judgment is accordingly reversed, with costs; and the cause is remanded for the entry of summary judgment in favor of defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
