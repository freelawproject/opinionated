Lewis Davis.</em></attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b397-8\">Heher, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4n\">In 1934, at a referendum election held pursuant to section 44 of the act relating to alcoholic beverages <em>(Pamph. L. </em>1933, <em>pp. </em>1180,1211, as amended by chapter 257, <em>Pamph. L. </em>1935, <em>p. </em>818; <em>R. 8. </em>1937, 33 :l-47), the electors of the borough of Runnemede, in the county of Camden, resolved in the negative the question of whether the sale of alcoholic beverages should \u201cbe permitted on Sundays\u201d in the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">At a meeting held on September 30th, 1937, the municipal governing body adopted a resolution directing the resubmission of that identical question to the voters of the municipality at the ensuing general election. The referendum was had accordingly; and the question was answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">The resolution of resubmission was based upon a petition filed with the governing body under section 44 of the Beverage Control act, <em>supra, </em>signed by the requisite number of qualified electors, requesting a referendum on the question of whether the sale of alcoholic beverages should \u201cbe permitted on Sundays in the municipality after 1:00 F. m. ;\u201d and on December 27th, 1937, the commissioner of alcoholic beverage control, in response to the borough clerk\u2019s request for his \u201copinion on the whole matter, that is in regard to the question submitted, and the legal hours of sales now in this Borough on Sunday,\u201d advised the clerk by letter that, in view of the failure of the governing body to submit the question demanded in the petition, the referendum was \u201cvoid and of no effect,\u201d and therefore the \u201cprevious referendum,\u201d held in 1934, resulting in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>prohibition of Sunday sales of alcoholic beverages, \u201chas never been superseded,\u201d and \u201cno sales of alcoholic beverages may be lawfully made at any time on Sundays in Eunnemede.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">The return shows that on Sunday, January 2d, 1938, representatives of the defendant commissioner \u201cexplained\u201d to prosecutor, the holder of a plenary retail consumption license issued by the local governing body, that \u201cthere was some controversy\u201d relating to \u201cthe wording on the ballot concerning open Sunday and until the matter was definitely settled licensed premises should remain closed on Sunday as the licensee would be subject to revocation proceedings and might lose the license for the premises;\u201d that the \u2018licensee was responsible for the conduct of his premises and he would have to decide for himself if he wanted to be subject to revocation proceedings;\u201d and that prosecutor expressed his \u201cdesire to do what\u201d the defendant-commissioner \u201cdesired,\u201d and informed them that he \u201cwould immediately close,\u201d and acted accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Prosecutor maintains that the referendum is not subject to collateral attack- \u2014 citing <em>State, ex rel. Love </em>v. <em>Freeholders of Hudson County, </em>35 <em>N. J. L. </em>269; <em>O\u2019Donnel </em>v. <em>Dusman, </em>39 <em>Id. </em>677; <em>Conger </em>v. <em>Convery, </em>52 <em>Id. </em>417; <em>Winters </em>v. <em>Warmolts, </em>70 <em>Id. </em>615; <em>Long Branch </em>v. <em>Sloane, </em>49 <em>Id. </em>356; <em>Camden </em>v. <em>Mulford, </em>26 <em>Id. </em>49, 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">It is the insistence of the defendant commissioner, on the other hand, that the referendum \u201cwas void on its face,\u201d in that a petition for the submission of that particular question was a jurisdictional prerequisite, and the whole proceeding is therefore a nullity \u2014 citing <em>App </em>v. <em>Stockton, </em>61 <em>N. J. L. </em>520; <em>Carron </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>26 <em>Id. </em>594; <em>State </em>v. <em>Mayor and Aldermen of Jersey City, </em>36 <em>Id. </em>188.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">There is no occasion to consider this question. The return reveals no action reviewable on <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">It is stipulated that, following the reply to the clerk\u2019s inquiry, to which we have adverted, the defendant commissioner, through his investigators, notified the local licensees, including prosecutor, \u201cof the contents of his letter\u201d to the clerk, and <em>advised </em>them that, in the event of Sunday sales of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>alcoholic beverages, \u201che- would cause proceedings to be instituted for violation of the Control act;\u201d that prosecutor \u201cthereafter kept his licensed place of business closed on Sundays;\u201d and that \u201cno other judicial proceedings have been instituted by the defendant\u201d commissioner, \u201cor the borough of Runnemede or any other person to determine the validity of the referendum.\u201d The return reveals that the commissioner\u2019s representatives were not authorized to direct the closing of prosecutor\u2019s place of business on Sundays; nor did they do so. As pointed out, he was distinctly informed that \u201cthere was some controversy\u201d respecting the validity of the referendum, and that it was his responsibility, as the licensee, to determine upon a course of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">And so the commissioner did not, in the matter complained of, profess to exercise authority conferred by section 36 of the Beverage Control act, <em>supra,. </em>He did not undertake to review the referendum proceedings; nor did he, by word or deed, lay claim to or indicate an assumption of such judicial authority by virtue of his office. He merely gave voice, in compliance with the municipal clerk\u2019s request for an expression of his view, to the opinion that the election was void, and therefore afforded no justification for Sunday sales of alcoholic beverages. It was neither a judicial determination nor an administrative act subject to review by <em>certiorari. </em>He went no further than to say that, such being his opinion, Sunday sales would impose upon him the duty of action as for violation of the law. In venturing this opinion, he was exercising a right common to <em>all </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>to disregard an action that, for jurisdictional lack, is a nullity, and therefore subject to collateral attack. <em>Maguire </em>v. <em>Van Meter, </em>121 <em>N. J. L. </em>150.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">It is the settled rule in this court that <em>\u201ccertiorari </em>will not lie to revise or correct erroneous opinions, however hurtful they may be to individuals concerning whom they are expressed. An order, judgment or determination affecting the rights of prosecutors is necessary as a foundation for the use of the writ. * * * The writ of <em>certiorari </em>cannot be used to draw judicial opinions in advance or to affect adjudications of subordinate tribunals.\u201d <em>Newark </em>v. Fordyce, 88 <em>N. J. L. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>440; <em>Livingston </em>v. <em>Rector, &amp;c., of Trinity Church, </em>45 <em>Id. </em>230; <em>Drake </em>v. <em>Plume, </em>44 <em>Id. </em>362; <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Medical Society of New Jersey, </em>38 <em>Id. </em>377.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The desire of prosecutor to have a judicial review of the opinion thus given is understandable; but it would be a decided innovation \u2014 at variance with settled principles that make for orderly administration of justice and also productive of needless litigation \u2014 to anticipate, on the basis of a mere expression of opinion as to the state of the law or its application to the facts of a given case, the ultimate action of a statutory tribunal in the exercise of judicial or quasi-judicial powers after hearing had on notice to the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">There is therefore no occasion to express an opinion on the validity or effect of the last referendum; and we reserve that question.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The writ is accordingly dismissed, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
