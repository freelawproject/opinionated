PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY OF AMERICA, DEFENDANT-RESPONDENT.</parties>\n<otherdate data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b408-4\">Submitted May 3, 1938</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A6u\">Decided November 16, 1938.</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b408-8\">Before Brogan, Chief Justice, and Justices Bodine and Hehee.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b408-9\">Eor the appellant, <em>Jacob I. Polkowiiz.</em></attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b408-10\">For the respondent, <em>R. E. &amp; A. D. Watson (A. Dudley Watson, </em>of counsel).</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b408-11\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b408-12\">Heher, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGR\">Plaintiff sued upon a policy of insurance issued by defendant upon the life of her husband. She was the designated beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-13\">While the policy was in force, defendant made a loan to the assured, and issued a \u201cloan policy\u201d in the amount of the loan upon the assured\u2019s life, payable to it \u201cin repayment of indebtedness on account of loan [thus] advanced\u201d under the original policy. And it was defendant\u2019s contention that, while the loan so made remained unpaid, the original policy lapsed for non-payment of the stipulated premium, and that the loan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>was repaid from the cash surrender value of the lapsed policy, leaving a balance of $2.40 \u201cas the net value of the policy on the date of lapse,\u201d which \u201cwas used to purchase extended insurance at the pending age for the modified amount-of insurance * * * for a period of fifty-five days,\u201d when the policy \u201cwas canceled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Thereafter the assured died; and his widow, as the designated beneficiary of the policy thus claimed to have lapsed and to have been ultimately canceled, instituted this action, on the theory that \u201cthe purpose of said loan insurance was to maintain\u201d the original policy \u201cin its full benefits,\u201d and that, \u201calthough the defendant was the named beneficiary\u201d of the loan policy, \u201cit was so made payable * * * for the benefit of the plaintiff,\u201d as the beneficiary under the original policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">The issue was tried before the Common Pleas judge, sitting without a jury by consent. Evidence was adduced by both parties. Motions for a nonsuit and direction of a verdict in its favor were made by defendant. Decision was reserved on each motion; and the record shows that subsequently \u201cthe court found in favor of the defendant,\u201d and ordered judgment final in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">The grounds of appeal are palpably deficient. They are two in number, and aver error by the trial judge (1) \u201cin giving a verdict to the defendant,\u201d and (2) \u201cin not giving a verdict to the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">These assignments set up matters that are reviewable only on rule to show cause. To secure a review of a judgment on error under chapter 62 of the laws of 1916 <em>(Pamph. L., p. </em>109; <em>B. S. </em>1937, 2:27-344 <em>et seq.), </em>it is requisite that the asserted errors of law residing in the findings of the trial judge be specified in the grounds of appeal filed and served, as required by rule 139 of this court. <em>Pannonia Building and Loan Association </em>v. <em>West Side Trust Co., </em>93 <em>N. J. L. </em>377; <em>Golden Realty Co. </em>v. <em>Grant Building and Loan Association, </em>109 <em>Id. </em>129; <em>Eckert </em>v. <em>Nazzaro, </em>109 <em>Id. </em>136; <em>Cohn </em>v. <em>Passaic National Bank and Trust Co., </em>109 <em>Id. </em>449; <em>Stassi </em>v. <em>De Fronzo, </em>110 <em>Id. </em>35; <em>Assin </em>v. <em>Traveler\u2019s Indemnity Co., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>114 <em>Id. </em>425; <em>Caspert </em>v. <em>Empire Furniture Co., </em>114 <em>Id. </em>546; <em>Press </em>v. <em>Klink, </em>115 <em>Id. </em>475; <em>Biczis </em>v. <em>Public Service Co-ordinated Transport, </em>115 <em>Id. </em>407; <em>Pollack </em>v. <em>New Jersey Bell Telephone Co., </em>116 <em>Id. </em>28.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Under this statute, \u201ca judgment presupposes a finding of facts in favor of the successful party, even if such finding be not expressed in terms, and also presupposes that, in the opinion of the judge, that party is entitled to the judgment by the law arising upon the facts.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Cruse, </em>101 <em>N. J. L. </em>82.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The appeal is accordingly dismissed, but without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
