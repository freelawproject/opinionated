WRIGHT, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">Today we consider what remedies are available to a federal employee who has work-related differences with his supervisors. Specifically, we decide whether a federal employee may use either a constitutional or a common law tort theory to sue his supervisors over disputes growing out of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b927-16\">Jeffrey Saul worked for the Social Security Administration (SSA) in Seattle as a Claims Representative. He also served as a union representative for the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE). His supervisors at the SSA included Ray Larsen, an Area Director, and Colleen St. Louis, Saul\u2019s immediate supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-17\">Saul sued Larsen and St. Louis in state court, charging constitutional and common law torts. He alleged that St. Louis had seized and opened personal mail addressed to him at the office, thereby violating his constitutional rights and invading his privacy. He further alleged that Larsen had twice defamed him<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and that both supervisors had tortiously inflicted emotional distress upon him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-18\">The defendants removed to federal district court by invoking 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1442(a)(1). They convinced the district court that they were entitled to absolute immunity under the doctrine of <em>Barr v. Matteo, </em>360 U.S. 564, 79 S.Ct. 1335, 3 L.Ed.2d 1434 (1959),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Judge McGovern entered summary judgment for them. Saul appealed the district court\u2019s acceptance of removal jurisdiction and its determination that his supervisors were immune from his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-19\">We affirmed initially by an unpublished memorandum. Simultaneously, however, the Supreme Court altered the analysis of federal employees\u2019 immunity by its deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>sions in <em>Forrester v. White, </em>484 U.S. 219, 108 S.Ct. 538, 98 L.Ed.2d 555 (1988), and <em>Westfall v. Erwin, </em>484 U.S. 292, 108 S.Ct. 580, 98 L.Ed.2d 619 (1988). On Saul\u2019s petition for rehearing we vacated our memorandum, reversed the grant of summary-judgment and remanded for the district court\u2019s reconsideration of the immunity issue in light of <em>Westfall </em>and <em>Forrester. Saul v. Larsen, </em>847 F.2d 573, 576 (9th Cir.1988) <em>(Saul I).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">While this case was pending on remand, Congress responded to <em>Westfall </em>by enacting the Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988, Pub.L. No. 100-694, 102 Stat. 4563 <em>(Westfall </em>Act). The <em>Westfall </em>Act amended the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2671 et seq., to protect federal employees from personal liability. <em>Westfall </em>Act \u00a7 2(b). In tort actions against federal employees, the act required substituting the United States as sole defendant if the Attorney General certified that the defendant employee had acted within the scope of employment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 6 (now codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(d)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A United States Attorney certified that Larsen and St. Louis had acted within the scope Of their employments.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">At issue now are several rulings by the district court on remand. First, following the <em>Westfall </em>Act certification, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to substitute the United States as the sole defendant of the common law tort claims. Saul contests this substitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">Second, the district court granted partial summary judgment dismissing Saul\u2019s constitutional tort claim. It found this claim precluded by the special factor of federal employment. Saul disputes this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">The United States moved for summary judgment on the common law tort claims. Saul opposed this motion. He sought to amend his complaint concerning the opening of mail to seek both injunctive relief and class relief on behalf of all SSA employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">Judge McGovern denied Saul leave to amend and entered summary judgment dismissing his common law tort claims. He found that Saul had failed to exhaust the administrative claim requirements of the FTCA. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2672, 2675(a). He also found that the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), Pub.L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 5 U.S.C.), preempted Saul\u2019s common law tort claims, depriving the court of subject matter jurisdiction. Saul\u2019s third and fourth arguments on appeal challenge the denial of leave to amend and the summary dismissal of his common law tort claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b928-11\">Only three legal issues require our resolution. First, we must decide whether Saul\u2019s federal employment status precludes him from bringing a constitutional tort action to challenge his supervisor\u2019s work-related conduct. Second, we must determine whether the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA) preempts Saul\u2019s common law tort claims. Third, we must consider whether the district court erred in denying Saul leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-12\">Because Saul appeals from grants of summary judgment, our review is de novo. <em>See Kruso v. International Tel. &amp; Tel. Corp., </em>872 F.2d 1416, 1421 (9th Cir. 1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 110 S.Ct. 3217, 110 L.Ed.2d 664 (1990). We must view both the facts and the inferences to be drawn from them in the light most favorable to Saul, the nonmoving party. We consider whether genuine issues of material fact preclude summary judgment, and whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law. <em>See Tzung v. State Farm Fire and Casualty Co., </em>873 F.2d 1338, 1339-40 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-15\">The CSRA is the bedrock of our analysis, for we conclude that it precludes Saul\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim and preempts his state tort claims. We begin by examining the CSRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">THE CIVIL SERVICE REFORM ACT OF 1978</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Congress enacted the CSRA to replace \u201can outdated patchwork of statutes and rules built up over almost a century.\u201d S.Rep. No. 969, 95th Cong., 2d Sess. 3, 53 (1978), <em>reprinted in </em>1978 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 2723, 2725 (Senate Report).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The goal was \u201ca single unified personnel policy which [takes] into account the requirements of all the various laws and goals governing Federal personnel management.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2775. The Act \u201creplaced the patchwork system with an integrated scheme <em>of </em>administrative and judicial review, designed to balance the legitimate interests of the various categories of federal employees with the needs of sound and efficient administration.\u201d <em>United States v. Fausto, </em>484 U.S. 439, 445, 108 S.Ct. 668, 672, 98 L.Ed.2d 830 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">Two of the CSRA\u2019s several appeal mechanisms are relevant here. The act permits federal employees to challenge \u201cprohibited personnel practices\u201d by their supervisors. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302. It also requires that any collective bargaining agreement covering federal employees contain a grievance procedure that culminates in binding arbitration. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7121. The United States argues that Saul could have challenged the actions of Larsen and St. Louis through either of these CSRA appeal procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b929-9\">Prohibited Personnel Practices</p>\n<p id=\"AsH\">The \u201cprohibited personnel practices\u201d of the CSRA include taking \u201cpersonnel action[s]\u201d violative of its merit system principles. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302(b)(ll). The merit system principles include treating employees fairly and equitably, \u201cwith proper regard for their privacy and constitutional rights,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2301(b)(2), as well as protecting employees against arbitrary action and personal favoritism. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2301(b)(8)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-12\">The Act offers an administrative remedy to federal employees who allege prohibited personnel practices.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Office of Special Counsel (OSC) must receive allegations of prohibited personnel practices and perform any necessary investigation. CSRA \u00a7 202(a) (formerly 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1206(a)(1)), <em>repealed in part by </em>Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 \u00a7 3(a)(8), Pub.L. No. 101-12 \u00a7 3(a)(8), 103 Stat. 16, 18. That office must report back to the person who alleged the prohibited practice. <em>Id. </em>(formerly 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1206(a)(2)). When the OSC has reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, it may petition the Merit System Protection Board (MSPB) to stay the personnel action, <em>id. </em>(formerly 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1208), or to correct the prohibited personnel practice. <em>Id. </em>(formerly 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1206(c)(1)(B)). It may even seek disciplinary action- against the employee who committed the prohibited practice. <em>Id. </em>(formerly 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1206(g)). Saul did not initiate a complaint to the Office of Special Counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-13\">The CSRA makes a \u201cpersonnel action\u201d an element of a prohibited personnel practice. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2302. It defines \u201cpersonnel action\u201d as including \u201cdisciplinary or corrective action,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2302(a)(2)(A)(iii), but it provides no definitions for these latter terms. Saul argues that he could not have challenged the opening of his mail under the procedures for prohibited personnel practices, because the definition of \u201cpersonnel action\u201d encompasses only actions bearing some relationship to employees\u2019 pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>We reject this cramped construction of \u201cpersonnel action.\u201d The CSRA\u2019s legislative history indicates that Congress rejected a pay-relatedness requirement. The House Conference Report states that \u201ca personnel action must be significant, but it need not be expected to result in a reduction in pay or grade.\u201d House Conf. Report at 2863 (also indicates that some reassignments that do not affect pay are \u201cpersonnel actions\u201d; others are not). Congress did expect \u201cprohibited personnel practices\u201d to cover supervisors\u2019 violations of employees\u2019 constitutional and privacy rights. <em>See id. </em>at 2865.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">The term \u201ccorrective action\u201d in section 2302 can be read broadly enough to encompass the mail opening before us.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In her affidavit, St. Louis said that Saul\u2019s constitutional tort claim pertains to the SSA\u2019s mail-handling policies. While Saul accused her of abusing the mail policy, he raises no genuine factual issue about whether such a policy existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">An unconstitutional personnel action violates merit principles. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2301(b)(2). The prohibited personnel practices include taking any personnel action that \u201cviolates any law, rule or regulation implementing, or directly concerning, the merit system principles contained in section 2301.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2302(b)(ll). If the opening of Saul\u2019s mail was a \u201cpersonnel action\u201d by virtue of being \u201ccorrective action,\u201d then his allegation of its unconstitutionality constitutes a colorable claim that a prohibited personnel practice occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-6\">The plain meaning of \u201ccorrective action\u201d also encompasses Saul\u2019s defamation claims against Larsen. The allegedly defamatory letter responded to Saul\u2019s grievance and Saul asserts it was placed in his personnel file. The alleged oral defamations of Saul occurred during a phone call by Larsen to a congressional aide in which Larsen offered the SSA\u2019s position on issues Saul had raised in a letter to the aide\u2019s Congressman. If either the letter or the statements to the aide were false or defamatory, they would violate merit principles and would be prohibited personnel practices.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b930-9\">Saul\u2019s final complaint is that St. Louis tortiously inflicted emotional distress upon him by prohibiting him from sitting at his desk before 8:00 a.m. and from coming to work on weekends. He raises no genuine factual issue concerning St. Louis\u2019 defense that these orders were imposed to avoid unauthorized overtime work. The restrictions are further examples of \u201ccorrective\u201d actions that would violate merit principles if unjustly imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b930-11\">Grievances Under Collective Bargaining Agreements</p>\n<p id=\"b930-12\">The CSRA requires any collective bargaining agreement covering federal employees to contain a grievance procedure. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121. The statute defines a \u201cgrievance\u201d as \u201cany complaint ... by any employee concerning any matter relating to the employment of the employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7103(a)(9). A grievance procedure\u2019s scope is generally negotiable, except for a few subjects not relevant here. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7121(a)(2), (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-13\">The grievance procedure in Saul\u2019s collective bargaining agreement covered \u201cany <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>complaint ... by an employee(s) concerning any matter relating to the employment of the employee.\u201d <em>See </em>National Agreement Between Social Security Administration and AFGE (AFL-CIO) Art. 24, \u00a7 2 (effective June 11, 1982) (SSA-AFGE Agreement). It excluded only the statutorily-excepted topics. <em>Compare id. with </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7121(c). On its face, this language encompassed Saul\u2019s claims against Larsen and St. Louis.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Other provisions of Saul\u2019s collective bargaining agreement echoed the CSRA\u2019s requirement of fair and equitable treatment in all aspects of personnel management, \u201cwith proper regard and protection of their privacy and constitutional rights.\u201d SSA-AFGE Agreement Art. 3, \u00a7 2A. The agreement also provided whistleblower protections and protected employees from \u201crestraint, interference, coercion, discrimination or reprisal ... in seeking adjustment of grievances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Art. 3, \u00a7 3; Art. 24, \u00a7 5. Saul might have based a grievance upon any of these provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b931-7\">We complete our examination of the CSRA by observing that Congress took pains to define the interrelationships between the CSRA\u2019s appeal mechanisms. Where a prohibited personnel practice falls within the scope of a negotiated grievance procedure, the CSRA gives the aggrieved employee the option of pursuing either contractual or OSC remedies, but not both. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7121(d); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 7121(a)(1) (contractual grievance procedure is the exclusive remedy, unless grievance involves specifically excepted subjects). The act similarly defines the relationship of unfair labor practices<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> to grievances and to other statutory appeals. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 7116(d). These provisions reflect the congressional purposes of avoiding duplication and fragmentation of remedies. <em>Cf. </em>House Conf. Report at 2862.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-11\">With this foundation in mind, we consider the merits of Saul\u2019s appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b931-13\">CSRA PRECLUSION OF SAUL\u2019S CONSTITUTIONAL TORT CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b931-14\">Saul complained that St. Louis violated his constitutional rights by seizing and opening personal mail he received at the office. In dismissing this claim on summary judgment, Judge McGovern found that St. Louis was entitled to immunity for the challenged acts. He also held the claim preempted because the CSRA afforded Saul an administrative remedy. Because we find the district court\u2019s second reason sufficient to answer to Saul\u2019s arguments, we do not reach the issue of immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-15\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b931-16\">Preclusion Where the CSRA Offers <em>Some </em>Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b931-17\">Saul patterns his constitutional tort claim upon the cause of action recognized in <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the Fed. Narcotics Bureau, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). In <em>Bivens, </em>the Court held that federal officers who acted under color of law were liable for damages caused by their violation of the plaintiff\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. 403 U.S. at 389, 397, 91 S.Ct. at 2001, 2005. Finding \u201cno special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress,\u201d the Court applied the rule that \u201cwhere legal rights have been invaded, and a federal statute provides for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>general right to sue for such invasion, courts may use any available remedy to make good the wrong done.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 396, 91 S.Ct. at 2004 (internal quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-4\">Since <em>Bivens, </em>the Court has \u201cresponded cautiously to suggestions that <em>Bivens </em>remedies be extended into new contexts.\u201d <em>Schweiker v. Chilicky, </em>487 U.S. 412, 421, 108 S.Ct. 2460, 2466, 101 L.Ed.2d 370 (1988). The Court's analyses in <em>Chilicky </em>and in its predecessor, <em>Bush v. Lucas, </em>462 U.S. 367, 103 S.Ct. 2404, 76 L.Ed.2d 648 (1983), are particularly instructive as to whether a court may entertain Saul\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-5\">The plaintiff in <em>Bush </em>was a federal employee who had publicly criticized his employing agency. He alleged that his supervisors violated his First Amendment rights by demoting him. 462 U.S. at 369-71, 103 S.Ct. at 2406-08. Through administrative channels, Bush won retroactive restoration to his position and $30,000 in backpay. <em>Id. </em>at 371, 103 S.Ct. at 2407. Nonetheless he sought to maintain a <em>Bivens </em>action against his supervisors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">To facilitate its analysis, the Supreme Court assumed both that Bush\u2019s First Amendment rights had been violated and that the civil services remedies available to him were less effective than a damages remedy. 462 U.S. at 372 &amp; nn. 8-9, 103 S.Ct. at 2408 &amp; nn. 8-9. Yet the Court distinguished Bush\u2019s- problem from the problem presented in <em>Bivens:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b932-7\">The question [in <em>Bush </em>] is not what remedy the court should provide for a wrong that would otherwise go unredressed. It is whether an elaborate remedial system [for the federal civil service] that has been constructed with careful attention to conflicting policy considerations, should be augmented by the creation of a new judicial remedy for the constitutional violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b932-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 388, 103 S.Ct. at 2416-17. The Court answered this question in the negative, stating that \u201c[b]ecause [Bush\u2019s] claims arise out of an employment relationship that is governed by comprehensive procedural and substantive provisions giving meaningful remedies against the United States, ... it would be inappropriate for us to supplement that regulatory scheme with a new judicial remedy.\u201d 462 U.S. at 368, 103 S.Ct. at 2406. It noted that Congress was better suited to decide if the new legal liability sought by Bush would serve the public interest. <em>Id. </em>at 390, 103 S.Ct. at 2417.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-11\">The civil service system afforded Bush a relatively complete remedy. This fact caused uncertainty, after <em>Bush, </em>about the scope of CSRA preclusion.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Courts questioned \u201c[w]hether the Court intended <em>Bush </em>to bar damages actions for those employees ... for whom the CSRA remedies are not so complete.\u201d <em>Spagnola v. Mathis, </em>859 F.2d 223, 226 (D.C.Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b932-12\">Five years after <em>Bush, </em>the Court clarified its position. The plaintiffs in <em>Schweiker v. Chilicky, </em>487 U.S. 412, 417-19, 108 S.Ct. 2460, 2464-65, 101 L.Ed.2d 370 (1988), brought a <em>Bivens </em>action alleging that federal and state officials violated their due process rights by wrongfully terminating their social security disability benefits. After reviewing the Social Security Act\u2019s elaborate remedial structure, the Court concluded this structure made <em>Chilicky </em>indistinguishable from <em>Bush. See id. </em>487 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>U.S. at 425, 108 S.Ct. at 2468. It observed that Congress had considered and addressed the problem of wrongful termination of disability benefits. <em>Id. </em>at 425-26, 108 S.Ct. at 2468-69. It held that the Social Security Act\u2019s comprehensive remedial scheme was a special factor counseling hesitation to permit a <em>Bivens </em>action. <em>Id. </em>487 U.S. at 429, 108 S.Ct. at 2470.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\"><em>Chilicky </em>teaches that the key consideration is not whether a complete statutory remedy exists for the constitutional violation charged. Rather,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b933-6\">[w]hen the <em>design </em>of a government program suggests that Congress has provided mechanisms for constitutional violations that may occur in the course of its administration, we have not created additional <em>Bivens </em>remedies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b933-7\"><em>Id. </em>487 U.S. at 423, 108 S.Ct. at 2467 (emphasis added). The <em>Chilicky </em>Court suggested that Congress had deliberately elected not to include \u201ccomplete relief\u201d for constitutional violations in the comprehensive acts covering federal employment and social security. <em>See id. </em>at 424-25, 108 S.Ct. at 2468-69. It viewed <em>Bush </em>as resting on the premise that Congress was better positioned to decide whether a new damages remedy would serve the public interest. <em>Id. </em>487 U.S. at 426-27, 108 S.Ct. at 2469-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-8\">No Supreme Court opinion holds squarely that the CSRA always prevents federal employees from bringing <em>Bivens </em>actions to right job-related wrongs. One justice has implied that in at least some situations, a federal employee could maintain a <em>Bivens </em>action despite the CSRA. <em>See United States v. Fausto, </em>484 U.S. 439, 455, 108 S.Ct. 668, 677, 98 L.Ed.2d 830 (1988) (Blackmun, J., concurring).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b933-12\">Before <em>Chilicky, </em>this court permitted a <em>Bivens </em>action by a federal employee who was demoted during a promotional probationary period, where the demotion allegedly violated the employee\u2019s constitutional rights of privacy and free speech. <em>See Kotarski v. Cooper, </em>799 F.2d 1342, 1344-45 (9th Cir.1986) <em>(Kotarski I), vacated and remanded, </em>487 U.S. 1212, 108 S.Ct. 2861, 101 L.Ed.2d 897 (1988). In holding that the doctrine of <em>Bush v. Lucas </em>did not preclude Kotarski\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim, we emphasized the absence of \u201cmeaningful\u201d and \u201cadequate\u201d remedies in the CSRA for probationary employees. <em>Id. </em>487 U.S. at 1346-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-13\">The Supreme Court vacated and remanded <em>Kotarski I </em>for our reconsideration in light of <em>Chilicky. </em>487 U.S. 1212, 108 S.Ct. 2861. On remand, we shifted our inquiry from evaluating whether the CSRA provided Kotarski with meaningful and adequate remedies to deciding if the CSRA\u2019s omission of a damages remedy for demoted probationary employees was \u201cinadvertent.\u201d <em>See Kotarski v. Cooper, </em>866 F.2d 311, 312 (9th Cir.1989) <em>(Kotarski II). </em>Because the CSRA allowed employees to appeal <em>some </em>adverse personnel actions, we found no inadvertence. We held that \u201cno <em>Bivens </em>action can be implied for Kotarski in light of <em>Chilicky.\u201d </em>Id.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>Nine other courts of appeals have concluded that the CSRA precludes a federal employee from using a constitutional tort theory to adjudicate at least some employment-related disputes. Four circuits reached this conclusion before Chilicky.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Chilicky </em>altered the views of two circuits besides this one, causing them to recognize CSRA preclusion of <em>Bivens </em>remedies.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Following <em>Chilicky </em>and <em>Fausto, </em>three more circuits have found that the CSRA precludes <em>Bivens </em>remedies.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Citing <em>Schowengerdt v. General Dynamics Corp., </em>823 F.2d 1328 (9th Cir.1987), Saul urges that his <em>Bivens </em>claims are actionable because the CSRA does not apply to \u201cnonemployment torts committed against federal employees which- are not related to pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">We reject the suggestion that a federal employee may bring a constitutional tort claim against his supervisors as long as he limits his challenge to actions unrelated to his pay.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The text of the CSRA, the case law interpreting it, and common sense all counsel against adoption of this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">The text of the CSRA shows that Congress did not inadvertently omit a damages remedy for Saul. As we have explained, the statute offers at least two means of redressing the constitutional injury he contends St. Louis inflicted. He could either have requested the OSC to investigate the mail opening as a prohibited personnel practice, or have filed a grievance under his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>collective bargaining agreement.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Case law interpreting the CSRA further supports rejection of Saul\u2019s pay-relatedness distinction. The Supreme Court has not used pay-relatedness as the determinant of whether federal employees may bring <em>Bivens </em>actions against their supervisors. In <em>Bush, </em>the Court deferred to Congress\u2019 superior ability to evaluate the impact of <em>Bivens </em>remedies upon the federal civil service. 462 U.S. at 389, 103 S.Ct. at 2417. The relationship of Bush\u2019s injury to his pay played no apparent role in the Court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Common sense also exposes the folly of making CSRA preclusion of a federal employee\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim turn on that claim\u2019s relationship to pay. It would turn the CSRA on its head to hold that the statute prohibited immediate lawsuits in pay-related cases, but did not prohibit such suits in nonpay-related cases. The structure of the CSRA established the \u201cprimacy of the MSPB for administrative resolution of disputes over adverse personnel action, ... and the primacy of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit for judicial review____\u201d <em>Fausto, </em>484 U.S. at 449, 108 S.Ct. at 674 (citations omitted). The <em>Fausto </em>Court found that it would undermine this structure to permit nonpreference eligible employees in the excepted service to sue over their dismissals. <em>Id. </em>at 451, 108 S.Ct. at 675. It would also undermine this structure to require employees to redress pay-related claims through the CSRA\u2019s administrative procedures, while permitting their coworkers with nonpay-re-lated claims to bypass the act\u2019s administrative procedures, sue in any federal district court, and appeal to any geographically appropriate circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">Preclusion Where the CSRA Offers No Remedy</p>\n<p id=\"b935-10\">Saul seizes upon dictum in a footnote to <em>Bush </em>that suggests a federal employee subjected to a warrantless search by a supervisor would not have an OSC appeal because the search would not meet the CSRA\u2019s definition of a \u201cpersonnel action.\u201d <em>See </em>462 U.S. at 385 n. 28, 103 S.Ct. at 2415 n. 28. That footnote cannot bear the weight of Saul\u2019s argument. We do not think the footnote was meant to decide whether every allegation that a supervisor has subjected a federal employee to a war-rantless search is barred from appeal under the CSRA. Read in context, the footnote indicates only that CSRA remedies, while comprehensive, are not infinitely so.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-13\">Saul points out that in <em>Schowengerdt, </em>this court applied Bush's footnote 28 very literally. It was cited as our authority for stating that \u201cwarrantless searches are not \u2018personnel actions\u2019 within the statutory scheme.\u201d <em>See </em>823 F.2d at 1339. In keeping with our <em>pre-Chilicky </em>analysis, we then reasoned that \u201cCongress has not acted to regulate the aspect of government/employee relations at issue ... and, thus, the \u2018special factor\u2019 present in <em>Bush </em>is wholly absent here.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-14\">While <em>Chilicky </em>undermines this latter reasoning, <em>see supra </em>nn. 13, 17, we do not think that the <em>Bush </em>language requires the literal application given it in the <em>Schowen-gerdt </em>opinion. A question not reached in the latter opinion is this: does the CSRA preclude even those <em>Bivens </em>claims for which it prescribes no alternative remedies?</p>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">In <em>Veit v. Heckler, </em>746 F.2d 508, 511 (9th Cir.1984) (citations omitted), we said that the comprehensiveness of the CSRA\u2019s remedies evinced \u201ca clear congressional intent to permit federal court review as provided in the CSRA or not at all.\u201d This statement suggests that CSRA preclusion of <em>Bivens </em>claims applies even absent any CSRA remedy. But <em>Veit </em>concerned the denial of a merit pay increase, which may be challenged as a prohibited personnel practice. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number><em>See id. </em>at 511.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The <em>Veit </em>court\u2019s suggestion that CSRA preclusion could apply even absent a CSRA remedy is only dictum.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">Cases from two other circuits indicate that the preclusive effect of the CSRA sweeps beyond the contours of its remedies. <em>See Lombardi v. Small Business Admin., </em>889 F.2d 959, 961 (10th Cir.1989); <em>Volk v. Hobson, </em>866 F.2d 1398, 1403-04 (Fed.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1092, 109 S.Ct. 2435, 104 L.Ed.2d 991 (1989). In <em>Volk, </em>the Federal Circuit noted that the remedies of the CSRA were</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AH9\">provided by Congress as a package. Whether or not an employee has access to all of the procedures and remedies of the CSRA, or, as here, fails to fully avail herself of those she has, it illustrates the logic inherent in the Supreme Court\u2019s admonitions to leave the architecture of the federal personnel system to Congress. It is far better positioned to set the policy and adjust the system than judges confronting ad hoc situations and trying to fill perceived gaps in the program by allowing employees to prosecute <em>Bivens </em>suits against each other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">866 F.2d at 1403.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">We agree with the <em>Volk </em>court that the CSRA precludes even those <em>Bivens </em>claims for which the act prescribes no alternative remedy. The CSRA\u2019s comprehensive remedial provisions convince us that there was no inadvertence by Congress in omitting a damages remedy against supervisors whose work-related actions allegedly violate a subordinate\u2019s constitutional rights. In the area of federal employment, Congress is better equipped than we to strike an appropriate balance between employees\u2019 interests in remedying constitutional violations and the interests of the government and the public in maintaining the efficiency, morale and discipline of the federal workforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-9\">In summary, we hold that the CSRA is a special factor counseling against recognition of a <em>Bivens </em>remedy for Saul. We affirm the dismissal of his <em>Bivens </em>claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-10\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">CSRA PREEMPTION OF SAUL\u2019S COMMON LAW TORT CLAIMS</p>\n<p id=\"b936-12\">Saul\u2019s complaint charged the torts of intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress, defamation, and invasion of privacy. The district court gave two reasons for dismissing these claims on summary judgment. First, Judge McGovern found that after substitution of the United States, Saul was required to exhaust his administrative remedies under the FTCA. Second, he held that the CSRA barred Saul\u2019s claims. We affirm on the second ground and do not discuss the first.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b936-13\">The question whether the CSRA preempts a federal employee\u2019s common law tort claims against his supervisors, where these claims stem from the working relationship but do not affect the employee\u2019s pay, is one of first impression in this circuit. It appears to be a novel question in the federal courts generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-14\">\u201cPreemption analysis always starts with the presumption that Congress did not intend to displace state law.\u201d <em>California ex rel. State Water Resources Bd. v. Federal Energy Regulatory Comm\u2019n, </em>877 F.2d 743, 746 (9th Cir.1989), <em>aff'd, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 110 S.Ct. 2024, 109 L.Ed.2d 474 (1990). The intention of Congress serves as the ultimate touchstone. <em>California </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number><em>Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n v. Guerra, </em>479 U.S. 272, 284, 107 S.Ct. 683, 691, 93 L.Ed.2d 613 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">Federal law may preempt state law in three different ways. <em>Id. </em>at 280-81, 107 S.Ct. at 689-90. First, Congress may preempt state law by an express statement. <em>Id. </em>at 280, 107 S.Ct. at 689. Second, the Supremacy Clause mandates preemption where state law actually conflicts with federal law. <em>See id. </em>at 280-81, 107 S.Ct. at 689-90. Third, we may infer that Congress preempted state law where the scheme of federal regulation is \u201csufficiently comprehensive to make reasonable the inference that Congress left no room for supplementary state regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citation omitted). Because we find no express preemption of state tort law in the text of the CSRA, <em>cf. Broughton v. Courtney, </em>861 F.2d 639, 641-44 (11th Cir.1988), we discuss only the last two preemption possibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">Preemption Caused by Actual State-Federal Conflict</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">A conflict between state and federal laws can occur either because it is physically impossible to comply with both, or because \u201cstate law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\u201d <em>Guerra, </em>479 U.S. at 281, 107 S.Ct. at 689 (internal quotations and citations omitted). Here, physical impossibility is not the issue. The issue is rather whether permitting state tort claims like Saul\u2019s would frustrate achievement of the congressional objectives embodied in the CSRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-9\">Saul points out correctly that each time we have held the CSRA preempted a federal employee\u2019s common law tort remedies, the employee had suffered some pay-related injury. <em>See Rivera v. United States, </em>924 F.2d 948, 951-52 (9th Cir.1991); <em>David v. United States, </em>820 F.2d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.1987) (CSRA preempted discharged employee\u2019s claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress); <em>Lehman v. Morrissey, </em>779 F.2d 526 (9th Cir.1985) (per curiam) (proper to dismiss claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress by employee who resigned after \u201cdirected reassignment\u201d; CSRA was her sole recourse). From this fact, Saul reasons that the CSRA preempts only those tort claims that bear some relationship to a federal employee's pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-11\">Saul focuses upon the wrong fact. CSRA preemption of a federal employee\u2019s state tort claims does not depend on whether the claims bear some nexus to the employee\u2019s pay. Rather, to the extent that preemption analysis seeks to avoid actual conflict between state and federal laws, the controlling factor must be whether the employee could challenge the action through the CSRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-12\">In <em>Broughton v. Courtney, </em>861 F.2d 639, 644 (11th Cir.1988), the Eleventh Circuit stated that \u201cwhere state common law claims are included in the personnel actions that employees can challenge under the CSRA, those state actions are preempted\u201d (citing <em>David </em>and <em>Lehman). </em>It reasoned that in such situations, the state claim would interfere with the congressional objective of making the CSRA an <em>\u201cexclusive </em>\u201d forum for challenging federal personnel actions. <em>See id. </em>at 643-44 (emphasis added). To prevent actual state-federal conflict, the <em>Broughton </em>court held that the CSRA preempted the plaintiff\u2019s state law claims for conspiracy and tortious interference with employment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b937-13\">As was true in <em>Broughton, </em>at least some of Saul\u2019s tort claims were subject to administrative appeal under the CSRA. He could have redressed the alleged defamations and inflictions of emotional distress either by initiating an OSC investigation of prohibited personnel practices or by filing a grievance under his collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-14\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b937-15\">Preemption By Federal Occupation of the Field</p>\n<p id=\"b937-16\">As already indicated, the <em>Schowengerdt </em>court\u2019s literal application of footnote 28 from <em>Bush </em>may mean that the mail-opening actions of St. Louis fall outside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>CSRA. <em>See supra </em>at II.B. Besides basing his <em>Bivens </em>claim on these actions, Saul complained that they tortiously invaded his privacy. We consider whether Congress, in enacting the CSRA, intended to leave room for such a tort claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">Both the CSRA and its legislative history show that Congress did not intend that state tort law operate within the interstices of the act. In the legislative history, Congress explicitly recognized that not every work-related complaint by a federal employee would be appealable, let alone appealable to the courts.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The act itself carefully defines the interrelationships between its appeal mechanisms. <em>See supra </em>at I.C. It \u201cfully protects the existing rights of employees to trial de novo under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\u201d House Conf.Report at 2874-75 (which continues by cataloging the eight different times when an employee may sue to redress discrimination). Yet the CSRA fails even to mention state tort remedies. We infer that Congress did not mention any such remedies because it left no room for them. <em>Accord Rivera v. United States, </em>924 F.2d 948, 951-52 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-12\">Our conclusion that Congress intended to oust state tort law from the realm of federal employment is consistent with cases defining the CSRA\u2019s relationship to other federal remedies. Federal courts have used the act\u2019s comprehensive and exclusive nature as a reason for holding that it precludes suit under a variety of other federal statutes.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> A similar analysis has supported holdings that the CSRA precludes implying rights of action for federal employees,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and that these employees may not bypass the CSRA to sue for breach of the duty of fair representation.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> To like effect are the many cases holding that the CSRA\u2019s comprehensive remedial scheme constitutes a special factor precluding fed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>eral employees from bringing <em>Bivens </em>actions. <em>See supra </em>at II.A. &amp; nn. 14-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">We find the failure of Congress to even mention state tort remedies in the CSRA is glaringly significant. We conclude that Congress ignored these remedies because it left no room for them to operate. The CSRA preempts Saul\u2019s claim that the opening of his mail violated state law by invading his privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">The district court held correctly that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Saul\u2019s common law tort claims. Insofar as the CSRA offered Saul remedies, his state tort claims must be preempted to prevent them from conflicting with the remedial system that Congress prescribed for federal employees. Even where the CSRA provided Saul no remedy, preemption of his work-related tort claims is necessary to fulfill congressional intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">DENIAL OF LEAVE TO AMEND</p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">Saul originally requested injunctive relief against the individual defendants. After substitution of the United States, he moved to amend his prayer for relief from the allegedly unconstitutional opening of his mail. He wished to add injunctive relief against the United States and class relief for all SSA employees. He now challenges the district court\u2019s denial of leave to amend, pointing out that courts are required to grant such leave freely. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">Once a responsive pleading has been filed, we review a denial of leave to amend for abuse of discretion. <em>Thomas-Lazear v. FBI, </em>851 F.2d 1202, 1206 (9th Cir.1988). A district court does not err in denying leave to amend where the amendment would be futile, <em>Reddy v. Litton Indus., Inc., </em>912 F.2d 291, 296 (9th Cir.1990), or where the amended complaint would be subject to dismissal. <em>Moore v. Kayport Package Express, Inc., </em>885 F.2d 531, 538 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-15\">Amending Saul\u2019s complaint to seek injunctive relief would be futile. The CSRA\u2019s elaborate remedies show that judicial interference in federal employment is disfavored, whether the employee requests damages or injunctive relief. <em>See Lombardi, </em>889 F.2d at 961-62. The act provides its own limited form of injunctive relief, by permitting the OSC to seek a stay of a prohibited personnel practice.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> As the Fourth Circuit noted, \u201cwhere the personnel actions are so minor in nature and where the available statutory remedies are constitutionally adequate to provide relief, ... Congress intended that judicially-created remedies ... not be made available.\u201d <em>Pinar v. Dole, </em>747 F.2d 899, 912 (4th Cir.1984), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1016, 105 S.Ct. 2019, 85 L.Ed.2d 301 (1985).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The CSRA precludes Saul from seeking injunctive relief for his asserted constitutional injury just as it precludes him from bringing a <em>Bivens </em>action for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-16\">Amending this complaint to seek class relief would also be futile. Saul\u2019s class claims would be of the same character as his individual complaint about the opening of mail. Just as the CSRA precludes Saul\u2019s individual <em>Bivens </em>claim, so would it preclude him from bringing this as a class action.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-17\">The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying leave to amend. Neither amendment could overcome the fundamental futility of the claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-18\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b939-19\">The comprehensive provisions of the Civil Service Reform Act severely limit the ability of federal employees to sue their supervisors. Our study of the CSRA\u2019s pre-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>elusive and preemptive effects convinces us that the district court properly granted summary judgment for the defendants on both the constitutional and common law tort claims. The court did not err by denying Saul leave to amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b927-12\">. The first alleged defamation stemmed from a letter Larsen wrote to the AFGE explaining his decision on five of Saul\u2019s grievances. Saul alleges that this letter defamed him, in part through its use of the word \u201d[s]ubterfuge.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b927-13\">The second alleged defamation involved Larsen\u2019s disclosures to a congressional aide that Saul had been the subject of \"production actions\u201d to improve his performance, had filed 16 grievances, and had been refused access by two SSA personnel libraries. Larsen made these disclosures during a phone conversation he initiated after learning that Saul had written to the aide\u2019s Congressman complaining about the SSA\u2019s union policies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b927-14\">. Saul alleged that the opening of mail by St. Louis and the allegedly defamatory communications by Larsen amounted to intentional and negligent inflictions of emotional distress. His complaint also alleged that St. Louis tortiously inflicted him with emotional distress by prohibiting him from sitting at his desk before 8:00 a.m. and from coming to work on weekends.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b927-21\">.

Bush was demoted in 1975, before enactment of the CSRA. <em>See </em>462 U.S. at 369-70, 103 S.Ct. at 2406-07. He obtained restoration to his position and backpay by using pre-CSRA civil service remedies. <em>See id. </em>at 370-71, 386-88, 103 S.Ct. at 2407-08, 2415-17. By the time his case reached the Supreme Court, however, the CSRA was four years old. In its thorough review of civil service remedies, the Court repeatedly discussed the remedial system instituted by the CSRA. <em>Id. </em>at 385-88 &amp; nn. 25, 28, 30, 32-33, 35, 103 S.Ct. at 2415-16 &amp; nn. 25, 28, 30, 32-33, 35. It then couched the question before it in terms of \u201cthe comprehensive nature of the remedies <em>currently </em>available.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 388, 103 S.Ct. at 2416 (emphasis added). The analysis of <em>Bush </em>thus applies to the CSRA.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-14\">The two concurring justices in <em>Bush </em>emphasized the completeness of the remedies available. They found \"nothing in today's decision to foreclose a federal employee from pursuing a <em>Bivens </em>remedy where his injury is not attributable to personnel actions which may be remedied under the federal statutory scheme.\u201d 462 U.S. at 390-91, 103 S.Ct. at 2418 (Marshall, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b933-9\">. In <em>Fausto, </em>the Court held that the CSRA precluded a \"nonpreference eligible employee\u201d in the federal \"excepted service\u201d from using the Back Pay Act to obtain judicial review of his suspension. 484 U.S. at 447, 108 S.Ct. at 673. While Fausto could have had a suit about his suspension before enactment of the CSRA, the act gave no remedy to employees with Fausto\u2019s status. The Court thought this omission reflected a deliberate congressional balancing of employee and government interests. It avoided undermining the CSRA\u2019s carefully balanced structure by finding CSRA preclusion. <em>Id. </em>at 448-51, 108 S.Ct. at 673-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-10\">Justice Blackmun concurred with the five-member <em>Fausto </em>majority, but added the caveat that he did not find its opinion inconsistent with the Court's established aversion to recognizing implied repeals. He thought this aversion applied with equal force to statutorily and judicially created remedies. He cited <em>Bivens </em>actions as an example of a judicially created remedy that should not be lightly repealed by implication. <em>Id. </em>484 U.S. at 455, 108 S.Ct. at 677.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b933-15\">. <em>See also Karamanos v.

In <em>Feit, </em>the Seventh Circuit found that the comprehensiveness of the CSRA\u2019s administrative system, coupled with the expertise and authority of Congress in the field of federal employment, constitute special factors counseling hesitation to imply a <em>Bivens </em>remedy. 886 F.2d at 854-55 &amp; n. 8. The court in <em>Feit </em>noted that the \"prohibited personnel practices\u201d redressible under the CSRA include violations of federal employees\u2019 constitutional rights. It found that the act\u2019s omission of a damages remedy for constitutional violations was not inadvertent. <em>Id. </em>at 855.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b934-14\">. Saul\u2019s reliance on <em>Schowengerdt </em>is misplaced. In <em>Schowengerdt, </em>another panel of this court held that a federal employee could bring a <em>Bivens </em>action to challenge a warrantless search by his supervisors because the CSRA offered no mechanism to vindicate his Fourth Amendment rights. <em>Id. </em>at 1339. But this holding antedated both <em>Chilicky </em>and <em>Kotarski I. </em>Like <em>Kotarski I, Schowengerdt </em>suffers from its emphasis on whether the CSRA offered adequate remedies. <em>See </em>823 F.2d at 1339 (reasoning that Schowen-gerdt could seek a <em>Bivens </em>remedy \"if the constitutional violations he claims cannot be <em>adequately </em>addressed under the [CSRA]\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>see also id. </em>at 1333 n. 4. <em>Chilicky </em>eliminated any need to make a case-by-case analysis of whether adequate administrative remedies are available to the prospective <em>Bivens </em>plaintiff. <em>Spagnola, </em>859 F.2d at 228.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b935-11\">.

Apparently neither party in <em>Veit </em>asserted that an OSC complaint could have been lodged. <em>See </em>746 F.2d at 511. The <em>Veit </em>court stated that \"the record would not support ... a contention [of a prohibited personnel practice] in any event.\" <em>Id. </em>This comment is dictum, because <em>Veit </em>did not require resolution of this issue.
