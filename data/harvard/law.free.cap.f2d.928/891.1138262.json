This petition alleged the following grounds for relief: (1) the state denied Harris his constitutional right to competent psychiatric assistance under <em>Ake v. Oklahoma, </em>470 U.S. 68, 105 S.Ct. 1087, 84 L.Ed.2d 53 (1985); (2) Harris was denied the effective assistance of counsel; (3) newly discovered evidence of organic brain damage and other mental disorders warranted relief; (4) false testimony was presented by a prosecution psychiatrist; (5) the state courts failed to review independently the evidence and determine the appropriateness of the death penalty as required by state law; and (6) the prosecution relied upon the testimony of Joey Abshire whom Harris alleged was a government agent who unlawfully interrogated him (\u201cthe Abshire claim\u201d). The Abshire claim was based upon two declarations stating that Abshire had unauthorized access to the legal papers of Harris\u2019s brother and codefendant, Daniel Harris. Harris also asserted that the Ab-shire claim did not violate Rule 9 of the rules governing habeas petitions under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 because the evidence of Ab-shire\u2019s access to Daniel Harris\u2019s papers was discovered \u201cfortuitously\u201d during an interview with Daniel Harris regarding Harris\u2019s mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">On March 28, 1990, the district court, after carefully considering the merits of each claim, denied the petition. As to the Abshire claim, the court rejected Harris\u2019s argument on the grounds that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AU-4\">Harris does not present any evidence to support his claim that Abshire was in fact a government agent or that Abshire had an agreement with the government prior to his July 26, 1978 conversation with Harris. The record suggests that Abshire questioned Harris out of his own curiosity and later, when offered a deal, agreed to testify against Harris.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b988-6\">The court found the declarations contained only \u201cconjectural information\u201d and even if found true would \u201cnot make [Abshire] a government agent.\u201d On March 30, 1990, four days before his scheduled execution, Harris filed with this court an emergency application for a stay of execution and issuance of a certificate of probable cause. The stay and certificate of probable cause were issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">On appeal, this court found that Rule 9 barred each of Harris\u2019s claims. <em>Harris v. Vasquez, </em>913 F.2d 606, 617-18 (9th Cir.1990). As to the Abshire claim, we stated that this claim could have been raised in his previous federal petitions and was therefore an abuse of the writ to raise it at this time. <em>Id. </em>at 618. In the interests of justice we also addressed the merits of Harris\u2019s contentions. We stated that the two declarations provided by Harris, stating that Abshire had access to Daniel Harris\u2019s cell and papers, did \u201cnot provide a sufficient evidentiary basis\u201d to warrant an evidentiary hearing on the matter. <em>Id. </em>at 629. The declarations did not \u201cindicate[] that the state participated in the visit [by Abshire to Daniel Harris\u2019s cell] or authorized it in any way.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">On November 28, 1990, Harris filed a petition for rehearing.- On November 30, 1990, prior to our deciding this petition, Harris filed a \u201cMotion to Remand to the District Court for an Evidentiary Hearing and Supporting Memorandum of law.\u201d This Motion is based upon the declarations of Abshire and Sonny Wisdom. Abshire\u2019s declaration states that after an initial conversation with Harris, \u201cthe police persuaded [him] to question Harris,\u201d and that he \u201cagreed to talk to Harris further to ask him why he had killed the victims ... [and] was then placed in a holding cell with Harris and asked him why he killed the boys.\u201d The declaration also states that he was \u201ccoached\u201d by investigators to make misstatements in a pretrial intervi\u00e9w and while testifying during Harris\u2019s trial. It further states that the trial testimony of a police sergeant which corroborated Abshire\u2019s testimony did \u201cnot accurately state what Harris said during [Harris\u2019s] conversation [with Abshire].\u201d The declaration of Wisdom states that he was in the same cell with Abshire and Harris, and is offered to support the statements made in Abshire\u2019s declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"893\">*893</page-number>Harris\u2019s claim that these declarations provide the evidentiary basis his latest habeas petition lacked. If proved true, Harris argues, they demonstrate violations of (1) Harris\u2019s constitutional right to counsel at state-initiated interrogations under <em>Massiah v. United States, </em>377 U.S. 201, 84 S.Ct. 1199, 12 L.Ed.2d 246 (1964), and <em>United States v. Henry, </em>447 U.S. 264, 100 S.Ct. 2183, 65 L.Ed.2d 115 (1980), (2) Harris\u2019s rights under <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), (3) the right to a trial free from state-initiated, perjury under <em>Mooney v. Holohan, </em>294 U.S. 103, 55 S.Ct. 340, 79 L.Ed. 791 (1935), and (4) a penalty trial free from materially inaccurate information under <em>Johnson v. Mississippi, </em>486 U.S. 578, 108 S.Ct. 1981, 100 L.Ed.2d 575 (1988). The Motion also asserts that this claim, as supported by the declarations, does not constitute an abuse of the writ because \u201cthe state has actively concealed the truth [about Abshire\u2019s role] from [Harris].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">We believe the presentation of these declarations require an evidentiary hearing on the Abshire claim and grant the Motion to Remand. We defer decision on the petition for rehearing pending our review of the district court\u2019s findings on remand. The district court is instructed to conduct a limited evidentiary hearing to determine whether the Abshire claim, supported now by the declarations of Abshire and Wisdom, warrant federal habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">The remand is limited to the receipt of evidence probative of the issues raised in the Motion to Remand and the government\u2019s Opposition. The district court shall make findings as to the admissibility, credibility, veracity, and materiality of such evidence. The court shall determine whether the failure to produce earlier the declarations supporting Harris\u2019s Motion constitutes an abuse of the writ of habeas corpus. The court shall further determine whether, in light of the existing record in this case and the evidentiary findings made pursuant to this order, Harris has shown this case warrants federal habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">Because of the extraordinary procedural posture of Harris\u2019s Motion, we believe immediate review by this court after the evi-dentiary hearing would materially advance the ultimate resolution of these proceedings. We accordingly stay any additional proceedings beyond those specified in this order and instruct the district court to certify its findings to this court for our review no later than sixty (60) days from the date of this order. <em>See Walker v. Lockhart, </em>726 F.2d 1238, 1265 (8th Cir.1984); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b989-9\">NOONAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AMzW\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">In <em>Harris v. Vasquez, </em>913 F.2d 606, 618 (9th Cir.1990) this court unanimously held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b989-11\">Harris\u2019s claim that he was subjected to an unlawful interrogation was not raised in his prior federal habeas petitions. It was not presented to the California Supreme Court until March 16, 1990. Because this issue could have been raised in his previous collateral attacks on his state conviction in the federal court system, it is an abuse of the writ and a violation of Rule 9(b) for Harris to raise it in this third petition for federal habeas corpus relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">There is no allegation in the affidavits supporting the petitioner\u2019s motion to remand that the state was responsible for keeping Daniel Harris, Joey Abshire or Sonny Wisdom from interrogation by counsel for Harris prior to 1990. There is no allegation in these affidavits that Daniel Harris was unavailable for questioning by counsel for Harris prior to 1990. There is n\u00f3 allegation that Sonny Wisdom was unavailable for questioning by counsel for Harris prior to 1990. There is no allegation that Joey Abshire was unavailable for questioning by counsel for Harris prior to 1990. There is no reason why the issue of Joey Abshire\u2019s role should be raised at this late date and no reason has been presented to depart from the law that is established. I dissent from the order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
