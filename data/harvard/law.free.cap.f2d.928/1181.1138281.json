The Alaska Energy Authority (AEA) challenges FERC\u2019s implementing regulations as contrary to congressional intent, and alternatively argues that AEA is entitled to an exemption even under the regulation\u2019s narrow definition of \u201cwithout profit.\u201d We hold that FERC has reasonably interpreted an imprecise statutory phrase in its regulation, and petitioner fails to show that the Commission\u2019s application of the regulation is arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-8\">AEA is a state-owned public corporation which administers the Four Dam Pool Project, designed to generate low-cost electricity for transmission to remote communities in southeastern and southcentral Alaska. AEA sells the output of the Four Dam Pool to three municipalities and two rural cooperatives (collectively, \u201cPurchasers\u201d) who resell the power to their retail customers. AEA is the Purchasers\u2019 sole source of power with the exception of incidental backup.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-14\">AEA applied to FERC for an exemption from payment of annual license fees on the Four Dam Pool project under the not-for-profit exception.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Controller denied AEA\u2019s application and AEA appealed to the Commission, which affirmed the Controller.</p>\n<p id=\"b1278-15\">The regulations, set out in the margin, require that AEA make two showings \u2014 that it sells its power to its purchasers without profit, defined as the excess of revenues over expenses in a given year, and that its purchasers in turn sell the AEA power (project power or input) to the public without profit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commission does not dispute that AEA made the first showing \u2014 that AEA sold its power to the Purchasers without profit. <em>Alaska Power Authority, </em>49 F.E.R.C. \u00b6 61,088 at 61,344 (1989). The point of contention between AEA and FERC involves the resale transaction between the Purchasers and their consumers. Applying its simple annual balance sheet test, FERC concluded that for the years in question all the Purchasers \u201chad accumulated annual revenues in excess of their annual expenses and therefore had made a profit on their resales of AEA-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>provided power to the ultimate consumer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61,343.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-5\">AEA advanced a number of arguments\u2014 all rejected by FERC \u2014 why the Purchasers\u2019 excess revenues did not bar AEA from claiming the exemption. Foremost was its contention that FERC\u2019s balance sheet definition of profit thwarted the intent of the statute to exempt public utilities from license fees so long as the utilities use all excess revenues for the benefit of their ratepayers. AEA also argued that FERC violated its own regulations by requiring that the Purchasers make a system-wide showing that revenues did not exceed expenses; since the Purchasers did not mark up project power for resale to their customers there was no profit on the resale of that specific AEA power. Any profits from other operations were therefore irrelevant to the existence of \u201cprofit\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Finally, AEA claimed that FERC was unfairly holding AEA to the balance sheet test since, under the alternative rate-of-return approach used in <em>Sabine River Authority, </em>10 F.E. R.C. \u00b6 61,241 (1980), the Purchasers\u2019 pass-through of the cost of project power would meet the requisite showing of no profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-6\">FERC found nothing in AEA\u2019s argument to warrant abandonment of its interpretation of the statute, adhered to since 1938. The agency believed that the open-ended language of the statute left it the policy choice of how to define \u201cprofit.\u201d FERC dismissed AEA\u2019s other contentions because AEA had not offered adequate proof that the Purchasers did not mark up project power before resale.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-8\">As noted, AEA\u2019s principal challenge is that FERC\u2019s regulation defining profit is contrary to the statutory purpose. In petitioner\u2019s view, FERC\u2019s definition, which effectively restricts exemption to utilities operating at a loss, thwarts a broader congressional intent to grant an exemption from license fees to state and municipal utilities that use all revenues for the benefit of their ratepayers. AEA offers a more generous \u201cclosed system\u201d definition under which the Purchasers would be thought to realize no profit so long as they retain all revenues within the utility system and use them exclusively to maintain and improve operations and service\u2014 to meet future capital expenses, to reduce long-term debt, or as operating reserves.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-10\">The statute, however, leaves the concept of \u201cwithout profit\u201d undefined. And since the sparse legislative history offers no clear guidance, we must defer to the agency\u2019s interpretation, if reasonable. <em>See Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781-82, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). We simply have no grounds to conclude that FERC is unreasonable in interpreting \u201cwithout profit\u201d in the accounting sense of the excess of revenues over expenses. We agree with our sister circuits, who have rejected arguments akin to AEA\u2019s, that even if FERC\u2019s definition restricts the exemption to utilities operating in the red, nothing in the statute or the legislative history precludes that result. <em>See Power Auth. of the State of New York v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n, </em>339 F.2d 269, 275 (2d Cir.1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>381 U.S. 933, 85 S.Ct. 1766, 14 L.Ed.2d 699 (1965); <em>Central Nebraska Public Power and Irrigation Dist. v. Federal Power Comm\u2019n, </em>160 F.2d 782, 786 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>332 U.S. 765, 68 S.Ct. 72, 92 L.Ed. 351 (1947). As those courts noted, because the decision to define \u201cwithout profit\u201d in the no profit, balance sheet sense, rather than the \u201cnon-profit,\u201d \u201cpublic benefit\u201d sense is a policy choice, the decision is the agency\u2019s. <em>See Central Nebraska, </em>160 F.2d at 785; <em>PASNY, </em>339 F.2d at 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b1279-11\">To be sure, we are left with some uncertainty as to the parameters of FERC\u2019s regulations. Unfortunately, at oral argument FERC counsel was unable to explain satisfactorily whether FERC looks at the excess of revenues over expenses on a system-wide basis or focuses solely on whether profit is earned on the particular input at issue. We need not remand for clarification, however, since, even under AEA\u2019s understanding of the agency\u2019s regulations \u2014 that AEA is obliged to show only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>that the Purchasers did not make a profit on the specific power sold by AEA \u2014 AEA did not meet its burden. <em>See </em>18 C.F.R. \u00a7 11.06(e). Petitioner insists that it demonstrated that there was no mark-up on the input purchased from AEA and resold to the ultimate consumer and that given this \u201cundisputed\u201d showing, FERC violated its own regulations by basing disqualification on the system-wide profit the Purchasers\u2019 income statements reflected. But all the Purchasers \u2014 municipalities and cooperatives alike \u2014 had substantial excess revenues and the power purchased from AEA and resold to the consumer appeared to be the principal source of that revenue, <em>see </em>49 F.E.R.C. \u00b6 61,088 at 61,343 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-4\">The record evidence on which AEA relies as proof that the Purchasers do not mark up the cost of power to their consumers is its year-end recomputation of accounts\u2014 called a \u201ctrue-up.\u201d AEA \u201ctrues-up\u201d its accounts by calculating the actual cost of its power and adjusts its billing to the Purchasers who, in turn, pass-through any adjustment to their customers. AEA asserts that this demonstrates that the Purchasers sell power to the ultimate consumer without mark-up. As FERC points out, however, the \u201ctrue-up\u201d mechanism merely guarantees that no \u201cunexpected\u201d profits are earned by the Purchasers \u2014 it says nothing about the level at which the resale price is set originally. AEA made no effort to demonstrate that the Purchasers design their rates to ensure that there is no profit earned on AEA power. In fact, the record suggests the contrary \u2014 that the Purchasers\u2019 rates are set to recover a substantial portion of their revenue requirements from sales of project power. Petitioner\u2019s contention that the portion of the Purchasers\u2019 revenue requirements that is attributable to a build-up of a reserve for future debt service or capital expenditures is not properly thought of as profit is simply another way of phrasing its basic and ineffective challenge to FERC\u2019s definition of profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-6\">Alternatively, to demonstrate that no profit was made by the Purchasers on the resale of AEA power, AEA could show that all profits system-wide came from other sources. But AEA offered no record evidence to support its claim that the Purchasers\u2019 excess revenues were generated solely from mark-up on non-input items, such as demand charges. As FERC pointed out, both in its initial order, <em>see Alaska Power Authority, </em>49 F.E.R.C. 61,088 at 61,345, 61,347, and on rehearing: \u201cNone of the filings from AEA shows that any excess revenues retained by the reselling utilities were earned only on the purchasers\u2019 transmission and distribution systems so that there was no profit on the resale of project power.\" <em>Alaska Energy Authority, </em>51 F.E.R.C. \u00b6 61,258 at 61,756.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-7\">The last argument petitioner brings to us is that FERC did not afford AEA and the Purchasers the same opportunity to show a lack of profit that it gave <em>Sabine River Authority </em>ten years ago. <em>See </em>10 F.E.R.C. 11 61,241 (1980). In the only case in which FERC has permitted a licensing fee exemption for power producers not operating in the red, the agency was faced with a licensee whose power was commingled by the purchasing utility with other power before it was resold to the ultimate consumer. FERC, believing it was administratively infeasible to determine whether a profit was made on the resale of the licensee\u2019s power, nevertheless granted an exemption. Because <em>Sabine, </em>unlike petitioner, was a rate-regulated utility, the Commission thought that the power purchased from the licensee would be passed through to the consumer on a dollar-for-dollar basis as an expense, and that FERC could rely on the independent regulator to ensure that there was no mark-up.</p>\n<p id=\"b1280-8\">Petitioner vigorously objects to FERC\u2019s distinction between regulated and non-regulated utilities, and we are not certain why <em>Sabine\u2019s </em>regulated status was determinative in that case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nevertheless, FERC has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>never applied <em>Sabine </em>in any other circumstance, and petitioner makes no contention that the Purchasers\u2019 difficulty in showing no mark-up on petitioner\u2019s power has anything to do with commingling other producers\u2019 power.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-5\">* * He * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-6\">For the foregoing reasons the petition for review is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1281-7\">\n<em>It is so ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1278-9\">. Section 10(e) of the Federal Power Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 803(e) reads in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1278-11\">(e) Annual charges payable by licensees; exception</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1278-12\">(1) That the licensee shall pay to the United States reasonable annual charges in an amount to be fixed by the Commission for the purpose of reimbursing the United States for the costs of the administration of this sub-chapter; for recompensing it for the use, occupancy, and enjoyment of its lands or other property; and for the expropriation to the Government of excessive profits until the respective States shall make provision for preventing excessive profits or for the expropriation thereof to themselves, ... <em>Provided further, </em>That licenses for the development, transmission, or distribution of power by States or municipalities shall be issued and enjoyed without charge to the extent such power is sold to the public without profit.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1278-16\">. AEA was required to show, under 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 11.06(d)(2):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1278-18\">That an income statement, prepared in accordance with the Commission\u2019s Uniform System of Accounts, shows that the revenues from the sale of project power do not exceed the total amount of operating expenses, maintenance, depreciation, amortization, taxes, and interest on indebtedness, applicable to the project property. Periodic accruals or payments for redemption of the principal of bonds or other indebtedness may not be deducted in determining the net profit of the project.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1278-19\">In addition, AEA had to demonstrate, under 18 C.F.R. \u00a7 11.06(e), that the Purchasers resold the power to the ultimate consumer without profit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1278-22\"><em>Sales for </em>resale____ [T]he licensee shall show that the power was sold to the ultimate consumer without profit. The matter of whether or not a profit was made is a question of fact to be established by the licensee.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1280-5\">. We cannot be sure whether FERC looked to the regulator to prevent circumvention of the no mark-up rule or whether FERC was relying on the regulator to ensure only a reasonable profit. We doubt that FERC could draw a distinction under the statute between a regulated \"profit\" (the reasonable rate of return (r) times the rate base (RB)) and a non-regulated one, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>FERC's counsel seemed to hold that view at oral argument. Nevertheless, we express no opinion as to whether <em>Sabine </em>should have any applicability in a non-commingling case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
