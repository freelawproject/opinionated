JONES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b773-18\">Defendant Antonio H. Colin was convicted after a jury trial in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas of one count of knowingly possessing, as convicted felon, a firearm in or affecting commerce, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), and one count of receiving or possessing a firearm not registered to him in the National Firearms Registration and Transfer Record, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5861(d). The conviction was based in part on the introduction of a sawed-off shotgun and shotgun shells found at the time of Colin\u2019s arrest. Colin had moved to suppress these items as seized in violation of the fourth amendment. The district court denied the motion. We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-20\">On the night of June 29, 1989, Officer Rudolfo Gomez of the San Antonio, Texas, Police Department stopped a car carrying four passengers, including Colin. Officer Gomez first noticed the car when it swerved in front of him; he then saw that the driver was not wearing a seat belt. While the car was coming to stop, he saw Colin, sitting in the front seat, make suspicious movements. After backup officers arrived, Officer Gomez removed Colin from the car, frisked him, and noticed a bulge in Colin\u2019s pant pocket, from which he removed two shotgun shells. He then looked into the car and saw the barrel of a gun, later determined to be a sawed-off shotgun, protruding from under the front seat. A further search of the vehicle yielded six more shells. Colin was arrested; so were the driver and another passenger when an identification check revealed outstanding traffic warrants for them. The fourth passenger, now alleged to be an illegal alien named \u201cJose Guadalupe,\u201d was not taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-21\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-22\">DENIAL OF MOTIONS TO SUPPRESS</p>\n<p id=\"b773-23\">As his first point, Colin argues that Officer Gomez lacked constitutionally sufficient justification to stop the vehicle and to frisk Colin and that he illegally arrested Colin prior to discovering the sawed-off shotgun. We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact on a motion to suppress under the clearly erroneous standard, and we re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>view the court\u2019s ultimate determination of fourth amendment reasonableness de novo. <em>See United States v. Basey, </em>816 F.2d 980, 987-88 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">The district court made oral findings of fact after hearing testimony at the suppression hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-5\">The court finds that ... the vehicle in which the defendant was traveling ... weaved toward Officer Gomez____ [T]he report does not say anything about whether [Colin] was wearing a seat belt or not. However, his testimony is that both the passenger and the driver were not wearing a seat belt. In any event, this is a violation of state law and the officer had probable cause to stop the vehicle because the driver was not wearing a seat belt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-8\"><em>Cf. </em>Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann. art. 6701d, \u00a7 107C(b) (defining traffic offense of riding in front seat of passenger car without a seat belt); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 153 (authorizing police officers to arrest traffic violators without a warrant).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-9\">Colin argues that there was \u201cno objective evidence\u201d that the driver violated any traffic regulations. He makes much of the fact that Officer Gomez did not mention any \u201cweaving\u201d in his final arrest report and did not issue any citations for failure to wear a seat belt. Given the subsequent discovery of a sawed-off shotgun and two outstanding arrest warrants, it is understandable that Officer Gomez lost interest in minor traffic violations. As quoted, the district court found in favor of the government on this issue. Giving due regard for the court\u2019s opportunity to judge the credibility of the witnesses, we cannot conclude that these findings of fact were clearly erroneous. Officer Gomez had probable cause to stop the vehicle. Because he had probable cause, his motive \u2014 even if anything but proper \u2014 was irrelevant. As we have said, \u201cso long as the police do no more than they are objectively authorized and legally permitted to do, their motives in doing so are irrelevant and hence not subject to inquiry.\u201d <em>United States v. Causey, </em>834 F.2d 1179, 1184 (5th Cir.1987) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-12\">Second, Colin argues that Officer Gomez possessed no \u201cspecific and articulable\u201d facts to warrant frisking him. The district court found that \u201cwhile following the car, [Officer Gomez] noticed movement on the part of [Colin], stooping down and moving from side to side. I think he said, some unusual movements by the passenger.\u201d On these specific and articulated facts, which Colin does not challenge, <em>Michigan v. Long, </em>463 U.S. 1032, 103 S.Ct. 3469, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983), declares that Officer Gomez acted permissibly. <em>Long </em>held that \u201cpolice may order persons out of an automobile during a stop for a traffic violation, and may frisk those persons for weapons if there is a reasonable belief that they are armed and dangerous.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1047-48, 103 S.Ct. at 3479-80. That a person is \u201cstooping down and moving from side to side\u201d in the front seat of an automobile may form the basis of this reasonable belief. <em>Cf. United States v. Ullrich, </em>580 F.2d 765, 769 (5th Cir.1978) (holding officer was justified in frisking driver who \u201cprocrastinated before opening the glove compartment and then simultaneously reached under the seat of the car\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Once Officer Gomez saw the bulge in Colin\u2019s pocket, it was proper to conduct a more thorough search. <em>See Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 111-12, 98 S.Ct. 330, 333-34, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b774-13\">Third, Colin argues that because Officer Gomez arrested him for possession of shotgun shells, which is not an offense under Texas law, the shotgun should have been suppressed as the fruit of a search pursuant to an illegal arrest. Colin cannot prove the first premise of this argument\u2014 that he was arrested <em>prior </em>to discovery of the shotgun. At the suppression hearing, Officer Gomez testified (emphasis added): <em>\u201cAt the time that I found the weapon </em>I proceeded to place him under arrest.\u201d On cross-examination, Colin\u2019s counsel did not refute this sequence of events. Based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>the testimony, the district court agreed with Officer Gomez (emphasis added): \u201cUpon finding the shotgun shells and looking into the car <em>and seeing on the floorboard, in plain view, the shotgun\\_, </em>t]hen he had probable cause to arrest the defendant for possession of a firearm, illegal firearm.\u201d The district court did not clearly err in so finding.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In any event, the shotgun was not discovered as the result of a search incident to an arrest. As the district court also found, Officer Gomez saw the shotgun \u201cin plain view.\u201d The court properly denied Colin\u2019s motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">RELEASE OF MATERIAL WITNESS</p>\n<p id=\"A3X\">Finally, Colin argues that his rights to due process and confrontation were violated because Officer Gomez \u201creleased\u201d a material witness, namely, illegal alien \u201cJose Guadalupe,\u201d a fellow passenger in the car. Because the government did not use Guadalupe\u2019s testimony at trial, in either live or recorded form, confrontation is not at issue here. \u201cDue process,\u201d we assume, refers in this context to Colin\u2019s right to compulsory process. This right proscribes \u201cthe government\u2019s making a witness unavailable and thereby preventing a defendant from interviewing the witness and determining whether he will subpoena and call the witness in his defense. Thus, the government may not deny the defendant access to a witness by hiding him out.\u201d <em>United States v. Henao, </em>652 F.2d 591, 592 (5th Cir. Unit B Aug. 1981). Surely, the conduct of Officer Gomez, even if it can be ascribed to the United States, did not rise to this level. The officer simply did not arrest Guadalupe; he had no eonstitutional duty to do so. In no way did Officer Gomez \u201chide\u201d Guadalupe or otherwise make him \u201cunavailable.\u201d . We reject Colin\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b774-10\">. Colin cites <em>Keah v. State, </em>508 S.W.2d 836 (Tex.Crim.App.1974), and <em>State v. Williams, </em>366 So.2d 1369 (La.1978), as holding to the contrary. Besides being in conflict with <em>Long </em>and <em>Ullrich, </em>these decisions, emanating from courts of co-ordinate jurisdiction, do not bind our court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b775-6\">. As indicated, Colin did not dispute the testimony of Officer Gomez at the suppression hearing. In support of his claims, he can point only to the response of Officer Gomez, <em>at trial, </em>to a question on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-7\">Q [The prosecutor asked you] about the gun being at Mr. Colin\u2019s feet. Well, as I understand it, you didn\u2019t see the gun protruding from the front seat until after you had arrested Mr. Colin, put the handcuffs on him, delivered him to Officer Richter, was it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-8\">A Yes, sir, that is correct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-20\">This response could mean that, yes, Officer Gomez had \"handcuffed\" and \"delivered\u201d Colin, without necessarily meaning that he had formally \"arrested\u201d him. In <em>Ullrich, </em>we held that a police officer took reasonable steps to ensure his safety by \"frisking the suspect and securing him in the back seat of the patrol car, where no bodily harm could result, before checking under the front seat of the automobile for a weapon.\u201d 580 F.2d at 769. Given this holding, even if Officer Gomez did handcuff Colin before finding the shotgun, he would have been justified in doing so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
