City of Minneapolis, </em>713 F.Supp. 1296 (D.Minn.1989). The ordinance at issue requires certain new and existing adults-only businesses to operate within a specifically zoned district of the city. For reasons stated below, we reverse the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">For more than a decade, the City of Minneapolis has attempted to regulate adults-only businesses operating within the city limits. As amended November 7,1986, Minneapolis Code of Ordinances \u00a7 540.410 is the third version of the zoning ordinance enacted by the City to \u201cinsure that the[] adverse effects [of certain uses] will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood.\u201d \u00a7 540.410(a). The ordinance requires adults-only bookstores,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> motion picture theaters,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and entertainment centers to operate only within the B4 Central Business District of the city. \u00a7 540.410(c)(1). Adults-only motion picture theaters are further restricted by another zoning ordinance to subdistricts B4S and B4C. In addition, these businesses, as well as adults-only massage parlors, rap parlors, and saunas, cannot operate \u201cwithin one thousand (1,000) feet of a residentially zoned district, and within five hundred (500) feet of a church, a state-licensed day care facility ... public library, and public educational facilities which serve persons age seventeen (17) or younger, an elementary school or a high school.\u201d \u00a7 540.410(c)(2). Only one adult business is allowed per block face. The ordinance regulates both new and existing adult businesses. Those facilities not complying with the ordinance were required to move to a permitted location by December 1, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">At the time this action for declaratory and injunctive relief was filed against the City, plaintiff Ferris Alexander owned five adult bookstores and two theaters. Plaintiff U.S. Video operates a video tape rental facility in Minneapolis. The plaintiffs argued that the amended ordinance violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Following a four-day trial, the District Court found the \u201csubstantial and significant\u201d language of the ordinance defining adults-only bookstores was unconstitutionally vague. 713 F.Supp. at 1303. In an alternative holding on the First Amendment issues, the court found that although the City\u2019s enactment of the ordinance was not based on an impermissible intent to restrict the content of materials provided by the businesses, enforcement of the ordinance would \u201csuppress and greatly restrict the access to protected speech.\u201d 713 F.Supp. at 1305. Based on this finding, the court held the ordinance unconstitutional on First Amendment grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">On appeal, the City argues that neither plaintiff has standing to challenge section 540.410 for vagueness, that the ordinance is not unconstitutionally vague, and that the District Court erred as a matter of law because it applied the wrong legal standard when it determined that the ordinance did not allow for reasonable alternatives for communication of protected speech. On May 23, 1990, a week after the oral argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>ments in this appeal were heard by this Court, Alexander was convicted on criminal charges under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962(a), (c), and (d) (1988). On August 6, 1990, Alexander lost all interests and rights in his adults-only bookstores along with other properties forfeited to the United States as a result of his racketeering conviction. <em>United States v. Ferris J. Alexander, </em>Criminal No. 4-89-85, 1990 WL 117882 (D.Minn. August 6, 1990). On September 10, 1990, we granted a motion by the City to declare the issues relating to adult bookstores once owned by Alexander as moot. <em>Alexander v. City of Minneapolis, </em>No. 89-5351 (8th Cir. Sept. 10, 1990) (Partial Judgment). Therefore, our decision today is limited to the remaining issues relating to the theatres owned by Alexander and to the video rental store operated by U.S. Video.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">In its decision that section 540.410 is void for vagueness, the District Court did not specifically address the issue of whether either plaintiff had standing to challenge the ordinance for this alleged constitutional defect. Instead, the court proceeded directly to the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 due process attack and \u201cagree[d] with plaintiffs in that the \u2018substantial and significant\u2019 language in the ordinance is unconstitutionally vague.\u201d 713 F.Supp. at 1303. Although the District Court has not ruled on the question of standing, \u201cwe are required to address the issue____ The federal courts are under an independent obligation to examine their own jurisdiction, and standing is \u2018perhaps the most important of [the jurisdictional] doctrines.\u2019 \u201d <em>FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, </em>493 U.S. 215, 110 S.Ct. 596, 607, 107 L.Ed.2d 603 (1990) (quoting <em>Allen v. Wright, </em>468 U.S. 737, 750, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 3324, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">Plaintiffs argue that section 540.-410 is unconstitutionally vague because its language does not enable them to determine whether their businesses are covered by the ordinance or, if so, what they are required to do to comply with it. We note that this challenge is limited only to the portion of the ordinance which defines adult bookstores. The \u201csubstantial and significant\u201d language which the District Court found to be unconstitutionally vague is not contained in the sections of the ordinance defining adult theaters or other establishments that the City attempts to regulate. The record offers not the slightest hint of a vagueness attack on the \u201cregularly or routinely\u201d language of the ordinance defining adults-only motion picture theaters. Thus, with respect to plaintiff Alexander, it is unnecessary for us to determine whether he has standing to challenge for vagueness a section of this ordinance which applies only to the bookstores that he no longer owns. This issue is moot. It is also unnecessary for us to determine whether Alexander has standing to challenge the ordinance for vagueness as it applies to his theaters because he has not made any such challenge in either the court below or this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">A different analysis is required to determine whether plaintiff U.S. Video, which arguably might be a \u201cbookstore\u201d within the meaning of the ordinance, has standing to attack section 540.410(b)(1) for vagueness or any other alleged constitutional defects. To meet the standing requirement, a plaintiff must show that, as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant, he has suffered an \u201c \u2018actual or threatened injury\u2019 \u201d redressable by the court. <em>Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church &amp; State, Inc., </em>454 U.S. 464, 472, 102 S.Ct. 752, 758, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982) (quoting <em>Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, </em>441 U.S. 91, 99, 99 S.Ct. 1601, 1607, 60 L.Ed.2d 66 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">At trial, Scott Sarkis, the general manager for U.S. Video, testified that U.S. Video operated a video-tape rental store in Minneapolis located outside the Central Business District. He explained that the video-tapes classified as \u201cadults only\u201d \u2014 approximately 30 percent of the store\u2019s inventory \u2014 are segregated from the general tapes on display for rental. A customer must be at least 18 years of age to enter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>the adults-only section of the store in which the tapes are shelved in plain boxes with only the titles displayed. Mr. Sarkis testified that the store occasionally sells used rental tapes to make room for newer releases. It also places special orders for customers wishing to purchase a particular film on tape. The sale of tapes, according to Mr. Sarkis, does not account for a large percentage of the store\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">At first glance, a literal reading of section 540.410(b)(1) suggests that the videotape rental store operated by U.S. Video might fall within the definition of an adults-only bookstore.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, William Nordrum, Jr., the zoning supervisor of the City\u2019s building inspection department, testified that the Assistant City Attorney who authored the ordinance had ruled that stores primarily in the business of renting adult videos were not captured by section 540.410(b)(1). \u201c[Although there may be some sales,\u201d Mr. Nordrum testified, \u201c[the City Attorney] just felt it would not trigger the adult ordinance.\u201d Trial Transcript vol. II, at 134. Based on this opinion from the City Attorney\u2019s Office, the building inspection department \u201cdidn\u2019t bother to inspect [video rental stores such as U.S. Video].\u201d Trial Transcript vol. II, at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Thus, U.S. Video has not even been subjected to preliminary enforcement; that is, notification from the City that the facility would have to comply with section 540.410. The record reveals absolutely no attempt, threat, or plan by the City to enforce the adult ordinance against U.S. Video. Furthermore, such action is not contemplated, as indicated by the opinion from the City Attorney\u2019s Office to which Mr. Nordrum testified. Clearly, U.S. Video has not suffered \u201cany actual or threatened injury\u201d as a result of the City\u2019s enactment of section 540.410. While the seeds of controversy may indeed be planted in the plain language of the ordinance, they have yet to sprout from the dirt let alone ripen into an issue appropriate for this court to consider. We therefore hold that U.S. Video lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of section 540.410.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">In light of our decision on the threshold issue of standing, we need not reach the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 claim that section 540.-410 is void for vagueness. In turn, the decision of the District Court declaring the ordinance unconstitutionally vague is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">The final issue before us is whether section 540.410 violates plaintiff Alexander\u2019s First Amendment rights. Noting that the ordinance does not ban adults-only businesses altogether, the District Court rejected plaintiff\u2019s arguments that section 540.410 was content-based. Instead, the court subjected the ordinance \u201cto the analysis set out by the Supreme Court in <em>Young v. American Mini Theatres, </em>427 U.S. 50, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1975) [sic], and more recently in <em>City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., </em>475 U.S. 41, [106 S.Ct. 925, 89 L.Ed.2d 29] (1986),\u201d 713 F.Supp. at 1301, and correctly treated section 540.410 \u201cas a form of time, place, and manner regulation.\u201d <em>Renton, </em>475 U.S. at 46, 106 S.Ct. at 928. Under this analysis, the ordinance does not violate the First Amendment if it is \u201cdesigned to serve a substantial governmental interest and [it does] not unreasonably limit alternative avenues of communication.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 47, 106 S.Ct. at 928.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">In enacting section 540.410, the City recognized that \u201cserious objectionable operational characteristics [of certain businesses concentrated within an area have] a deleterious effect upon the use and enjoyment of adjacent areas.\u201d \u00a7 540.410(a). The stated purpose of the ordinance is \u201cto insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhood.\u201d \u00a7 540.410(a). Conceding that this stated purpose was permissible, Alexander argued that the real <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>intent of the City was to eliminate adult businesses because of their content. The District Court disagreed, finding that the ordinance was designed to serve a substantial governmental interest, and thus, passed the first part of the <em>Renton </em>test. Alexander does not appeal this determination by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Turning to the second part of the <em>Renton </em>test requiring reasonable alternative avenues of communication, the District Court examined the effect of the ordinance on adults-only businesses. Because both of Alexander\u2019s theaters are located outside the B4S and B4C segments of the Central Business District, section 540.410 requires Alexander to relocate these facilities within the permissible subdistricts. Alexander claimed that the ordinance would effectively put his theaters out of business because no reasonable opportunity existed for their relocation. Noting that the possibility that Alexander\u2019s theaters might be forced to close did not automatically invalidate the ordinance, the District Court determined that the validity of section 540.410 depended \u201con whether reasonable relocation possibilities exist for the protected businesses forced to shut down.\u201d 713 F.Supp. at 1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">The court declined to decide as a matter of law whether the percentage of land theoretically open to adult businesses was sufficient to provide reasonable access to protected speech. Instead, it focused on the actual locations available for Alexander to relocate his theaters. Based on lengthy testimony concerning Alexander\u2019s unsuccessful attempts to relocate his businesses, the court concluded that \u201cthe ordinance works to suppress and greatly restrict the access to protected speech and is unconstitutional.\u201d 713 F.Supp. at 1305. We reverse this ruling because we believe the District Court applied an incorrect legal standard in striking down section 540.410.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">\u201cThe inquiry for First Amendment purposes is not concerned with economic impact.\u201d <em>American Mini Theatres, </em>427 U.S. at 78, 96 S.Ct. at 2456 (Powell, J., concurring). The District Court, however, did consider testimony by Alexander that the one potential relocation site he found was cost-prohibitive. Additional testimony from Alexander that no one would sell or lease property on which he could relocate his businesses was also irrelevant to the First Amendment inquiry. The record clearly shows that other owners of adult businesses were able to find suitable relocation sites. That Alexander must fend for himself \u201cin the real estate market, on an equal footing with other prospective purchasers and lessees, does not give rise to a First Amendment violation.\u201d <em>Renton, </em>475 U.S. at 54, 106 S.Ct. at 932. The Supreme Court has \u201cnever suggested that the First Amendment compels [a municipal government to ensure that adult theaters, or any other kinds of speech-related businesses for that matter, will be able to obtain sites at bargain prices.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">Our examination of the record satisfies us that numerous sites were potentially available for Alexander to relocate his theaters. Under the ordinance, theaters of this sort have access to at least 6.6% of the total acreage of commercial land;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> within the available areas are a myriad of block faces, each a potential relocation site.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>That Alexander could not secure property meeting his economic or commercial criteria does not render section 540.410 invalid. The City is not required by the First Amendment to provide Alexander with an actual site available to relocate his the-atres. Rather, Minneapolis is only prohibited from denying plaintiff \u201ca reasonable opportunity to open and operate an adult theater within the city.\u201d <em>Renton, </em>475 U.S. at 54, 106 S.Ct. at 932. Holding that section 540.410 meets this requirement, we reverse the decision of the District Court that the ordinance violates plaintiffs First Amendment rights.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we vacate the decision of the District Court that section 540.410 is unconstitutionally vague. The court\u2019s alternative holding that the ordinance works as a prior restraint in violation of the First Amendment is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b384-7\">. The ordinance defines an adults-only bookstore as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">[a]n establishment having as a substantial or significant portion of its stock in trade, books, magazines, films for sale or viewing on premises by use of motion picture devices or other coin-operated means, and other periodicals which are distinguished or characterized by their principal emphasis on matters depicting, describing or relating to nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement or sadomasochistic abuse ... or an establishment with a segment or section devoted to the sale or display of such material, for sale to patrons therein. \u00a7 540.410(b)(1).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b384-13\">. The ordinance defines an adults-only motion picture theater as \"[a]n enclosed building used regularly and routinely for presenting programs, material distinguished or characterized by an emphasis on matter depicting, describing or relating to nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement or sadomasochistic abuse ... for observation by patrons therein.\" \u00a7 540.410(b)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b386-6\">. \u201cAn establishment having as a substantial or significant portion of its stock in ... films for sale ... which are distinguished or characterized by their [sexually-explicit nature] ... or an establishment with a segment or section devoted to the sale or display of such material, for sale to patrons therein.\" \u00a7 540.410(b)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b387-7\">. We arrive at this figure by simple calculations. According to Plaintiffs Exhibit 14, land zoned B4, B4C, and B4S constitutes at least 13.5% of the city\u2019s commercial land; <em>i.e., </em>375 acres of the 2,784 acres of land in commercial use. Allowing a 90 acre loss for the spacing restrictions caused by triggering uses, 285 acres or 10.2% of the city's commercial land remain for adults-only businesses to legally locate their facilities. Theaters are further restricted from the 3.6% of the land which constitutes the B4 Central Business District. Therefore, 6.6% of the total acreage of commercial land is available for adults-only theaters. <em>See </em>Joint Appendix vol. I, at p. 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b387-11\">. Our examination of the record, specifically Plaintiffs Exhibit 23, shows at least 120 block faces are potentially available for owners of adult theaters to locate their facilities. This ample opportunity for relocation distinguishes the case here from Alexander\u2019s earlier and successful challenge of the Minneapolis Code of Ordinances section 540.410 enacted in 1977. Because the earlier version of the zoning ordinance allowed \"at most [only] twelve possible legal sites for relocation,\u201d <em>Alexander v. City of Minneapolis, </em>698 F.2d 936, 938 (8th Cir.1983), we upheld the District Court\u2019s finding that \u00a7 540.410 would greatly suppress access to adult theaters and was therefore a constitutional vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>lation under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. 698 F.2d at 939.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b388-30\">. It is unnecessary for us to consider Alexander's claim that he is denied equal protection under section 540.410. Although raised at the District Court, this issue was not addressed. We decline to do so now except to quote a footnote from <em>Posadas De Puerto Rico Assoc. v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, </em>478 U.S. 328, 345 n. 9, 106 S.Ct. 2968, 2979 n. 9, 92 L.Ed.2d 266 (1986): \"If there is a sufficient \u2018fit\u2019 between the legislature's means and ends to satisfy the concerns of the First Amendment, the same 'fit' is surely adequate under applicable \u2018rational basis\u2019 equal protection analysis.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
