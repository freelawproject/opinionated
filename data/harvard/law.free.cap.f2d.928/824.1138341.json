Price alleges that the defendants contravened federal law restricting the management of Hawaiian lands previously held by the United States. The district court dismissed the action for failure to state a claim and for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. We reverse and remand the case to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-23\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b921-24\">When Hawaii achieved statehood, the United States ceded to the new State almost all of the Hawaiian lands to which the federal government held title. <em>See </em>Hawaii Admission Act, Pub.L. No. 86-3 (hereinafter the \u201cAdmission Act\u201d) \u00a7 5(b), 73 Stat. 4, 5 (1959), as amended by the Hawaiian Omnibus Act, Pub.L. No. 86-624, 74 Stat. 411 (1960). At the same time, the United States imposed obligations upon Hawaii with respect to these lands. In particular, it specified that such lands, and the income from them</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-25\">shall be held by [Hawaii] as a public trust for the support of the public schools and other public educational institutions, for the betterment of the conditions of native Hawaiians ... for the development of farm and home ownership ..., and for the provision of lands for public use. Such lands, proceeds, and income shall be managed and disposed of for one or more of the foregoing purposes in such manner as the constitution and laws of [Hawaii] may provide, and their use for any other object shall constitute a breach of trust for which suit may be brought by the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b921-26\"><em>See </em>Admission Act \u00a7 5(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b921-27\">In its constitution, Hawaii declared that it would hold a portion of the lands conveyed by \u00a7 5(b) as a \u201cpublic trust for native Hawaiians and the general public.\u201d Haw. Const, art. XII, \u00a7 4. Subsequently, the Hawaiian legislature established the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (hereinafter the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>\u201cOHA\u201d) to serve \u201cnative Hawaiians and Hawaiians.\u201d Haw. Const., art. XII, \u00a7 6. The state funded the OHA in part by granting it a share of the income produced by the \u201cpublic land trust\u201d created out of the \u00a7 5(b) lands. Haw.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 10-3.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">In this suit, filed under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, Price alleges that the trustees of the OHA have violated the Admission Act by managing income derived from \u00a7 5(b) lands in a manner that contravenes \u00a7 5(f) of the Act. More specifically, he contends that the trustees have comingled OHA\u2019s share of that income with other OHA funds; that they have expended none of it for the benefit of native Hawaiians; and that they have used it instead for purposes other than those listed in \u00a7 5(f). <em>See </em>Complaint, 111115, 14, 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Without filing an Answer to Price\u2019s Complaint, the trustees moved to dismiss the action. The district court granted the motion on the grounds that (A) the court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, and (B) the Complaint does not state a claim upon which relief can be granted. On appeal, Price takes issue with both of these rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b922-7\">Having accepted the Complaint\u2019s allegations as true, and having construed the Complaint in the light most favorable to Price, <em>see Baker v. McNeil Island Corrections Ctr., </em>859 F.2d 124, 127 (9th Cir.1988), we hold that Price has stated a claim and that the district court has jurisdiction to hear it. We conclude therefore that the court\u2019s dismissal was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">A. <em>Failure To State A Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b922-12\">The district court found that Price has not stated a claim because the Admission Act does not impose the obligations that Price asserts the trustees have violated. This ruling is one of law and we review it <em>de novo. See Thomas v. Carpenter, </em>881 F.2d 828, 829 (9th Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 110 S.Ct. 1475, 108 L.Ed.2d 612 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b922-15\">Section 5(f) of the Admission Act directed unequivocally that the lands conveyed to Hawaii in \u00a7 5(b), and the income produced by them, \u201cshall be managed and disposed of for one or more\u201d of five stated purposes. Admission Act, \u00a7 5(f). Because the OHA share of \u201cpublic trust\u201d income at issue in this case derives directly from the \u00a7 5(b) lands, \u00a7 5(f)\u2019s limitation on uses applies to that income. In his Complaint, Price alleges that the trustees have expended the income on purposes other than those listed in \u00a7 5(f). <em>See </em>Complaint, 111114, 16. Thus, the Complaint states a claim to enforce the provisions of \u00a7 5(f) of the Admission Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-16\">The fact that the trustees may, consistently with \u00a7 5(f), spend the income for purposes other than to benefit native Hawaiians does not deprive Price of standing to bring his claim. We recently considered this very question, and determined that allegations such as those Price has made are sufficient to show an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d. <em>See Price, </em>764 F.2d at 630.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In addition, allow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>ing Price to enforce \u00a7 5(f) is consistent with the common law of trusts, in which one whose status as a beneficiary depends upon the discretion of the trustee nevertheless may sue to compel the trustee to abide by the terms of the trust. <em>See </em>Restatement 2d of the Law of Trusts, \u00a7 214(1), comment a; <em>see also id. </em>at \u00a7 391 (stating that plaintiff with \u201cspecial interest,\u201d beyond that of ordinary citizen, may sue to enforce public charitable trust).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">The trustees argue that they may not be held liable for breaching the terms of \u00a7 5(f) because the \u201cOHA trust,\u201d which they manage and into which the OHA share of \u00a7 5(f) income was placed, is distinct from the trust created by \u00a7 5(f). Transferring a portion of the \u00a7 5(f) trust income to a state agency, however, did not dissolve or dilute the restrictions on how that income may be spent. So long as \u00a7 5(f) trust income remained in the hands of the state, as it did when transferred from the \u00a7 5(f) corpus to the OHA corpus, the \u00a7 5(f) obligations applied. Naturally, we accept that once the income has been \u201cdisposed of\u201d or \u201cuse[d]\u201d by the state, there are no \u00a7 5(f) limitations on subsequent use; however, we reject the trustees\u2019 suggestion that Hawaii \u201cdisposed of\u201d or \u201cused\u201d \u00a7 5(f) trust income simply by transferring it to the OHA. Admission Act \u00a7 5(f). Because the funds are still in state hands, \u00a7 5(f)\u2019s restrictions apply to the use or disposal of the income <em>by OHA.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">The trustees also maintain that, although Hawaii itself may be bound by \u00a7 5(f), the trustees\u2019 obligations with respect to spending OHA funds are to state law alone. The trustees\u2019 position is squarely at odds with the principle of \u00a7 1983 in general, and our recent Admission Act decisions in particular. Any ordinary policeman sued under \u00a7 1983 defendant is, in his official function, a creature of the state, and his primary obligations are to state law; yet, he is not thereby relieved of the duty not to deprive persons of their federal rights. In a similar vein, the fourteenth amendment addresses itself to \u201cstates,\u201d but that does not mean that entities and agents inferior to states are incapable of violating the amendment by depriving citizens of due process and equal protection. <em>See, e.g., Scheuer v. Rhodes, </em>416 U.S. 232, 235, 94 S.Ct. 1683, 1685, 40 L.Ed.2d 90 (1974) (holding that state governor and state university president were sueable under \u00a7 1983 for due process violations). Furthermore, the defendants in <em>Keaukaha II, </em>officers of the Hawaiian Homes Commission, also answered to state law in the execution of their official functions; yet, they were held properly subject to a \u00a7 1983 suit for breach of \u00a7 5(f). <em>See </em>739 F.2d at 1472.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-9\">B. <em>Subject Matter Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"axn-dedup-0\">The district court concluded that it lacks jurisdiction to hear Price\u2019s suit for two independent reasons: first, Price\u2019s claim is state rather than federal in nature, and therefore \u00a7 1983, the asserted basis of jurisdiction, is unavailable; second, Price\u2019s suit is against the trustees in their official capacities, and therefore barred by the eleventh amendment. These issues are reviewable <em>de novo. See Keaukaha I, </em>588 F.2d at 1224-27 (federal nature of claim); <em>Keaukaha II, </em>739 F.2d at 1471-72 (same); <em>BV Engineering v. University of California at Los Angeles, </em>858 F.2d 1394, 1395 (9th Cir.1988) (eleventh amendment immunity), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>489 U.S. 1090, 109 S.Ct. 1557, 103 L.Ed.2d 859 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b923-10\">1. <em>Nature of Price\u2019s claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b923-11\">The right Price claims is indeed federal; thus, he has not failed to meet this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>requirement of \u00a7 1983. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 536, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 1913, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981) (\u00a7 1983 plaintiff must allege deprivation of federal, not state, right). In <em>Keaukaha II, </em>we held that the right asserted by the plaintiffs was federal because it was \u201cspecifically protected by an Act of Congress, the Admission Act, \u00a7 5(f).\u201d 739 F.2d at 1472. The \u00a7 5(f) trust obligation, we said, was \u201crooted in federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, we recently have characterized <em>Keaukaha II </em>as holding that \u201c\u00a7 5(f) of the Admission Act creates a federal \u2018right\u2019 enforceable under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Price, </em>764 F.2d at 628; <em>see also Ulaleo v. Paty, </em>902 F.2d 1395, 1397 (9th Cir.1990). The source of the right Price asserts here is precisely the same as the source of the right claimed in <em>Keaukaha II, </em>namely \u00a7 5(f) of the Admission Act. Hence, the right Price asserts also is federal, and \u00a7 1983 is available,</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">2. <em>Applicability of the eleventh amendment</em></p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Price is suing the trustees in their individual, rather than official, capacities, and thus his suit is not barred by the eleventh amendment. <em>See Blaylock v. Schwinden, </em>862 F.2d 1352, 1354 (9th Cir.1988) (noting that eleventh amendment does not prohibit individual capacity suits); <em>cf. Kentucky v. Graham, </em>473 U.S. 159, 165-67, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 3104-06, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985) (observing that official capacity suits are equivalent to suits against the entity itself, and raise eleventh amendment concerns where the entity is a state). Although the Complaint does not expressly state that Price is suing the trustees themselves, as opposed to the state, the \u201cbasis of the claims asserted and nature of relief sought\u201d imply that this must be so. <em>See Central Reserve Life Ins. Co. v. Struve, </em>852 F.2d 1158, 1161 (9th Cir.1988) (relying on these factors, rather than on caption of complaint, to determine capacity in which defendant is being sued).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-8\">By seeking damages under \u00a7 1983, the Complaint indicates that the intended defendants are the trustees as individuals. <em>See Blaylock, </em>862 F.2d at 1354 (\u201c[DJamage actions brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 are generally viewed as suits against the individual\u201d); <em>Demery v. Kupperman, </em>735 F.2d 1139, 1145-46 (9th Cir.1984) (construing \u00a7 1983 damage action as individual capacity suit), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1127, 105 S.Ct. 810, 83 L.Ed.2d 803 (1985). To sue Hawaii itself, by proceeding against the trustees in their official capacities, would have been inconsistent with the very nature of Price\u2019s claim, since \u00a7 1983 applies only to deprivations of federal rights by \u201cpersons,\u201d and Hawaii is not a person under the statute. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983; <em>Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Police, </em>491 U.S. 58, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 2307-08, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-9\">The trustees argue, and the district court found, that Price\u2019s suit must be against the trustees in their official capacities because the Complaint\u2019s allegations concern the trustees\u2019 conduct while performing their official functions. This argument confuses the capacity in which a defendant is sued with the capacity in which the defendant was acting when the alleged deprivation of rights occurred. The former need not coincide with the latter. Clearly, under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff may sue a state officer in his individual capacity for alleged wrongs committed by the officer in his official capacity. <em>See, e.g., Blaylock, </em>862 F.2d at 1354 (observing that plaintiff who alleged failure by governor to administer certain law could avoid eleventh amendment bar by amending complaint to claim only damages against governor in his individual capacity); <em>Demery, </em>735 F.2d at 1146 (construing as individual capacity suit an action against state medical board superfi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>sor who enforced allegedly ineffective disciplinary order of board).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">The district court erred in concluding that Price has not stated a claim, and that the court is without jurisdiction to hear it. The order of dismissal is therefore REVERSED, and the case is REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b922-8\">. Among the lands expressly conveyed by \u00a7 5(b) were those known as the Hawaiian \"homelands\u201d. A \u201ccompact\" between Hawaii and the United States strictly limits the manner in which Hawaii may manage the homelands and the income they produce. <em>See </em>Admission Act \u00a7 4; <em>Keaukaha-Panaewa Community Ass\u2019n v. Hawaiian Homes Comm\u2019n, </em>588 F.2d 1216, 1218\u201419 (9th Cir.) <em>(\"Keaukaha I\"), cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 826, 100 S.Ct. 49, 62 L.Ed.2d 33 (1979); <em>Keaukaha-Panaewa Community Ass\u2019n v. Hawaiian Homes Comm\u2019n, </em>739 F.2d 1467, 1469 (9th Cir.1984) <em>(\u201cKeaukaha </em>II\u201d); <em>Price v. Hawaii, </em>764 F.2d 623, 625 (9th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 1055, 106 S.Ct. 793, 88 L.Ed.2d 771 (1986). The \"public land trust\u201d created by the Hawaiian constitution, however, does not include the homelands. <em>See </em>Haw. Const., art. XII, \u00a7 4. Consequently, the trust proceeds granted to the OHA are unrelated to the homelands, <em>see </em>Haw. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 10-3; and whether State officials are managing the homelands and the income they produce in conformity with the compact between Hawaii and the United States is not at issue in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b922-18\">. The trustees argue that the <em>Price </em>decision on standing does not apply to this case because the relief sought in <em>Price </em>was prospective, while the relief sought here is retrospective. That difference, however, does not affect standing. We held in <em>Price </em>that native Hawaiians had standing to compel future compliance with the terms of \u00a7 5(f) even though compliance would not neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>sarily result in use of \u00a7 5(f) assets to benefit native Hawaiians. Following that precedent, we hold here that Price, as a native Hawaiian, has standing to seek redress for past violations of \u00a7 5(f) even though that redress may not necessarily benefit native Hawaiians. Moreover, we note that counsel for Price asserted at oral argument that among the .state-authorized purposes for which the OHA may spend its funds, only one \u2014 the benefit of native Hawaiians \u2014 is authorized by \u00a7 5(f). If Price succeeds in proving that the trustees have misappropriated \u00a7 5(f) income and must return it to the OHA or \u00a7 5(f) trust, he might attempt to show, perhaps in a pendent claim, that the returned money must be used to benefit native Hawaiians. Thus, Price has a real stake in enforcing the terms of \u00a7 5(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b924-6\">. Only if Price had sought prospective relief could this inconsistency have been avoided; such an action against the trustees in their official capacities would not have been an action against the state. <em>See Will, </em>109 S.Ct. at 2311 n. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>10. Price, however, has not sought prospective relief in his Complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b925-17\">. <em>Mitchell v. Los Angeles Community College Dist., </em>861 F.2d 198 (9th Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1081, 109 S.Ct. 2102, 104 L.Ed.2d 663 (1989), does not support the trustees\u2019 position. <em>Mitchell </em>held that the defendants in that case \u201dshare[d] in [the state's] eleventh amendment immunity because they were sued in their official capacities.\u201d It did not expressly state the basis on which it had decided that the action was an official capacity suit. <em>See id. </em>at 201-02. In that case, it was apparently undisputed that the plaintiffs were seeking damages from a California community college district, and that the officials of the district were being sued in their official capacity. The question was whether, under California law, the district should be regarded as a state agency. In this case, the plaintiffs have disavowed any claim for state funds, and have made it clear they are seeking damages from the personal estates of the individual defendants. The defendants therefore do not share the state\u2019s immunity from this suit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
