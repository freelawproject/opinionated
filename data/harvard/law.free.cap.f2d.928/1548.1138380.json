BACKGROUND OF THE CASE</p>\n<p id=\"A7Z\">In the spring of 1989, Derick Bennett was involved in cocaine distribution in Jacksonville, Florida. He gave some crack cocaine to a friend named Carolyn Taylor. Taylor then took the drugs to Alexander Gardner and asked him to sell the drugs for her. Gardner, however, was a government informant. Working with law enforcement officers, Gardner gathered information on Taylor, Bennett, and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-6\">In the fall of 1989, after finding out that Gardner was an informant, Bennett approached Gardner on the street and got into an argument with him. Bennett shot at Gardner, but did not hit him.</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-7\">Bennett was subsequently indicted on charges of retaliating against a confidential government informant in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1513(a)(2) and distributing five grams or more of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(a)(1). He was convicted on both charges in a three-day jury trial in January 1990 and was later sentenced to serve nineteen years and seven months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-8\">In this appeal, Bennett raises issues regarding the government\u2019s use of peremptory strikes in the selection of his jury, the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to interview prospective government witnesses, and the district court\u2019s grant of the government\u2019s motion in limine restricting testimony regarding a government witness\u2019s drug-related arrests. Bennett also appeals the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-11\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"AOC\">A. <em>Batson Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1646-12\">Bennett is a Jamaican-born African-American. His jury was chosen from a venire consisting of thirty-two persons, five of whom were African-Americans. Of its six peremptory strikes, the government used three to strike African-Americans. The empaneled jury contained two African-Americans. After each government strike against an African-American, Bennett objected to the strike as racially discriminatory in accordance with <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986). The district court requested that the government explain its reasons for striking the prospective jurors. In each instance, the court accepted the government\u2019s articulated reasons as racially neutral. Bennett asserts on appeal that the government\u2019s reasons were not racially neutral, but instead were pretextual.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1647-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1551\">*1551</page-number>Once the defendant makes out a prima facie case of racial discrimination, \u201cthe burden shifts to the prosecutor to articulate a clear, reasonably specific and neutral explanation for challenging the black jurors.\u201d <em>United States v. David, </em>844 F.2d 767, 769 (11th Cir.1988). We review the district court\u2019s findings of fact as to whether the government\u2019s articulated reasons are racially neutral on a clearly erroneous standard. <em>Id. </em>In making its determination, the district court may \u201cconsider whether the reasons offered by the government for excluding a black member of the venire also applied to white members.\u201d <em>United States v. Alston, </em>895 F.2d 1362, 1367 n. 5 (11th Cir.1990). Bennett\u2019s primary argument is that the district court was clearly erroneous in holding the government\u2019s reasons racially neutral because white venire members were selected who had the same characteristics for which the African-American venire members were allegedly struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b1647-5\">The first African-American the government struck was prospective juror Hunt, a nineteen-year-old, single male, who worked as a custodian and who had a relative working in law enforcement. The government\u2019s reasons for striking him were his youthfulness, lack of employment experience, and also the fact that he had an uncle who had been convicted on drug charges. The court found this last reason for striking Hunt especially persuasive. Bennett points out, however, that prospective juror Grandstaff, who was white and was not stricken, was also young, inexperienced, and lacked employment history. Moreover, yet another prospective juror, who cannot be identified in the transcript, also had a close family member who had been convicted of drug offenses, but he or she was not stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1647-7\">Prospective juror Grier, the second African-American whom the government struck, was thirty-eight years old, was employed at a Naval Air Base, had been in the military, and had relatives in law enforcement. The prosecutor\u2019s articulated reason for striking him was that his ex-wife had been convicted of narcotics possession within the last year. Bennett again points out that the unidentified prospective juror with a close relative who had likewise been convicted of drug charges was not stricken. Moreover, he points out that those with ties to law enforcement and the military are generally good jurors for the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b1647-8\">The last African-American the government struck was prospective juror Thomas. When the judge asked the venire generally whether any of them had eaten at the \u201cPepper Pot,\u201d a restaurant where Bennett had worked, Thomas said \u201cno\u201d along with everyone else. However, he later told a marshal during a break that he had heard of the \u201cPepper Pot\u201d and knew it had a \u201cbad reputation.\u201d The government asserted his belated admission of knowledge of the \u201cPepper Pot\u201d and the fact that he lived near the restaurant as its reasons for striking Thomas. Bennett contends that these reasons are irrational because any venire member who knew of the \u201cPepper Pot\u201d would be likely to be prejudiced against Bennett and therefore be a pro-government juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b1647-9\">The fact that a prospective juror has \u201cprior family involvement with drug charges,\u201d as was the case with Hunt and Grier, has been deemed a racially neutral reason for the government to strike under <em>Batson. Alston, </em>895 F.2d at 1367. Though the unidentified prospective juror with this characteristic was not stricken, the record does not reflect this prospective juror\u2019s race or whether this prospective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1552\">*1552</page-number>juror was eventually empaneled.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, the comparison between the unidentified non-stricken prospective juror and the stricken African-American venire members does not nullify the government\u2019s purported reason for striking. Moreover, \u201c[t]he attributes relied upon by the prosecutor in striking potential jurors are not always easily compared ... and often require an evaluation of the degree to which the prospective juror manifests the stated at-tribute____ The trial judge is in a superior position to determine whether white members of the venire who were not struck had a greater, lesser, or the same degree of difficulty in following voir dire questions, or whether a prospective white juror\u2019s familiarity with a family drug problem was as significant as that of an excluded black member of the venire.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1367 n. 5. We must therefore defer to the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1648-5\">Bennett further claims, however, that the government\u2019s reasons for striking Grier and Thomas are irrational and therefore must be pretextual. <em>See United States v. Alcantar, </em>897 F.2d 436, 438 (9th Cir.1990) (stating that \u201cclaims about the juror, although true, [may be] so irrational as a reason for striking a juror that they might be pretexts for some undisclosed discriminatory reason\u201d). Bennett claims the reasons are pretexts because Grier\u2019s familial association with law enforcement makes him a strong pro-government juror and Thomas\u2019s knowledge of the \u201cPepper Pot\u201d should actually prejudice him against Bennett. These reasons in favor of the government\u2019s choosing these prospective jurors, however, must be weighed against the government\u2019s articulated reasons for striking them. In Grier\u2019s case, that articulated reason is his familial association with someone convicted on drug charges, clearly a weighty and racially neutral reason under <em>Alston, supra. </em>In Thomas\u2019s case, the government\u2019s reason for striking him was his belated admission that he knew of the \u201cPepper Pot\u201d and that he lived in the area of the restaurant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Though the sufficiency of these reasons for striking Thomas is not as apparent at first glance as the sufficiency of the reason for striking Grier, a close look at the record aids us in determining that they are. <em>See Alston, </em>895 F.2d at 1367 n. 5 (noting that the weighing and comparisons a <em>Batson </em>claim requires also necessitate a close reading of the hearing transcript).</p>\n<p id=\"b1648-10\">From the government\u2019s explanation regarding the striking of Thomas, the court appears to have assumed that the government\u2019s real reason was that the prospective juror lacked forthrightness. This lack of forthrightness was in the court\u2019s mind a sufficiently neutral reason justifying the strike. The court noted that Thomas\u2019s comments to the marshal would just as easily have supported a strike by the defendant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1648-11\">There is, however, some question as to whether Thomas actually lacked forthrightness. The government had requested as one of its four proposed voir dire questions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1553\">*1553</page-number>whether the jurors had eaten at or knew of the \u201cPepper Pot.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court, however, asking the question at the close of voir dire, asked only whether they had eaten at the \u201cPepper Pot.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thomas stated along with the other prospective jurors that he had not eaten there. Later, he relayed to the marshal only that he knew of the restaurant\u2019s reputation and lived near it even though he had never eaten there.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, Thomas was actually truthful in answering the court\u2019s question and fastidiously forthright in relaying his doubts to the marshal. It is obvious that the court was not aware that it had asked in voir dire only whether any member of the venire had eaten at the \u201cPepper Pot\u201d and had not asked the second half of the question concerning familiarity with the \u201cPepper Pot.\u201d Accordingly, the court was incorrect in finding that the government\u2019s reason for striking Thomas was his lack of forthrightness and consequently in declaring that this lack of forthrightness was a sufficiently neutral reason for the strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b1649-5\">The court\u2019s misperception of the situation, however, was harmless. The government also put forward the additional reason for striking Thomas that \u201che lived in the area\u201d of the restaurant. This additional reason is, in our opinion, sufficiently neutral to justify the strike. <em>See United States v. McAnderson, </em>914 F.2d 934, 942 (7th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>871 F.2d 71, 72-73 (8th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Andrade, </em>788 F.2d 521, 525 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 963, 107 S.Ct. 462, 93 L.Ed.2d 408 (1986). We therefore find no <em>Batson </em>error.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1649-15\">B. <em>Motion to Interview Witnesses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1649-16\">Prior to trial, Bennett made a motion before the magistrate to interview prospective government witnesses. The government responded that its two witnesses, Alexander Gardner and Carolyn Taylor, had stated that they did not wish to speak to Bennett\u2019s attorneys. The magistrate, consequently, denied Bennett\u2019s motion. Bennett claims that this denial was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1649-17\">\u201cIt is well established that a defendant is normally entitled, without governmental interference, to access to prospective witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. Pepe, </em>747 F.2d 632, 654 (11th Cir.1984). However, \u201cthe government [has] no duty, absent a court order, to present its witnesses for interviews; the government\u2019s duty [is], simply, not to deny access.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655. Clearly, \u201ca witness may refuse to be interviewed.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1554\">*1554</page-number><em>United States v. Brown, </em>555 F.2d 407, 425 (5th Cir.1977) (quoting <em>United States v. Dryden, </em>423 F.2d 1175, 1177 n. 6 (5th Cir.1970)), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>435 U.S. 904, 98 S.Ct. 1448, 55 L.Ed.2d 494 (1978). \u201c[A] government witness who does not wish to speak to or be interviewed by the defense prior to trial may not be required to do so.\u201d <em>United States v. Benson, </em>495 F.2d 475, 479 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1035, 95 S.Ct. 519, 42 L.Ed.2d 310 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-4\">Bennett proposes that the court should have ordered or at least encouraged Gardner and Taylor to talk with his attorney. In <em>Pepe, supra, </em>the district court did take it upon itself to advise the government\u2019s witness that he was free to speak with the defense if he chose to do so. <em>Pepe, </em>747 F.2d at 656. <em>Pepe </em>did not, however, create or impose a duty on the district court to encourage reluctant government witnesses to speak with defense counsel. Rather, error is normally found only where \u201cprosecutors have hidden witnesses or deliberately disobeyed court orders to produce for examination witnesses under governmental control.\u201d <em>Pepe, </em>747 F.2d at 654. This is not such a case. We therefore find this argument to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-5\">C. <em>The Motion in Limine</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1650-6\">Prior to trial, the government made a motion in limine to limit Bennett\u2019s cross-examination of witness Gardner in regard to prior drug arrests and a murder arrest, all of which were dismissed against him. After holding an evidentiary hearing, the district court found that the drug arrests in question had been staged in order to maintain Gardner\u2019s cover and ruled that Bennett could not bring up the drug arrests because of the possibility that their mention would mislead the jury. The court ruled, however, that Bennett could cross-examine Gardner as to the murder arrest because, in Bennett\u2019s theory, the dropping of the murder charge was related to Gardner\u2019s willingness to cooperate with the government. Bennett appeals the court\u2019s limitation of his cross-examination as to the drug charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-7\">This Court reviews the district court\u2019s \u201ccurtailment of cross-examination or the admissibility of extrinsic evidence to attack the credibility of a witness\u201d under the \u201cabuse of discretion\u201d standard. <em>United States v. Calle, </em>822 F.2d 1016, 1019-20 (11th Cir.1987). The defendant\u2019s right <em>to </em>cross-examine the government\u2019s witnesses is secured by the Sixth Amendment guarantee that the accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him. <em>Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 315, 94 S.Ct. 1105, 1109, 39 L.Ed.2d 347 (1974). \u201c[Ejxposure of a witness\u2019 motivation in testifying is a proper and important function of the constitutionally protected right of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 316-17, 94 S.Ct. at 1110-11. Bennett claims that the real rationale for dropping the drug charges was that the government made a deal with Gardner in order to get him to testify against Bennett. Accordingly, Bennett claims, cross-examination in regard to the charges could have uncovered Gardner\u2019s bias against Bennett.</p>\n<p id=\"b1650-8\">\u201cThis court has repeatedly held, however, that a trial judge may limit cross-examination without infringing the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment rights where \u2018(1) the jury, through the cross-examination permitted, was exposed to facts sufficient for it to draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness; and, (2) the cross-examination conducted by defense counsel enabled him to make a record from which he could argue why the witness might have been biased.\u2019 \u201d <em>Calle, </em>822 F.2d at 1020 (quoting <em>United States v. Summers, </em>598 F.2d 450, 461 (5th Cir.1979)). The government points out that Gardner was cross-examined on, <em>inter alia, </em>his prior involvement in drug distribution for a large-scale drug organization, his plea agreement with the government which limited his criminal liability, and his undercover work for the government. Consequently, the jury had information upon which to judge Gardner\u2019s reliability, and defense counsel had a record from which to argue bias. Accordingly, limitation of Gardner\u2019s cross-exami<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1555\">*1555</page-number>nation was within the district court\u2019s discretion.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1651-5\">D. <em>Sentencing Issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1651-6\">After trial, a pre-sentencing report was done. The district court adopted that report\u2019s recommendations and arrived at a sentence of nineteen years and seven months. The report calculated that the offense level for distributing cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 841(a)(1) in Bennett\u2019s case was 32. The report then suggested adding 2 points for possession of a weapon during the commission of a drug offense under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) and 2 points for obstruction of justice under \u00a7 3C1.1 for a suggested level of 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b1651-7\">The count of retaliation against a government informant in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1513(a)(2) was grouped together with the drug offense as a closely-related offense pursuant to \u00a7 3D1.2(c) which requires grouping when one of the counts embodies conduct that is treated as a specific offense characteristic in, or adjustment to, the guideline applicable to another count. The shooting at Gardner was the basis of the obstruction of justice adjustment on the drug distribution charge. Therefore, Bennett\u2019s offense level was not additionally increased for the retaliation charge. Bennett\u2019s motion for a two-point downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3El.l(a) was denied. The sentencing level finally arrived upon therefore remained 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b1651-11\">(1) The Relevant Conduct Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b1651-12\">The base level for distribution of five grams or more is normally 26, instead of the level 32 used in Bennett\u2019s case. The base level was adjusted upward 6 points under \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l), which allows the sentencing court to take into account \u201crelevant conduct,\u201d defined as \u201call acts and omissions committed or aided and abetted by the defendant, or for which the defendant would be otherwise accountable, that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction.\u201d Bennett was convicted of distributing five or more grams of cocaine. The chemist who analyzed the cocaine Bennett distributed to Taylor stated that she weighed 11.9 grams of cocaine base. Taylor, however, testified at trial that Bennett had in his apartment 362 packets of cocaine base on the night that Bennett gave her the cocaine which she later passed on to Gardner. Taylor also testified that the bag of cocaine she passed to Gardner contained 62 packets. The Presentencing Investigation Report projected the total amount of cocaine Bennett had in his possession that night to have been 90 grams.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1652-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1556\">*1556</page-number>Bennett claims that an amount of cocaine base greater than 11.9 grams was not shown by a preponderance of the evidence. Taylor presented the only testimony indicating that the drugs involved were more than the 11.9 grams confirmed by the chemist. Bennett points out that the chemist testified that there were 92 packets in the bag she was given to examine, <em>i.e., </em>the bag Bennett gave Taylor which was later passed on to Gardner. The chemist removed 30 packets and tested them, so that at the time of trial there were only 62 packets actually remaining in the bag. But Taylor testified at trial that there were 62 packets in the bag when Bennett originally gave it to her, suggesting in Bennett\u2019s view, that she had no independent recollection of the number but was basing her testimony on her examination of the bag after the chemist had finished the testing, <em>i.e., </em>92 \u2014 30 = 62. Bennett also asserts that Taylor\u2019s inaccuracy throws serious doubt on the reliability of her testimony regarding the total number of packets Bennett had in his possession that night. The district court, however, found Taylor\u2019s testimony credible, stating that it had been specific and that the jury had obviously found her credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1652-4\">\u201c[Cjonduct not contained in the indictment may be considered at sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Ignancio Munio, </em>909 F.2d 436, 439 (11th Cir.1990) (per curiam). This concept applies even when considering the amount of drugs under the \u201crelevant conduct\u201d provision of the Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 438-39. The facts considered in sentencing, moreover, need only be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 439. In addition, \u201c[tjhe sentencing court\u2019s findings of fact must be accepted unless they</p>\n<p id=\"b1652-9\">are \u2018clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Erves, </em>880 F.2d 376, 381 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 110 S.Ct. 416, 107 L.Ed.2d 381 (1989). It is also clear that \u201cthe court of appeals must \u2018give due regard to the opportunity of the district court to judge the credibility of witnesses ... and shall give due deference to the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Howard, </em>923 F.2d 1500, 1503 (11th Cir.1991) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e)(4) (1988)). The district court, having listened to all of the testimony, chose to accept Taylor\u2019s testimony as to the total amount of cocaine Bennett had in his possession. We cannot find error in that credibility choice absent a stronger showing than Bennett has put forward here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1652-12\">(2) Upward Adjustment For Firearm</p>\n<p id=\"b1652-13\">The district court adjusted Bennett\u2019s base level upward two points by applying \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), which states, \u201cIf a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed during commission of the offense, increase by 2 levels.\u201d The court stated: \u201cThe court would find from the facts of this case that the weapon was conveniently near the defendant in order for him to obtain it to consummate the drug transaction, and would find that it was used, therefore, for the offense and he possessed the weapon in furtherance of the offense; and the Court would deny the objection.\u201d (R8:9).</p>\n<p id=\"b1652-14\">However, as the government concedes, there was absolutely no evidence presented at trial indicating that Bennett possessed a firearm at the time of the drug offense for which he was convicted. The only evidence of firearm possession involved the offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1557\">*1557</page-number>of retaliation against a government informant, <em>i.e., </em>the fight with Gardner, which occurred seven months after the drug transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-5\">Bennett contends that the district court erred in enhancing his offense level under this guideline. The guideline itself specifies that the possession must occur \u201cduring commission of the [drug] offense.\u201d Moreover, application note three to this section states that the purpose of the enhancement is to \u201creflect[] the increased danger of violence when drug traffickers possess weapons.\u201d The note goes on to say that the \u201cadjustment should be applied if the weapon was present\u201d during the offense. Moreover, in addressing this section, this Circuit has found the enhancement justified in situations in which there was sufficient evidence to support a finding that the firearm was actually present at a drug transaction. <em>United States v. Shuman, </em>902 F.2d 873, 875 (11th Cir.1990). Accordingly, it would appear that the Guidelines did not contemplate use of this enhancement where the defendant possessed the firearm seven months after the drug transaction occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-6\">The government argues that the enhancement should apply anyway because the altercation with Gardner during which Bennett possessed the gun was about Gardner\u2019s informing on drug transactions. The government contends that the firearm can be tied in through the relevant conduct section, \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2), which allows the district court to take into account \u201call such acts and omissions that were part of the same course of conduct or common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d This argument ignores the fact that \u00a7 1B1.3 begins by stating, \u201cUnless otherwise specified.\u201d The enhancement in \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) would appear to be the \u201cotherwise specified\u201d which precludes application of \u00a7 1B1.3 in this case. In addition, the government\u2019s argument does not comport with the purpose behind the enhancement, <em>i.e., </em>to punish those who increase the danger of injury <em>during </em>commission of drug offenses. Consequently, Bennett is due re-sentencing without the firearm possession enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-7\">(3) Acceptance of Responsibility</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-8\">The district court refused to adjust Bennett\u2019s offense level downward 2 points for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3El.l(a). Bennett contends that this was error because he rendered \u201cvoluntary assistance to authorities in the recovery of the fruits and instrumentalities of the offense,\u201d which is one of the reasons for which this reduction can be applied. <em>See </em>Application Note 1(e). Bennett points out that when arrested he was cooperative, allowed police to search his car, helped them open his trunk, and showed them where his gun was.</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-9\">\u201cBecause demonstration of whether or not the defendant has personally accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct requires a consideration of both objective factors and subjective considerations of the defendant\u2019s demeanor and sincerity, the district court\u2019s determination will not be overturned unless it is without foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Castillo-Valencia, </em>917 F.2d 494, 500 (11th Cir.1990). It is clear that a court can recognize a defendant\u2019s cooperation with the government yet still deny the two-point reduction under this guideline. <em>Id. </em>The government contends that the district court\u2019s reason for not applying the guideline was that Bennett pled not guilty and went to trial denying any responsibility for the retaliation charge by claiming he acted in self-defense by firing the gun at Gardner. \u201c[A] defendant\u2019s decision to go to trial may properly be considered along with other factors in determining whether there has been an acceptance of responsibility under 3E1.1.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 501. With these considerations in mind, Bennett clearly has not presented sufficient cause to overturn the district court\u2019s decision not to apply \u00a7 3E1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-10\">(4) Relevant Conduct Provision U nconstitutional</p>\n<p id=\"b1653-12\">Bennett finally argues that \u00a7 1B1.3, which allows the court to consider conduct other than that for which the defendant was indicted, is unconstitutional as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1558\">*1558</page-number>a Bill of Attainder under Article 1, Section 9, Clause 3 of the United States Constitution. A bill of attainder is \u201c \u2018a law that legislatively determines guilt and inflicts punishment upon an identifiable individual without provision of the protections of a judicial trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Selective Serv. Sys. v. Minnesota Pub. Interest Research Group, </em>468 U.S. 841, 846-47, 104 S.Ct. 3348, 3351-52, 82 L.Ed.2d 632 (1984) (quoting <em>Nixon v. Administration of Gen. Servs., </em>433 U.S. 425, 468, 97 S.Ct. 2777, 2803, 53 L.Ed.2d 867 (1977)). Bennett argues that through the relevant conduct provision the legislative branch has taken discretion in sentencing away from the judicial branch, forcing the court to consider a quantity of drugs, in Bennett's case, other than that for which he was convicted of distributing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1654-4\">Under this Court\u2019s precedent, however, Congress has the power to restrict judicial discretion. \u201cThrough the Sentencing Reform Act, Congress merely decided to exercise its power to fix sentences and tighten the rein on the broad judicial discretion it had previously delegated, which resulted in unacceptably wide sentencing disparities.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>876 F.2d 1502, 1506 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 110 S.Ct. 417, 107 L.Ed.2d 382 (1989). Moreover, the consideration of all relevant conduct has been a traditional sentencing practice. <em>Alston, </em>895 F.2d at 1372 (\u201cThe idea that a sentencing court may consider conduct not covered by the counts of conviction is neither new nor radical. Prior to the enactment of the Guidelines, sentencing courts relied upon such information in arriving at sentences.\u201d). Finally, the sentencing court does retain at least some discretion in deciding whether to apply the relevant conduct provision in that under \u00a7 6A1.3 the court has the authority to resolve factual disputes regarding any sentencing factor. Presumably, then, if the court does not find conduct outside of the conviction relevant or proven with sufficient accuracy, it need not consider that conduct in sentencing. Therefore, Bennett\u2019s argument on this point is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1654-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1654-8\">We AFFIRM the district court on all issues except its upward adjustment of the sentence under \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). We REMAND for sentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1646-9\">. Bennett secondarily argues that the district court did not give him an opportunity to rebut the government's reasons for striking the prospective jurors in question before it declared the reasons to be racially neutral. In <em>United States v. Gordon, </em>817 F.2d 1538 (11th Cir.1987), this Court found that a district court had erred because after the government had voluntarily explained its strikes \"the district court failed to make any independent inquiry or allow [the defendant] the opportunity to offer rebuttal evidence pertaining to the Government\u2019s reasons.\" <em>Id. </em>at 1541. Moreover, in <em>United States v. Alston, </em>895 F.2d 1362 (11th Cir.1990), this Court stated that after the government has offered its explanation, and the defendant raises the allegation that the government's reasons are pretextual, \"the district court must allow the defendant to establish those facts.\" <em>Id. </em>at 1374 (Hatchett, J., concurring). In the instant case, however, the defendant\u2019s attorney did not allege that the government\u2019s explanation was pretextual at the time the government made its explanation for the strikes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-13\">The government contends, therefore, that any right to a rebuttal was waived because Bennett did not object to having an inadequate opportunity to rebut the government\u2019s reasons as pre-textual at the time the court made its findings. Bennett\u2019s response to the government\u2019s position at oral argument was that he objected to the court\u2019s <em>Batson </em>ruling in his post-trial motion for a new trial and that this objection was sufficient to allow this Court to address on appeal his lack of opportunity to rebut the government\u2019s reasons as pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b1646-14\"><em>Batson </em>did not establish every detail of the procedure to be followed when the defendant makes an objection to the government\u2019s use of strikes, but instead left the formulation of many of the specifics to the courts. <em>Batson, </em>476 U.S. at 99 &amp; n. 24, 106 S.Ct. at 1724 &amp; n. 24. <em>Gordon </em>and <em>Alston, </em>however, have since clearly required the district courts to give defendants some opportunity to show that the government's articulated reasons were pretextual, at least when the defendant asserts that they are pretextual. The issue of whether the defendant must formally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1551\">*1551</page-number>demand an opportunity for rebuttal and the district court formally deny that opportunity in order for error to occur has not specifically been addressed by our Circuit. <em>But see United States v. Rodriguez, </em>917 F.2d 1286, 1288, n. 4 (11th Cir.1990) (suggesting generally that all <em>Batson </em>claims must be raised before the jury is sworn); <em>United States v. Rudas, </em>905 F.2d 38, 41 (2d Cir.1990) (stating that \"[o]nce the Government has offered reasons for its peremptory challenges, defense counsel must expressly indicate an intention to pursue the <em>Batson </em>claim\u201d). We hold <em>infra, </em>however, that the government\u2019s articulated reasons are not pretextual as a matter of law. Opportunity to rebut the government\u2019s reasons would therefore have been to no avail. Consequently, we need not address Bennett\u2019s secondary argument at this juncture.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1648-6\">. Under the method of jury selection used by the court, venire members were first struck, and then the twelve with the lowest juror numbers were seated along with two alternates.

Generally speaking, \u201cwhen a petit jury has been selected upon improper criteria,\u201d the Supreme Court has \"required reversal of the conviction because the effect of the violation cannot be ascertained.\u201d <em>Vasquez v. Hillery, </em>474 U.S. 254, 268, 106 S.Ct. 617, 626, 88 L.Ed.2d 598 (1986). \"[D]iscrimination in [jury selection] undermines the structural integrity of the criminal tribunal itself and is not amenable to harmless error review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 263-64, 106 S.Ct. at 623-24. Nevertheless, it is also clear that a \"reviewing court [must] consider the trial record as a whole and ... ignore errors that are harmless, including most constitutional violations.\u201d <em>United States v. Hasting, </em>461 U.S. 499, 509, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 1980, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 (1983). In the case at bar, there can be no finding of discrimination because one of the government\u2019s articulated reasons for striking was, in fact, legitimate. In such a case as this, where discrimination cannot be said to have infected the jury, it is incumbent upon us to disregard errors which cannot ultimately affect the outcome of the case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b1651-8\">. Bennett also asserts that the trial court erred in an evidentiary ruling which he feels eventually resulted in a further limitation on his ability to cross-examine Gardner. Stephanie Roberts, one of Bennett's witnesses, had testified that it was Gardner, rather than Bennett, who initiated the exchange of gunfire on the street when Bennett and Gardner fought about Gardner\u2019s involvement as a government informant. During the direct examination of Roberts, Bennett asked, \"Did [Gardner] say anything about the shooting at that time to either you or Ms. Grant?\u201d The government objected to the question as calling for hearsay. At sidebar, Bennett argued that this was an exception to the hearsay rule in that he wished to show based on Roberts\u2019 testimony that Gardner had actually initiated the gunfire and had planned to make it appear that he had fired at Bennett in self-defense. The court permitted Bennett to ask the question, but cautioned that the government would also be permitted to go into the issue on rebuttal. Bennett then felt compelled to forgo the question because the government would bring up testimony regarding Gardner\u2019s fears at the time and his practice of staying in hotel rooms, apparently afraid of being found by those against whom he had informed. Bennett appears to claim that the court\u2019s ruling amounted to a Sixth Amendment violation because he was inhibited from asking Roberts a question on direct which would have thrown doubt on Gardner\u2019s credibility and could have bolstered his theory that he fired at Gardner only in self-defense. Bennett equates this inhibition in examining Roberts with a limitation on his cross-examination of Gardner because both resulted in restraint on his ability to discredit Gardner\u2019s testimony. Bennett cites no case law to support this convoluted theory, nor can we uncover any. We cannot see that his theory implicates a restraint on the Sixth Amendment right to cross-examination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1651-14\">. However, 11.9 grams/62 packets x 362 packets does not equal 90 grams. Rather, 11.9 grams/62 packets x 362 = 69.48. The Presen-tencing Investigation Report does not explain where the figure of 90 grams comes from. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1556\">*1556</page-number>possible that the figure is based on a statement given by Taylor at trial.
