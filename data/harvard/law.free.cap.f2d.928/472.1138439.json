We conclude that the answer to the question is found in the \u201ccustoms laws\u201d of the United States. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(d). Since the appellant, an \u201cinnocent lienholder\u201d who wants to foreclose, did not follow the relevant customs laws proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>dures, we affirm a district court determination that it may not foreclose at the present time.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The Government has seized two pieces of real estate, one residential, the other commercial. It says that William Sundel, either directly or indirectly, bought these properties with the profits of drug transactions. It points to relevant drug-forfeiture statutes, which provide that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\">1) \u201c[a]ll ... things of value furnished ... by any person in exchange for a controlled substance [and] all proceeds traceable to such an exchange ...\u201d are subject to forfeiture, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 881(a)(6);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\">2) the \u201cAttorney General\u201d may \u201cseize[ ]\u201d such property before forfeiture, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 881(b); and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\">3) after seizure, the property \u201cshall be deemed to be in the custody of the Attorney General, subject only to the orders and decrees of the court ... having jurisdiction thereof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 881(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">The appellant, Newport, is a bank that holds mortgages on the properties. It holds a mortgage on the seized house to secure a debt (to the bank) of about $239,-000; it holds a mortgage on a 99-year lease for the seized commercial property to secure a debt (to the bank) of about $734,000. It has received no mortgage payments since the Government seized the property on July 17, 1989. It would like to foreclose upon its mortgages and to sell both properties. It points out that the drug-forfeiture statute says that an owner who did not know of, or agree to, the unlawful use of his property, is an innocent owner, and that no property shall be forfeited ... to the extent of the interest of [such] an own-er____</p>\n<p id=\"b570-11\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 881(a)(6). The Government concedes, and the district court specifically found, that Newport is an innocent owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-12\">The forfeiture proceeding is currently in progress in the district court. During this proceeding, Newport filed a motion in the district court, asking the court to grant it \u201cleave\u201d to foreclose its mortgages and to sell the properties. Newport pointed out that its mortgages were in default. It said that the mortgage debt exceeds the value of the properties. And, it warned that, with every passing day, a falling real estate market weakens its ability to recover (through sale) the money it has loaned. The district court denied its request for \u201cleave\u201d to foreclose. Newport now appeals that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b570-15\">\n<em>Appealability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b570-16\">The Government argues that the district court\u2019s denial of Newport\u2019s motion for \u201cleave\u201d to foreclose is not an appeal-able order. We agree that the motion may seem an odd one, for, in the forfeiture context (unlike bankruptcy, <em>see </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a)(4) &amp; (d)(2)), no statute seems to say that anyone needs a federal court\u2019s approval in order to bring a state-law foreclosure action. Yet, as a practical matter, it may be impossible to find a buyer at a foreclosure sale for property that is \u201cin the custody of the Attorney General,\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(c), and to which the United States asserts a legal claim. Thus, we look past the motion\u2019s title, and we assume that it is a motion asking the district court to order the Government to release the property from its \u201ccustody\u201d so that Newport can foreclose upon, and sell, it.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-17\">Characterized in this way, the determination of the district court, while not appeal-able as a \u201cfinal decision,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (for it does not finally determine the claims asserted in the forfeiture. proceeding), is nonetheless appealable as a \"collateral order.\u201d <em>See Cohen v. Beneficial Indus. Loan Corp., </em>337 U.S. 541, 545-47, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 1225-26, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949). Such an order must \u201c(1) \u2018conclusively determine the disputed question,\u2019 (2) \u2018resolve an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action,\u2019 and (3) \u2018be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Van Cauwenberghe v. Biard, </em>486 U.S. 517, 522, 108 S.Ct. 1945, 1949, 100 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>L.Ed.2d 517 (1988) (quoting <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 468, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 2457, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978)). These same features characterize the order before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">The order conclusively determines a matter fully resolved below, namely whether an innocent lienholder can foreclose on seized property in the Government\u2019s custody. And, this right is unrelated to the issue of whether or not \u201cdrug money\u201d was used to pay for the property. <em>See Van Cauwenberghe, </em>486 U.S. at 529, 108 S.Ct. at 1953; <em>Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., </em>485 U.S. 271, 277, 108 S.Ct. 1133, 1137, 99 L.Ed.2d 296 (1988). The order determines an asserted right that Newport cannot vindicate on a later appeal, namely the right to exercise <em>now, </em>before a final forfeiture determination, the same state-law foreclosure remedies that it could exercise if the Government had not seized the property. That right may be important in this case (where the debt allegedly exceeds the value of one of the properties), for a significant postponement of its exercise could mean added loss for Newport if the real estate market falls further. And, even if market values stay constant, Newport may be harmed. The consent decree says that Newport \u201cis entitled to ... interest from the date of seizure to the date of sale or disposition of the property,\u201d but that clause does not say that the Government must pay Newport interest. It may simply give Newport permission to collect interest from foreclosure sale proceeds, in which case Newport might find it impossible to collect the interest owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">Moreover, the legal question itself is an important one. <em>See In re Recticel Foam Corp., </em>859 F.2d 1000, 1003-04 (1st Cir. 1988). Drug-related forfeiture proceedings have become common. They may frequently implicate the property rights of innocent persons. Yet, the parties have not pointed to any well-settled law defining those rights while the property is in the Attorney General\u2019s custody, pending a forfeiture proceeding\u2019s outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"APm\">Consequently, we proceed to the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"APu\">m</p>\n<p id=\"A4Y\">\n<em>The Merits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b571-9\">The legal question before us is whether the district court lawfully could refuse to permit an innocent lienholder, such as Newport, to foreclose upon, and to sell, mortgaged property that the Government wants forfeited, before forfeiture proceedings have concluded. Newport, pointing to a statutory provision in Title 28 of the U.S.Code, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2465, argues that the court <em>must </em>issue an order releasing such property from the Government\u2019s \u201ccustody\u201d so that an innocent lienholder can exercise its right to foreclose. The Government, pointing to the Quiet Title Act of 1972, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2409a, argues that federal courts have <em>no </em>power to order the Government to release seized real property before the related forfeiture proceeding has concluded. In our view, neither of these statutory provisions directly controls the court\u2019s power to impose appropriate protective orders during forfeiture proceedings \u2014 orders that seek to permit private parties to preserve the value of their property interests while also adequately safeguarding the Government\u2019s interest in eventual forfeiture. Rather, Congress has provided that courts are to determine disputes about such orders (disputes such as the present one) in accordance with the \u201ccustoms laws\u201d of the United States, <em>see </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(d), which set forth procedures for releasing such property upon the posting of a proper bond. <em>See </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1614.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-10\">a. <em>Newport\u2019s argument. </em>Newport argues that it has an absolute legal right to foreclose upon real property in the Government\u2019s \u201ccustody,\u201d just as if the property were in the hands of a private person. It finds that right in a procedural provision of Title 28 of the U.S.Code, which says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-11\">Upon the entry of judgment for the claimant in any proceeding to condemn or forfeit property seized under any Act of Congress, such property shall be returned forthwith to the claimant----</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2465. Newport says that the district court\u2019s finding that it is an innocent lienholder amounts to a \u201cjudgment for the claimant;\u201d hence, the court must order the Government to \u201creturn\u201d its \u201cproperty ... forthwith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">We do not accept Newport's reading of the statute for several reasons. First, the statute\u2019s language does not apply directly to the present case. Strictly speaking, the Attorney General has not \u201cseized\u201d Newport\u2019s property (which is a lien) nor is he attempting to do so. Thus, in a sense, there is nothing for the Attorney General to \u201creturn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Second, and more important, the statutory provision is not directed at the problem that underlies the present case. Its language suggests application where the Government and a private party disagree about who owns a piece of property and a court then decides in favor of the private party. The conflict here, however, is not one of conflicting claims to Newport\u2019s property interest. Rather, the conflict arises because the Attorney General has taken \u201ccustody\u201d of a piece of physical property in order to protect the Government\u2019s claims to different, potentially forfeitable interests in that property (the <em>Sundel </em>interests), not Newport\u2019s interests. Newport, the holder of a nonforfeitable interest, wishes to exercise rights that (it believes) are inconsistent with the Government\u2019s protective custody. The legal problem is one of reconciling two provisions of the drug-forfeiture law, one provision that authorizes protective custody, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(c), and another that says specifically that \u201cproperty\u201d shall not be \u201cforfeited ... to the extent of the interest of [an innocent] owner.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(a)(6). The \u201creturn-to-claimant\u201d provision to which Newport points seems beside the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Third, the history of the return-to-elaim-ant provision shows that it does not address the problem of the simultaneous existence of forfeitable and nonforfeitable interests in the same piece of physical property. That provision is a lineal descendant of customs statutes that explicitly gave a claimant, or claimants, the right to recover a seized \u201cvessel, goods, wares or merchandise ... forthwith\u201d once \u201cjudgment\u201d was \u201crendered\u201d or \u201cgiven\u201d in their favor. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 818 (1940); Act of March 2, 1799, ch. 22, \u00a7 89, 1 Stat. 627, 696; Act of July 31, 1789, ch. 5, \u00a7 36, 1 Stat. 29, 47-48. Customs laws provided, however, that the <em>entire </em>vessel, good, ware, or other physical piece of property was \u201cguilty\u201d of a customs violation; hence, the <em>entire </em>piece of property was subject to forfeiture, including the interest of an innocent lienholder. <em>See generally Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., </em>416 U.S. 663, 683-86, 94 S.Ct. 2080, 2091-93, 40 L.Ed.2d 452 (1974). An innocent lienholder might ask the Government to give it all, or part, of the sale proceeds from seized property, or even the property itself, and the Government might do so; but, the Government would do so <em>as a matter of grace. See id. </em>at 689-90 n. 27, 94 S.Ct. at 2095 n. 27. The Government did not have a legal obligation, the return-to-claimant provision notwithstanding, to return mortgaged goods \u201cforthwith\u201d at the request of an innocent mortgagee, at least, not in the absence of a bond. <em>See </em>pp. 479-480, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">Fourth, the differences between the new drug-forfeiture statute and the older customs laws make no significant difference here. We concede that the drug-forfeiture statute does not make the <em>entire </em>piece of physical property \u201cguilty;\u201d it says that property shall <em>not </em>be forfeited \u201cto the extent of the interest of an [innocent] owner;\u201d it thereby permits an innocent mortgagee to recover the value of its interest as a matter of <em>right, </em>not <em>grace. Compare </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(a)(6) <em>with </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1618. And Newport can argue that the language of the return-to-claimant statute <em>could </em>be read to encompass (and require return \u201cforthwith\u201d of) the interest of the innocent owner. But, the language <em>need not </em>be so read. The fact that an innocent lienholder\u2019s interest is not forfeitable does not necessarily mean that the lienholder can exercise every right associated with that interest, just as if the Government had never taken custody of the physical property. It would seem odd to read the innocent-owner and the return-to-claimant provisions as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>permitting the holder of even a small, \u201cin-' nocent\u201d interest in even a large piece of forfeitable property to require the Attorney General (even without a protective bond) to release the property from his \u201ccustody\u201d prior to forfeiture, for the Government would thereby lose the very security in respect to its forfeitable interest that the \u201ccustody\u201d provision seems designed to provide.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">For these reasons of language, history, and purpose, we read the return-to-claimant provision as requiring a return of property \u201cforthwith\u201d only after a determination that there is <em>no </em>forfeitable interest in the property. That is to say, it does not govern disputes about the extent to which lien-holders may exercise lien rights in physical property over which the drug-forfeiture statute gives the Government \u201ccustody\u201d pending forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">b. <em>The Government\u2019s argument. </em>The Government rests its argument for absolute power to control the Sundel properties and effectively to prohibit foreclosures (pending the outcome of the forfeiture proceedings) on the Quiet Title Act of 1972, codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2409a. The relevant subsection reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-7\">The United States shall not be disturbed in possession or control of any real property involved in any action under this section pending a final judgment or decree, the conclusion of any appeal therefrom, and sixty days; and if the final determination shall be adverse to the United States, the United States nevertheless may retain such possession or control of the real property ... upon payment to the person determined to be entitled thereto of ... just compensa-tion____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2409a(b). The Government argues that any court order requiring it to permit foreclosure on real property that it has seized would \u201cdisturb ... [the United States] in [its] possession or control\u201d of that real property, contrary to the statute\u2019s instruction. The Government adds that three district courts have accepted this reading of the statute, and that no court has directly rejected it. <em>See United States v. Parcel of Real Property Known as 708-710 West 9th Street, </em>715 F.Supp. 1323, 1327 (W.D.Pa.1989); <em>United States v. Real Property Constituting Approximately Fifty (50) Acres, </em>703 F.Supp. 1306, 1312 (E.D.Tenn.1988); <em>United States v. Real Property Titled in the Name of Shashin, Ltd., </em>680 F.Supp. 332, 335 (D.Haw.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">We do not accept the Government\u2019s reading of the statute, however, for two related reasons. First, the language of this statutory provision makes it inapplicable in a typical drug-forfeiture case. It says that the \u201cUnited States shall not be disturbed in possession or control of any real property involved in any action <em>under this sec-</em>tion____\u201d An \u201caction under this section\u201d is described in the section\u2019s title as a \u201cquiet title action,\u201d and its meaning is elucidated in subsection (a), which says that the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1f\">United States may be named as a party defendant in a civil action under this section to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the United States claims an interest, other than a security interest or water rights____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-13\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2409a(a). Later subsections, which limit the circumstances under which the United States \u201cmay be named as a party defendant,\u201d refer to the action as a \u201ccivil action against the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2409a(f), and to the adverse party as the \u201cplaintiff.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2409a(d). A drug-forfeiture action is not a \u201cquiet title action,\u201d nor does it resemble a \u201cquiet title\u201d action. It is not an action in which the United States is a \u201cparty defendant;\u201d it is an action in which the United States is a party plaintiff. Under applicable Admiralty Rules, <em>see </em>Supplemental Rules for Certain Admiralty and Maritime Claims Rule A(2), Newport is not a \u201cplaintiff\u201d suing the United States, but, rather, it is a \u201cclaimant\u201d to seized property, who, the Admiralty Rules say, may \u201cdefend the action\u201d on behalf of the property. <em>See id. </em>Rule C(6) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-14\">Second, the history of \u00a7 2409a makes clear that Congress did not intend it to apply to a case like this one. The purpose of the Quiet Title Act of 1972 was to waive the sovereign immunity of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>States, which might otherwise have barred actions involving real property brought by private citizens against the United-States. <em>See Block v. North Dakota, </em>461 U.S. 273, 282, 103 S.Ct. 1811, 1817, 75 L.Ed.2d 840 (1983). It waived that sovereign immunity by stating that the \u201cUnited States <em>may be named </em>as a party defendant\u201d in such a suit. The statute goes on to condition that waiver of sovereign immunity by, for example, imposing a 12-year statute of limitations, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2409a(g), requiring trial \u201cwithout a jury,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2409a(f), and insisting that the \u201ccomplaint\u201d meet certain technical requirements. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2409a(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">A forfeiture action, in which the United States seeks to obtain property owned by a private citizen, is not an action in which the United States might have asserted sovereign immunity as a bar to claims to the property, either before or after Congress enacted the Quiet Title Act in 1972. <em>Cf. General Elec. Credit Corp. v. The Oil Screw Triton VI, </em>712 F.2d 991, 994 (5th Cir.1983). This is because, normally, when the United States sues as a plaintiff, it waives \u201csovereign immunity\u201d in respect to any \u201cdefensive plea including a set-off to the extent of the Government\u2019s claim or for a claim arising out of the same transaction or occurrence.\u201d <em>See </em>14 C. Wright,- A. Miller, E. Cooper, <em>Federal Practice And Procedure </em>\u00a7 3654, at 202 (1985). Moreover, the qualifications of \u00a7 2409a(b)-(n) on the sovereign-immunity waiver <em>(e.g., </em>statute <em>of </em>limitations, no jury trial, technical complaint requirements) seem either inapplicable in the forfeiture context or contrary to forfeiture-related law. <em>Cf. United States v. One 1976 Mercedes Benz 280S, </em>618 F.2d 453, 456 (7th Cir.1980) (owner of property that Government seeks to forfeit pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881 is entitled to a jury trial).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">We recognize that sometimes the Quiet Title Act might apply in special ways to actions that its language does not literally cover. For example, the Supreme Court has held that the Act \u201cpre-empted\u201d actions that a private party might bring against an <em>officer of </em>the Government. <em>Block, </em>461 U.S. at 285, 103 S.Ct. at 1818. In <em>Block, </em>the Court reasoned that pre-1972 law was not clear about just whether, or when, sovereign immunity applied in such actions, and that Congress intended the qualifications of the Quiet Title Act to apply both to actions where the Act waived sovereign immunity and to similar actions where the waiver perhaps was <em>not </em>truly (but was at least arguably) required. <em>See id. </em>at 284-86, 103 S.Ct. at 1818-19. Forfeiture cases, however, are neither \u201cquiet title actions\u201d against the Government, nor are they actions that resemble such actions. Unlike actions against Government officers, they were not devised as part of a technical effort to avoid a sovereign-immunity bar. And, there is no reason to think that the Quiet Title Act was meant to \u201cpre-empt\u201d claims asserted by claimants in forfeiture actions. We conclude that we must read the language of the Quiet Title Act, in light of its purpose, to mean what it says, namely that it does not apply to the kind of action at issue here. In so reading the Act, we Stress that Newport is <em>not </em>bringing a foreclosure action in federal court. Any such foreclosure action, brought against the Federal Government, might well fall within the scope of \u00a7 2409a. Rather, as we have said, the action at issue is a forfeiture action brought by the Government against the property. And, Newport\u2019s motion, within that action, simply asks for release of that property so that it can foreclose against the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">We find unpersuasive the case authority that the Government cites in support of its \u00a7 2409a argument. Two of the three district court cases justify their result simply by citing the third case. That third case, <em>Shashin, </em>rests its conclusion upon the authority of a Second Circuit case, <em>United States v. Bedford Associates, </em>657 F.2d 1300 (2d Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 914, 102 S.Ct. 1767, 72 L.Ed.2d 173 (1982). In <em>Bedford, </em>a bank sued the Government, which had leased space in a private building. The bank wanted the court to declare that it had a legal right to foreclose on the building free of the Government\u2019s lease interest. <em>Id. </em>at 1303, 1315. The parties disagreed about whether the suit was one in which the United States was \u201cnamed as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>a party defendant in a civil action under this section to adjudicate a disputed title to real property in which the United States holds an interest.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2409a(a). But, the only word in this phrase about which they disagreed was the word <em>\u201ctitle,\u201d </em>a word not in issue here. The court held that the word \u201ctitle\u201d might include a lesser property interest, such as a leasehold. <em>Id. </em>at 1316. In so holding, it said that even though the statute is entitled \u201cquiet title actions,\u201d it \u201cplainly permits a variety of suits besides the typical quiet title suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And, it added that the provision was \u201cbroadly conceived\u201d by Congress. <em>Id. </em>But, these statements, in context, mean that the statute is designed, broadly, to waive sovereign immunity, not that its restrictions apply (despite its language) where the Government is a plaintiff, where the Government is trying to take property from another person, where sovereign immunity would not previously have barred suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">We conclude that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2409a does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">c. <em>This court\u2019s view. </em>If the statutes we have discussed neither require a court to permit foreclosure nor require it to refuse a request like Newport\u2019s, what law governs an innocent lienholder\u2019s request to foreclose on property the Government holds in custody pending forfeiture?</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">In our view, the forfeiture statute offers specific legal guidance. It says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-8\">The provisions of law relating to the seizure, summary and judicial forfeiture, and condemnation of property for violation of the customs laws ... shall apply to seizures and forfeitures [under this statute] ... insofar as applicable and not inconsistent with the provisions here-of____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(d). We have previously applied customs statutes in drug-forfeiture cases, reading them <em>mutatis mutandis, </em>so that, for example, customs statutes that refer only to vehicles, goods, baggage, and similar movable items, nonetheless bring seizures of real property within their scope. <em>See United States v. Parcel of Land and Residence at 28 Emery Street, </em>914 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1990) (\u00a7 881(d) makes burden of proof rules of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1615 \u2014 which also speaks of \u201cvessel, aircraft, merchandise, or baggage\u201d \u2014 applicable to forfeiture of real estate); <em>United States v. Parcels of Land, </em>903 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir.1990) (same). The need for simplicity, the virtue of uniformity, and the benefit of learning from years of practical experience, all argue for treating both these areas of the law alike.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">As we understand customs law and practice, a claimant seeking release of seized property must offer to post an appropriate bond. Indeed, customs law has contained release-on-bond rules almost since the beginning of the Republic. <em>See </em>Act of July 31, 1789, ch. 5, \u00a7 36, 1 Stat. 29, 47; <em>United States v. The Brig Burdett, </em>34 U.S. (9 Pet). 682, 683-84, 9 L.Ed. 273 (1835); D. Smith, <em>Prosecution and Defense of Forfeiture Cases </em>\u00b6 8.03, at 8-17 (1991). A current customs statute, entitled \u201cRelease of seized property,\u201d says the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-12\">If any person claiming an interest in any vessel, vehicle, aircraft, merchandise, or baggage seized under the provisions of this chapter offers to pay the value of such vessel, vehicle, aircraft, merchandise, or baggage, as determined under section 1606 of this title, and it appears that such person has in fact a substantial interest therein, the appropriate customs officer may ... accept such offer and release the vessel, vehicle, aircraft, merchandise, or baggage seized upon the payment of such value thereof, which shall be distributed in the order provided in section 1613 of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1614. Other customs statutes and regulations set forth relevant procedures, such as procedures for determining values. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1606; 19 C.F.R. Part 161, Subpart E; D. Smith, <em>Prosecution and Defense of Forfeiture Cases </em>\u00b6 8.03, at 8-14 to 8-16 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-14\">We need not, and do not, now hold that this statute, or current customs procedure, literally and exactly sets standards for the posting of a bond in drug-forfeiture cases. Such cases differ from customs eases, for example, in one respect previously described, namely that the statutes protect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>the innocent lienholder as a matter of right, not simply through executive grace. <em>See </em>p. 476, <em>supra; cf. </em>Ship Mortgage Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 961(b) (similar in this respect to the drug-forfeiture law). Thus, an appropriate bond might have to cover only the value of the Government\u2019s interest in, rather than the entire value of the seized physical property. And, the Department of Justice may not wish to follow precisely the same administrative procedures for, say, obtaining valuations, as does the Customs Service. The drug-forfeiture provision stating that the Attorney General holds such property \u201csubject to the orders of the court,\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(c), would seem to give the courts adequate legal power to make appropriate adjustments.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">.[7] We need not determine the exact meaning of the customs statute in this case, nor need we determine the exact scope of the court\u2019s supervisory powers, for Newport has made no effort to follow customs or other bonding procedures. Newport has not offered to post a bond. Newport did file an affidavit stating that the value of the commercial piece of property is less than the value of its mortgage. But, the record does not reflect the Government\u2019s valuation of the Sundel properties. <em>Cf. </em>19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1606 (providing for Government appraisal of seized property); 21 C.F.R. \u00a7 1316.74 (same); 19 C.F.R. \u00a7 162.43 (same). In any event, the Government responded with what the record suggests was a denial. <em>See </em>Docket Entry 11. Moreover, the record does not contain evidence that the Government\u2019s interest in the residential property was without value.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Under these circumstances, we conclude that the court\u2019s denial of Newport\u2019s motion was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">The decision of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
