His sentence was adjusted under the career offender provisions of the Sentencing Guidelines for having two prior convictions for crimes of violence. He appeals this adjustment, arguing that the district judge erred in determining that a prior state conviction for \u201cburglary in the first degree using a firearm\u201d was a crime of violence under \u00a7 4B1.2 of the Guidelines. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b421-18\">On July 14, 1989, Sherman pled guilty to five of fifteen counts of bank robbery and attempted bank robbery. In applying the Sentencing Guidelines in its presentence report, the Probation Office calculated that Sherman\u2019s total offense level was 32, his criminal history category was VI, and, thus, his imprisonment range was 210-262 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-19\">Sherman challenges the determination that he is a career offender having at least two prior felony convictions for crimes of violence. Specifically, Sherman contests the conclusion his 1978 conviction for burglary of the Boise Holiday Inns manager\u2019s office constitutes a crime of violence under the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-20\">The district court initially characterized the hotel burglary as a burglary of a nond-welling. Although it believed that a Guidelines\u2019 application note ordinarily proscribed treating nondwelling burglaries as crimes of violence, the court nonetheless concluded that the facts of Sherman\u2019s burglary, namely the use of a sawed-off shotgun in its perpetration, converted the offense into a crime of violence. As a result, Sherman was sentenced to a 210-month term of imprisonment and a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-21\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b421-22\">We review <em>de novo </em>challenges to the proper application of the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>891 F.2d 212, 214 (9th Cir.1989) (citation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 110 S.Ct. 1496, 108 L.Ed.2d 631 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-25\">Under the Guidelines, \u201c[a] defendant is a career offender if (1) the defendant was at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>least eighteen years old at the time of the instant offense, (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 4B1.1. The sole issue on appeal pertains to the last of these conditions \u2014 specifically, whether Sherman\u2019s Idaho burglary constitutes a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">At the time of Sherman\u2019s sentencing \u00a7 4B1.2(1) referred to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 for the definition of \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d Section 16 provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-5\">The term \"crime of violence\u201d means\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-6\">(a) an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b422-7\">(b) any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 (1988).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Sentencing Commission interpreted \u00a7 16 to mean that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AkOT\">murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, extortionate extension of credit, forcible sex offenses, arson or robbery are covered by [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a)], Other offenses are covered only if the conduct for which the defendant was specifically convicted meets the above definition. For example, conviction for an escape accomplished by force or threat of force would be covered; conviction for an escape by stealth would not be covered. Conviction for burglary of a dwelling would be covered; conviction for burglary of other structures would not be covered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b422-12\">\u00a7 4B1.2, Application note 1 (Nov. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-13\">Sherman contends that, because the application note considers convictions for burglaries of nondwellings uncovered, the district judge erred in determining that the burglary of a nondwelling was a crime of violence even though it involved the use of a firearm. Sherman insists that it was an error for the judge to consider the underlying conduct and particular circumstances of his burglary in assessing whether the burglary involved a substantial risk that physical force would be used in committing the offense. He reads the career offender provisions to require a categorical approach in determining whether a prior conviction is a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-14\">After we heard argument in this case, we decided <em>United States v. Becker, </em>919 F.2d 568 (9th Cir.1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 111 S.Ct. 1118, 113 L.Ed.2d 226 (1991). In <em>Becker </em>we held that \u201cwe do not look to the specific conduct which occasioned [a defendant\u2019s prior] convictions, but only to the statutory definition of the crime.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 570. We further noted that by doing so we adopt the \u201cso-called \u2018categorical\u2019 approach that the Supreme Court has held is appropriate for determining whether someone is a career criminal under the Armed Career Criminal Act____\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-19\">While Sherman criticizes the government for adopting a fact-based rather than categorical approach, he does the same when it behooves him. He looks to the underlying facts of his conviction to characterize his offense as burglary of a nondwelling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>in <em>Becker </em>we clearly proscribed a fact-based approach. We noted that \u201cthe categorical approach looks to the \u2018particular provision of a statute\u2019 under which the defendant was convicted.\u201d <em>Becker, </em>at 570 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Sherman was convicted of \u201cburglary in the first degree using a firearm.\u201d Contrary to his implied contention, Idaho law does not distinguish between dwelling and nondwelling burglaries. Burglary is defined under Idaho law as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b423-6\">Every person who enters any house, room, apartment, tenement, shop, warehouse, store, mill, barn, stable, outhouse, or other building, tent, vessel, closed vehicle, closed trailer, airplane or railroad car, with intent to commit any theft or any felony, is guilty of burglary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">Idaho Code \u00a7 18-1401 (1987). First degree burglary is simply any burglary committed in the nighttime. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 18-1402. While the burglary provisions do not contain any reference to the use of a firearm during the commission of a burglary, it appears that another count of the Idaho state indictment, for possession of a firearm during the commission of a crime, <em>see id. </em>at \u00a7 19-2520, was subsumed into the count to which Sherman pled guilty. Section 19-2520 imposes additional imprisonment to be served consecutively upon persons convicted of certain crimes, including burglary, who \u201cdisplayed, used, threatened, or attempted to use a firearm\u201d during its commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-8\">The Idaho courts have noted consistently that \u00a7 19-2520 \u201cdoes not define or create a separate offense, but is merely a sentence enhancing statute that comes into play after a defendant is convicted of one of the enumerated offenses.\u201d <em>State v. Galaviz, </em>104 Idaho 328, 658 P.2d 999, 1000-1001 (App.1983) (citation omitted); <em>see also State v. Smith, </em>103 Idaho 135, 645 P.2d 369, 371 (1982); <em>State v. Baruth, </em>107 Idaho 651, 691 P.2d 1266, 1274 (App.1984). Because we must look to the statute of conviction to decide whether a particular offense is a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d we must first decide what the relevant statutory provision of conviction is. Sherman seems to contend that we may not look to the firearm charge because it relates to an enhancement provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-11\">We disagree. Instead, we conclude that in determining the statutory scope of the underlying offense we may properly characterize the crime, as did the judgment of conviction, as \u201cburglary in the first degree using a firearm.\u201d As the conviction specifically implicates \u00a7 19-2520, use of a firearm is expressly part of the offense of conviction. The mere fact that the Idaho legislature did not create a single offense criminalizing burglaries involving the use of a firearm does not compel a different result. Likewise, the fact that \u00a7 19-2520 is an enhancement provision is of no moment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Cf. May v. Sumner, </em>622 F.2d 997, 999 (9th Cir.1980). Therefore, we must decide whether \u201cburglary in the first degree using a firearm\u201d constitutes a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-12\">In making that determination, we look to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b). It provides that a crime of violence is any felony that inherently involves \u201ca substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d The crime for which Sherman was convicted involves precisely such risk. Breaking into any building in the dead of night with a criminal intent and wielding a firearm creates very serious risks to both occupants of the building and law enforcement officials who become aware of the crime and seek to apprehend its perpetrator. <em>See, e.g., Taylor v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2151, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990) (recognizing that typical residential and even \u201cprofessional commercial\u201d burglaries present very seri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>ous dangers to those \u201cwho might be inadvertently found on the premises\u201d) (citation omitted). Analogously, we have noted that the use of a weapon, even if inoperable, creates grave risks because of the fear it instills in victims, and because of the increased chance that law enforcement officials will resort to armed response, thereby posing greater risk to the security of victims and bystanders. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Jimenez, </em>864 F.2d 664, 666-667 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>489 U.S. 1099, 109 S.Ct. 1576, 103 L.Ed.2d 942 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">Because \u201cburglary in the first degree using a firearm\u201d constitutes a crime of violence for purposes of the career offender provisions of the Guidelines, we find no error in the district court\u2019s sentencing. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-10\">. As of November 1, 1989, the Guidelines no longer incorporate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16\u2019s definition of crimes of violence. Thereafter, \"crime of violence\u201d has been defined to mean \"any offense under federal or state law punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that (i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (ii) is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d \u00a7 4B1.2 (effective Nov. 1, 1989). The amendment, however, has no application to this case as it was not in effect on the date of sentencing. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4) (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b422-21\">. Because it is unnecessary to the resolution of this case, we do not decide whether a burglary that takes place in a hotel, albeit in the office, constitutes a nondwelling burglary. However, we do note in passing that, because hotels are in the business of housing overnight guests, many of the reasons that make traditional dwelling burglaries dangerous seem likewise present here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b423-9\">. Clearly, the Idaho legislature could have chosen to create two substantive burglary charges\u2014 one criminalizing burglaries involving the use of a firearm and the other involving no such additional element. If it had done so, and Sherman were convicted under the former provision, surely no objection would be raised to our considering whether \"burglary involving a firearm\u201d constitutes a crime of violence. The vagaries of legislative drafting techniques simply cannot alter that result.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
