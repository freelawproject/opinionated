HALL, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">Commercial Petroleum, Inc. (\u201cCommercial\u201d), appeals the order enjoining it from infringing upon certain Shell Oil Company (\u201cShell\u201d) trademarks. Shell cross-appeals the district court\u2019s refusal to award damages and attorney\u2019s fees. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">Shell produces motor oils for use in heavy-duty trucks under the identifying trademarks \u201cRotella\u201d and \u201cShell Rotella T.\u201d These oils are sold in packaged and bulk form through numerous licensed distributors and jobbers. Since 1957, the subject marks have been marketed and widely publicized in North Carolina and throughout the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">Shell imposes stringent quality control standards on its trademark licensees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under these standards, Shell requires its authorized distributors and jobbers to maintain storage facilities and transportation procedures that assure the integrity of the motor oils. Stringent quality control standards are necessary because the bulk lubricant goes through numerous tanks, tanker trucks, and pumps during the distribution process, and the oil can easily be contaminated by residuals.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-15\">Commercial is a wholesaler of many brands of bulk and packaged oil. For several years, Commercial sold both packaged and bulk Shell motor oil as \u201cShell Rotella T.\u201d After receiving a written warning from Shell concerning use of its trademarks on bulk oil sales, Commercial discontinued using the actual trademarks on its customer invoices for Shell bulk oil sales and substituted the symbols \u201cSRT\u201d or \u201cRT.\u201d However, when questioned by customers about the change, Commercial readily confirmed that all oil billed under these designations was in fact \u201cShell Rotel-la T\u201d motor oil. Although customers may have been generally aware that it was not an authorized Shell distributor, Commercial eventually included a disclaimer to that effect on its invoices and delivery tickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-16\">In handling bulk oil, Commercial employed its own quality control standards, which were less stringent than Shell\u2019s and not approved by Shell.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Commercial has never been affiliated with Shell as a jobber or otherwise; it purchased bulk Shell oil from Shell\u2019s authorized distributors and then resold it.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-17\">Shell alleged in its complaint that Commercial\u2019s use of Shell\u2019s marks and the use of substitute marks constituted unfair competition and trademark infringement in violation of the Lanham Trademark Act of 1946, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1114(1) and 1125(a) (1988),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because it falsely indicated affil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>iation, sponsorship or approval by Shell and created a likelihood of confusion among prospective purchasers. Shell sought an injunction, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1116 (1988) and North Carolina General Statute \u00a7 75-1.1 (1988). Shell also sought damages and profits derived from the sale of bulk oil under its marks, pursuant to 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117 (1988) and North Carolina General Statute \u00a7 75-1.1. Finally, Shell sought treble damages, pursuant to North Carolina General Statute \u00a7 75-16 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">After a bench trial, the district court concluded that Commercial had competed unfairly with Shell and had infringed on Shell\u2019s trademarks. The court enjoined Commercial from using the labels \u201cRotel-la,\u201d \u201cShell Rotella T,\u201d \u201cRT,\u201d or \u201cSRT,\u201d in connection with the advertising, marketing, or sale of bulk oil without authorization from Shell. The court declined to award any damages based on its finding that Shell had suffered none. Commercial appealed, and Shell cross-appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Commercial raises two issues: (1) whether trademark law applies to Commercial\u2019s sale of genuine bulk oil under Shell's marks, and (2) if applicable, whether Commercial\u2019s sale of bulk oil under Shell\u2019s marks creates a likelihood of customer confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">First, Commercial argues that the district court erred in finding trademark infringement, because it resells genuine bulk oil under a true mark. As a general rule, trademark law does not apply to the sale of genuine goods bearing a true mark, even if the sale is without the mark owner\u2019s consent. <em>NEC Electronics v. CAL Circuit Abco, </em>810 F.2d 1506 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 851, 108 S.Ct. 152, 98 L.Ed.2d 108 (1987). Therefore, we must decide whether Commercial sold a \u201cgenuine\u201d product under Shell marks in order to determine whether trademark law applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">A product is not truly \u201cgenuine\u201d unless it is manufactured and distributed under quality controls established by the manufacturer. <em>El Greco Leather Products Co. v. Shoe World, </em>806 F.2d 392, 395 (2d Cir.1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 817, 108 S.Ct. 71, 98 L.Ed.2d 34 (1987). The Lanham Trademark Act affords the trademark holder the right to control the quality of the goods manufactured and sold under its trademark. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he actual quality of the goods is irrelevant; it is the control of quality that a trademark holder is entitled to maintain.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">The district court found that the quality control standards employed by Shell for the transportation, delivery and storage of bulk oil were necessary to maintain the quality of its bulk oil, and, in fact, Shell\u2019s quality control standards were an integral part of the bulk product identified by the marks. While Commercial does not dispute the importance of quality control standards, it contends that it employs its own standards that guarantee the quality of the oil. However, in order to maintain the genuineness of the bulk oil, the quality standards must be controlled by Shell. <em>Id. </em>at 395-96. It is insufficient that Commercial employed its own quality standards. Without Shell\u2019s enforcement of its quality controls, the bulk oil sold by Commercial was not truly \u201cgenuine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">Therefore, by marketing the bulk oils under Shell\u2019s trademarks according to its own quality controls, Commercial violated Shell\u2019s right under the Lanham Act to retain control of the use of its trademark in the sale of the product to the end user. <em>Id. </em>at 392. The court\u2019s findings of fact are not clearly erroneous. We affirm its application of trademark law.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">Second, Commercial argues that, even assuming its use of Shell\u2019s trademarks implicates trademark law, its sale of bulk oil under Shell\u2019s marks did not create <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>a likelihood of customer confusion. The issue of confusion is key because \u201c[ljiability under the Lanham Act for trademark infringement is predicated on use of a registered trademark that \u2018is likely to cause confusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Soweco, Inc. v. Shell Oil Co., </em>617 F.2d 1178, 1185 (5th Cir.1980), <em>cert. denied, </em>450 U.S. 981, 101 S.Ct. 1516, 67 L.Ed.2d 816 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">Commercial cites <em>Soweco </em>for the proposition that the court must \u201cconsider whether or not actual confusion has occurred\u201d in order to determine whether a likelihood of confusion existed. Commercial argues that there was no likelihood of confusion, based on its contention that the evidence proved that customers knew that it was not an \u201cauthorized distributor\u201d of Shell. <em>Soweco </em>does not support Commercial\u2019s proposition, however. Though <em>Soweco </em>lists \u201cactual confusion\u201d as one factor that courts must consider, it clearly states that \u201c[p]roof of actual confusion is unnecessary; the <em>likelihood </em>of confusion is the determinative factor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1185-86 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The use of the Shell marks implies that the product has been delivered according to all quality control guidelines enforced by the manufacturer. The district court found that Commercial does not follow Shell quality control procedures, and there was, therefore, a likelihood of customer confusion as to the quality and source of the bulk oil. The court considered the evidence \u201cmore than ample\u201d to show likelihood of confusion,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the court\u2019s findings of fact are not clearly erroneous. We affirm its conclusion that Commercial\u2019s use of Shell\u2019s marks was deceptive and likely to confuse consumers who rely on the trademarks as symbols of Shell quality.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">Shell cross-appeals the district court\u2019s denial of damages.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Shell argues that the district court incorrectly interpreted the Lanham Act by concluding that a finding of actual losses is a prerequisite to an award of damages. In denying an award of damages, the court stated simply that \u201c[t]he evidence does not show any damages suffered by Shell and none will be assessed.\u201d <em>Shell Oil Co. v. Commercial Petroleum, Inc., </em>733 F.Supp. 40, 45 (W.D. N.C.1989). Shell is correct that equitable damages, as measured by the infringer\u2019s profits, can be awarded to the trademark owner without proof of actual loss. <em>Blue Bell Co. v. Frontier Refining Co., </em>213 F.2d 354 (10th Cir.1954). However, the court has broad discretion to award any monetary relief necessary to serve the interests of justice. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117 (1988); <em>Metric &amp; Multistandard Components Corp. v. Metric\u2019s, Inc., </em>635 F.2d 710 (8th Cir.1980). Based on the court\u2019s statement, we do not believe that it misinterpreted the requirements for awarding damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">Moreover, the court found that, though some of Shell\u2019s distributors may have suffered losses, Shell suffered no actual damages as a result of Commercial\u2019s infringement. Though the district court <em>could </em>have awarded Shell some or all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Commercial\u2019s profit, it did not abuse its discretion by not doing so.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b214-10\">. Examples of procedures required by Shell are the use of dedicated lines, pumps and tanks, as well as the steam cleaning of tankers prior to filling with the product.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b214-11\">. For example, Commercial hauls the subject oils immediately after hauling diesel fuel, without cleaning the tanker.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b214-12\">. Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1114 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-13\">(1) Any person who shall, without the consent of the registrant-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ab-dedup-0\">(a) use in commerce any reproduction, counterfeit, copy, or colorable imitation of a registered mark in connection with the sale, offering for sale, distribution, or advertising of any goods or services on or in connection with which such use is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ak_R\">shall be liable in a civil action by the registrant for the remedies hereinafter provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqO\">Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-20\">Any person who ... uses in commerce any word, term, name, symbol, ... or any combination thereof, or any false designation of origin, false or misleading description of fact, or false or misleading representation of fact, which-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-13\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>(1) is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive as to the affiliation, connection, or association of such person with another person, or as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods, ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXc\">shall be liable in a civil action by any person who believes that he or she is or is likely to be damaged by such act.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b216-6\">. For example, one defense witness testified at trial that, notwithstanding the fact that Commercial\u2019s president had told him that his company was not an authorized distributor of Shell, and that he had read the disclaimer Commercial placed on its invoices, he would look to Shell if any of his motors were damaged by the use of the oil.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b216-7\">. Based on our affirmance of the court\u2019s finding a likelihood of customer confusion under the Lanham Trademark Act, we find it unnecessary to reach the issue of unfair competition under North Carolina state law, N.C.Gen.Stat. \u00a7 75-1.1 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b216-13\">. Shell also cross-appeals the district court\u2019s denial of an award of attorney's fees under the Lanham Act and North Carolina law. Under both the Lanham Act and state statute, attorney\u2019s fees are not awarded as a matter of right; they are within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Bandag, Inc. v. Al Bolser's Tire Stores, </em>750 F.2d 903, 917 (Fed.Cir.1984); <em>Otis Clapp &amp; Son, Inc. v. Filmore Vitamin Co., </em>754 F.2d 738, 747 (7th Cir.1985); <em>Mayton v. Hiatt's Used Cars, Inc., </em>45 N.C.App. 206, 262 S.E.2d 860 (1980) (under N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 75-16.1, attorney\u2019s fees are within discretion of court but are contingent upon finding actual damages). Finding no abuse of discretion, we affirm the court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b217-22\">. Shell also argues that based on the court\u2019s finding of unfair competition, damages should have been assessed and trebled under North Carolina General Statute \u00a7 75-16 (1988). Section 75-16 states in pertinent part: \"if damages are assessed ... treble ... the amount.\u201d Proof of actual damages is an essential element for an award of treble damages. <em>Ellis v. Smith-Broad-hurst, Inc., </em>48 N.C.App. 180, 268 S.E.2d 271 (1980). Because we affirm the court\u2019s finding no actual damages, Shell is not entitled to treble damages under state law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
