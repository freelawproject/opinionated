THOMPSON, District Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1130-14\">Appellants Mervyn Harold Cross and Robert Carter Lodge were each indicted in November 1984 by a federal grand jury in Tampa, Florida, on one count of conspiracy to persuade a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct for the purpose of producing visual or print media, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 371 (1966) and 2251 (1982); one count of mailing obscene material, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1461 (1984); and 18 counts of mail fraud, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1341 (1984). After a jury trial, Cross was convicted on all counts with the exception of one count of mail fraud, and Lodge was found guilty on only the conspiracy charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-18\">The evidence at trial showed that between 1980 and 1983, Cross and Lodge, together with co-defendant Ruksana Di-wan, conspired to exploit children sexually in order to produce and sell child pornography.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cross, while a prison inmate in Florida, orchestrated a fraudulent scheme to obtain nude photos of child models from the Tampa, Florida area by falsely portraying himself as a film producer and misrepresenting that the pictures were necessary for casting decisions for a legitimate educational documentary. Lodge, who, like Cross, was a pedophile interested in pre-ad-olescent girls, used a lab in his Seattle, Washington home to develop these pictures as well as obscene photos of two California children which Cross arranged for him to receive in the mail. Diwan assisted by placing telephone calls, directing mail, and serving as a Florida contact for Cross.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-19\">Cross and Lodge have appealed their convictions on a multitude of grounds: co-conspirator hearsay, immunity, denial of a continuance, prosecutorial misconduct, sufficiency of the evidence, improper jury instructions, unduly prejudicial evidence, recanted testimony, a false search warrant affidavit, and refusal to sever.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We now affirm.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1035\">*1035</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-5\">Cross and Lodge began their association, in 1975 when Lodge responded to an advertisement by Cross\u2019s mail order company, \u201cCine International,\u201d offering \u201cerotic\u201d photographs of children. Cross and Lodge soon started to exchange such pictures and share accounts of their sexual experiences with children. In 1978, the two men, through letters and phone calls, began to discuss a series of proposed ventures for producing and marketing child pornography. Cross offered to arrange several opportunities for Lodge to take sexually explicit photos of pre-adolescent girls. In return, Lodge would process the film and send the pictures to Cross, who would sell the photos and share the profits with Lodge. Lodge expressed to Cross his interest in several of these ventures and at least one such photo session was arranged but had to be cancelled at the last minute when a woman, whose two young daughters Lodge had intended to pay to pose nude, telephoned Lodge\u2019s home and mistakenly mentioned the plan to Lodge\u2019s wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-6\">In 1980, Cross recruited Lodge for a scheme that involved sending obscene materials through the mail. Several years earlier, Cross had begun communicating with Elmer Donald Woodward concerning \u201ctheir mutual interest in child pornography.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On several occasions, Woodward mailed to Cross the negatives of obscene photographs of a seven-year old California girl and her younger brother. Cross indicated to Woodward that Lodge could develop the pictures for a reasonable fee, and offered to pay for the film processing himself if he also could receive a set of prints. Cross subsequently arranged for his attorney to mail the Woodward negatives to Lodge. Both the negatives and black and white prints of the photos were later discovered during a search of Lodge\u2019s home in May 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-13\">In 1981, Cross and Lodge, this time with Diwan\u2019s assistance, initiated a new attempt to obtain nude photographs of children and market them as child pornography by means of an elaborate confidence game in which the parents of child models in the Tampa, Florida area were misled into believing that Cross was an independent movie producer who required such pictures in order to make casting decisions for a new film.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Using a dummy corporation as a front, Cross contacted a Tampa talent agency, and requested and received composite photographs and resum\u00e9s of actresses between the ages of eight and twelve.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Cross informed the head of the agency that he was looking for a young girl to star in an educational documentary he was producing, and indicated that because it might involve some nudity, the agency should inform him as to which children did not suffer from \u201cmodesty problems.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-14\">Cross contacted the parents of several of the agency's models,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and later enlisted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>professional photographer in Tampa to take \u201ccasting\u201d pictures of these young girls.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Cross instructed the photographer to shoot several nude photos of the girls, allegedly in order to gauge their reactions to being filmed in the nude, and to determine whether the models were too physically developed to play the role of a young child. Cross further directed the photographer to provide him with full frontal nude pictures in the form of color transparencies three times the size of normal slides.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Like the talent agency, both the photographer and the girls\u2019 parents were told by Cross that the photo sessions were necessary because the film would include scenes in certain locations where native people routinely wore little or no clothing. Cross also assured them that these photos would not be reproduced and would be returned to the parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-4\">However, soon after receiving the transparencies, Cross mailed them to Lodge to be processed and enlarged so they would be suitable for sale. Lodge developed and sent to Cross slides from some of these transparencies, but indicated that several of the other pictures would need to be retaken because of their inferior quality.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> When Lodge\u2019s house was searched in May 1983, police discovered a negative strip containing a sequence of nude, black and white photos of one of the Tampa girls.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In addition, the strip contained versions of these photos that Lodge had cropped to highlight the girl\u2019s nude torso, followed by closeup photographs of adult female genitalia which he had added.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-9\">Neither Cross nor Lodge testified at trial. Cross, who represented himself, called several law enforcement officers and fellow prisoners to testify, in an attempt to show that he had planned and engaged in these various child pornography schemes in the course of acting as a police informant. Two character witnesses testified on Lodge\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-11\">I. SEVERANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-12\">Lodge contends that he was deprived of his right to a fair trial as a result of being tried jointly with his co-defendant Cross. Lodge argues that the district court erred in summarily denying his pre-trial motions for severance, and that he was unfairly prejudiced by a joint trial.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> He advances three grounds in support of this claim of error: (1) that Cross would have provided exculpatory testimony on Lodge\u2019s behalf had their cases been severed, (2) that Lodge\u2019s and Cross\u2019s defenses at trial were antagonistic, and (3) that Cross\u2019s behavior during the trial and evidence introduced solely against him had a prejudicial spill<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>over effect on the jury\u2019s determination of Lodge\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-5\">As a general rule, defendants who have been jointly indicted should be tried together, particularly in conspiracy cases. <em>United States v. Castillo-Valencia, </em>917 F.2d 494, 498 (11th Cir.1990). The decision whether to grant a severance is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court and can only be overturned for an abuse of such discretion. <em>United States v. Rucker, </em>915 F.2d 1511, 1512 (11th Cir.1990) (per curiam). In considering a motion for severance under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 14, a district judge is required to balance the prejudice that a defendant may suffer from a joint trial, against the public\u2019s interest in judicial economy and efficiency. In order to establish that a refusal to sever constituted an abuse of discretion, an appellant must demonstrate that he \u201csuffered compelling prejudice against which the trial court was unable to afford protection.\u201d <em>United States v. Riola, </em>694 F.2d 670, 672 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1073, 103 S.Ct. 1532, 75 L.Ed.2d 953 (1983). Guided by these principles, the court considers each of Lodge\u2019s separate theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-6\">A. <em>Exculpatory Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1133-7\">Lodge argued to the district court in his motions for severance that if he and Cross were tried separately, Cross would provide exculpatory testimony on Lodge\u2019s behalf. In support of this contention, Lodge submitted an affidavit from Cross, in which Cross promised to testify \u201cif I can do so without exposing myself to criminal jeopardy in [this] case,\u201d and described his proposed testimony. In his affidavit, Cross stated that Lodge had neither known of nor participated in the Tampa photo arrangements, but had \u201cinadvertently\u201d been mailed these photographs; that he and Lodge had otherwise never exchanged child pornography but only \u201cnaturist photographs\u201d of the kind found in \u201cnudist magazines;\u201d and that he had communicated with Lodge as a police informant surreptitiously seeking information about illegal activities. Lodge now contends that Cross\u2019s testimony could have refuted the government\u2019s conspiracy charge against him.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1133-11\">In order to warrant severance based on a co-defendant\u2019s potential testimony, an accused must first show: \u201c(1) a bona fide need for the testimony; (2) the substance of the desired testimony; (3) the exculpatory nature and effect of the desired testimony; and (4) that the codefendant would indeed ... testif[y] at a separate trial.\u201d <em>United States v. Funt, </em>896 F.2d 1288, 1297 (11th Cir.1990). If the defendant satisfies these threshold requirements, the trial judge then must \u201c(1) examine the significance of the testimony in relation to the defendant\u2019s theory of the case; (2) assess the extent of prejudice caused by the absence of the testimony; (3) consider judicial administration and economy; and (4) give weight to the timeliness of the motion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1133-12\">We are not persuaded as to the exculpatory nature or effect of Cross\u2019s proposed testimony. The affidavit consisted of little more than bare conclusory assertions of Lodge\u2019s lack of involvement, and contained no clear indication of any \u201cspecific and exonerative facts\u201d to which Cross would have testified. <em>United States v. Pepe, </em>747 F.2d 632, 651 (11th Cir.1984). <em>See also United States v. Johnson, </em>713 F.2d 633, 641 (11th Cir.1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1081, 104 S.Ct. 1447, 79 L.Ed.2d 766 (1984). Furthermore, Cross\u2019s proffered testimony was entirely self-serving in light of its emphasis on his own defense theory that he was acting as a police informant, and was contradicted by the extensive evidence of Lodge\u2019s considerable involvement in the Tampa photo scheme which was introduced at trial. For these reasons, Cross\u2019s affidavit lacked any substantial credibility. Therefore, the exculpatory value of his proposed testimony would have been trivial, and Lodge\u2019s defense did not suffer harm, let alone compelling prejudice, as a result of Cross\u2019s unavailability. <em>See Pepe, </em>747 F.2d at 651; <em>Johnson, </em>713 F.2d at 641; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number><em>United States v. Metz, </em>608 F.2d 147, 156 (5th Cir.1979), <em>cert. denied, </em>449 U.S. 821, 101 S.Ct. 80, 66 L.Ed.2d 24 (1980).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, even if the court were persuaded that Cross\u2019s testimony would have benefitted Lodge, we would still conclude that Lodge was not entitled to a severance on this basis. The trial in this case lasted approximately two months, and involved dozens of witnesses and hundreds of exhibits. As in <em>Pepe, </em>\u201cthe savings in time and resources produced by holding a joint trial in such a complex conspiracy case outweighed the possible benefit\u201d Lodge might have \u201cderived\u201d from Cross\u2019s testimony. <em>Id., </em>747 F.2d at 651.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See also Metz, </em>608 F.2d at 156. We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to try Lodge and Cross separately on the basis of Cross\u2019s alleged exculpatory testimony.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1134-4\">B. <em>Antagonistic Defenses</em></p>\n<p id=\"aaj-dedup-0\">A defendant is not entitled to a trial separate from that of his co-defendant simply because their defenses are prejudicial to one another. Rather, a trial court abuses its discretion in denying a severance only when the defenses advanced are \u201cso antagonistic as to be irreconcilable or mutually exclusive.\u201d <em>United States v. Castillo-Valencia, </em>917 F.2d 494, 498 (11th Cir.1990). Severance is compelled only \u201cif the jury, in order to believe the core of testimony offered on behalf of one defendant, must necessarily disbelieve the testimony offered on behalf of his co-defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Rucker, </em>915 F.2d 1511, 1513 (11th Cir.1990) (per curiam), <em>quoting United States v. Berkowitz, </em>662 F.2d 1127, 1134 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See also United States v. Caporale, </em>806 F.2d 1487, 1510 (11th Cir.1986) (severance mandated only when \u201cthe jury will infer that both defendants are guilty solely because of the conflict\u201d between their defenses), <em>cert. denied, </em>482 U.S. 917, 107 S.Ct. 3191, 96 L.Ed.2d 679 (1987). Lodge\u2019s and Cross\u2019s defenses at trial, however, were not so incompatible that the jury could not reasonably have decided on a version of events that accommodated both of their theories. <em>See Castillo-Valencia, </em>917 F.2d at 498; <em>United States v. Sawyer, </em>799 F.2d 1494, 1504 (11th Cir.1986) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 1069, 107 S.Ct. 961, 93 L.Ed.2d 1009 (1987). At trial, Lodge sought to undercut the government\u2019s charge that he joined and participated in the Tampa photo conspiracy. In cross-examination and argument, Lodge\u2019s counsel suggested to the jury that Lodge had not solicited these nude pictures from Cross, and never intended to prepare them for commercial distribution as child pornography. Cross\u2019s defense, on the other hand, was that he communicated with Lodge as a police informer acting under a grant of immunity. The jury could have believed both stories \u2014 that Cross was secretly working for law enforcement, and that Lodge received the photos but never agreed to become a part of Cross\u2019s scheme.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>not a case in which Cross\u2019s defense was Lodge\u2019s guilt. <em>See Rucker, </em>915 F.2d at 1513; <em>United States v. Magdaniel-Mora, </em>746 F.2d 715, 720 (11th Cir.1984). Therefore, we also conclude that the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a severance on the basis of an antagonism between Cross\u2019s and Lodge\u2019s defenses was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-6\">C. <em>Prejudicial Spillover</em></p>\n<p id=\"axq-dedup-0\">Finally, Lodge claims that his conviction should be reversed because his joint trial with Cross created a prejudicial spillover effect on the jury\u2019s determination of Lodge\u2019s guilt. Lodge contends that Cross\u2019s misbehavior as a pro se litigant and the government\u2019s introduction of inflammatory evidence against Cross deprived Lodge of his right to a fair trial.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We find that this theory, like Lodge\u2019s other grounds for challenging the denial of severance, is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1135-8\">As the court has noted, denial of severance will be considered error where the defendant can demonstrate that he suffered \u201ccompelling prejudice\u201d as a result of the spillover effects of being tried jointly with a co-defendant. The applicable test is whether it was \u201cwithin the capacity of [the] jurors to follow [the] court\u2019s limiting instructions and appraise the independent evidence against each defendant solely upon that defendant\u2019s own acts, statements, and conduct.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Silien, </em>825 F.2d 320, 232 (11th Cir.1987) (per curiam). In this case, the trial court specifically charged the jury that, \u201ceach offense and the evidence pertaining to it should be considered separately,\u201d and that \u201cthe case of each defendant should be considered separately and individually.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Pritchett, </em>908 F.2d 816, 822 (11th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Garrett, </em>727 F.2d 1003, 1015 (11th Cir.1984), <em>aff'd, </em>471 U.S. 773, 105 S.Ct. 2407, 85 L.Ed.2d 764 (1985). Indeed, the fact that the jury acquitted Lodge on a number of counts on which it convicted Cross confirms that the jurors \u201csifted the evidence and made individual determinations of guilt and innocence.\u201d <em>United States v. Khoury, </em>901 F.2d 948, 966 (11th Cir.1990). <em>See also United States v. Berkowitz, </em>662 F.2d 1127, 1135 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981). Moreover, Lodge fails to explain how any particular comment by, or testimony against, Cross was either adverse to Lodge or created a risk of conflating the jury\u2019s determination of each defendant\u2019s guilt.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. LaChance, </em>817 F.2d 1491, 1497 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 928, 108 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1040\">*1040</page-number>S.Ct. 295, 98 L.Ed.2d 255 (1987). We are not persuaded that Lodge suffered contaminating prejudice as a result of his joint trial with Cross. The trial court\u2019s refusal to sever was not an abuse of discretion on this or any of the other rationales advanced by Lodge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-4\">II. SEARCH WARRANT</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-5\">Lodge also contends that the district court erred in failing to conduct a pretrial evidentiary hearing on his motion to suppress evidence seized during a search of his Seattle home in May 1983. At trial, Lodge argued that Detective Thomas Dittmar of the Seattle Police Department intentionally or recklessly included false information and misleadingly omitted material facts from his search warrant affidavit. The district court, however, found that even if the allegedly false or misleading statements were deleted or corrected, the affidavit was still sufficient to establish probable cause for the search of Lodge\u2019s house. Relying on our independent weighing of the allegations in such a redacted affidavit, we too conclude that the Seattle judge who issued the search warrant had a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for finding that probable cause existed. <em>See United States v. Sims, </em>845 F.2d 1564, 1571 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 957, 109 S.Ct. 395, 102 L.Ed.2d 384 (1988); <em>United States v. Kirk, </em>781 F.2d 1498, 1505 (11th Cir.1986). We therefore find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-6\">In <em>Franks v. Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 98 S.Ct. 2674, 57 L.Ed.2d 667 (1978), the United States Supreme Court recognized the limited constitutional right of a criminal defendant to attack the veracity of a warrant affidavit.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In order to merit an evi-dentiary hearing on such a claim, however, an accused must make a concrete, preliminary showing that: (1) the affiant deliberately or recklessly included false statements, or failed to include material information, in the affidavit; and (2) the misrepresentation was essential to the finding of probable cause. <em>Id. </em>at 171-72, 98 S.Ct. at 2684-85. <em>Accord United States v. Jenkins, </em>901 F.2d 1075, 1080 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 111 S.Ct. 259, 112 L.Ed.2d 216 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-11\">In this case, Dittmar\u2019s affidavit contained information that he received from William Dworin, a Los Angeles police detective who had corresponded with Lodge in the course of an undercover investigation of child pornography.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> In a then-recent letter to Dworin, Lodge had stated that he was \u201cfairly active in photography,\u201d had a collection of \u201c15,000 to 20,000 negatives,\u201d and had \u201ccontacts that may eventually lead to some good models.\u201d Lodge had also indicated that he had \u201ca fair amount of European material, but as you know acquisition has been difficult lately.\u201d Lodge assured Dworin that it would be \u201csafe\u201d to send him \u201cany mail of any type.\u201d In addition to providing the Seattle detective with a copy of Lodge\u2019s letter, Dworin also informed Dittmar that Lodge\u2019s name had appeared on Cross\u2019s mailing lists for child pornography when he arrested Cross several years earlier. Finally, Dittmar\u2019s affidavit also contained certain information about Lodge\u2019s involvement in the Tampa photo hoax. According to the affidavit, the source of this last material was a government official who, in turn, had learned of the conspiracy from Cross.</p>\n<p id=\"b1136-12\">Lodge argues that the following \u201cfacts,\u201d which he presented to the district court, constituted a \u201csubstantial preliminary showing,\u201d mandating a pretrial hearing on his suppression motion: (1) Dittmar failed to contact Cross to verify Lodge\u2019s involvement in the Tampa scheme; (2) Cross denied making the statements attributed to him in the affidavit; (3) Dittmar failed to disclose that such information actually came from several prisoners incarcerated with Cross, whose reliability was unproven; and (4) the affidavit did not describe or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1041\">*1041</page-number>attach the letter from Dworin which elicited Lodge\u2019s return correspondence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1137-5\">We assume, as did the district court, that Cross has satisfied the first prong of <em>Franks </em>by alleging, in more than conclusory fashion, a deliberately or recklessly false statement or material omission from the affidavit. However, even if all the information attributed to Cross were removed and the letter from Dworin to Lodge were added, the redacted affidavit would still contain allegations sufficient to support a finding of probable cause. <em>See Jenkins, </em>901 F.2d at 1080; <em>Sims, </em>845 F.2d at 1571; <em>United States v. Ofshe, </em>817 F.2d 1508, 1513 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 963, 108 S.Ct. 451, 98 L.Ed.2d 391 (1987). Lodge\u2019s letter, with its cryptic references to \u201cEuropean material,\u201d \u201cgood models,\u201d his huge collection of photographs, and the need for secrecy, could reasonably be read as a veiled discussion of child pornography.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Such an interpretation is only supported by Dworin\u2019s antecedent letter to Lodge,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and by the fact that Lodge\u2019s name had earlier appeared on Cross\u2019s child pornography mailing list. In short, even if restricted to such information, the affidavit demonstrated \u201ca fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime [would] be found in\u201d Lodge\u2019s home. <em>Illinois v.

SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"Ah5\">A. <em>Lodge</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1137-11\">In his third and final claim of error, Lodge challenges his conviction of conspiracy to exploit a minor sexually, on the ground that the evidence introduced against him at trial was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain a guilty verdict on this charge. In evaluating the sufficiency of evidence, we must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the government.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> <em>Glasser v.

To support a conviction for conspiracy, the prosecution must prove that two or more persons agreed to commit a crime, that the defendant knew of the conspiracy, and that he voluntarily participated in helping to achieve its objective. <em>United States v. Roper, </em>874 F.2d 782, 787 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 110 S.Ct. 189, 107 L.Ed.2d 144 (1989). An additional element, under \u00a7 371, is an overt act committed by one of the co-conspirators in furtherance of the conspiracy. 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 371 (1966); <em>United States v. Hollifield, </em>870 F.2d 574, 577 (11th Cir.1989) (per curiam).

Lignarolo, </em>770 F.2d 971, 978 n. 9 (11th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>476 U.S. 1105, 106 S.Ct. 1948, 90 L.Ed.2d 358 (1986). Similarly, the defendant\u2019s knowledge of and membership in the conspiracy may be proven by acts on his part which furthered the goal of the conspiracy.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Morales, </em>868 F.2d 1562, 1572 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1138-11\">The evidence presented by the government amply demonstrated both the existence of, and Lodge\u2019s knowing involvement in, a conspiracy with Cross and Di-wan to produce and market child pornography. The correspondence between Cross, Lodge, and third parties, as well as altered versions of the Tampa photos found in Lodge\u2019s home, make clear that Lodge knew of Cross\u2019s and Diwan\u2019s plan to deceive the models and their parents into providing nude pictures, and that Lodge actively participated in the scheme by processing and modifying these photos in order to render them suitable for commercial distribution. The proof at trial was more than adequate to support Lodge\u2019s conviction.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1138-12\">B. <em>Cross</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1138-13\">Cross also argues that the evidence at trial was legally insufficient as to the conspiracy charge of which he too was found guilty. Cross alleges not that the government failed to prove all the elements of a conspiracy; rather, he contends that his conviction should be reversed because the evidence did not demonstrate that the Tampa photos were obscene, or that he endeavored to produce them for pecuniary gain. However, the antecedent version of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2251, which Cross was convicted of violating, did not require that either the \u201csexually explicit conduct\u201d engaged in by the minor or the \u201cvisual or print medium\u201d created from that conduct be obscene.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 2251(a), 2253(2) (1982); <em>New York v.

JURY INSTRUCTIONS ON MAIL FRAUD</p>\n<p id=\"b1139-6\">Relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>McNally v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 350, 107 S.Ct. 2875, 97 L.Ed.2d 292 (1987),<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Cross asks us to reverse his mail fraud convictions on the ground that the jury could have concluded that he perpetrated the Tampa photo hoax simply to indulge his own personal, sexual gratification, and therefore could have found him guilty of engaging in a scheme to deprive his victims of intangible, non-property rights, outside the scope of the mail fraud statute, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1341 (1984).<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> However, after reviewing the indictment, the evidence offered at trial, and the jury instructions, we conclude that the jury in this case necessarily determined that Cross schemed to defraud the Tampa models, along with their families, the photographer, and the modeling agency, of various servic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1044\">*1044</page-number>es and property of some value.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Lang, </em>904 F.2d 618, 627 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 111 S.Ct. 305, 112 L.Ed.2d 258 (1990); <em>United States v. Dynalectric Co., </em>859 F.2d 1559, 1570 (11th Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1006, 109 S.Ct. 1642, 104 L.Ed.2d 157 (1989). Therefore, we reject this claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-6\">In disposing of an appeal by Cross\u2019s co-defendant, Diwan, this court has already determined that the indictment in this case sufficiently alleged a plot to deprive the victims of property or money.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Diwan, </em>864 F.2d 715 (11th Cir.) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>492 U.S. 921, 109 S.Ct. 3249, 106 L.Ed.2d 595 (1989). The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1140-7\">One objective of this conspiracy ... was that the girls forfeit modelling services, photographs, and the likenesses that emanate therefrom. The photographer would lose the value of his services, as would the ... [tjalent [ajgency ... the photographer would necessarily have to use film and other materials in producing the photographs, and [the talent agency] would forfeit proprietary business information \u2014 the identities and the addresses of aspiring actresses. All of these items have value to the owner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1140-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 719. Nevertheless, Cross now argues that the evidence presented at trial and the jury charge on the elements of mail fraud allowed the jury to convict him of engaging in a deception involving intangible, McNally-type rights. In attempting to identify such rights in this case, which were unprotected by the mail fraud statute, Cross contends that his guilty verdict may have improperly rested on proof showing only that he sought to obtain the Tampa photographs to satisfy his own sexual appetites.</p>\n<p id=\"b1140-12\">Cross is wrong on all accounts. The evidence at trial proved the indictment\u2019s allegations of losses suffered by the victims, as described in <em>Diwan. </em>More importantly, the district court\u2019s instructions specifically directed the jury that it could return a guilty verdict on the mail fraud counts only if it found that Cross had devised \u201ca scheme to defraud or for obtaining money or property,\u201d and defined scheme to include any plan to obtain \u201cmoney or property.\u201d <em>See Dynalectric, </em>859 F.2d at 1573 (concluding that identical instruction comported with <em>McNally). </em>The court also charged that to act with \u201cintent to defraud\u201d meant acting \u201cordinarily for the purpose of causing some financial loss to another or bringing about some financial gain to oneself.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> As for Cross\u2019s claim that his convictions should be reversed because the ultimate goal of the plot was to indulge his pedophilia and not turn a profit, Cross incorrectly focuses on his own ultimate purposes, rather than on the harms suffered by his victims.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> In rejecting the same contention in Diwan\u2019s case, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1140-13\">Diwan misses the point when she argues that the primary objective of the scheme was merely personal sexual indulgence, and not the deprivation of property through fraud. The entire array of deprivations announced in the indictment would be a necessary result of the overt acts planned to further the scheme. If the defendants were to achieve success in their endeavor in the chosen manner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1045\">*1045</page-number>the girls, the photographer, and the talent agency would have to lor :, and what they would lose is property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1141-5\"><em>Diwan, </em>864 F.2d at 719-20. Cross\u2019s mail fraud convictions were not invalid under <em>McNally </em>and its progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-6\">V. ADMISSION OF CROSS\u2019S LETTERS TO LODGE</p>\n<p id=\"b1141-7\">A. <em>Immunity</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1141-8\">As the centerpiece of his defense at trial, Cross sought to prove that, in corresponding with Lodge, he was acting as an informant for the Florida Department of Law Enforcement under an official grant of immunity. Cross claims that his convictions should be overturned because the trial court improperly admitted as evidence letters that he wrote to Lodge as part of his work on behalf of a government investigation of child pornographers.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> For the purposes of resolving this issue, we accept, as did the district court, Cross\u2019s contention that such evidence would be subject to exclusion if it were indeed a product of either an actual immunity agreement or Cross\u2019s good faith belief that he had been granted immunity from prosecution. <em>See United States v. Harvey, </em>869 F.2d 1439, 1444 (11th Cir.1989); <em>Rowe v. Griffin, </em>676 F.2d 524, 527-28 (11th Cir.1982); <em>United States v. Weiss, </em>599 F.2d 730, 735-36, 738 n. 17 (5th Cir.1979). The district court overruled Cross\u2019s objection to admission of the correspondence, in light of the government\u2019s contrary evidence that Cross was not working as a law enforcement informant.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Because Cross\u2019s immunity contentions raised an issue relevant to his guilt or innocence, the jury was allowed to hear the evidence and received instructions on this defense.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> In convicting Cross on the conspiracy count, the jury necessarily found that Cross had possessed the requisite criminal intent when he conspired with Lodge. We find no reason to disturb the jury\u2019s resolution of this factual issue against Cross.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1141-12\">In 1979, Cross, through his attorney, Raymond Cramer, contacted the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1046\">*1046</page-number>plore the possibility of assisting the Department in an investigation of child pornography distribution. In 1980, Cross, Cramer, and Department agent Michael Brick met on several occasions to discuss ways in which Cross could aid in the investigation, but no agreement was reached. Brick suggested that Cross maintain his contacts with pornography distributors, but not with individual pedophiles. Brick also instructed Cross to mail only written materials, and specifically rejected a proposal by Cross that he send out a fake brochure containing pictures of nude children.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Later that year, Department agent George Syring, who had been reassigned in Brick\u2019s place, together with United States Postal Inspector Ted Griem also contacted Cross in order to solicit his assistance in gathering information about child pornographers. At a meeting with Cross in 1981, Syring and Griem instructed him to correspond with four magazine advertisers, who they suspected were peddling child pornography, through a post office box rented by Syring under a false name. No letters to or from Cross were ever received at this post office box. Instead, Cross asked the Department for a grant of immunity before proceeding with any correspondence. Several months later, the Department\u2019s legal counsel forwarded a draft immunity agreement to Cross which he signed and returned to the Department through his attorney, Cramer.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The agreement was never signed by any law enforcement official and was never returned to Cramer or Cross.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Cramer testified that he assumed that the Department\u2019s failure to return the immunity agreement meant that they had decided not to go forward with it.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1142-8\">What is most telling is that, contrary to his instructions, Cross never informed any of the government officials with whom he communicated during this period about the Tampa photo scheme or that he was mailing nude pictures, nor did he ever receive permission from any law enforcement officer to engage in such activities.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Indeed, Cross\u2019s intrigues involving the child models occurred in late 1982 and early 1983, well after he had last had any discussions with or received any news from law enforcement officers concerning his assistance in an investigation or the possibility that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1047\">*1047</page-number>would be granted immunity. In short, based on these facts, it was not unreasonable for the jury to find that Cross did not engage in these activities under a good faith belief that he was acting on behalf of law enforcement and under a grant of immunity.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Clearly rather, Cross was, as the government aptly describes it, \u201cplaying both ends against the middle in a cynical effort to create a defense for himself if his efforts to obtain pornographic pictures of little girls were discovered.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1143-5\">B. <em>Relevancy and Undue Prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"A8U\">In addition to challenging the admission of his correspondence with Lodge on the basis of his purported immunity agreement, Cross also claims that the letters should have been excluded because they were unduly prejudicial and because those which predated the conspiracy were irrelevant to the charges against him. A district court\u2019s admission of \u201cextrinsic act\u201d evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 404(b) will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Jones, </em>913 F.2d 1552, 1556 (11th Cir.1990). In order to be admissible under Rule 404(b), extrinsic act proof must simply be relevant.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> <em>Huddleston v. United States, </em>485 U.S. 681, 689, 108 S.Ct. 1496, 1501, 99 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988). Cross\u2019s pre-1980 correspondence to Lodge,<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> in which he discussed at length various plots to produce and distribute child pornography, was properly introduced to demonstrate both appellants\u2019 intent to accomplish this same illegal purpose with regards to the Tampa photo hoax.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 404(b); <em>Jones, </em>913 F.2d at 1566; <em>United States v. Collins, </em>779 F.2d 1520, 1533 (11th Cir.1986). Evidence explaining the onset of Cross and Lodge\u2019s planning of illegal activities was particularly important because of the unusual circumstances in this ease: Cross and Lodge had never met, they lived on opposite coasts, and Lodge was not aware that Cross was incarcerated. <em>See id.; United States v. Mancari, </em>875 F.2d 103, 105 (7th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Marks, </em>816 F.2d 1207, 1209 (7th Cir.1987). In short, contrary to what Cross suggests, there is no absolute bar on the introduction of evidence which pre-dates an alleged conspiracy if the evidence is otherwise relevant. <em>See United States v. Diaz, </em>878 F.2d 608, 614 &amp; n. 2 (2nd Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 110 S.Ct. 543, 107 L.Ed.2d 540 (1989); <em>Mancari, </em>875 F.2d at 105; <em>Marks, </em>816 F.2d at 1209.</p>\n<p id=\"b1143-13\">Cross, however, also contends that even if the correspondence were relevant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1048\">*1048</page-number>the probative value of these and other, post-1980 letters used against him by the government was substantially outweighed by their unfair and unduly prejudicial impact on the jury. <em>See </em>Federal Rule of Evidence 403.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Cross points, in particular, to some of the letters\u2019 sexual references to children, and argues that their admission created an unacceptable risk that the jury convicted simply because he was a pedophile. A conviction will not be set aside because of a district court\u2019s refusal to exclude evidence under Rule 403 absent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Cauchon v. United States, </em>824 F.2d 908, 913-14 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 957, 108 S.Ct. 355, 98 L.Ed.2d 380 (1987). Indeed, Rule 403 is \u201can extraordinary remedy which should be used sparingly,\" and the trial court\u2019s discretion to exclude evidence as unduly prejudicial is \u201cnarrowly circumscribed.\u201d <em>United States v. Norton, </em>867 F.2d 1354, 1361 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 110 S.Ct. 200, 107 L.Ed.2d 154 (1989). The \u201cmajor function\u201d of Rule 403 \u201cis limited to excluding matter of scant or cumulative probative force, dragged in by the heels for the sake of its prejudicial effect.\u201d <em>United States v. Sawyer, </em>799 F.2d 1494, 1506 (11th Cir.1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 1069, 107 S.Ct. 961, 93 L.Ed.2d 1009 (1987), <em>quoting United States v. Thevis, </em>665 F.2d 616, 633-34 (5th Cir. Unit B), <em>cert. denied, </em>456 U.S. 1008, 102 S.Ct. 2300, 73 L.Ed.2d 1303 (1982).<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> As previously discussed, the correspondence was of considerable probative value in proving Lodge\u2019s and Cross\u2019s intent to create and market child pornography.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> Moreover, because there was ample other evidence offered at trial that Cross was a pedophile and child pornographer, it is unlikely that the references in these letters to sexual exploitation of children injected any unfair prejudice into the jury\u2019s determination of Cross\u2019s guilt. We find no error in the district court\u2019s admission of Cross\u2019s correspondence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-10\">VI. REFUSAL TO GRANT A CONTINUANCE</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-11\">Cross insists that he is entitled to a new trial as a result of the district court\u2019s refusal to grant a continuance to enable him to call his daughter as a witness. The decision whether to continue a trial is committed to the sound discretion of the district court. <em>United States v. O\u2019Neill, </em>767 F.2d 780, 784 (11th Cir.1985). The factors to be considered in evaluating such a claim of error are: (1) the diligence of the defense in interviewing the witness and procuring her testimony; (2) the probability of obtaining the testimony within a reasonable time; (3) the specificity with which the defense was able to describe the witness\u2019s expected knowledge or testimony; and (4) the degree to which such testimony was expected to be favorable to the accused, and the unique or cumulative nature of the testimony. <em>United States v. Costello, </em>760 F.2d 1123, 1126 (11th Cir.1985). <em>See also Dickerson v. Alabama, </em>667 F.2d 1364, 1370 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 878, 103 S.Ct. 173, 74 L.Ed.2d 142 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b1144-12\">Cross\u2019s claim fails to satisfy several of these criteria. First, Cross was not diligent in endeavoring to secure his daughter\u2019s presence, and did not demonstrate that she would actually be available to testify within a reasonable period of time. He first indicated to the trial court that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1049\">*1049</page-number>having difficulty locating his daughter, who lived in Canada, two weeks after he had begun to present his defense, on the day he rested his case. At such time, the court granted Cross a five-day continuance, indicating that he would be allowed to reopen his case during or after Lodge\u2019s defense in order to call his daughter as a witness, but that if she were not available on that date, the trial would be completed and the case submitted to the jury. On the day that Cross\u2019s daughter was supposed to appear, he moved for another continuance on the ground that she had been forced to remain in Canada to care for a sick relative. Cross did not specifically indicate to the court when his daughter would be available to testify.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Refusing to further delay the trial, the court denied Cross\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-4\">Second, his daughter's testimony would have been, at best, cumulative and of marginal benefit to Cross\u2019s defense. Cross contends that she would have testified that he had, in the 1950\u2019s and 60\u2019s, been a legitimate film producer and had intended to produce a documentary similar to the one that was the subject of the Tampa hoax. Such evidence, however, would have been of little relevance to the question of whether, decades after the events claimed by his daughter, Cross obtained nude photos from the young models in order to create child pornography. Indeed, the evidence at trial that Cross\u2019s activities were not aimed at producing a legitimate film was overwhelming. Moreover, two other witnesses, the head of the talent agency and the Tampa photographer hired by Cross, each testified that he indeed demonstrated a professional familiarity with the film business and appeared to be a knowledgeable, experienced producer. The district court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to grant Cross a second continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-7\">VII. EXPERT TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b1145-8\">Cross next argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the district court erred in admitting irrelevant, cumulative, and unfairly prejudicial expert testimony by Kenneth Lanning, an FBI agent, on the characteristic behaviors of pedophiles. A trial court has wide discretion in determining whether to exclude expert testimony, and its action will be sustained on appeal unless \u201cmanifestly erroneous.\u201d <em>United, States v. Burchfield, </em>719 F.2d 356, 357 (11th Cir.1983) (per curiam). <em>See also Hamling v. United States, </em>418 U.S. 87, 108, 94 S.Ct. 2887, 2903, 41 L.Ed.2d 590 (1974); <em>United States v.

It is well settled that such expert testimony is permissible in an obscenity prosecution, particularly when \u201ccontested materials are directed at ...

In his defense at trial, Cross contended that the Tampa photos were innocent \u201cnude studies,\u201d rather than child pornography, and that he had arranged them for the purpose of casting a legitimate film. In describing the habits of pedophiles, Lanning testified that such persons characteristically derive sexual satisfaction from and collect even such ostensibly non-sexual nude photographs of children. Lanning also told the jury that these kinds of pictures, rather than more graphic ones, are frequently published in magazines distributed to pedophiles in an attempt to circumvent laws against obscenity and child pornography.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Such evidence clearly shed light on one of the critical issues in the case \u2014 whether Cross obtained the photos with the intention of using them to produce and distribute child pornography. Indeed, federal courts have ordinarily allowed law enforcement officials \u201cto testify as experts ... to establish the <em>modus operandi </em>of particular crimes,\u201d in order to \u201cexplain the actions of the defendants.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> <em>Burchfield, </em>719 F.2d at 358 (counterfeiters). <em>Accord United States v.

Cross specifically suggests that Lanning\u2019s testimony created an unacceptable risk that the jury convicted him simply out of disgust for pedophilia. As the court has already recognized in its discussion of Cross\u2019s claim of error regarding admission of his correspondence,<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> a conviction will not be overturned on the basis of a violation of Rule 403 absent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Cauchon v. United States, </em>824 F.2d 908, 913\u201414 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 957, 108 S.Ct. 355, 98 L.Ed.2d 380 (1987). This rule is \u201can extraordinary remedy which should be used sparingly,\u201d and, indeed, the trial court\u2019s discretion to exclude evidence as unduly prejudicial is \u201cnarrowly circumscribed.\u201d <em>United States v. Norton, </em>867 F.2d 1354, 1361 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 110 S.Ct. 200, 107 L.Ed.2d 154 (1989). As noted above, Lanning\u2019s testimony on the obscene nature of the California photos and the sexual appeal and marketability of the Tampa pictures to pedophiles was of considerable probative value in proving each of the charges contained in the indictment. Moreover, because there was extensive, particularized evidence of Cross\u2019s sexual attitudes toward children offered at trial by the government and, indeed, by Cross himself, it is doubtful that Lanning\u2019s more generalized testimony about the nature of pedophilia could have independently affected the jury\u2019s verdict. <em>See Anderson, </em>851 F.2d at 394. The jurors were instructed to determine for themselves the weight to be given the opinion of each expert witness. <em>See Burchfield, </em>719 F.2d at 358. We find no error in the district court\u2019s admission of Lanning\u2019s testimon over Cross\u2019s Rule 403 objection.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1147-12\">VIII. CO-CONSPIRATOR HEARSAY</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-13\">In his initial <em>pro se </em>brief, Cross complains that the district court improperly admitted certain hearsay statements made to law enforcement officers by Diwan and Lodge. At trial, a prison inspector and state police official from Florida each testified that Diwan provided and identified for them certain documents that the government later introduced as exhibits at trial, including a package of nude photographs which Diwan indicated she had received from the Tampa photographer. In addition, Seattle Detective Thomas Dittmar also testified that at the time he and other officers searched Lodge\u2019s home, Lodge acknowledged to him that he collected child pornography, knew Cross, and that the dummy corporation created as a front for the Tampa photo scheme had been Cross\u2019s idea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1147-14\">An out-of-court statement by a co-conspirator is admissible under both Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(2)(E)<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1052\">*1052</page-number>Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment if the trial judge determines that the government has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that (1) \u201cthe declarant and the defendant were involved in an existing conspiracy,\u201d and (2) \u201cthe statement was made in furtherance of that conspiracy.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Jones, </em>913 F.2d 1552, 1563 (11th Cir.1990). <em>See also Bourjaily v. United States, </em>483 U.S. 171, 175, 107 S.Ct. 2775, 2778, 97 L.Ed.2d 144 (1987). Although we are bound to apply a \u201cliberal standard\u201d in determining whether a statement was made in furtherance of a conspiracy, <em>see United States v. Byrom, </em>910 F.2d 725, 735 (11th Cir.1990), it is clear that these statements by Diwan and Lodge were admissions after the conspiracy had effectively ended, and as such, were not made \u201cin furtherance of that conspiracy.\u201d <footnotemark>72</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s finding to the contrary was clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Turner, </em>871 F.2d 1574, 1581 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 110 S.Ct. 552, 107 L.Ed.2d 548 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1148-6\">However, this conclusion does not end our inquiry. It is well-established that the improper admission of co-conspirator hearsay, like other Confrontation Clause errors, is subject to the harmless error rule of <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). <em>Turner, </em>871 F.2d at 1581-82. <em>See also Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 684, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1438, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986). We find that Cross is not entitled to prevail on appeal, despite the district court\u2019s erroneous failure to exclude these statements, because there is \u201cno reasonable probability\u201d that such evidence \u201cmight have contributed to [his] conviction[s].\u201d <em>Turner, </em>871 F.2d at 1582, <em>quoting Fahy v. Connecticut, </em>375 U.S. 85, 86-87, 84 S.Ct. 229, 230-31, 11 L.Ed.2d 171 (1963).<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> <em>See also United States v.

Diwan\u2019s and Lodge\u2019s statements to law enforcement officers were of little significance to the case against Cross. The government presented abundant, independent proof of the inculpatory facts referred to in these statements, namely, that the Tampa photographer had conveyed nude photos to Cross, and that Cross had hatched the idea of chartering a corporation to disguise his pornographic enterprise. Moreover, because the evidence of Cross\u2019s guilt on all counts was so overwhelming, we can be virtually certain that the admission of these statements did not influence the jury\u2019s verdict. Cross is not entitled to a new trial, because the error in question was \u201charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>See Turner, </em>871 F.2d at 1582; <em>United States v. Pendegraph, </em>791 F.2d 1462, 1465 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 869, 107 S.Ct. 235, 93 L.Ed.2d 160 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>(1986). <em>See also United States v.

RECANTED TESTIMONY</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-6\">Cross contends that Warren Mum-power, a former fellow inmate and government witness, has since recanted the testimony he gave at Cross\u2019s trial.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> However, the proper procedure for presenting such newly discovered evidence would have been to file a motion for a new trial in the district court. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 33. Cross has failed to pursue this avenue and it is now closed to him, as the prescribed two-year period in which to move for a new trial under Rule 33 has expired.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> This court cannot consider a claim that rests on factual allegations outside the record which the district court has never considered. <em>See United States v. Costa, </em>890 F.2d 480, 483 (1st Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Lara-Hernandez, </em>588 F.2d 272, 275 (9th Cir.1978).<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> As a federal prisoner, Cross is free to bring a habeas corpus action in the district court, under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255, collaterally attacking his convictions on the basis of Mumpower\u2019s alleged perjury. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1149-7\">X. PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b1149-8\">We now dispose of Cross\u2019s final claim that he is entitled to a new trial because the prosecution improperly obtained his sealed witness list, and colluded with Diwan\u2019s defense counsel to induce her to flee the country.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> As a general matter, we will reverse a conviction on the basis of governmental misconduct only if the misconduct may have prejudiced substantial rights of the accused. <em>United States v. Collins, </em>779 F.2d 1520, 1534 (11th Cir.1986). Specifically, the government\u2019s improper acquisition of defense strategy is fatal to a conviction only where there was \u201ca realistic possibility of injury to [the defendant] or benefit to the State.\u201d <em>United States v. Franklin, </em>598 F.2d 954, 956 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>444 U.S. 870, 100 S.Ct. 147, 62 L.Ed.2d 95 (1979), <em>quoting Weatherford v. Bursey, </em>429 U.S. 545, 558, 97 S.Ct. 837, 845, 51 L.Ed.2d 30 (1977). In this case, Cross submitted to the district court, <em>ex parte, </em>a list of witnesses he wished to call together with a description of the relevant, anticipated testimony of each one, in order to obtain subpoenas and expenses for these witnesses. Cross himself admitted that this document was unsealed when received by the clerk of the district court, although he insists that it was sealed when filed by his standby counsel. Even if it were true that, as Cross alleges, the witness list was later revealed to the FBI agent assigned to the case, Cross did not demonstrate that the agent or any member of the prosecutorial team was responsible for unsealing the document, or that it was unsealed other than by accident. This does not amount to governmental misconduct. Moreover, Cross has failed to describe how the revelation of his witness list prejudiced his ease, and he has not contradicted the government\u2019s contention that they already knew the nature of his defense and the identities of many of his witnesses. Presented with these alle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>gations, the district court properly denied Cross\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment on the basis of the unsealed witness list.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1150-4\">As for the other element of Cross's misconduct claim, it is true that government intimidation of defense witnesses can constitute a denial of due process. <em>See United States v. Terzado-Madruga, </em>897 F.2d 1099, 1108 (11th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Stewart, </em>820 F.2d 370, 375 (11th Cir.1987). <em>See also United States v.

The district court held several hearings to inquire into allegations by Cross that the government had deprived him of favorable testimony from Diwan by colluding with her defense attorney to persuade her to abscond rather than face trial. Although testimony by Cross and Diwan,<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> together with a purported transcript of one of Diwan\u2019s conversations with her attorney, indicates that the attorney may have suggested to Diwan that she consider leaving the country, there was no evidence whatsoever that the government induced the attorney to make this suggestion, or otherwise colluded with Diwan\u2019s counsel.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> We concur in the district court\u2019s finding that Cross\u2019s witness intimidation claim has no merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1150-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1130-16\">.

Cross, Diwan, and Lodge were officers or directors of this corporation, which Cross named \"Viewfinder, Inc.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1131-16\">. Cross explained that the documentary, to be entitled, \"Susan\u2019s Magic Carpet,\u201d would be about a girl who travels around the world, and that, in order for the film to be realistic, the principal character would briefly have to appear nude in certain scenes such as, for example, an aboriginal dance sequence in New Guinea.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b1131-17\">.

Because Cross was a prison inmate in Florida during this time, in all his communications with the talent agency, models\u2019 parents, the Tampa photographer, and Lodge, he used Diwan to set up \"conference calls\u201d and relay his mail, so as to conceal the fact that he was incarcerated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b1132-7\">. Cross carefully specified the poses in which the children were to be photographed. However, because they were uncomfortable with some of these poses, including one which called for the children to squat on their knees, the photographer and several of the parents did not agree to the shooting of certain nude photos, and the photographer deliberately did a poor job of developing the film so that the pictures he did take could not be copied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b1132-13\">. Around this time, Cross suggested in a letter that Lodge return the original, poor-quality transparencies to him, explaining that he had been able to persuade the girls\u2019 parents to allow another nude photo session, but only on the condition that the first set of pictures be destroyed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1132-14\">.

Neither Lodge nor Cross claim on appeal that the Tampa pictures or the scenes they depicted were not \"lewd\" within the meaning of the statute; therefore, we do not reach this issue. However, even if they had raised such an argument, we would still affirm their convictions on this count. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1043\">*1043</page-number>Tampa photographs displayed pre-adolescent girls fully nude from a frontal view, and were arranged by Cross in order to be used to satisfy the sexual interests of himself and other pedophiles. Moreover, Cross had also ordered that the children be photographed in the nude, squatting on their knees, but the Tampa photographer felt uncomfortable with and ultimately refused to shoot such pictures. Based on these factors, we are of the opinion that the photographs taken or planned involved \u201clewd exhibition of the genitals or pubic area.\u201d We reach this conclusion despite the obvious fact that the photographs did not portray the models as sexually coy or inviting, and the Tampa photographer who had been duped by Cross did not knowingly or intentionally exhibit the girls in lewd poses. <em>See United States v.

Cross also contends that the district court erred in failing to dismiss the indictment\u2019s conspiracy count because it was based on his immunized conduct. Because, as discussed below, we concur with the jury's determination that Cross did not in good faith believe he was acting on behalf of law enforcement when he wrote to Lodge or undertook other actions in furtherance of his pornographic ventures, we conclude that this claim of error, like Cross\u2019s related contention that his correspondence with Lodge was improperly admitted at trial, is without merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"45\">\n<p id=\"b1141-10\">. Cross complains that the district court should have ruled on his motion to exclude the letters <em>in limine, </em>as he had requested, rather than during the trial at the point when the government sought to introduce such correspondence. However, we find that it was proper for the court to reserve decision on Cross\u2019s request. The motion was filed on the eve of an already twice-delayed trial, and resolution of the immunity issue at that juncture would have required a trial-in-miniature of the government\u2019s and Cross\u2019s evidence. Moreover, the district court\u2019s deferral of its ruling did not adversely affect Cross\u2019s ability to raise this issue on appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 12(e) (determination of pre-trial motions may be postponed until trial \"for good cause\"); <em>United States v.

Because it challenged the truth of the indictment\u2019s allegations, the district judge properly determined that the immunity issue presented a factual question for the jury, and that it was therefore not within the province of the court ultimately to weigh the government\u2019s and Cross\u2019s evidence on this matter. <em>See United States v.

This is in contrast to the ordinary, non-guilt-related immunity claim, in which the government seeks to use against a defendant evidence that he contends derives from his previous immunized testimony. <em>See, e.g., Kastigar v.

Cross places false weight on a 1981 draft letter sent to Cramer by Brick. The letter, which was originally drafted by Cramer and modified by Brick, was to be sent to Florida parole officials on Cross\u2019s behalf. It erroneously stated that an immunity agreement had been \u201cissued\" for Cross\u2019s \"future association with the porno-trade during the course of his assistance\" to the Department. Cramer testified that he knew that Brick's failure to change or remove this phrase from the draft letter did not mean the immunity agreement had been signed or approved. The proof at trial clearly showed that Cross had no reason to, and in fact did not, infer from this stray, incorrect comment that he henceforth had license to establish a pornographic enterprise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"49\">\n<p id=\"b1142-5\">. The \"Contract of Immunity\u201d indicated that if he cooperated with law enforcement officials, Cross would not be prosecuted for past pornographic activities or for future attempts to solicit child pornography. As such, it did not cover Cross\u2019s mailings of pornographic photos or attempts to have these photos prepared for commercial distribution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"50\">\n<p id=\"b1142-6\">. The agreement contained labeled blank spaces for the signatures of the state attorney and an assistant state attorney, but was never signed by either of these officials. Although prison investigators discovered in Cross's cell a copy of the immunity agreement which purportedly was signed by an assistant state attorney named \"Richards,\u201d the government presented evidence that no lawyer by this name worked in the office of the state attorney. There was also testimony from one of Cross\u2019s then-fellow prison inmates that Cross had tampered with the document, as well as testimony from a handwriting expert that the \"Richards\" signature was similar to Cross\u2019s and that Cross had disguised his handwriting exemplars. Cross's duplicity in this matter clearly indicates he was aware that he had no valid immunity agreement with law enforcement officials.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"51\">\n<p id=\"b1142-10\">. In 1981, Syring informed Cross that he was being transferred to Fort Myers, Florida, and instructed Cross to contact him when he was granted immunity.

Although Cramer did provide the Department with copies of several of Woodward\u2019s California photographs, these were different photos than the ones sent to Lodge. Moreover, as with the Tampa photos, no government official was informed of or approved Cross's mailing of the California photos to Lodge, although Cross had given Lodge\u2019s and Woodward\u2019s names to several law enforcement agents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b1143-6\">. We must note, however, that the court is disturbed by the somewhat careless and slipshod fashion in which government agents dealt with Cross, who even then was a notorious confidence artist.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"54\">\n<p id=\"b1143-7\">. The government presented evidence that Cross's ulterior motive in pretending to act as an informant was not only to avoid criminal punishment if the Tampa hoax were detected, but also to further the scheme itself: A then-fellow prison inmate testified that Cross had told him that he was attempting to parlay his cooperation with a Senate subcommittee investigating child pornography into a parole in the New York area, where Cross hoped to establish a phony office in order to take additional nude pictures of the Tampa girls and sexually molest several of them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"55\">\n<p id=\"b1143-8\">.

Proof of such intent was essential to the government\u2019s case against appellants on both the conspiracy and mail fraud counts. Lodge\u2019s defense at trial challenged the government\u2019s case on this issue by suggesting that Lodge was a passive recipient of the Tampa photos from Cross and that he never planned to process or market these pictures.

Cross has not challenged on appeal Lanning\u2019s qualifications as an expert on pedophilia.

Furthermore, his testimony regarding the obsession of pedophiles with exchanging stories and photographs with a network of others who share their sexual interest in children helped to explain the genesis and odd character of appellants\u2019 relationship, particularly the fact that they had cooperated in a complex, risky, criminal conspiracy although they had never met and knew little about one another.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"66\">\n<p id=\"b1146-7\">.

The decision in <em>Anderson, </em>involving a defendant charged with transporting minors for prostitution, is particularly applicable to this case. There too, expert testimony was presented to rebut the defendant\u2019s claim that his conduct was innocent rather than criminal. The court held that expert testimony regarding \"pimping patterns and the pimp-prostitute relationship,\u201d was properly admitted to assist the jury in evaluating the defendant\u2019s contention that he was \u201cmerely a gambler with a flashy lifestyle and a penchant for travel.\u201d <em>Id., </em>851 F.2d at 393.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"68\">\n<p id=\"b1147-7\">. <em>See </em>section V(B) of the court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"69\">\n<p id=\"b1147-8\">. Cross also complains that the district court failed to caution the jury against considering Lanning's testimony as evidence of Cross\u2019s bad character or disposition to commit the crimes charged. However, neither Cross nor Lodge ever requested such a limiting instruction, and the failure of the court to provide one, <em>sua sponte, </em>was not plain error. <em>See Burchfield, </em>719 F.2d at 358. <em>See also United States v.

Read in context, Lanning mentioned \"molestation\" only as an example of criminal conduct, and never alleged or implied that Cross was accused of physically abusing children. Such a brief, non-suggestive reference was itself hardly damaging to Cross, and the trial court\u2019s failure to order the jury to disregard it was not plain error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"70\">\n<p id=\"b1147-16\">.

Here, it was sufficient that the district court admitted these and other statements by Diwan and Lodge on the government's assurance that they would be connected to a conspiracy, and that the court ruled at the close of the government\u2019s case that the evidence was admissible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"72\">\n<p id=\"b1148-8\">. Although Cross does not object to other statements by Diwan, introduced by the government in the <em>form of </em>hearsay through the testimony of parents of the Tampa models, we note that such evidence, in contrast, was properly admitted. Diwan communicated with the parents while masquerading as an assistant to Cross\u2019s film project and for the purpose of obtaining nude photographs of the models. The government provided ample evidence of her participation in the conspiracy, and also proved that she made these statements to the parents in furtherance of the conspiracy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"73\">\n<p id=\"b1148-11\">. \u201cFactors to consider\u201d in determining whether the error was \"harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\" include \"the importance of the evidence to the prosecution, whether the evidence was cumulative, and the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case.\" <em>Turner, </em>871 F.2d at 1582. <em>See also Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. at 684, 106 S.Ct. at 1438.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"74\">\n<p id=\"b1149-10\">. Cross cites a purported August 1987 letter by Mumpower, sent to Diwan\u2019s attorney and the district judge, in which he threatens to \"consider full recantation of all testimony given in the cause of U.S. v. Eric Cross,\u201d unless government officials improve the conditions of his confinement. Cross has also submitted with his reply brief a copy of an affidavit by another inmate, who claims Mumpower admitted to perjuring himself at Cross\u2019s trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"75\">\n<p id=\"b1149-11\">. Rule 33 provides that a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence must be made no later than two years after final judgment. Cross was sentenced on May 16, 1986 and, therefore, would have had to file his motion no later than May 16, 1988. Although Cross\u2019s appeal was pending during this period, he was free to move this court to remand his case back to the district court to enable him to file his new trial motion. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 33; <em>United States v. Khoury, </em>901 F.2d 975, 976, <em>modified on denial of reh'g, </em>910 F.2d 713 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"76\">\n<p id=\"b1149-13\">. Neither of the documents on which Cross relies \u2014 the letter from Mumpower and the other prisoner's affidavit \u2014 are part of the record on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"77\">\n<p id=\"b1149-14\">. Cross filed a pre-trial motion to dismiss the indictment on these grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"78\">\n<p id=\"b1150-8\">. The district court heard oral argument from Cross and the government on this issue. Although the court denied Cross's request that an evidentiary hearing be held to allow his standby counsel to testify that the witness list was sealed when it was filed, we have, in deciding this claim, accepted Cross\u2019s allegation that the witness list was filed in a sealed condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"79\">\n<p id=\"b1150-9\">. Before she fled the country, Diwan testified regarding her concerns that her attorney was colluding with the prosecution at a hearing on her request to be appointed new counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"80\">\n<p id=\"b1150-10\">. Cross complains that the district court failed to order that cassette tapes contained in Diwan\u2019s bank safety deposit box be turned over to the court. He claimed that the tapes were a recording of the conversation in which Diwan\u2019s attorney told her to consider absconding. Cross furnished the district court with a transcript of the alleged conversation, which the court refused to consider on grounds of lack of authentication and Diwan\u2019s attorney-client privilege, but which was made part of the record for appellate review. Because we have taken into account the contents of the transcript in determining that there was no proof of government misconduct, we need not address Cross\u2019s argument that the district court erred in failing to subpoena the tapes.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
