United States, </em>11 CIT 344, 662 F.Supp. 258 (1987), upholding the determination of the International Trade Administration (ITA or agency) that unprocessed float glass from Mexico was not subject to countervailing duties under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1303(a) (1982) by reason of certain programs instituted by the government of Mexico, namely, the Trust Fund for the Coverage of Exchange Risks (FI-CORCA) and the sale of natural gas at controlled prices. The trial court concluded that the administrative record did not establish that the benefit from these programs constituted a \u201cbounty or grant\u201d within the meaning of section 1303(a) as a matter of law or fact. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1666-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1666-9\">The issue in this appeal broadly concerns what type of domestic subsidy received by a foreign producer from its government gives rise to a countervailing duty under 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1303 upon importation of its goods into the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The goods in question, \u201cfloat glass,\u201d a type of flat glass, were imported from Mexico during the period January 1 to September 30, 1983. <em>See Unprocessed Float Glass From Mexico, </em>48 Fed.Reg. 56095 (Dec. 19,1983) (Preliminary Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination). In pertinent part, Section 1303 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1666-14\">[Wjhenever any country ... shall pay or bestow, directly or indirectly, any bounty or grant upon the manufacture or production or export of any article or merchandise produced in such country, then upon the importation of such article or merchandise into the United States, there shall be levied and paid, in all such cases, in addition to any duties otherwise imposed, a duty equal to the net amount of such bounty or grant____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1666-15\">Under this part of the statute the question would be phrased in terms of what is a \u201cbounty or grant.\u201d However, because of the interrelationship of section 1303 and 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the following provision of section 1677(5) is also pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1666-16\">The term \u201csubsidy\u201d has the same meaning as the term \u201cbounty or grant\u201d as that term is used in section 1303 of this title, and includes, but is not limited to, the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1666-17\">(A) Any export subsidy described in Annex A to the Agreement (relating to illustrative list of export subsidies).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1666-18\">(B) The following domestic subsidies, if provided or required by government action to a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries, whether publicly or privately owned, and whether paid or bestowed directly or indirectly on the manufacture, production, or export of any class or kind of merchandise:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1571\">*1571</page-number>(i) The provision of capital, loans, or loan guarantees on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1667-5\">(ii) The provision of goods or services at preferential rates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1667-6\">(iii) The grant of fund or forgiveness of debt to cover operating losses sustained by a specific industry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1667-7\">(iv) The assumption of any costs or expenses of manufacture, production, or distribution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1667-8\">19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677(5) (1982).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> From this provision it becomes clear that the countervailing duty statute contemplates two types of subsidies which give rise to additional duties: (1) export subsidies, that is, a benefit conferred only on goods that are exported, all of which are countervailable unless <em>de minimis, </em>and (2) domestic subsidies which may or may not be countervailable. With respect to the latter type of subsidy, the ITA has interpreted the statute to require that a domestic subsidy must be provided to a \u201cspecific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries\u201d to be countervailable. <em>See Certain Steel Products From Belgium, </em>47 Fed.Reg. 39304, 39328 (1982) (Appendix 4). Under this standard, the FICORCA program and Natural Gas pricing policies established by the Mexican government did not constitute, per ITA, a countervailable \u201cbounty or grant\u201d within the purview of Section 1303 because they were not directed by their terms to the float glass industry or a group of specific industries nor, in actual implementation, did the programs in fact bestow a benefit on a <em>specific </em>industry or group.</p>\n<p id=\"b1667-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1667-10\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1667-11\">The Supreme Court has instructed that the courts must defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute an agency has been charged with administering provided its interpretation is a reasonable one. As the Supreme Court has succinctly stated: \u201cWhen faced with a problem of statutory construction, this Court shows great deference to the interpretation given the statute by the officers or agency charged with its administration.\u201d <em>Udall v. Tallman, </em>380 U.S. 1, 16, 85 S.Ct. 792, 801, 13 L.Ed.2d 616 (1965); <em>accord K Mart v. Cartier, Inc., </em>486 U.S. 281, 291, 108 S.Ct. 1811, 1817, 100 L.Ed.2d 313 (1988); <em>United States v.

Cir.1985) (\u201cTo sustain an agency's construction of its authority, we need not find that its construction is the only reasonable one, or even that it is the result we would have reached had the question arisen in the first instance in judicial proceedings.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 854, 107 S.Ct. 190, 93 L.Ed.2d 123 (1986); <em>Corning Glass Works v. United States Int\u2019lkTrade Comm\u2019n, </em>799 F.2d 1559, 1565 (Fed.Cir.1986). Moreover, the Secretary of Commerce through the ITA has been given great discretion in administering the countervailing duty laws. As we noted in <em>Smith Corona Group v. United States, </em>713 F.2d 1568, 1571 (Fed. Cir.1983) in discussing the Secretary\u2019s comparable authority under the antidumping law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1667-14\">The Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, establishes an intricate framework for the imposition of antidumping duties in appropriate circumstances. The number of factors involved, complicated by the difficulty in quantification of these factors and the foreign policy repercussions of a dumping determination, makes the enforcement of the antidumping law a difficult and supremely delicate endeavor. The Secretary of Commerce ... has been entrusted with responsibility for imple-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1572\">*1572</page-number>meriting the antidumping law. The Secretary has broad discretion in executing the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1668-4\">These considerations are equally applicable to administration of the countervailing duty statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As this court\u2019s predecessor has repeatedly opined, countervailing duty determinations involve complex economic and foreign policy decisions of a delicate nature, for which the courts are woefully ill-equipped. <em>United States v.

PPG\u2019s efforts have been unsuccessful.</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-7\">Requirement of Specificity</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-8\">PPG first mounts a broadside attack on ITA\u2019s interpretation that a domestic subsidy must benefit a specific industry or group for such subsidy to constitute a \u201cbounty or grant\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1303. Per PPG, the legal test for determining whether a benefit is a \u201cbounty or grant\u201d for countervailing duty purposes is whether \u201cthat benefit allows goods to be sold for less in the United States than would otherwise be possible.\u201d PPG contends that the ITA\u2019s specificity test goes against (1) the language of the statute, (2) longstanding judicial definitions of \u201cbounty or grant\u201d, and (3) the Congressional purpose behind the countervailing duty statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-10\">PPG urges that the broad language used in Sections 1303 and 1677(5) requires the term \u201cbounty or grant\u201d to be interpreted, as a matter of law, as broadly as possible. In section 1303, PPG points to the word \u201cany\u201d preceding \u201cbounty or grant\u201d, the reference to \u201cdirect or indirect\u201d bounties or grants, the phrase \u201cpaid or bestowed\u201d, and the inclusion of benefits whether \u201con production, manufacture or export.\u201d In section 1677(5), the salient language, per PPG, is \u201cbut is not limited to,\u201d which precedes the enumerated examples of benefits which may constitute a \u201csubsidy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-11\">This language itself, individually or collectively, does not compel a definition of \u201cbounty or grant\u201d as all encompassing of domestic subsidies as PPG seeks. As interpreted by the ITA, the broad term \u201cdomestic subsidy\u201d is limited by the language of section 1677(5)(B) in that such subsidy is countervailable only if provided by the foreign government to a \u201cspecific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries.\u201d In the ITA\u2019s view, this limitation in the statute would be made superfluous by an interpretation that every domestic subsidy on imported goods which confers a competitive advantage vis-a-vis U.S. competitors is a countervailable \u201cbounty or grant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-13\">In this connection, in <em>ASG Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>610 F.2d 770, 67 CCPA 11 (1979), our predecessor court dealt with certain benefits under West German regional development programs, which the ITA rejected as countervailable even though directed to a \u201cspecific\u201d group of industries because the benefits did not have the requisite effect on international trade. While holding such benefits to be countervailable if more than <em>de minimis, </em>the court in <em>ASG </em>emphatically rejected ASG\u2019s test that \u201cany benefit (that is not <em>de minimis) </em>bestowed by a foreign government in connection with the production of merchandise requires a countervailing duty.\u201d <em>ASG, </em>610 F.2d at 777. The <em>ASG </em>court held that this test, which is the same as PPG\u2019s proposed test, <em>\u201cignores </em>the clear wording of the statute____ [A]ll relevant circumstances are to be taken into account.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(Emphasis added.) When the statute is read as a whole, a \u201cspecificity\u201d requirement is neither precluded nor unreasonable as a matter of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-16\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1669-17\">PPG next argues that its broad interpretation of \u201cbounty or grant\u201d is required in order to be in line with longstanding judicial precedent. According to PPG, the courts (including the Supreme Court) \u201chave consistently defined \u2018bounty or grant\u2019 and \u2018subsidy\u2019 in terms of the effect of foreign government programs on the ability of foreign producers to sell their products for less in the U.S.\u201d For this proposition, appellant quotes statements from <em>Downs v. United States, </em>187 U.S. 496, 23 S.Ct. 222, 47 L.Ed. 275 (1903); <em>G.S. Nicholas &amp; Co. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1574\">*1574</page-number><em>United States, </em>249 U.S. 34, 39 S.Ct. 218, 63 L.Ed. 461 (1919); <em>United States v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>437 U.S. 443, 98 S.Ct. 2441, 57 L.Ed.2d 337 (1978); the aforementioned <em>ASG Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>610 F.2d 770, 67 CCPA 11 (1979); <em>Georgetown Steel Corp. v. United States, </em>801 F.2d 1308 (Fed.Cir.1986) and from various lower court opinions in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b1670-4\">These authorities do not present, as PPG asserts, a bulwark of historical judicial precedent defining \u201cbounty or grant\u201d so as to preclude a requirement of beneficial \u201cspecificity\u201d for <em>domestic </em>subsidies. The passages cited by PPG amount simply to isolated, broad statements taken out of context with reference to a different version of the statute in some instances and without reference to the actual benefit considered in the particular case. In <em>Downs, </em>for example, the Supreme Court held that a remission <em>on exportation </em>by the Russian government of a tax imposed on sugar through the issuance of saleable certificates was an indirect bounty. In that case, the benefit was an export bounty, not a <em>domestic </em>subsidy of the sugar industry.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Likewise, <em>Nicholas </em>involved the payment by the British government of allowances upon exportation of certain British spirits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1670-5\">It is surprising that PPG can find support in <em>Zenith Radio Corp. </em>for its advocacy of a sweeping inclusion of all competitive benefits under the rubric of \u201cbounty or grant.\u201d There, the Secretary of Treasury (who then administered this statute), in in-terpretating the very language at issue here, held that the remission of an indirect tax on electronic products upon export <em>was not a </em>\u201cbounty or grant\u201d within the meaning of the statute. In affirming, the Court held the interpretation by the Secretary to be reasonable, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1670-6\">More fundamentally, as the Senate Committee with responsibility in this area recently stated, \u201c \u2018the issues involved in applying the countervailing duty law are complex, and ... internationally, there is [a] lack of any satisfactory agreement on what constitutes a fair, as opposed to an \u201cunfair,\u201d subsidy.\u2019\u201d S.Rep. No. 93-1298, p. 183 (1974). In this situation, it is not the task of the judiciary to substitute its views as to fairness and economic effect for those of the Secretary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqM4\"><em>Zenith Radio Corp., </em>437 U.S. at 458-59, 98 S.Ct. at 2449. Finally, <em>ASG, </em>discussed above, and <em>Georgetown Steel, </em>801 F.2d 1308 (Fed.Cir.1986), which held nonmarket economies to be outside the purview of countervailing duty laws, did not discuss the specificity test, much less rule it out.</p>\n<p id=\"b1670-9\">In sum, the statutory term \u201cbounty or grant\u201d has not been <em>defined, </em>as a matter of law, by the courts to encompass <em>every domestic subsidy conferring a competitive advantage </em>and, thus, does not mandatorily prohibit the limitation of countervailable domestic subsidies in the present statute to benefits provided only to a specific industry or group of industries.</p>\n<p id=\"b1670-10\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b1670-11\">PPG urges that ITA\u2019s interpretation of the law is contrary to the intent of Congress that the countervailing duty law neutralize all subsidies that allow foreign goods to be sold for less in the United States. PPG discerns this single overriding congressional purpose from a consistent historical pattern of expansion of the reach of the countervailing duty laws by legislative enactments. While a review of the history of legislation regarding the countervailing duty laws does evidence the intent of Congress to broaden the reach of these laws, at the same time, Congress has effectuated such intent incrementally by the specific language chosen in each enactment, and each enactment pertained to specific situations as detailed therein. As an example, after the general \u201cbounty or grant\u201d language was added in 1897 to the original enactment which only affected export bounties on sugar, the law was expanded in 1909 to cover any governmental unit of a country. <em>See </em>Tariff Act of 1909, Pub.L. No. 61-5, ch. 6 \u00a7 6, 36 Stat. 11, 85 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1575\">*1575</page-number>(1909). Later, in 1921 the statute was amended to include as eountervailable bounties or grants bestowed on the <em>manufacture </em>of an exported product rather than solely by reason of the act of exportation, for the first time bringing domestic subsidies into the law. <em>See </em>Tariff Act of 1922, Pub.L. No. 67-318, Title III \u00a7 303, 42 Stat. 935; <em>Subsidies, </em>18 Geo.Wash.Int\u2019l J. of Law &amp; Economics at 302-3. The next change noted by PPG occurred in 1974 when Congress delineated specific procedures to be followed in the conduct of a countervailing duty investigation, in particular setting time limits and providing U.S. industries the right to obtain judicial review of duty determinations. <em>See </em>Trade Act of 1974, Pub.L. No. 93-618 \u00a7 331, 88 Stat. 1978, 2049-53. And finally, the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 was enacted to conform the U.S. countervailing duty law to the requirements of GATT. <em>See supra, </em>n. 2. In this enactment, Congress added Section 1677(5), wherein the language \u201cspecific enterprises or industries, or group of enterprises or industries\u201d used by the ITA in determining whether a domestic subsidy is a \u201cbounty or grant\u201d is found. None of these enactments mandates that the terms \u201cbounty or grant\u201d must encompass every subsidy provided by the government to industries within that country.</p>\n<p id=\"b1671-4\">As appellant has acknowledged in its briefs, Section 1677(5) was enacted to conform U.S. countervailing duty law to the GATT Subsidies Code.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The GATT Subsidies Code contains the specific statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aql7\">Signatories recognize that subsidies other than export subsidies are widely used as important instruments for the promotion of social and economic policy objectives and <em>do not intend to restrict the right of signatories to use such subsidies </em>to achieve these and other important objectives which they consider desirable. [Subsidies Code, art. 11, para 1, emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1671-7\">PPG\u2019s definition of \u201cbounty or grant,\u201d as applied to domestic subsidies, would override the narrower definition of \u201cdomestic subsidy\u201d in section 1677(5) and to a large extent would nullify the Congressional purpose of conforming our law with GATT.</p>\n<p id=\"b1671-8\">The view that these complicated statutes have only one purpose, namely, to protect U.S. industry from every competitive advantage afforded by foreign governments, is simplistic and myopic. The congressional debates and the objectives listed in the GATT Subsidies Code indicate that numerous public policies, some of which conflict with overcoming a competitive advantage, entered into enactment of these statutes and must be considered by ITA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1671-9\">The GATT Subsidies Code specifically states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1671-10\">Signatories note that among such objectives are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1671-11\">(a) the elimination of industrial, economic and social disadvantages of specific regions,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1671-12\">(b) to facilitate the restructuring, under socially acceptable conditions, of certain sectors, especially where this has become necessary by reason of changes in trade and economic policies, including international agreements resulting in lower barriers to trade,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1671-13\">(c) generally to sustain employment and to encourage re-training and change in employment,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1671-14\">(d) to encourage research and development programmes, especially in the field of high-technology industries,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1671-15\">(e) the implementation of economic programmes and policies to promote the economic and social development of developing countries,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1671-16\">(f) redeployment of industry in order to avoid congestion and environmental problems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1672-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1576\">*1576</page-number>Subsidies Code, art. 11, para. 1. The broad brush single purpose approach PPG advocates does not accord with the multi-pur-pose objectives set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b1672-4\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b1672-5\">Finally, as a reason to prohibit the ITA\u2019s specificity test, PPG argues that such a test yields the \u201cabsurd\u201d result that the more widely a domestic subsidy is available and the more products that benefit from it, the less likely it would be that the subsidy would be countervailable. That is essentially the policy argument which has flared from time to time in Congress and it remains a policy choice for Congress in the first instance, not the courts. When some members of Congress in 1984 sought to make natural resource subsidies counter-vailable <em>per se </em>where an industry was a disproportionate user, the legislation failed to be enacted. Indeed, the limited scope of that proposed legislation undercuts PPG\u2019s argument that the ITA is now precluded under the statute from requiring specificity in connection with any type of domestic subsidy. Had the legislation been enacted, it would not have affected application of a specificity test in general, for example in connection with FICORCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1672-6\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b1672-7\">In sum, the ITA\u2019s interpretation of section 1303 is reasonable that domestic subsidies must be bestowed only on a specific enterprise or industry or a specific group of enterprises or industries to be counter-vailable. Therefore, the ITA\u2019s interpretation must be upheld by the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1672-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1672-9\">Accepting that \u201cspecificity\u201d is a requirement for countervailability of a domestic subsidy, PPG argues that the requirement of specificity must be deemed met \u2014 as a matter of law \u2014 if the recipients of the subsidy are simply \u201cidentifiable.\u201d That is, if a company or companies which receive benefits can be named, they would be \u201cidentifiable\u201d and \u201cspecific.\u201d While PPG asserts this argument primarily in connection with FICORCA which has fewer participants than the natural gas pricing program, no reason is given for excluding the latter. It would appear that industrial customers of natural gas from the state monopoly could also be identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b1672-11\">ITA does not follow PPG\u2019S specificity test. The ITA\u2019s specificity test is two-fold. If the domestic subsidy is provided by its terms to a particular enterprise or industry or group of enterprises or industries, it is countervailable without further inquiry. If the benefit appears by its terms to be nominally generally available to all industries, the benefit may nevertheless be countervailable if, <em>in its application, </em>the program results in a subsidy only to a specific enterprise or industry or specific group of enterprises or industries. <em>See </em>1 <em>Commerce Department Speaks on Import and Export Administration, 1984 </em>at 319, 476-77 n. 26; <em>see, e.g., Anhydrous and Aqua Ammonia from Mexico, </em>48 Fed.Reg. 28523 (June 22, 1983) (Final Negative Countervailing Duty Determination); <em>Certain Softwood Products from Canada, </em>48 Fed.Reg. 24159 (May 31, 1983) (Final Negative Countervailing Duty Determination); <em>Certain Steel Products From the Netherlands, </em>47 Fed. Reg. 26335, 26336 (June 17, 1982) (Preliminary Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination). As the ITA recently summarized its position:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1672-12\">Based on our six years of experience in administering the law, we have found thus far that the specificity test cannot be reduced to a precise mathematical formula. Instead, we must exercise judgment and balance various factors in analyzing the facts of a particular case in order to determine whether an \u201cunfair\u201d practice is taking place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1672-13\">Among the factors we consider are: (1) the extent to which a foreign government acts to limit the availability of a program; (2) the number of enterprises, industries, or groups thereof which actually use a program, which may include the examination of disproportionate or dominant users; and (3) the extent to which the government exercises discretion in making the program available. The Department must consider all of these factors in light of the evidence on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1577\">*1577</page-number>the record in determining the specificity-in a given case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1673-5\"><em>Certain Softwood Lumber Products from Canada, </em>51 Fed.Reg. 37453 (1986). <em>See also Countervailing Duties: Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, </em>54 Fed.Reg. 23366, 23379 (May 31, 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1673-6\">This standard is in accord with the decision of the Court of International Trade involving an investigation into imports of carbon black from Mexico, authored by Judge Carman, in <em>Cabot Corp. v. United States, </em>9 CIT 489, 620 F.Supp. 722 (1985) <em>dismissed as unappealable, </em>788 F.2d 1539 (Fed.Cir.1986); <em>see also Cabot Corp. v. United States, </em>694 F.Supp. 949 (Ct.Int\u2019l Trade 1988) (Carman, J.); <em>PPG Indus., </em>662 F.Supp. at 264 (Carman, J.); <em>Alberta Pork Producers\u2019 Marketing Bd. v. United States, </em>11 CIT 563, 669 F.Supp. 445 (1987); <em>Can-Am Corp. v. United States, </em>11 CIT 424, 664 F.Supp. 1444 (1987). As explained in <em>Cabot, </em>620 F.Supp. at 732, application of the <em>de facto </em>aspect of the specificity test requires a \u201ccase by case\u201d analysis to determine whether \u201cthere has been a bestowal upon a specific class.\u201d Judge Carman restated the <em>Cabot </em>specificity test in this case in terms of inquiring into \u201cwhether there is a discrete class of beneficiaries\u201d noting that in <em>Cabot</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1673-7\">[t]he record established that no enterprise or industry in Mexico other than the carbon black industry had the technology or ability to make commercial use of the [subsidized carbon black feedstock]. Thus, although the favorable price for carbon black feedstock was nominally available to <em>all </em>Mexican enterprises and industries, it appeared that the program actually conferred a benefit upon a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1673-8\"><em>PPG Indus., </em>662 F.Supp. at 266 and n. 5 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1673-9\">PPG does not contend that either FI-CORCA or the natural gas program confers a benefit <em>de facto </em>on the float glass industry as a discrete, selective or targeted class comparable to the class identified as possible <em>de facto </em>sole recipients of the carbon black feedstock subsidy in <em>Cabot. </em>While PPG asserts it meets a specificity test, PPG seeks reversal not as a matter of fact but law; PPG simply wants a <em>different defacto </em>test based merely on the recipients of the subsidy being identifiable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1673-11\">Nothing in the statute mandates PPG\u2019s interpretation that specificity is met merely if recipients of a domestic subsidy are <em>identifiable. </em>Moreover, given the policy choice involved in adopting PPG\u2019s interpretation, this is a matter on which a court must defer to the agency. Thus, this argument does not require reversal. The statute does not mandate that \u201cspecific\u201d means no more than \u201cidentifiable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1673-12\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1673-13\">Falling back to an even narrower position, PPG asserts that the FICORCA and natural gas subsidy programs fit within the ITA\u2019s specificity standard. At this point, review of the details of these programs is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1673-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1673-15\">FICORCA is a trust fund for the coverage of risks provided by the government of Mexico to industries on an eligibility basis. In its original petition to initiate an investigation, PPG argued to the ITA that the Mexican float glass producers were eligible for this program; that the program guarantees the rate at which debt- or companies buy foreign exchange to pay extended debt; and that program participation in FICORCA by the eligible float glass industry made such products subject to countervailing duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1673-16\">As a result of its investigation, the ITA found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1673-17\">FICORCA is a trust fund set up by the Mexican government and the Bank of Mexico operating through the country\u2019s credit institutions. All Mexican firms with registered debt in foreign currency and payable abroad to Mexican credit institutions or to foreign financial entities or suppliers may purchase, at a controlled rate, the amount in dollars necessary to pay principal on the loan. All loans which are covered by the program must be long-term or be restructured on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1578\">*1578</page-number>a long-term basis. The program was terminated December 20, 1982. Companies had until October 25, 1983 to register for the program. We verified that the float glass companies did not have any rescheduling of debt during our period of investigation. The float glass companies have not used the program. We also have verified documentation that the program is available to all Mexican firms with foreign indebtedness; it is not targeted to a specific industry or enterprise, groups of industries or enterprises, or to companies located in specific regions. FICORCA is also not tied in any way to exports.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1674-4\"><em>Float Glass From Mexico, </em>49 Fed.Reg. at 23099. On that basis, the ITA determined that the FICORCA program was not countervailable. <em>Id. </em>PPG attacks this conclusion because the program contains certain \u201celigibility requirements\u201d, which per PPG, limits the group and makes it \u201cspecific.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1674-5\">The trial court is correct that the existence of eligibility requirements does not suffice to identify a discreet class which has been afforded the benefits of a \u201cbounty or grant.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Carlisle Tire and Rubber Co. v. United States, </em>5 CIT 229, 564 F.Supp. 834, 836 n. 3 (1983) (Tax benefit not countervailable where not every company can meet eligibility criteria). Although eligibility requirements may, if sufficiently narrowly tailored, <em>de facto </em>render the benefit one targeted to a specific industry or group of industries, the Court of International Trade and the ITA both determined that these eligibility requirements did not present such a case. <em>See PPG Indus., </em>662 F.Supp. at 266; <em>Float Glass From Mexico, </em>49 Fed.Reg. at 23099. PPG\u2019s arguments are unpersuasive that ITA\u2019s application of the specificity standard to FICORCA is unsupported by substantial evidence or otherwise not in accordance with law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1674-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1674-7\">Natural Gas Pricing Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b1674-8\">The Mexican government holds a monopoly on the sale of basic fuels in Mexico. Operating through a state-owned facility, Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos (PEMEX), Mexico sells natural gas produced in Mexico at controlled prices. There are two categories of natural gas prices in Mexico, one for industrial use and a higher price for residential use. The prices set by the Mexican government for industrial users are well below the export price for Mexican natural gas and the world market price.</p>\n<p id=\"b1674-10\">Before the ITA and the Court of International Trade, PPG asserted that preferential discounted natural gas rates were given to the float glass industry as compared to other industries, thus bringing the subsidy under section 1677(5)(B)(ii). Upon investigation, the ITA found that the evidence was to the contrary, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1674-11\">We verified that the float glass companies paid the published price for natural gas which was available to all industries, and therefore received no benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1674-14\"><em>Float Glass From Mexico, </em>49 Fed.Reg. at 23099. The trial court affirmed. <em>PPG Indus., </em>662 F.Supp. at 272. This issue is not raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1674-15\">In its reply brief, PPG appears to argue for the first time that the float glass industry is part of a larger specific group, that is, \u201cenergy-intensive\u201d industries, and that, therefore, it meets the specificity test. In this connection, it must be noted that this was not the first case to raise the issue of the countervailability of the Mexican natural gas program, in none of which was this domestic subsidy program countervailed. The basic determination with respect to the program was made in <em>Final Negative Countervailing Duty Determination on Anhydrous and Aqua Ammonia from Mexico. See </em>48 Fed.Reg. 28523 (June 22, 1983). Despite the \u201cenergy-intensive\u201d nature of that industry, the ITA ruled that the Mexican subsidization of natural gas was not countervailable. This conclusion was also reached in connection with <em>Portland Hydraulic Cement Clinker from Mexico. See </em>48 Fed.Reg. 43063 (Sept. 21, 1983) <em>(Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1674-16\">Indeed, ultimately the Mexican natural gas program was held by the ITA after remand to be noncountervailable in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1579\">*1579</page-number><em>Cabot </em>investigation where it was also at issue. This determination was affirmed by the court on June 7, 1989. <em>See Carbon Black From Mexico, </em>55 Fed.Reg. 5643 (February 16, 1990) (Amendment to Final Determination) and 51 Fed.Reg. 13269 (April 18, 1986) (Preliminary Determination) and citations therein. Because no additional information was provided by PPG to cause ITA to review its prior determination that the program was not countervaila-ble as a general proposition by reason of the differential in pricing between Mexican and foreign prices of natural gas, the ITA did not do so in this case and, therefore, limited its inquiry to the only other charge made by PPG, namely, that special discounts were afforded the float glass industry. <em>Float Glass From Mexico, </em>48 Fed. Reg. at 56095 (Dec. 19, 1983) (Preliminary Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination). Neither the ITA nor the court below discussed \u201cenergy-intensive\u201d as a category of \u201cspecific\u201d industries, inasmuch as it appears to be an argument raised only on appeal. Nevertheless, it also appears quite clear from ITA\u2019s prior determinations that ITA does not recognize \u201cenergy-intensive\u201d as a category of \u201cspecific\u201d industries. In the ammonia and cement investigations, the subsidized resources are reported to have accounted for <em>eighty </em>percent and <em>fifty </em>percent of cost, respectively. <em>See Subsidies, </em>18 Geo.Wash.J. of Int\u2019l Law &amp; Economics at 309-310. Here, energy is alleged to be 6.7 percent of production costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1675-5\">As previously noted, in response to ITA\u2019s uniform decisions that no countervailing duties resulted from the Mexican gas pricing policies, legislation was introduced and defeated which would have made subsidies for natural resources countervailable where certain requirements were met, such as substantial use. The debate on the issue showed greatly divergent views on whether this type of subsidy was \u201cunfair.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Yet this is exactly the question PPG now puts to this court to decide by judicial fiat. While the ITA might in its discretion have defined \u201cspecific\u201d to in-elude as a category, energy-intensive industries, perhaps with guidelines, it has not done so. Disproportionate use is, under the ITA\u2019s specificity standard, a factor to be considered but is not in and of itself controlling. <em>See supra </em>at 1576-77. In the absence of clear directions from Congress, it cannot be said that the ITA\u2019s failure to make \u201cenergy-intensive\u201d into a \u201cspecific\u201d group of industries within the meaning of section 1303 is unreasonable, much less an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1675-10\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b1675-11\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1675-12\">The decision of the Court of International Trade that the Mexican government FI-CORCA program and natural gas programs are not countervailable on imports of float glass is</p>\n<p id=\"b1675-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1675-14\">SMITH, Senior Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1666-12\">.

Indeed, ITA itself abandoned this misinterpretation five years ago after its \u201cgeneral availability test\u201d was rejected by the Court of International Trade (\u201cCIT\u201d) in <em>Cabot Corp. v. United States, </em>9 CIT 489, 620 F.Supp. 722 (1985). Ever since, both the administering agency and the specialized trade court have agreed that the former ITA interpretation was incorrect, as well as on what the correct test is. The CIT has remanded cases in which ITA applied its old interpretation. Finally, this old interpretation clearly contravenes Congressional purpose as expressed by Congress itself, which explicitly disap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1580\">*1580</page-number>proved it in 1988, while approving the new test ITA uses today.</p>\n<p id=\"b1676-4\">In this case, however, instead of exercising discretion to determine if the discount gas sales to the defendant float glass manufacturers constituted a bounty or grant by applying the correct test to the facts, ITA declined to investigate the relevant facts and simply defined the subsidy out of existence with its old, statutorily incorrect general availability test. Therefore, this is not an appeal that can properly be resolved by deference to agency discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1676-5\">While I believe this appeal is resolved with the wrong result, my greater concern is that this affirmance threatens to unsettle the law. Since this is our first decision in an appeal on the question, its unsettling effect may be compounded. Nor is concern lessened because there is no opinion of the court and hence no opinion with prece-dential force. Since Senior Judge Smith, while voting to affirm the CIT result, did not join in Chief Judge Nies\u2019 opinion, she speaks only for herself, just as I speak only for myself. This jurisprudential truth, however, likely will be lost when the bar reads and cites that opinion. After all, facts and reasons are described and a two-judge result is noted; together, they imply a precedential holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b1676-6\">The result here conflicts not only with the \u201cspecificity\u201d requirement of the 1979 statute as expressly and definitively construed by ITA and CIT, but also with the result in every <em>other </em>ITA investigation and CIT decision since 1985. It is a result based on an agency analysis that clearly did not measure the \u201ccase by case effect of benefits provided to recipients\u201d \u2014 here, the discount natural gas sales \u2014 as <em>Cabot </em>and the other authorities explicitly require. <em>See </em>620 F.Supp. at 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b1676-7\">On the contrary, ITA applied <em>only </em>a \u201cgeneral availability\u201d of benefits test, which Chief Judge Nies agrees is statutorily incorrect. Although there is a suggestion it relied on a \u201cnominal general availability\u201d analysis, clearly, ITA relied <em>only </em>on price, determining it was the same for all. That is the very definition of a generally available benefit. Nominal availability was never an issue in this case as all other industries not only can but actually do buy the discount gas at the uniform, published price. Nor, in any event, has the <em>Cabot </em>test been limited by CIT to piercing <em>nominal </em>general availability. Certainly, Judge Carman in <em>PPG Industries </em>itself does not rely on any such limitation, as he did, properly, in <em>Cabot </em>where only three companies could even use the heavy fuel nominally available to all companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1676-9\">Similarly, there is a suggestion that this case presents the dichotomy between <em>de jure </em>and <em>de facto </em>analysis. Since under the program the gas sales are made to all industries, however, this case involves only <em>de facto </em>analysis. The true issue here is not whether <em>de facto </em>analysis is required but what such a case by case analysis includes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1676-10\">The CIT has answered that question. However, by affirming in this appeal, our court weakens a six-year consistent line of CIT cases, starting with <em>Cabot, </em>to which <em>PPG Industries </em>is the sole exception. These cases hold that ITA must look beyond general availability and must assess the \u201ceffect of benefits\u201d on the \u201crecipients\u201d on a \u201ccase by case\u201d basis, particularly whether the subsidies disproportionately benefit a foreign company or industry compared to others there, thereby creating a significant \u201ccompetitive advantage\u201d over companies here. The mandate of <em>Cabot </em>is clear: ITA is required to undertake a factual investigation comparing the <em>effects </em>of the benefit on the foreign party named in the petition with those on other recipients of the same subsidy. <em>Cabot, </em>620 F.Supp. at 732 (\u201cThe appropriate standard focuses on the <em>de facto </em>case by case effect of benefits.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1676-11\">The logic of this reasoning is undeniable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1676-12\">Even in <em>PPG Industries, </em>the sole aberration, the CIT (Carman, J.) started from the same premise, <em>i.e., </em>that to avoid</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEZz\">the absurdity of a rule that transforms an obvious bounty into a non-countervail-able benefit by making the program \u201cgenerally available\u201d ... the appropriate standard [must focus] on the <em>de facto case by case effect of benefits provided </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1581\">*1581</page-number><em>to recipients </em>rather than on the nominal availability of benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1677-4\"><em>PPG Indus., Inc. v. United States, </em>11 CIT 344, 662 F.Supp. 258, 265 (1987) (quoting <em>Cabot Corp., </em>620 F.Supp. at 732) (emphasis added in part). As a result, at least where, as here, benefits are not just nominally available to but are actually received by many, other factors must be considered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1677-5\">Although general availability may be a manifestation that a program has not conferred a benefit upon a specific recipient, <em>general availability is not the statutory test. </em>It is merely one of <em>several relevant factors </em>to be considered in determining <em>whether or not a benefit or competitive advantage has been conferred </em>upon a \u201cspecific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1677-6\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted) (emphasis added). This multi-factor test, based on <em>Cabot, </em>also written by Judge Carman, has been consistently followed by the CIT. <em>See, e.g., Roses, Inc. v. United States, </em>743 F.Supp. 870 (Ct.Int\u2019l Trade 1990); <em>Armco Inc. v. United States, </em>733 F.Supp. 1514 (Ct.Int\u2019l Trade 1990); <em>Comeau Seafoods Ltd. v. United States, </em>724 F.Supp. 1407 (Ct.Int\u2019l Trade 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b1677-7\">In <em>Cabot </em>itself, Judge Carman explained that even</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1677-8\"><em>generally available benefits, </em>when actually bestowed, may constitute specific grants <em>conferred upon specific identifiable entities, </em>which would be subject to countervailing duties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1677-9\"><em>Cabot, </em>620 F.Supp. at 731 (emphasis added in part). Gauging whether countervailable benefits are \u201cactually bestowed\u201d and \u201cgrants conferred\u201d requires first, an inquiry whether the benefits are \u201cspecific [and] quantifiable\u201d and can be traced to \u201cspecific identifiable entities,\u201d \u201cspecific industries\u201d or a \u201cspecific class.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 731-32. The <em>Cabot </em>test next requires \u201cdetermining if [the subsidy] amounts to an additional benefit or competitive advantage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 732. If so, the program likely is countervailable under the statute. <em>Id. </em>But none of these <em>Cabot </em>inquiries was made here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1677-11\">Nevertheless, the government argues that this test \u201chas always been applied [by ITA] in the same manner.\u201d Indeed, as ITA itself acknowledged in 1986 (post-Cabot) in <em>Certain Softwood Lumber Products from Canada, </em>51 Fed.Reg. 37453, 37456 (1986) (Preliminary Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination), it must conduct a <em>multi-factor </em>test of effects, which may include an examination, as PPG insists was necessary here, of disproportionate beneficiaries or dominant users. In 1989, ITA further acknowledged that in determining whether a domestic program was counter-vailable, consideration must be given to \u201cwhether certain enterprises, industries, or groups thereof receive disproportionately large benefits under a program.\u201d <em>Countervailing Duties, </em>54 Fed.Reg. 23366, 23379 (1989) (Proposed Rules). Answering that question can only require comparing the effects of the subsidy on one foreign company or class with those on another. Indeed, it is clear that in some cases a program may so disproportionately benefit a single company or class that on that factor alone, a countervailable subsidy could be found. Thus, in individual cases, disproportionate benefit can indeed be \u201cin and of itself controlling.\u201d In its 1984 final determination, on which this appeal is based, however, ITA explicitly failed to make such a comparison, or, indeed, to inquire beyond general availability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1677-12\">We verified that the float glass companies paid the published price for natural gas which was available to all industries, <em>and therefore </em>received no benefit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AkO\"><em>Unprocessed Float Glass From Mexico; Countervailing Duty Determination, </em>49 Fed.Reg. 23097, 23099-100 (1984) (emphasis added) (Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination). Thus, contrary to the government, this test has <em>not </em>\u201calways been applied in the same manner.\" In fact, before <em>Cabot </em>in 1985, it was never applied. This investigation was <em>pre-Cabot.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1677-13\">It is suggested that ITA needed only to investigate PPG\u2019s charge of preferential pricing and when that charge was shown to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1582\">*1582</page-number>be untrue, needed do nothing more. But PPG also charged that <em>published </em>price was a countervailable subsidy to these defendant float glass manufacturers as individual companies and also as members of a larger class. PPG then does <em>not </em>argue that the subsidy is countervailable \u201cbased merely on the recipients of the subsidy being identifiable.\u201d Thus PPG does indeed seek reversal as a matter of fact as well as law. Moreover, under the statute, PPG has no burden of proof. Therefore, once PPG\u2019s petition was accepted, ITA was obliged to investigate the facts that are relevant under the statutory test. Here, it declined to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1678-4\">Despite quoting Cabot\u2019s requirement that ITA assess the \u201ccase by case effect of benefits provided to recipients,\u201d <em>PPG Indus., </em>662 F.Supp. at 265, the CIT, in reviewing ITA\u2019s final determination in <em>PPG Industries, </em>concluded, illogically, that <em>\u201c[sjince </em>the ITA determined [that the float glass manufacturers] paid the <em>published price </em>for natural gas which was <em>available to all </em>industries, ... ITA\u2019s determination was in substantial accordance with the statutory standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 272 (emphasis added). Yet, Judge Carman himself says earlier in <em>PPG Industries </em>that general availability \u201cis <em>not </em>the statutory test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 265 (emphasis added). Thus, like Chief Judge Nies, Judge Carman addressed only the preferential pricing allegations of PPG\u2019s ITA petition and CIT complaint, while ignoring the allegation that sales to these defendants at the published price were themselves a countervailable subsidy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1678-5\">Nor may ITA properly rely in this case on its earlier determination in <em>Anhydrous and Aqua Ammonia from Mexico, </em>48 Fed. Reg. 28522 (1983) (Final Negative Countervailing Duty Determination). There, ITA determined that no countervailable subsidy existed <em>solely </em>on the ground that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1678-6\"><em>[sjince </em>all industrial users of natural gas can obtain this good <em>at the same price, </em>gas is not provided to a \u201cspecific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries\u201d under section 771(5)(B) of the Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1678-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 28524 (emphasis added). Thus, there too ITA plainly failed to look beyond general availability, but merely confirmed that the defendant manufacturers paid the same energy price as all other industries in Mexico. That analysis was as defective as this one and for the same reason: Instead of investigating, ITA defined the issue away. Nor, as the other opinion suggests, did PPG have some burden to come forward with \u201cadditional information ... to cause ITA to review\u201d its original determination that the natural gas program was \u201cnot countervailable as a general proposition,\u201d since that determination was based entirely on an incorrect statutory interpretation, and since PPG as petitioner has no burden to plead specific effects on defendants anyway. Similarly, PPG had no burden to prove that defendants were part of a \u201cclass\u201d of \u201cenergy-intensive\u201d industries, for it had alleged that these defendants, as individual enterprises, received a counter-vailable benefit. Nor was PPG required to somehow equate the defendant float glass manufacturers with <em>\u201cde facto </em>sole recipients\u201d in other countervailing duty cases. Under <em>Cabot, </em>all PPG was required to do was identify the company or class allegedly receiving the countervailable benefits. Whether or not, under a \u201ccase by case\u201d analysis, a class including defendants is \u201ccomparable\u201d (in size) with the three-company class in <em>Cabot </em>is irrelevant. Moreover, to reason, as the other opinion does, that ITA need not review a program because in a prior determination the program was found \u201cnot countervailable as a general proposition,\u201d clearly contravenes the rationale behind <em>Cabot\u2019s </em>\u201ccase by case\u201d requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1678-8\">Since ITA plainly did not apply to defendants here a \u201cspecificity analysis,\u201d measuring the \u201ccase by case effect of benefits provided to recipients,\u201d to affirm its determination is wrong as a matter of law. Moreover, our affirming the CIT\u2019s erroneous holding in <em>PPG Industries </em>undermines subsequent CIT holdings, which uniformly and correctly applied the <em>Cabot </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b1678-9\">For example, in <em>Roses, </em>Judge Restani specifically applied <em>Cabot </em>to overturn the ITA determination, holding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1583\">*1583</page-number>[T]he appropriate test in the current investigation should have been <em>whether a competitive advantage in fact was bestowed </em>on a specific enterprise or industry, or a group thereof, by the program at issue. Thus, the general availability rule under which ITA conducted the investigation was flawed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1679-5\"><em>Roses, </em>743 F.Supp. at 879 (emphasis added). Similarly, in <em>Armco, </em>the court, applying <em>Cabot, </em>reversed ITA\u2019s determination that a depreciation program was noncountervaila-ble because 'it was available to all industries depreciating similar assets. Such an analysis, the court explained, \u201cmisses the point\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1679-6\"><em>[I]f a particular benefit did constitute an unfair, countervailable subsidy when granted to a certain company or companies, </em>the fact that other companies were also eligible for the benefit, or even that other companies also utilized the benefit, would not, as the <em>Cabot </em>Court pointed out, change the fact that the benefit was unfair, and thus counter-vailable, when granted to the first company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1679-7\"><em>Armco, </em>733 F.Supp. at 1530 (emphasis added). To the same effect is <em>Comeau Seafoods Ltd., </em>724 F.Supp. at 1414 (\u201c[T]he test is a <em>de facto </em>case by case analysis of the benefits conferred.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1679-8\">What vitality will those and similar CIT decisions have in view of our court\u2019s result in <em>PPG Industries?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1679-9\">Finally, ITA\u2019s incorrect determination, based on a statutorily incorrect test, contravenes the clear intent of Congress, which has adopted the <em>Cabot </em>\u201ceffect of benefits\u201d test as reflective of its original intent. Congress amended section 1677(5)(B), originating in 1979, in the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, adding a \u201cSpecial Rule\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1679-10\">In applying subparagraph (A) [which includes the specificity language], the administering authority, in each investigation, shall determine whether the bounty, grant, or subsidy in law or in fact is provided to a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries. Nominal general availability, under the terms of the law, regulation, program, or rule establishing a bounty, grant, or subsidy, of the benefits thereunder is not a basis for determining that the bounty, grant, or subsidy <em>is not, or has not been, in fact provided to a specific enterprise or industry, or group thereof. </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1679-12\">The legislative history, moreover, clearly indicates that Congress explicitly endorsed the test required in the <em>Cabot </em>case, H.R. Rep. No. 40, Comm. on Ways and Means, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. (H.R.Rep.No. 40), at 123-24 (\u201cThis [amendment], in effect, codifies the finding of the [CIT] decided in <em>Cabot Corp. v. United </em>States____ The test ... is whether there is a sufficient <em>degree of competitive advantage </em>in international commerce being bestowed upon a discreet class of beneficiaries that would not exist <em>but for </em>government action.\u201d (emphasis added)). The purpose in enacting the Special Rule was not to change existing law, but to ensure that ITA properly applied the 1979 statute. According to the House Committee Report, ITA \u201chad been interpreting the concept of \u2018specificity\u2019 and \u2018general availability\u2019 in an unduly narrow manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 123. The <em>Cabot </em>test \u201cprovide^] a sound interpretive rule to be applied in those cases where broadly available benefits are at issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 124. The Special Rule, by endorsing the <em>Cabot </em>test, therefore, simply \u201cclarifies the application of the countervailing duty law to domestic subsidies.\u201d Conf.Rep. No. 576, Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. at 587. Thus, as of 1989, both Congress in its Special Rule and ITA in its Proposed Rule set forth the correct test, which is presently applied. But the correct test was not applied here, so our decision here needlessly casts doubt upon whether it is indeed correct or required.</p>\n<p id=\"b1679-15\">It is suggested that Congress, in adopting the clarifying Special Rule, only adopted a \u201cportion\u201d of <em>Cabot. </em>Nothing could be more clearly not so, as the above quotations demonstrate. It is also suggested that defeat in 1984 of an amendment to make natural energy subsidies <em>per se </em>countervailable proves that Congress\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1584\">*1584</page-number>intent in 1979 on specificity could not cover energy subsidies even when the facts of the case warrant. The illogic of equating a <em>per se </em>rule of countervailability and a fact-based discretionary rule needs no elaboration. In any event, in adopting the Special Rule, Congress explicitly envisioned it being used in situations where natural energy, natural gas in particular, was the generally available benefit in question. H.R. Rep. No. 40 at 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b1680-4\">Rather than upholding this incorrect determination, this court should insist that ITA apply the correct statutory test. Moreover, since the failure to assess the effects of these gas sales or look at anything more than general availability was clearly not harmless error, remand is our only proper course. Indeed, remand has been ordered in every CIT case where ITA had failed to apply the <em>Cabot </em>test, <em>except </em>in <em>PPG Industries. See, e.g., Roses, </em>743 F.Supp. at 881 (on remand, ITA cannot rely on \u201cits flawed \u2018general availability\u2019 test\u201d); <em>Armco, </em>733 F.Supp. at 1529-30 (remand necessary because ITA conducted only a general availability inquiry); <em>Cabot, </em>620 F.Supp. 722 (remand required for the same reasons). The result here should likewise be a remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1680-6\">At the very least, I would have hoped our decision would not have confused the correct interpretation of the specificity requirement. Regrettably, its clarification will have to await another day and perhaps another case.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
