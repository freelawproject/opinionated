Gordy and Mamie L. Kovac appeal from a summary judgment by the District Court for the Northern District of Alabama in favor of appellee, The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court based its ruling on a body of federal common law known as the <em>D\u2019Oench </em>doctrine, which protects FDIC and The Federal Savings &amp; Loan Insurance Corporation (\u201cFSLIC\u201d) from \u201cagreements\u201d between borrowers and banks which tend to misrepresent the value of a bank\u2019s assets.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We must decide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1560\">*1560</page-number>whether the court correctly determined that such agreements encompass a bank\u2019s warranty of the truth of its false financial statement, which was relied upon reasonably and in good faith by appellants in the course of negotiations culminating in their guaranteeing the notes presently sued upon. We also must decide whether the district court correctly determined that the bank\u2019s misrepresentation of its financial condition constituted fraud in the inducement, and not fraud in the factum, which would have rendered the guaranties void <em>ab initio </em>and thus provided FDIC, the bank\u2019s successor-in-interest, no basis for suit. Because we agree that the district court correctly decided these questions, its judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1656-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1656-5\">The relevant facts are not in dispute. In December of 1982, appellants commenced negotiations with Vernon Savings &amp; Loan Association, FSA (\u201cVernon\u201d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> in connection with appellants\u2019 plans to acquire and develop a hotel in Natchez, Mississippi. These negotiations culminated in a transaction whereby Natchez Hotel Properties, Inc. (\u201cNatchez Hotel\u201d) received funds for the acquisition and development of the hotel. The project was financed by industrial revenue bonds issued by the City of Natchez; the bond issuance closed on September 1, 1984. As part of the transaction, Vernon issued a letter of credit in favor of the indenture trustee, Merchants National Bank of Mobile. The letter, insured by Industrial Indemnity Company of California (\u201cIndustrial Indemnity\u201d), entitled the indenture trustee to make a demand on the letter of credit upon the occurrence of any event of default specified in the documents connected with the bond issue. One such specified event was the insolvency of Vernon. On March 31, 1985, appellants executed facially unqualified guarantees obligating them to pay $3,167,312 upon the occurrence of a default event specified in the bond closing documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b1656-9\">Vernon, it turned out, unknown to the appellants, was insolvent throughout the negotiations described above. On April 21, 1987, the indenture trustee, having learned of the insolvency, demanded payment of Vernon pursuant to its letter of credit obligation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Industrial Indemnity paid the amount demanded by the trustee and entered into a negotiated settlement with Vernon, which acquired the notes and underlying guaranties executed by appellants. Subsequently, FSLIC, as receiver for Vernon, made demands of Natchez Hotel for payment of the notes. Natchez Hotel defaulted. On November 29, 1988, FSLIC filed this suit against the appellants seeking payment of the amounts secured by the guaranties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1656-10\">In the district court, the appellants defended and counterclaimed against FSLIC on the basis of misrepresentations made by Vernon to the appellants during the course of the negotiations regarding the plans to acquire and develop the Natchez Hotel. At the heart of the misrepresentations was a written statement of Vernon\u2019s financial condition as of June 30,1984, which Vernon submitted for the use of all participants in the Natchez Hotel transaction. At a time when Vernon already was insolvent, the statement portrayed a sound financial condition. The truth of the statement was certified by an October 9, 1984 certificate signed by a vice-president of Vernon. The guaranties signed by appellants did not indicate that Vernon had certified the truth of its financial statement or that the truth thereof was a condition to appellants\u2019 fulfillment of their obligations under the facially unqualified guaranties.</p>\n<p id=\"b1657-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1561\">*1561</page-number>The parties eventually filed cross-motions for summary judgment. In an October 25, 1989 opinion, the district court identified the threshold issue with regard to the motions as whether Vernon\u2019s misrepresentation and concealment of its financial condition provide a basis for defendants\u2019 defense or counterclaims in light of the <em>D\u2019Oench </em>doctrine. Conceding fraud on the part of Vernon, its predecessor-in-interest, appellee argued that the doctrine precluded appellants from relying on Vernon\u2019s misrepresentations as a basis for a defense or counterclaim. Appellants argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that given their good faith and reasonableness, the misrepresentations did not constitute a \u201csecret agreement\u201d within the meaning of <em>D\u2019Oench, </em>and also that because Vernon\u2019s misrepresentations went to the essence of the guaranties, the guaranties were void <em>ab initio </em>and thus provided no basis for appellants\u2019 liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b1657-5\">In the October 25 opinion, the district court preliminarily granted appellee\u2019s summary judgment motion, accordingly denying those of appellants. The court rejected appellants\u2019 contention that Vernon\u2019s misrepresentations created a condition to their duty to pay under their guaranties and that this condition fell outside the scope of the <em>D\u2019Oench </em>doctrine: \u201c[T]he court finds no agreement which creates a condition to or qualification of defendants\u2019 obligation to pay on their guaranties____ There was no written agreement whereby defendants\u2019 duty to pay was so conditioned.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> October 25, 1989 Opinion at 14-15. The court also rejected appellants\u2019 argument that Vernon\u2019s misrepresentations constituted fraud in the factum. In a December 4, 1989 opinion, the court revisited the fraud in the factum issue before finalizing its ruling in favor of appellee: \u201cNo matter how gross or severe the alleged fraud may be, it did not relate to the nature, contents or terms of the guaranty agreements. At best, it was a mere inducement to their execution.\u201d December 4, 1989 Opinion at 2. Because voidable documents, unlike void documents, are capable of transfer, FSLIC had a basis for its suit. On April 25, 1990 the court issued a final judgment for appellee in the amount of $3,980,515 on the guaranties, including interest and attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1657-11\">Appellants appealed from this judgment on May 16, 1990 and now advance two arguments. First, they primarily contend that Vernon\u2019s misrepresentations constituted not fraud in the inducement, but fraud in the factum, thus taking the misrepresentations outside the <em>D\u2019Oench </em>doctrine\u2019s reach. Second,' appellants argue that the bank\u2019s misrepresentation of its financial condition does not fall within the doctrine because appellants acted reasonably and in good faith. We turn to these arguments after reviewing the relevant history of the <em>D\u2019Oench </em>doctrine and applying the Eleventh Circuit <em>D\u2019Oench </em>standard to the facts before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b1657-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1657-13\">A grant of summary judgment is subject to de novo review by this court. <em>Vernon v. Resolution Trust Corp., </em>907 F.2d 1101, 1104 (11th Cir.1990). Because the relevant facts are not in dispute, we must determine only whether FDIC is entitled as a matter of law to the summary judgment issued by the district court. <em>Id.; </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1657-14\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b1657-15\">The <em>D\u2019Oench </em>doctrine was created by the United States Supreme Court in <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme &amp; Co. v. FDIC, </em>315 U.S. 447, 62 5. Ct. 676, 86 L.Ed. 956 <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>315 U.S. 830, 62 S.Ct. 910, 86 L.Ed. 1224 (1942). FDIC had sued to collect on notes which had been executed with the understanding that they would never be called for pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1562\">*1562</page-number>ment. The guarantor defended by alleging failure of consideration, that is, that FDIC\u2019s predecessor-in-interest failed to perform a promise \u2014 not to call in the loan \u2014 that was a condition precedent to payment of the note. The Court held that this \u201csecret agreement\u201d could not be a defense to the FDIC suit because it would tend to deceive federal banking authorities who, given their responsibility to protect the fiscal stability of financial institutions, must be able to evaluate a given bank\u2019s true assets and commitments. The Court explained that the guarantor need not have been aware that the secret agreement was designed to mislead federal banking authorities. \u201cIt would be sufficient ... that the maker lent himself to a scheme or arrangement whereby the banking authority ... was or was likely to be misled.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 460, 62 S.Ct. at 681.</p>\n<p id=\"b1658-4\">The policy considerations leading to the development of the <em>D\u2019Oench </em>doctrine have resulted in its extension \u201cwell beyond [the] precise factual setting [found in <em>D\u2019Oench].\u201d Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. McCullough, </em>911 F.2d 593, 600, <em>en banc reh\u2019g denied, </em>920 F.2d 13 (11th Cir.1990). Most significantly, the Supreme Court has expanded the doctrine to encompass not only a \u201csecret arrangement\u201d such as that found in <em>D\u2019Oench, </em>but also \u201c[a] condition to payment of a note, including the truth of an express warranty.\u201d <em>Langley v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>484 U.S. 86, 96, 108 S.Ct. 396, 403, 98 L.Ed.2d 340 (1987). <em>Langley </em>involved the interpretation of 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1823(e),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the statutory counterpart of the <em>D\u2019Oench </em>doctrine. \u201c[C]ourts have referred to section 1823(e) and the cases interpreting it as guidelines for the application of the <em>D\u2019Oench </em>doctrine.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Vernon, </em>907 F.2d at 1105.</p>\n<p id=\"b1658-11\">In <em>Langley, </em>FDIC had sued to collect on a note guaranteed by defendants in order to purchase land. The defendants argued that FDIC\u2019s predecessor-in-interest had procured the note through misrepresentations overstating both the amount of land and the mineral acres in the land and falsely declaring the absence of outstanding mineral leases on the property. No references to these representations appeared in the documents executed by defendants, in the bank\u2019s records, or in the minutes of the bank\u2019s board of directors or loan committee. The question before the court was whether these representations constituted \u201cagreements\u201d within the meaning of section 1823(e). If the representations were agreements, they would be unavailable as a defense because they did not appear among the bank\u2019s documents. <em>Langley, </em>484 U.S. at 88-90, 108 S.Ct. at 399-401.</p>\n<p id=\"b1658-12\">The Supreme Court rejected the defendants' argument that the word \u201cagreement\u201d encompasses only an express promise to perform an act in the future, as in <em>D\u2019Oench, </em>and set out its reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1658-13\">As a matter of contractual analysis, the essence of petitioners\u2019 defense against the note is that the bank made certain warranties regarding the land, the truthfulness of which was a condition to performance of their obligation to repay the loan. As used in commercial and contract law, the term \u201cagreement\u201d often has \u201ca wider meaning than ... promise\u201d and embraces such a condition upon performance. The Uniform Commercial Code, for example, defines agreement as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1563\">*1563</page-number>\u201cthe bargain of the parties in fact as found in their language or by implication from other circumstances____\u201d Quite obviously, the parties\u2019 bargain cannot be reflected without including the conditions upon their performance, one of the two principal elements of which contracts are-constructed. It seems to us that this common meaning of the word \u201cagreement\u201d must be assigned to its usage in \u00a7 1823(e) if that section is to fulfill its intended purposes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1659-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 90-91, 108 S.Ct. at 401 (citations omitted). Accordingly, the Court held that \u201c[a] condition to payment of a note, including the truth of an express warranty, is part of the \u2018agreement\u2019 \u201d within the meaning of section 1823(e), <em>id. </em>at 96, 108 S.Ct. at 403, and by implication, within the meaning of the <em>D\u2019Oench </em>doctrine. As the Court explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1659-9\">one who signs a facially unqualified note subject to an unwritten and unrecorded condition upon its repayment has lent himself to a scheme or arrangement that is likely to mislead the banking authorities, whether the condition consists of performance of a counterpromise (as in <em>D\u2019Oench, </em>Duhme) or of the truthfulness of a warranted fact.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1659-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 93, 108 S.Ct. at 402. Because the representations alleged by the defendants regarding the land did not appear in the bank\u2019s records, the Court held that the defendants were properly estopped from raising them.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 96, 108 S.Ct. at 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b1659-11\">The Supreme Court in <em>Langley </em>also reiterated the two purposes underlying the <em>D\u2019Oench </em>doctrine. First, the doctrine permits federal and state banking examiners to rely on an institution\u2019s records in evaluating its fiscal soundness. Thus, FDIC need not be concerned about undisclosed conditions on notes when assessing the assets of a failed bank and making the often speedy decision whether to liquidate the bank\u2019s assets or to initiate a purchase and assumption. Second, it \u201censure[s] mature consideration of unusual loan transactions by senior bank officials, and prevents] fraudulent insertion of new terms, with the collusion of bank employees, when a bank appears headed for failure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91-92, 108 S.Ct. at 401; <em>cf. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Merchants Nat\u2019l Bank of Mobile, </em>725 F.2d 634, 638 (11th Cir.) (stating that pace of some FDIC reviews does not allow detailed review of a bank\u2019s assets), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 829, 105 S.Ct. 114, 83 L.Ed.2d 57 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1659-14\">The Eleventh Circuit recently articulated the <em>D\u2019Oench </em>standard as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1659-15\">Whether a borrower\u2019s defense is barred by the <em>D\u2019Oench </em>doctrine depends upon whether the purported agreement relied upon by the private party was ever memorialized in writing or otherwise made explicit such that the FSLIC or the FDIC would have knowledge of the bank\u2019s obligations during an evaluation of the bank\u2019s records. If the bank\u2019s records reveal that the bank has agreed to certain additional obligations, then the <em>D\u2019Oench </em>estoppel doctrine would not preclude a borrower\u2019s claim that the bank had not satisfied those additional obligations. In such an instance, the bank\u2019s responsibilities are clearly delineated by documents in that bank\u2019s files manifesting the bank\u2019s reciprocal obligations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1659-16\">On the other hand, if side agreements or other inducements cannot be determined by a review of the bank\u2019s files, then it cannot be said, without additional proof, that the FSLIC or the FDIC was aware of the additional commitments allegedly made by the bank. Given federal policy favoring reasonable reliance upon existing bank records evidencing all of the bank\u2019s existing commitments, such unrecorded commitments will not be honored.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1659-17\"><em>McCullough, </em>911 F.2d at 600 (citations and footnote omitted). Under this standard, \u201cthe borrower must be able to point to documents that \u2018clearly manifest[ed] the bilateral nature of the [parties\u2019] rights and obligations.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 601 (quoting <em>Federal </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1564\">*1564</page-number><em>Savings &amp; Loan Ins. Corp. v. Two Rivers Associates, </em>880 F.2d 1267, 1275 (11th Cir.1989)) (brackets in original); <em>cf. Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ins. Corp. v. Homes Intern. Development Corp., </em>721 F.Supp. 290, 294 (S.D.Fla.1989) (holding that to avoid application of <em>D\u2019Oench, </em>\u201ca collateral agreement must be fully integrated and capable of definition without resort to parol evidence\u201d). Because the defendant in <em>McCullough </em>was unable to meet this heavy burden, the court affirmed the district court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of FSLIC based on the <em>D\u2019Oench </em>doctrine.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1660-4\">Application of the doctrine as set out in <em>McCullough </em>to the facts before us requires a similar result. The present appellants signed facially unqualified guaranties obligating them to pay $3,167,312 upon Vernon\u2019s insolvency, which occurred. The condition of payment alleged by appellants \u2014 the truth of Vernon\u2019s financial statement \u2014 was not \u201cmemorialized in writing or otherwise made explicit such that the FSLIC or the FDIC would have knowledge of the bank\u2019s obligations during an evaluation of the bank\u2019s records.\u201d <em>McCullough, </em>911 F.2d at 600. Thus, the \u201cbilateral nature of the [parties\u2019] rights and obligations,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 601 (quotation omitted), e.g., that the truth of Vernon\u2019s financial statement was a condition to appellants\u2019 fulfillment of their obligations under the guaranties, was not manifest in the documents. <em>See Two Rivers Associates, </em>880 F.2d at 1276 (emphasizing that bank\u2019s obligation or acceptance of condition of repayment must be explicit). Such explicit documentation is necessary given the policy underlying the <em>D\u2019Oench </em>doctrine: to enable banking authorities to fulfill their responsibility to protect the fiscal stability of financial institutions. <em>McCullough, </em>911 F.2d. at 600. Especially where banking authorities are determining whether to liquidate a failed bank or to provide financing for purchase of its assets by another bank, an evaluation of a bank\u2019s assets and liabilities \u201cmust be made with great speed, usually overnight, in order to preserve the going concern value of the failed bank and avoid an interruption in banking services.\u201d <em>Langley, </em>484 U.S. at 91, 108 S.Ct. at 401 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1660-7\">Because the alleged condition of repayment pursuant to the guaranties \u2014 the truth of Vernon\u2019s financial statement, an agreement under <em>Langley, see id. </em>at 96, 108 S.Ct. at 403\u2014was unrecorded and thus not manifest as required by <em>McCullough, </em>appellants \u201clent [themselves] to a scheme or arrangement that is likely to mislead the banking authorities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93, 108 S.Ct. at 402; <em>see Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Bell, </em>892 F.2d 64, 65-66 (10th Cir.1989) (holding that <em>Langley </em>bars defense based on bank\u2019s failure to disclose material fact regarding financial condition of company whose obligations were guaranteed by defendant and noting defendant\u2019s admission that <em>Langley </em>bars bank\u2019s misrepresentation of such a material fact), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 110 S.Ct. 2607, 110 L.Ed.2d 286 (1990); <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Galloway, </em>856 F.2d 112, 114-15 (10th Cir.1988) (characterizing <em>Langley </em>as holding that representations or warranties made by bank as part of the loan transaction are \u201cagreements\u201d within section 1823(e)).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, the <em>D\u2019Oench </em>doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1565\">*1565</page-number>trine apparently precludes appellants\u2019 defenses and counterclaims based on Vernon\u2019s misrepresentations.</p>\n<p id=\"b1661-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1661-7\">We now consider appellants\u2019 two attempts to defeat application of the doctrine. First, appellants contend that Vernon\u2019s misrepresentation of its financial condition constituted not fraud in the inducement, but fraud in the factum. Second, appellants argue that Vernon\u2019s misrepresentation of its financial condition does not fall within the <em>D\u2019Oench </em>doctrine because appellants acted reasonably and in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1661-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1661-9\">Appellants\u2019 primary argument is that Vernon\u2019s misrepresentations regarding its financial condition constituted fraud in the factum and thus prevented assent and rendered the guaranties void <em>ab initio. </em>This argument relies on dictum in <em>Langley </em>suggesting that fraud in the factum would preclude application of the <em>D\u2019Oench </em>doctrine. <em>See Langley, </em>484 U.S. at 93, 108 S.Ct. at 402 (noting \u201c[rjespondent conceded at oral argument that ... fraud in the factum ... would take the instrument out of [s]ection 1823(e)\u201d). Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that fraud in the factum would take Vernon\u2019s warranty of its financial condition outside the <em>D\u2019Oench </em>doctrine, <em>but see McLemore v. Landry, </em>898 F.2d 996, 1002 (5th Cir.) (declining to read fraud in the factum exception into <em>Langley), cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 111 S.Ct. 428, 112 L.Ed.2d 412 (1990), the facts of the present case do not support a determination that Vernon\u2019s conceded misrepresentations went to the character or essential terms of the contract in such a way as to constitute fraud in the factum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1661-14\">Fraud in the factum has been described as \u201cthe sort of fraud that procures a party\u2019s signature to an instrument without knowledge of its true nature or contents,\u201d <em>Langley, </em>484 U.S. at 93, 108 S.Ct. at 402, as fraud which occurs \u201cwithin the instrument itself,\u201d <em>Leasing Services Corp. v. River City Const., Inc., </em>743 F.2d 871, 877 (11th Cir.1984), and as fraud arising \u201cwhen a party signs a document without full knowledge of the character or essential terms of the instrument,\u201d <em>McLemore, </em>898 F.2d at 1002 (quotation omitted). Such fraud arguably would preclude application of the <em>D\u2019Oench </em>doctrine because it would render the guaranties void, thus leaving FDIC no basis for suit. Fraud in the inducement, which does not go to the very essence of the agreement but rather merely induces the party to enter the agreement, would not have the same effect because it would render the instrument merely voidable and thus capable of transfer. <em>Langley, </em>484 U.S. at 93-94, 108 S.Ct. at 402-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b1661-15\">A Sixth Circuit case provides an example of fraud in the factum warranting nonap-plication of the doctrine. In <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Turner, </em>869 F.2d 270 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1566\">*1566</page-number>(6th Cir.1989), the defendant signed for a bank officer a guaranty form with blanks for the debtor\u2019s name and the guaranty amount. In the defendant\u2019s absence, someone whited out the name of the bank printed on the form, inserted the name of another bank, and filled in the name of a debtor other than one whose debt defendant had expected to guarantee. When defendant learned what had happened, he contacted the bank holding the guaranty and followed the bank\u2019s instructions on how to rescind it, including sending a letter which was kept on file at the bank. When he asked for proof of the removal of his guaranty, the bank assured him that it had been removed from the files and destroyed. Subsequently, the bank failed and FDIC stepped in and sued to enforce the guaranty, which had never been removed. <em>Id. </em>at 272-73. The Sixth Circuit found fraud in the factum because the whiting out and alteration of the guaranty \u201cdefrauded [defendant] as to the guaranty\u2019s essential terms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 276; <em>see also Cancanon v. Smith Barney, Harris, Upham &amp; Co., </em>805 F.2d 998, 999-1001 (11th Cir.1986) (finding fraud in the factum where evidence showed plaintiffs intended to enter money market account agreement instead of securities account agreement characterized as money market account agreement).</p>\n<p id=\"b1662-4\">While the misrepresentations in <em>Turner </em>involved essential terms appearing on the face of the guaranty, e.g., the names of the bank and the debtor, the present record contains no evidence that appellants had any terms of the unqualified guaranties misrepresented to them. Certainly, appellants were ignorant of Vernon\u2019s true financial condition. However, we agree with the district court that appellants \u201cattempt to equate an alleged high degree of fraudulent inducement with lack of knowledge of the essential terms of the guaranty or other agreements.\u201d December 4, 1989 Opinion at 3. The record contains no evidence that any appellant signed a guaranty \u201cwithout knowledge of <em>its </em>true nature or contents,\u201d <em>Langley, </em>484 U.S. at 93-94, 108 S.Ct. at 402 (emphasis added), that any fraud occurred \u201cwithin the instrument itself,\u201d <em>Leasing Services Corp., </em>743 F.2d at 877, or that appellants signed the guaranty agreements \u201cwithout full knowledge of the character or essential terms [thereof],\u201d <em>McLemore, </em>898 F.2d at 1002. Thus, we conclude that the district court properly found that appellants suffered fraud in the inducement, not fraud in the factum.</p>\n<p id=\"b1662-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1662-7\">Appellants\u2019 second argument accurately recognizes that their good faith and reasonableness distinguishes the present situation from the typical <em>D\u2019Oench </em>case, which involves at least some evidence of bad faith, negligence, or recklessness. <em>See, e.g., D\u2019Oench, </em>315 U.S. at 454, 62 S.Ct. at 678 (noting defendant\u2019s knowledge that notes would never be called); <em>McCullough, </em>911 F.2d at 601 (suggesting that defendant acted unreasonably under circumstances by not insisting that loan documents reflect inclusion of disputed terms); <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. McClanahan, </em>795 F.2d 512, 516 (5th Cir.1986) (emphasizing that borrower acted recklessly by signing blank notes). Such a requirement seems appropriate in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s language in <em>D\u2019Oench. See D\u2019Oench, </em>315 U.S. at 460, 62 S.Ct. at 681 (requiring the note-maker to have \u201clent himself to a scheme or arrangement\u201d). The gist of this argument is that when a bank defrauds a borrower and the borrower is innocent of bad faith, recklessness or negligence, the borrower cannot be determined to have lent himself to a scheme. <em>See </em>Note, Borrower Beware: <em>D\u2019Oench, Duhme </em>and Section 1823 Overprotect the Insurer When Banks Fail, 62 S.Cal.L.Rev. 253, 310 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1662-8\">We conclude that the <em>Langley </em>and <em>McCullough </em>decisions as well as the policies underlying <em>D\u2019Oench </em>call for application of the doctrine even in the absence of bad faith, recklessness or negligence on the appellants\u2019 part. Although the circumstances in <em>Langley </em>suggest that the borrowers acted negligently, <em>see </em>Note, <em>supra, </em>at 311 (describing borrowers\u2019 ready access to information disputing bank\u2019s alleged oral misrepresentations regarding oil leases and acreage of land) (citing Brief for Respondent at 3, <em>Langley), </em>the Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1567\">*1567</page-number>Court\u2019s opinion mentions no requirement of bad-faith, recklessness or even negligence on the part of the borrower. <em>See Langley, </em>484 U.S. at 88-96, 108 S.Ct. at 399-403. Thus, <em>Langley </em>suggests that no such evidence is required for application- of the <em>D\u2019Oench </em>doctrine. <em>See Hartigan v. Commonwealth Mortgage Corp. of America, </em>723 F.Supp. 1258, 1262 n. 5 (N.D.Ill.1989) (noting that <em>\u201cpre-Langley </em>decisions ... call for a greater degree of borrower involvement than the Supreme Court has now made clear is required\u201d).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1663-5\">The test articulated in <em>McCullough </em>also supports such a conclusion. To be sure, the court did emphasize several acts and omissions on the borrower\u2019s part which, taken together, appear to constitute at least negligence. <em>See McCullough, </em>911 F.2d at 601 (noting defendant\u2019s execution of the instruments without formalities of a loan closing as an accommodation to the bank, his failure to examine the instruments at the closing, and his knowledge that speed was essential due to an impending visit by bank examiners). However, elsewhere the court indicates that evidence of bad faith, recklessness or negligence on the part of the borrower is not required. <em>See id. </em>at 600 n. 6 (stating that <em>D\u2019Oench </em>might not apply where \u201cthe borrowers are wholly innocent of any misconduct <em>and, additionally, </em>cannot be said to have lent themselves to arrangements that might deceive the banking authorities\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1663-6\">Finally, the nature of the primary policy underlying the <em>D\u2019Oench </em>doctrine suggests that its application does not require evidence of negligence, recklessness or bad-faith on the borrower\u2019s part. The ability of banking examiners to rely on an institution\u2019s records in evaluating its fiscal soundness would seem to be unaffected by whether or not a borrower knew or had reason to know of an institution\u2019s fraud. Section 1823(e) contains no bad-faith, recklessness, or negligence requirement and thus reflects this understanding of the policy underlying the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1663-10\">Accordingly, we reaffirm this circuit\u2019s previous holding that the controlling inquiry is \u201cwhether the purported agreement relied upon by the private party was ever memorialized in writing or otherwise made explicit such that the FSLIC or the FDIC would have knowledge of the bank's obligations during an evaluation of the bank\u2019s records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 600. If the agreement \u2014 in this case, the conditioning of appellants\u2019 guaranty obligations on the truth of Vernon\u2019s financial representations \u2014 is not manifest as required by <em>McCullough, </em>then the party is deemed to have \u201clent himself to a scheme or arrangement that is likely to mislead the banking authorities,\u201d <em>Langley, </em>484 U.S. at 93, 108 S.Ct. at 402, and is estopped from basing a defense or counterclaim on the agreement. No independent evidence of bad-faith, recklessness, or negligence is required.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1663-11\">Our determination that appellants\u2019 fraud-based defenses and counterclaims are barred by the <em>D\u2019Oench </em>doctrine \u201cmay appear inequitable.\u201d <em>McCullough, </em>911 F.2d at 600. However, we are constrained by the <em>Langley </em>Court, which determined the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1663-12\">the equities [appellants would have the Court invoke] are not the equities the [doctrine] regards as predominant. While the borrower who has relied upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1568\">*1568</page-number>an erroneous or even fraudulent unrecorded representation has some claim to consideration, so do those who are harmed by his failure to protect himself by assuring that his agreement is approved and recorded in accordance with the [doctrine].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1664-4\"><em>Langley, </em>484 U.S. at 94, 108 S.Ct. at 403; <em>see McCullough, </em>911 F.2d at 600 (explaining that the doctrine \u201cfavors the interests of depositors and creditors of a failed bank, who cannot protect themselves from secret agreements, over the interests of borrowers, who can\u201d) (quotation omitted); <em>McCla-nahan, </em>795 F.2d at 516 (holding that \u201c[the borrower], rather than the FDIC or the innocent depositors or creditors of the failed bank, must bear the consequences of [the] unfortunate involvement with [the failed bank]\u201d). Thus, the absence of bad faith, recklessness or negligence on appellants\u2019 part does not preclude application of the <em>D\u2019Oench </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b1664-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1664-6\">In light of the foregoing, appellee is entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law. Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1655-15\">.

After the defendant had refused to make further payments on the loan and the bank had gone into receivership, FSLIC\u2019s predecessor in interest sued for collection on the loan. <em>See McCullough, </em>911 F.2d at 595-96.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1660-9\">. We note that courts prior to <em>Langley </em>identified an institution\u2019s misrepresentation of its financial condition as one type of fraud to which <em>D\u2019Oench </em>would not apply. <em>See, e.g., Federal Deposit Ins.

First, the opening paragraph of <em>Langley </em>bases its jurisdiction on a conflict between the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Langley, </em>which it affirmed, and two of the cases cited in the paragraph above, <em>Hatmaker </em>and <em>Gunter. See Langley v. Federal Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>484 U.S. 86, 88, 108 S.Ct. 396, 399, 98 L.Ed.2d 340 (1987), <em>aff''g Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Langley, </em>792 F.2d 541 (5th Cir.1986) (barring \"a [notemaker\u2019s] defense of misrepresentation of existing facts\u201d). The pages cited in <em>Langley </em>as conflicting with the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision contain the proposition that an institution\u2019s misrepresentation of its financial condition would not be barred by <em>D\u2019Oench. See Hatmaker, </em>756 F.2d at 37; <em>Gunter, </em>674 F.2d at 867; <em>see also Two Rivers Associates, 880 </em>F.2d at 1277 (noting that <em>Gunter </em>was \"undercut\" and \"rejected\u201d by <em>Langley). </em>Second, the plain language of <em>Langley </em>\u2014 \u201c[a] condition to payment of a note, including the truth of an express warranty, is part of the <em>\u2018agreement,\u2019\" Langley, </em>484 U.S. at 96, 108 S.Ct. at 403 \u2014 does not distinguish between an institution\u2019s misrepresentation of the terms of a transaction and an institution\u2019s misrepresentation of its financial condition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1663-7\">. Moreover, as discussed previously, <em>see supra </em>note 12, <em>Langley </em>rejected two cases which stood for the proposition that fraudulent inducement based on an institution\u2019s misrepresentation of its financial condition would not fall within <em>D\u2019Oench. </em>Such misrepresentation would not necessarily involve bad faith, recklessness or negligence on the borrower\u2019s part.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1663-8\">.
