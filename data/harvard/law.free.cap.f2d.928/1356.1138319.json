Nickerson, <em>Judge, </em>in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. Paci was convicted on both counts of a two count indictment charging both Paci and his codefendant, Salvatore Puzzo,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with conspiracy to import, distribute, and possess with intent to distribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 and 963 (1988), and possession of heroin with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (1988) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-16\">On appeal, Paci challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions. He also contends that the district court improperly restricted his direct testimony, thus prejudicially interfering with his ability to present a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-17\">For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-18\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1453-19\">This case arose out of a Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) investigation into allegations that an organization was importing heroin from Italy into the United States with the assistance of one or more corrupt United States customs officials at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Taken in the light most favorable to the government, and construing all permissible inferences in its favor, <em>see United States v. Diaz, </em>878 F.2d 608, 610 (2d Cir.) (citing <em>United States v. Chang An-Lo, </em>851 F.2d 547, 554 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 966, 109 S.Ct. 493, 102 L.Ed.2d 530 (1988); <em>United States v.

Working undercover, with the assumed name Antonio (\u201cNino\u201d) Alfieri, Alieva posed as a large scale narcotics trafficker. With the assistance of an informant, Nick Argano, he arranged to travel to Italy and meet with several individuals, including Joseph Paci, in order to buy heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-4\">Alieva first traveled to Italy <em>on </em>October 27, 1985. Following Argano\u2019s instructions, he remained in Italy until November 7, 1985 \u201cawaiting a phone call or directions from ... Paci,\u201d which never came. Upon his return to the United States, Alieva contacted the informant and then telephoned a hotel in Naples and spoke to Paci. It became apparent that there had been a mix-up in communications, and a second trip was planned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-5\">On November 12, 1985, Alieva again traveled to Italy. He carried $40,000 in DEA funds to use as a partial payment for the purchase of a kilogram of heroin. The total purchase price agreed to by Alieva and Paci was $90,000. On November 13, Alieva met with Paci at the Excelsior Hotel in Naples. Paci advised Alieva that the \u201cpackage\u201d was ready and would be delivered to Paci by two Italian men.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-6\">After Paci told Alieva to change his travel arrangements so they could leave Italy together the following morning, Alieva, Paci, and the two men went together by car to a travel agency. When they arrived, Paci told Alieva to give the $40,000 to one of the Italian men, who remained in the car while the others went into the travel agency. After the travel arrangements were made, the other Italian man told Paci that the package would be delivered to Paci\u2019s hotel room by 11:00 that night, or, at the latest, by early the following morning. Later, Alieva and Paci had dinner in a restaurant in Naples. During dinner, Alieva expressed concern about the package, and Paci replied that since he was being paid, he would do the worrying.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-7\">Alieva was awakened at 6:00 a.m. the following morning by a telephone call from Paci, who advised him that everything was ready. Asked whether he had the package, Paci responded: \u201c[Everything is okay, let's me[e]t at the airport.\u201d Paci then \u201cexpressed his desire [that Alieva and Paci] leave separately and not speak to each other.\u201d At the Naples airport, Alieva tried to engage Paci in conversation, but Paci refused to speak with him, except to repeat \u201ceverything is okay.\u201d In the Rome Airport, after the initial leg of the journey, Paci again refused to converse with Alieva. Alieva and Paci sat apart from each other on the flight from Rome to New York. Finally, upon arriving at Kennedy Airport, they remained separate, again per Paci\u2019s instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-10\">Acting upon information supplied by the informant Argano on the day following Al-ieva\u2019s return from Italy, Alieva collected an additional $10,000 in DEA funds to take to Paci\u2019s home at 2170 79th Street, Brooklyn. The additional cash apparently was needed so that an unidentified Kennedy Airport employee would release the package of heroin from his custody. On November 18, Alieva, accompanied by Argano, brought the money to Paci\u2019s home. Paci was not there. Instead, they were met by Puzzo, who was introduced to Alieva by Argano. Puzzo directed Alieva to place the $10,000 under a sofa cushion. Puzzo told Argano that Paci was not home but would return shortly, and instructed Argano to call Paci the following morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1454-11\">Alieva returned to Paci\u2019s residence on November 27, 1985. Based upon information provided by Argano, Alieva expected to receive one-eighth of the kilogram of heroin that Paci had smuggled in from Italy. Alieva understood from Argano that after the balance had been sold by Paci and Puzzo, Alieva would receive a portion of the proceeds. As Alieva approached Paci\u2019s residence, Paci came outside to meet him and said: \u201cI have something for you.\u201d Paci opened the trunk of a red Oldsmobile and removed a brown paper bag, which he placed in Alieva\u2019s attache case. When Al-ieva apologized for not trusting Paci and having questioned whether he had the package, Paci responded: \u201cI could not tell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1359\">*1359</page-number>you I had the package.\u201d Alieva left after agreeing to contact Paci \u201cto let him know the quality of the merchandise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-5\">Inside the brown paper bag was a transparent bag that contained white powder. Alieva did not conduct a field test, but submitted the package to the DEA laboratory for testing. The laboratory analysis revealed that the package contained not heroin, but Diazepam (valium). After receiving the report from the laboratory, Al-ieva met with Paei on December 6, 1985 at a diner in Brooklyn. The informant Arga-no was also present. Alieva expressed his dissatisfaction with the package, stating that \u201cit was not what it was supposed to be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-6\">Paci insisted that he did not know what had happened, that he had received the package directly from the two men in Naples, and \u201cthey had told him it was good.\u201d Upon further complaint from Alieva, Paci acknowledged that the two men had told him that the package contained only 600 grams rather than a full kilogram, and that Alieva would receive the remaining 400 grams upon paying the full purchase price. When Alieva suggested that Paci had done something wrong at the airport, Paci stated that \u201cthat was totally out of the question, he [Paei] had possession of the package,\u201d and had dealt only with confederates in customs who were totally reliable \u201cto bring the package in.\u201d The conversation ended when Alieva refused Paci\u2019s suggestion that he purchase an additional half kilogram of better quality heroin from the two Italian men for $20,000. Later that month, Alieva was transferred by the DEA to a different assignment, as a result of which he played no further role in this investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-7\">Detective Richard Platzer resumed the investigation approximately six months later. He assumed the undercover role of a narcotics trafficker, using the name \u201cRich Pizzo.\u201d Platzer went with Argano to Puz-zo\u2019s residence in Brooklyn on June 17, 1986. Argano introduced Platzer as an associate of \u201cNino,\u201d the nickname used by Alieva in his undercover role. Platzer told Puzzo that \u201cNino\u201d was no longer involved, that the money provided for the defective package Alieva had received from Paci was Platzer\u2019s, and that Platzer was therefore owed the $50,000 he had paid plus an additional $10,000 for expenses. Puzzo told Platzer to be patient, and indicated that based on two telephone calls he had placed to Italy, he was expecting \u201ca package to come in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-9\">On September 25, 1986, Platzer and Ar-gano met with Puzzo at Puzzo\u2019s residence in Brooklyn. The three then drove to a nearby intersection, where Puzzo and Ar-gano left the car and disappeared from Platzer\u2019s view. They returned after a short period, and Puzzo handed Platzer a plastic bag containing white powder, which subsequent laboratory analysis revealed to be 265.1 grams of heroin. Puzzo stated: \u201c[T]his takes care of part of the problem.\u201d Platzer responded: \u201cyes, now we can start making money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-10\">Puzzo agreed to notify Platzer when he had more heroin available. Although Plat-zer regarded the $50,000 debt resulting from the prior valium delivery as discharged, he told Puzzo that an additional $10,000 was still owed to cover the expenses of Alieva\u2019s trip to Italy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-11\">On October 8, 1986, Platzer gave $5,000 to Puzzo, who was to secure five ounces of heroin for Platzer. Unable to do so that day, Puzzo stated that he would contact Platzer shortly to complete the transaction. Six days later, Platzer met with Puzzo, accompanied by Argano, in Brooklyn. Puz-zo stated that he still had not been able to obtain the five ounces, but that he had 400 grams of low grade heroin that he would sell to Platzer for $2,500 an ounce. Platzer indicated he would forgive the $10,000 debt from the valium incident in exchange for 120 grams of the low grade heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-12\">Two days later, Platzer and Argano met Puzzo at Puzzo\u2019s residence in Brooklyn, where Puzzo gave Platzer a package containing a clear plastic bag of white powder. Subsequent laboratory analysis revealed the powder to be 114.4 grams of heroin.</p>\n<p id=\"b1455-13\">On December 8, 1986, Platzer and Arga-no again met with Puzzo in Brooklyn. Puz-zo advised Platzer that there was no good heroin available \u201con the street,\u201d and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1360\">*1360</page-number>two kilograms were available in Italy. It was then agreed that Platzer would make the trip during the first week of January. Platzer asked whether Puzzo or Paci would be accompanying him to Italy. Puzzo responded that he did not trust Paci. Two days later, Puzzo advised Platzer \u201cthat he had talked to the people at the airport and that everything was being arranged,\u201d and they could make the trip to Italy during the first week in January.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-4\">On December 29,1986, Platzer and Arga-no again met with Puzzo to make plans for the trip to Italy. Puzzo informed Platzer that because of preparations that had to be made at the airport, the trip would have to be made in the middle, rather than the beginning, of January. Puzzo then stated that Paci would be making the trip with Platzer, and that Paci would be paid for doing so. Platzer responded: \u201cisn\u2019t this the same Joe Paci that you told me you didn\u2019t trust[?]\u201d Puzzo assured Platzer that Paci was \u201cokay,\u201d and further explained that \u201cthe people in the airport know Joe Paci and Joe Paci has been smuggling in stuff at the airport for years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-5\">There was further delay regarding the planned trip to Italy. At a meeting in Brooklyn on February 9, 1987, Puzzo reiterated that Paci would accompany Platzer, and proposed that upon boarding the plane to return from Italy, Platzer would hand the package of heroin to Paci, who in turn would take it through customs. Platzer responded that the plan was unacceptable \u201cbecause of the problems the last time.\u201d Puzzo then suggested that Platzer keep the heroin and give it to the customs agent, whom Paci knew and would point out.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-6\">Platzer, Argano, and Puzzo again met in Brooklyn on February 13, 1987, and drove to Jay Stylist, a beauty parlor in Brooklyn that was Paci\u2019s place of employment. Paci joined them in the car, and Puzzo introduced him to Platzer. Puzzo asked Paci when he wanted to go to Italy. Paci stated that he would be unable to go the next week because he was going to Florida, but the following week would be acceptable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-7\">Three days later, Platzer and Argano met with Paci at Paci\u2019s residence in Brooklyn. Paci informed Platzer that he had learned from Puzzo that there would be no customs agent to assist them in bringing in the package, and that Paci would have to bring in the package unaided. Paci explained that when Puzzo had brought in a package the previous May, he \u201cstiffed the guy at the airport and didn\u2019t pay him,\u201d and that as a result the inspector was refusing to work with Puzzo. Paci told Platzer that he would bring the package into the country taped to his legs. When Platzer expressed reluctance to proceed without the assistance of the customs inspector, Paci stated that he had \u201cdone it on prior occasions.\u201d He then specified that on \u201cthe trip he made with Nino [Alieva], ... when he [Paci] brought the stuff in, he had it taped to his legs and he came through Customs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1456-9\">Platzer would not agree to the new plan, stating: \u201cI don\u2019t think this trip is going to go unless I know 100 percent that the \u2014 it is guaranteed that it\u2019s going to get in.\u201d Paci stated that he would discuss the matter with Puzzo\u2019s friend \u201cPaolo,\u201d the man who had the connections at the airport. Paci explained: \u201c[T]hey know me because I have been doing this but I can\u2019t go to them without first going to [Puzzo] and Paolo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aj9\">In the course of this conversation, Plat-zer asked Paci about the prior trip from Italy when Paci had been accompanied by Alieva. Platzer testified concerning that portion of their conversation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ajf-dedup-1\">I had Joe [Paci] explain to me how the whole trip was done with Nick, Agent Alleva. I asked him, when you and Nino went to Italy, I said what happened? How did this happen? And he said to me he doesn\u2019t know that, all he knows he brought what he thought to be good stuff back and he turned it over to Sal [Puzzo] and he didn\u2019t know what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1456-10\">And I said, because it doesn\u2019t make sense to me that \u2014 he said Richie what do you want me to tell you, I put it on my body, I brought it in and they told me it was good over there. I believed them and I gave it over to Sal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1456-11\">On February 24, 1987, Puzzo told Platzer that Platzer would be able to make the trip <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1361\">*1361</page-number>to Italy unaccompanied. Puzzo stated that the customs inspector wanted $50,000 to allow the package to pass through customs, and that Platzer could bring in up to six kilograms of heroin. The following day, Puzzo informed Platzer that Paci \u201cwas no longer involved in this.\u201d Shortly thereafter, as a result of an unrelated investigation, federal agents arrested a number of Pan Am employees. Puzzo told Platzer that one of those arrested was \u201cone of his people,\u201d and that the trip to Italy would have to be postponed, because \u201cit would take a few months for things to cool down.\u201d Although Platzer and Puzzo had at least one subsequent meeting, Platzer never made the trip to Italy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-6\">A. <em>Sufficiency of the Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1457-7\">At trial, Paci twice moved pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 for a judgment of acquittal; first, at the close of the government\u2019s case, and again after both sides rested. He argued that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction on either count of the indictment. The motions were denied. On appeal, Paci renews this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b1457-8\">An appellant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence bears \u201c \u2018 \u201ca very heavy burden.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>United States v.

Fiore, </em>821 F.2d 127, 128 (2d Cir.1987)). In sum, \u201c[a] jury\u2019s verdict will be sustained if there is substantial evidence, taking the view most favorable to the government, to support it.\u201d <em>United States v.

Paci was shown to be involved with Puzzo, the two men in Italy, and a corrupt customs inspector. Statements made by Paci to both Alieva and Platzer, according to them, clearly indicated that Paci had knowingly brought a substance that he thought to be heroin into the United States for the purpose of distribution. Platzer also testified that Paci admitted to him Paci\u2019s ongoing involvement with Puzzo in the importation of heroin. Although Paci denied these admissions when he testified at trial, and suggests on appeal that Puzzo perpetrated a \u201cscam\u201d against Alieva in which Paci was an unknowing participant, there was clearly adequate evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict. The testimony of Alieva and Platzer, if believed, amply supported the conviction, and Paci\u2019s \u201cscam\u201d scenario is hardly plausible in the context of the overall evidence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1362\">*1362</page-number>In any event, the issue of credibility was the jury\u2019s to decide. <em>See Roman, </em>870 F.2d at 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-4\">The evidence on count two, which charged Paci and Puzzo with possession of heroin, was also sufficient to sustain a conviction. The charge in this count was based upon Puzzo\u2019s September 25, 1986 delivery of heroin to Platzer. Alieva had previously provided a total of $50,000 to Paci and the Italians in Naples for the purpose of buying heroin, but the package delivered to Alieva turned out to contain valium instead of heroin. On September 25, Puzzo handed Platzer a package of heroin. Puzzo sought no payment from Platzer, but instead stated: \u201c[Tjhis takes care of part of the problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-5\">The government\u2019s theory, on appeal as at trial, \u201cis that Puzzo delivered the heroin on Paci\u2019s behalf to satisfy Paci\u2019s debt to the undercover agent. Puzzo and Paci thus jointly possessed the heroin.\u201d In denying Paci\u2019s Rule 29 motion, the trial court acknowledged this theory, stating: \u201cThere is enough evidence Mr. Puzzo wasn\u2019t delivering [the heroin] on his on [sic] behalf but also on the behalf of Mr. Paci.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-6\">Possession of narcotics \u201cmay be shared among several conspirators, each of whom performs a distinct role in the transaction.\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>679 F.2d 845, 853 (11th Cir.1982), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 1207, 103 S.Ct. 1198, 75 L.Ed.2d 441 (1983); <em>see also United States v. Torres, </em>901 F.2d 205, 221 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 111 S.Ct. 273, 112 L.Ed.2d 229 (1990). The jury was entitled to conclude, based upon the evidence presented, that the heroin was possessed by Puzzo not only on his own behalf, but for the benefit of Paci, as well. The evidence was sufficient to establish that Puzzo and Paci had collaborated on the original importation, Paci had delivered the bogus heroin to Alieva, and Alieva\u2019s first complaint concerning the delivery was made to Paci. Further, Platzer\u2019s testimony indicated that both Paci and Puzzo continued to be involved in discussions with Platzer regarding the importation of heroin well past the September 25, 1986 delivery. The jury could therefore infer that when Puzzo told Platzer that the September 20 delivery took care of \u201cpart of the problem,\u201d he was acting on behalf of both himself and Paci, and that Paci had aided, abetted, counselled, commanded, induced, or procured the delivery within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (1988). In sum, we see no reason to overturn either conviction for insufficient evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1458-10\">B. <em>Restriction of Paci\u2019s Testimony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1458-11\">After calling two character witnesses, Paci took the stand in his defense. At several points during his direct testimony, the court sustained objections of opposing counsel to questions posed by Paci\u2019s attorney, preventing Paci from describing conversations he had with Puzzo and, on one occasion, with Alieva. According to Paci, these conversations, which \u201cwere intended to constitute the crux of his defense\u201d by explaining his presence in potentially culpable situations, were improperly restricted. Specifically, Paci points to the following testimony concerning his encounter with Alieva in Italy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1458-12\">Q While you were in Sicily, you said you got a phone call from Mr. Puzzo?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1458-13\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1458-14\">Q Would you continue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1458-15\">A Called the first time and I wasn\u2019t home; and called again and got me home.

One of which is hearsay, except under certain circumstances, basically you can\u2019t say what someone else said to you. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-33\">THE WITNESS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-34\">THE COURT: What your lawyer is asking, what happened, okay. Listen to the question and just answer the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-35\">Q Mr. Paci, can you say what you said and what happened?

He had an open shirt, full of jewelry, very macho. Macho.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-47\">I didn\u2019t feel comfortable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-48\">Q Are you able to relate this person Nino to the second phone call made to you by a person you had not known before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-49\">MR. SEMMELMAN: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-50\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1459-51\">When I sustain an objection don\u2019t answer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1459-52\">Paci also maintains that the following testimony regarding a subsequent conversation with Puzzo was improperly restricted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1364\">*1364</page-number>Q Now, prior to Mr. Alleva coming to your home to pick up something did you see Mr. Puzzo?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-4\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-5\">Q When was the last time you had seen him prior to Mr. Alieva coming?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5cE\">A The day before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-6\">Q What happened at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-7\">A The day before he came in and told me\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-8\">MR. SEMMELMAN: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-9\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1460-10\">Finally, Paci points to restrictions imposed upon his testimony regarding preparations for the visit by Puzzo and Platzer to Paci at Paci\u2019s place of employment, Jay Stylist, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-11\">A [Puzzo] asked me if when he came around with \u2014 what is his name? The other agent, Mr. Alieva, when Mr. Alie-va\u2019s partner would come around I would say whatever [Puzzo] says I should say yes. I asked him why. Do you want to know why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-12\">Q Did you say anything in response?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALhp\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-13\">Q What did you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-14\">A I wanted to know why I should say yes to something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-15\">Q Did you then engage Mr. Puzzo in any further conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-16\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-17\">Q Did he ask anything of you at that time when you asked why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-18\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-19\">MR. SEMMELMAN: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-20\">THE COURT: Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-21\">MR. PASCARELLA: Not what he said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-22\">THE COURT: Don\u2019t put it now in the form what he said. What question did he ask you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-23\">THE WITNESS: He asked me to help him out and say yes to whatever he\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1460-24\">THE COURT: You already testified to that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1460-25\">Paci argues that the district court\u2019s improper restriction of his testimony deprived him of the opportunity to present a defense, thereby violating his fifth amendment right to due process and his sixth amendment right to counsel. The government responds that: (1) the issue has not been preserved for appellate review because it was not raised below; (2) viewed in the context of subsequently allowed testimony and defense counsel\u2019s summation, no significant restriction of Paci\u2019s testimony occurred; and in any event, (3) any error was harmless. Accordingly, we examine (1) the issue of waiver; (2) whether Paci\u2019s testimony was erroneously circumscribed; and (3) whether any error that occurred was in any event harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-27\">1. Waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-28\">It is clear from the foregoing that the trial court restricted Paci\u2019s testimony to prevent the admission into evidence of hearsay. Paci contends on appeal that the evidence as he intended to use it would not have been hearsay, or alternatively would have fallen under an exception to the hearsay rule. The government responds, however, that Paci\u2019s trial counsel failed to present this argument to the district court and thereby waived the issue. Thus, the government reasons, we may reverse only if plain error is established. <em>See </em>Fed.R. Crim.P. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-29\">Concededly, Paci\u2019s counsel waived an opening statement, thereby precluding any initial insight into the theory of Paci\u2019s defense. On the other hand, Paci\u2019s counsel requested a sidebar conference when the trial court originally ruled adversely regarding Paci\u2019s testimony, and was rebuffed. <em>See United States v. Pugliese, </em>712 F.2d 1574, 1580 (2d Cir.1983) (burden on counsel to alert court to legal basis for proffer). Paci\u2019s counsel also persisted in his attempts to elicit the testimony in question. We believe these efforts suffice to establish that Paci did not waive his right to argue this point on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-30\">2. The Excluded Testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b1460-31\">It would appear that at least some of Paci\u2019s intended testimony concerning conversations between Paci and Puzzo, and on one occasion in Naples between Paci and Alieva, was improperly excluded. Fed.R. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1365\">*1365</page-number>Evid. 801(c) defines hearsay as \u201ca statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Paci contends that the conversations were not offered for \u201cthe truth of the matter asserted,\u201d but rather to explain Paci\u2019s state of mind. Thus, the conversations with Puzzo and Alieva while Paci was in Italy would assertedly have established that Paci had been duped by Puzzo into thinking he would be carrying back a package of gold jewelry, not cocaine. The subsequent excluded conversations concerning (1) delivery of the package and (2) a repeat trip to Italy by Paci would presumably have been along the same lines. Far from being offered for their truth, Paci contends that \u201cthe thrust of [his] testimony is that Puzzo was lying to him.\u201d Thus, the proffered testimony was assertedly admissible because it \u201cformed the basis of Paci\u2019s knowledge at the time which provided the motive for his actions; and was evidence of Paci\u2019s probable state of mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-5\">Paci\u2019s proffered testimony regarding these conversations apparently was not offered for the truth of the matters asserted. <em>Cf. United States v. Pedroza, </em>750 F.2d 187, 203 (2d Cir.1984) (statement not hearsay because offered for its \u201cpatent falsity\u201d). Thus, the statements would not have been hearsay as offered, and the district court erred in excluding them. <em>See United States v. Lambinus, </em>747 F.2d 592, 597 (10th Cir.1984) (testimony offered to show effect of statements on listener not hearsay), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>471 U.S. 1067, 105 S.Ct. 2143, 85 L.Ed.2d 500 (1985); <em>United States v. Leake, </em>642 F.2d 715, 720 (4th Cir.1981) (statement offered as evidence of defendant\u2019s state of mind not hearsay); <em>United States v. Carter, </em>491 F.2d 625, 628-29 (5th Cir.1974) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-6\">This is not, however, the end of the matter. As Paci concedes, the district court relaxed its restrictions as Paci\u2019s testimony proceeded and its thrust became clearer. As Paci states in his brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-7\">Eventually, the court did allow Paci to testify regarding what Puzzo asked him to do (e.g., bring gold to the United States, to introduce two individuals to a person from New York, to give a package to Agent Alieva, and to agree to go to Italy). The court did <em>not </em>allow Paci to explain the reason for these requests (e.g., why Puzzo wanted gold, who the Italians were, why he wanted Paci to make the introduction, why he wanted Paci to deliver a package, what the package allegedly contained, what the purpose of the proposed second trip to Italy was to be).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1461-11\">In the course of his direct examination, Paci testified that Puzzo was his good friend, his employer in the \u201cJay Stylist\u201d beauty shop, and his former lover; that Puzzo discussed with Paci, prior to Paci\u2019s trip to Italy in November 1985, the idea of importing gold jewelry to sell in the beauty shop \u201clike pawn shops;\u201d that after this conversation, Paci went to Sicily to visit relatives, leaving with Puzzo a phone number in Italy where Paci could be contacted regarding business matters; and that Puz-zo called Paci in Sicily and asked Paci to introduce two people in Italy to Puzzo\u2019s \u201cpartner from New York,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>Alieva.</p>\n<p id=\"b1461-12\">Paci\u2019s central complaint is that he was not allowed to develop the explanation that Puzzo misled him into believing that he was bringing back gold, not cocaine, from Italy. The trouble with this argument is that Paci twice testified that he refused to bring back any gold from Italy when Puzzo requested that he do so. His initial testimony in this regard was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-13\">Q Now, prior to you going to Sicily in November 1985, did you have any discussion with Mr. Puzzo about the business at the beauty parlor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-14\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-15\">Q Did he ask you anything at that time, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-16\">A Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-17\">Q What did he ask you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-18\">A He asked me, he would want to bring in some gold, like pawn shops.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-19\">THE COURT: What was the question he asked you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1461-20\">THE WITNESS: He asked me being I was in Italy that he wanted to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1366\">*1366</page-number>THE COURT: What did he ask you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-4\">THE WITNESS: If I would bring gold from Italy. I said no. I thought it was a small amount.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1462-5\">Immediately thereafter, Paci\u2019s counsel returned to the subject, eliciting the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-6\">Q Now, back to this discussion about the beauty parlor business and the gold, he asked you to personally bring the gold back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1462-7\">A Yes, I said no way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1462-8\">In his summation, Paci\u2019s counsel nonetheless suggested that in light of the prior conversation with Puzzo, Paci might have surmised that Puzzo was \u201csending [his] partner [Alieva] over on a jewelry business deal,\u201d and later asserted \u201cthat is what Mr. Paci believed\u201d to be the subject of the meetings in Naples. Aside from these suggestions, the central thrust of Paci\u2019s testimony, and of his counsel\u2019s summation, was that the government agents were lying about the events in question, and especially about Paci\u2019s alleged admissions to them, and that Paci knew nothing about any narcotics activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-9\">3. Harmless Error.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-10\">Although the district court erroneously cut short some questioning the responses to which would not have been hearsay, Paci was ultimately able to testify, and his counsel to argue, in support of the theory that Puzzo had misled Paci into believing that the meetings and introductions Paci undertook in Italy at Puzzo\u2019s behest were related to the importation of gold jewelry. Indeed, given Paci\u2019s repeated testimony that he had explicitly refused, prior to his trip to Italy, to bring gold jewelry back for Puzzo, his counsel\u2019s suggestions in summation probably did as much with that theory as the record would allow. Further, although we have concluded that Paci\u2019s counsel should not be charged with a waiver on this issue, we note that no offer of proof was ever made to indicate that the theory pressed by Paci on appeal was regarded as a substantial line of defense at trial. The gist of the trial was a clash of credibility between agents Alieva and Platzer, on the one hand, and Paci, on the other. The jury obviously decided that fundamental issue against Paci. We conclude that in view of the weight of the evidence against Paci, and his subsequent opportunity to provide the substance of the challenged testimony, any error in restricting Paci\u2019s testimony regarding his conversations with Puzzo was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-12\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1462-13\">The judgment of conviction is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1453-14\">. Puzzo subsequently pled guilty to conspiracy to possess heroin with intent to distribute and remained free on bail pending sentence. The government\u2019s brief advises that hours after the jury found Paci guilty, Puzzo was murdered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
