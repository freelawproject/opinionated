Because we conclude that Banashefski\u2019s convictions were based on separable instances of conduct, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The facts are not in dispute. On September 16,1988, in Valencia County, New Mexico, defendant Banashefski was arrested while driving a stolen, 1980 Dodge Diplomat. In the trunk of this car was a brown suitcase, containing a sawed-off, double barrel 12 gauge shotgun, shotgun shells, narcotics paraphernalia, and an undeveloped roll of film.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Banashefski was arrested as a result of an investigation, initiated earlier the same day, by Belen police detectives Sanchez and Gallegos. Pursuant to the investigation, Sanchez and Gallegos began a \u201cstake out\u201d of room # 30 at the Rio Community Resort Motel near Belen. While there, the detectives ran a computer check on a maroon, 1980 Dodge Diplomat, parked by the room. The computer check revealed that the car was stolen. Under the direct observation of Sanchez and Gallegos, Banashefski was seen exiting the room carrying a brown suitcase. As the detectives watched, he took the suitcase over to the Dodge and placed it in the trunk. He then returned to the motel room.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Approximately thirty minutes later, while maintaining surveillance on the car and the room, the detectives saw Banashef-ski and three other individuals exit the room and get into the car, with Banashef-ski driving. The detectives followed the stolen Dodge in their own car, radioing for a marked patrol car to make a stop. Patrolman Savilla responded and stopped the Dodge. Banashefski was arrested. Before towing the Dodge, detective Gallegos and officer Savilla conducted an inventory search of the car. In the trunk, they found the shotgun, ammunition and film inside the brown suitcase. From the main interi- or compartment, they recovered several handguns. At a later date, the roll of film was developed, revealing a photograph of Banashefski holding a sawed-off shotgun similar to the one in the suitcase. <em>See </em>Presentence Report at 3-4; Government\u2019s Response to Motion to Suppress, filed June 2, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">Banashefski was indicted in the New Mexico state court, in Valencia County, for possession of a stolen vehicle (the Dodge Diplomat), possession of a stolen firearm (one of the handguns), possession of a firearm as a felon, and possession of drug paraphernalia. On April 3,1989, Banashef-ski pled guilty to possession of the stolen vehicle and was sentenced to incarceration for one year. The remaining charges were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">On April 13, 1989, a federal grand jury indicted Banashefski in a two-count indictment, alleging in Count I, possession of a firearm by a felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(a)(1)(B), and in Count II, possession of an unregistered firearm in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5861(d), 5871. On August 29, 1989, Banashefski, pursuant to a plea agreement, pled guilty to a single-count information which charged him with being a felon in possession of a firearm. The federal indictment was dismissed. A presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) was prepared and sentencing was scheduled for November 6, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">In the PSR, Banashefski\u2019s offense level was calculated at 7. His criminal history score, including 2 points assessed for the state stolen vehicle conviction, was 14\u2014 putting him in criminal history category VI. <em>See </em>PSR at 4-7. By written and oral motions before and during his sentencing hearing, Banashefski objected to the inclusion in the PSR of this state sentence as a \u201cprior sentence\u201d for purposes of computing his criminal history category under \u00a7 4A1.1 of the United States Sentencing Commission, <em>Guidelines Manual </em>(1989) (\u201cU.S.S. G.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The state conviction, he argued, arose out of the same offense/conduct as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>the felon in possession charge, and, thus, should not be counted as a \u201cprior sentence\u201d as defined in \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(l). On appeal, Ba-nashefski points out that in its discussion of \u201cRelated Cases,\u201d the PSR (19) lists the charge in Valencia County, New Mexico, against Banashefski for possession of a stolen vehicle, and his guilty plea and sentence thereon, and his state court sentence for being a habitual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">At sentencing, the district court determined that no evidentiary hearing was necessary since there was no dispute as to the facts. The court adopted the computations in the PSR. The guideline range, as determined by the district court, was 15 to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Noting both the presence in the car of several weapons and Banashefski\u2019s \u201ccontinuous disrespect for law and order[,]\u201d TR at 8, the district court sentenced Banashefski to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment, the top of the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">On appeal from this sentence, Banashef-ski argues that the state stolen vehicle conviction \u201cshould not have been included in the calculation of his criminal history, and, therefore [its inclusion] resulted in an erroneous sentence.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">We review a district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines to the facts under a \u201cdue deference\u201d standard, while reviewing the overall application of the guidelines for \u201cerrors of law,\u201d subject to a <em>de novo </em>review. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>900 F.2d 1442, 1445 (10th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Kirk, </em>894 F.2d 1162, 1163 (10th Cir.1990). We begin, as with statutory interpretation, with the language of the guidelines, and move to the Commentary, and Supplementary Illustrations in instances of ambiguity. <em>See Smith, </em>900 F.2d at 1446-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">For purposes of calculating the criminal history score, a \u201cprior sentence\u201d is \u201cany sentence previously imposed upon adjudication of guilt, ..., <em>for conduct not part of the instant offense.\u201d </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(1) (emphasis added). Clearly, the state court sentence can be deemed a \u201cprior sentence\u201d even though it was imposed between the date of the instant federal offense and the date of the federal sentencing. <em>See Smith, </em>900 F.2d at 1446-48 (10th Cir.1990). As noted in <em>Smith, </em>the Commentary to \u00a7 4A1.2 explains that \u201c[a] sentence imposed after the defendant\u2019s commencement of the instant offense, but prior to sentencing on the offense, is a prior sentence if it was for conduct other than conduct that was part of the instant offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1447 (quoting Application Note 1). Thus, Banashefski may only succeed on appeal if his state conviction was for conduct that constitutes a part of the instant federal felon in possession offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">Banashefski argues that the state stolen vehicle offense was \u201cconduct that was part of the instant offense\u201d because at the time of his arrest, his possession of the shotgun in the trunk was constructive, and thus, \u201cimplied because he was driving the car.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Brief at 6. Moreover, he argues, since the original state charges included an alleged violation of the state\u2019s own felon in possession statute, this further proves that the offenses arose from the same conduct. Banashefski cites, by analogy, guidelines cases construing \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2), dealing with \u201crelated cases,\u201d and argues that the Sentencing Commission intended to treat offenses occurring on a single occasion, or as part of a common scheme, as involving the same conduct for sentencing purposes. However, neither the instant facts, nor the authorities cited, persuade us that Banashefski\u2019s two possessory offenses involved a single act of conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-15\">First, and foremost, Banashefski mis-characterizes the evidence against him as constituting only proof of his \u201cconstructive possession\u201d of the firearm. During his plea colloquy where the district court ascertained the factual basis for his guilty plea, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>Banashefski stated: \u201cOn September 16th, 1988, I possessed a firearm in Valencia County, New Mexico, and I\u2019ve been convicted of a felony in the past.\u201d Transcript of Proceedings, dated August 29, 1989. This statement, coupled with the uncontested observations of the surveilling Belen detectives established that Banashefski physically carried the shotgun, albeit secreted in the brown suitcase, out of the motel room. As shown by the record, the suitcase and weapon, placed in the trunk by Banashef-ski, remained undisturbed until he was stopped driving the stolen car a short time later.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Thus, there was nothing \u201cconstructive\u201d about his possession of the shotgun, in that he was actually seen carrying the suitcase holding it, and has implicitly admitted knowing it was in the suitcase. Indeed, on these facts, there could be no other basis for admitting his knowledge. That he, shortly thereafter, also exercised possesso-ry control over the stolen car is irrelevant to the existence of his federal crime. That crime, felon in possession, was complete <em>before </em>he approached the car, and continued as well. The after-the-fact discovery of a possessory offense does not detract from the unlawfulness of the earlier act of possession. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Massey, </em>687 F.2d 1348, 1354 (10th Cir.1982) (defendant convicted of unlawful possession of marijuana he harvested earlier the same day even though he was not in the transporting car upon discovery); <em>United States v. Henry, </em>468 F.2d 892 (10th Cir. 1972) (defendant, observed by police driving a <em>motor </em>home, subsequently convicted of possession with intent to distribute narcotics later discovered in the abandoned vehicle). Banashefski\u2019s knowing violation of the felon in possession statute involved separate conduct within the meaning of \u00a7 4A1.2 \u2014 conduct which was \u201cnot part of the instant offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Admittedly, this would be a more difficult case had Banashefski not been observed before entering the stolen car and had his only link to the shotgun been its mere presence in the trunk.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But as noted, there were two severable instances of unlawful possessory conduct which support treating the state conviction as a \u201cprior sentence\u201d under the guidelines. Since there were severable instances of unlawful conduct, the fact that the state initially brought multiple charges against Banashefski for the events of September 16 adds nothing to his argument on appeal.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">Nor do the cases cited by Banashefski provide a basis for upsetting the sentence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>These cases construe the term \u201crelated cases\u201d used in \u00a7 4Al.2(a)(2). It is true that \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) provides that \u201cPrior sentences imposed in related cases are to be treated as one sentence for purposes of the criminal history.\u201d According to the Application Notes commentary, cases are considered related if, <em>inter alia, </em>they \u201coccurred on a single occasion.\u201d However, as we explain, here the possessory acts are separable.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Moreover, the basic issue here concerns whether there was a \u201cprior sentence,\u201d and \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(l) of the Guidelines says this means any sentence previously imposed \u201cfor conduct not part of the instant offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>909 F.2d 389, 392 (9th Cir.1990), points out that the commentary that \u201cCases are considered related if they (1) occurred on a single occasion\u201d was meant to explain the term \u201crelated cases\u201d used in \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2), but that there is no indication that the commentary was intended to define the words \u201cconduct not a part of the instant offense\u201d used in \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(l). The <em>Garcia </em>opinion rejected a contention that a state sentence for possession of a drug was imposed for conduct that was part of the same offense, a federal charge of possession of counterfeit money seized from the defendant Garcia in the same arrest where the drug was seized. <em>Id. </em>at 392. <em>But see United States v. Jones, </em>899 F.2d 1097, 1101 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 111 S.Ct. 275, 112 L.Ed.2d 230 (1990). The analysis under another statute in <em>United States v. Schieman, </em>894 F.2d 909, 913 (7th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 111 S.Ct. 155, 112 L.Ed.2d 121 (1990), cited by Banashefski, supports treating the two instances of possessory conduct here as severable.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">Finally, Banashefski\u2019s reference to the guidelines\u2019 Supplementary Illustrations is equally unconvincing. He directs our attention to the Illustrations for what he apparently presents as a parallel example to his own case. Under the heading \u201cPrior Sentence Defined\u201d he cites Example A.3 which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">The instant offense (a bank robbery) was committed on 11-1-87. The defendant is to be sentenced on 4-1-88. The defendant\u2019s criminal history includes a conviction on a state charge of possession of stolen property (the money taken during the instant offense). On 2-15-88, the defendant was sentenced to imprisonment for one year for that offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-13\">No criminal history points are assigned for the sentence imposed on 2-15-88. A \u201cprior sentence\u201d does not include a sentence for conduct that was a part of the instant offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-14\">Supplementary Illustrations, Criminal History, at 2 (emphasis and citations omitted). This example, however, reaches too far beyond the instant facts to be applied here. As the government points out, \u201c[t]his example would apply here if the firearm was stolen and Banashefski had been convicted in state court for possession of the stolen firearm.\u201d Brief of Appellee at 9. On the record facts before us, this example is inap-posite here.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-15\">In sum, we hold that the possessory acts of conduct in this case are separable and the district court did not err by using the sentence imposed for the state stolen vehicle conviction as a \u201cprior sentence\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(l). That prior sentence was \u201cfor conduct not part of the instant offense,\u201d \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(l). The court sentenced Banashefski to 21 months, the maximum allowable within the selected guideline range. In doing so, the court noted his \u201ccontinuous disrespect\u201d for the law and the presence of several other firearms accessible to him in the stolen car. These uncontroverted findings support a sentence at the top of the guideline range. Accordingly, the sentence imposed by the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b446-7\">. Banashefski also moved for downward departure, alleging that had the state and federal charges been consolidated, his subsequent sentences on the stolen vehicle and firearm charges would have been imposed concurrently. Thus, he argued below, the consecutive sentences he would now receive resulted solely from the delay in bringing the federal charges \u2014 a situation not contemplated by the Sentencing Guidelines Commission. The district court did not depart downward and Banashefski does not present this argument on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b447-10\"><em>. </em>Had the state stolen vehicle sentence been omitted, Banashefski would have been placed within criminal history category V, with a resultant guideline range of 12 to 18 months. On appeal, he argues for a sentence correction within this range.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b448-5\">. To date, few courts have directly addressed the meaning of the \"prior sentence\" provision of \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(l). In <em>United States v. Garcia, </em>909 F.2d 389 (9th Cir.1990), the defendant, stopped by police for speeding, was arrested for possession of a small amount of methamphetamine and a bundle of counterfeit $50 bills. Without elaboration, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the federal sentence for possession of counterfeit money over Garcia's objection that his sentence should not be augmented by the \u201cprior sentence\u201d incurred by his state conviction for possession of the methamphetamine. <em>See id. </em>at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>913 F.2d 313 (6th Cir.1990), the defendant appealed the use of his state court drug conviction as a \"prior sentence\" to augment his federal sentence for involvement in a continuing criminal enterprise (\"CCE\u201d). The conduct for which Crosby was prosecuted in state court also had established an element of the CCE charge. The <em>Crosby </em>court admitted that \"[ujnder a natural reading of the guidelines, conduct that is an element of an offense would normally be considered 'part' of that offense\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(l). Nevertheless, the court affirmed the federal sentence, noting that the guidelines specifically contemplated the special situation presented by CCE prosecutions. <em>See id. </em>at 314-16. <em>But cf., United States v. Belton, </em>890 F.2d 9, 11 (7th Cir.1989) (dicta noting that had the defendant been sentenced for federal drug conspiracy under U.S. S.G. Chapter 4, his state conviction for cocaine possession \"would not be a part of his criminal history usable to enhance his sentence.\u201d)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b448-11\">. The government\u2019s brief argues that the double jeopardy analysis in <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), is sufficient to show that the conduct is separate because the federal and state charges each involve proof of an element that the other does not. In light of the recent revision of double jeopardy analysis in <em>Grady v. Corbin, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 110 S.Ct. 2084, 109 L.Ed.2d 548 (1990), however, this approach is questionable. In any event, there is no double jeopardy question presented here because the convictions are by different sovereigns. <em>See Heath v. Alabama, </em>474 U.S. 82, 88-91, 106 S.Ct. 433, 437-439, 88 L.Ed.2d 387 (1985).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
