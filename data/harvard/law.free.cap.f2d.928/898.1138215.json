The Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) ruled that Hawaii\u2019s free, no-fault program violates section 1903(o) of the Social Security Act because it excludes medical coverage for welfare recipi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>ents and thus places Medicaid in the role of primary payer. The result of the Secretary\u2019s ruling was that Hawaii was denied certain federal matching funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">The Director of the Department of Human Services, State of Hawaii (Director) filed for declaratory and injunctive relief seeking judicial review of the Secretary\u2019s ruling. The district court denied the Director\u2019s request for relief and motion for summary judgment, and affirmed the Secretary\u2019s ruling. 720 F.Supp. 840 (1989). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">The facts are undisputed. Hawaii requires that all motor vehicles be covered by a no-fault insurance policy. The policy must provide minimum coverages of $15,-000 general no-fault (including medical), $35,000 liability, and $10,000 property damage. <em>See </em>Haw.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 431:100-103 (1989 Supp.); Haw.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 431.10C-301 (1987 Special Pamphlet).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-8\">Due to a concern that welfare recipients will not purchase automobile insurance, Hawaii requires insurers to provide free, no-fault automobile insurance policies to all licensed Hawaii drivers receiving public assistance. Haw.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 431:100-407 (1987 Special Pamphlet). The free, no-fault program, however, excludes welfare recipients from receiving any medical coverage under a free no-fault policy. Haw.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 431:10C-103(10)(A) (1989 Supp.).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-9\">Title XIX of the Social Security Act (ACT), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 <em>et seq. </em>(1988), establishes a federal-state program known as \u201cMedicaid\u201d to enable states to provide medical assistance to low-income individuals. In 1977, Congress amended the Act through the Medicare-Medicaid Antifraud and Abuse Amendments (Amendments), Pub.L. No. 95-142, 91 Stat. 1175 (1977). Section 1903(o) of the Amendments provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b995-10\">Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, no payment shall be made to a State ... for expenditures for medical assistance provided for an individual under its State plan approved under this subchapter to the extent that a private insurer ... would have been obligated to provide such assistance but for a provision of its insurance contract which has the effect of limiting or excluding such obligation because the individual is eligible for or is provided medical assistance under the plan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b995-13\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(o) (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-14\">In March 1985, the United States General Accounting Office reviewed Hawaii\u2019s Medicaid program and concluded that Hawaii\u2019s insurance program placed Medicaid in the role of primary payer in violation of section 1903(o) of the Act. The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), which is responsible for ensuring compliance with Medicaid legislation, instituted a review of Hawaii\u2019s Medicaid program.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-15\">The particular claim underlying this declaratory relief action was reviewed and disallowed during the HCFA review. On May 2,1981, a car driven by Queenie Kana-kanue, a welfare recipient, was struck by a car driven by Eric Pule. The front seat passenger, Alice Bras, also a welfare recipient, was severely injured. As a welfare recipient, Ms. Bras was able to collect medical coverage only from Mr. Pule\u2019s insurance policy. Ms. Bras accumulated $14,000 of unpaid medical expenses that were covered by Medicaid. Settlement funds from a lawsuit initiated by Ms. Bras reduced the $14,000 amount to $5,897, of which $2,949 in matching funds were claimed by Hawaii.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-16\">HCFA found that the federal matching funds of $2,949 were claimed in violation of \u00a7 1903(o) and sought repayment. HCFA also requested that Hawaii identify any similar claims and refund any improper payments. On March 14, 1988, the Regional Administrator of HCFA notified Hawaii that the $2,949 would be disallowed. Hawaii appealed the disallowance to the Departmental Grant Appeals Board of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (Appeals Board or Board).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>On September 1, 1988, the Appeals Board issued a ruling upholding the disallowance.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-4\">On October 14, 1988, the Director filed a declaratory relief action seeking judicial review of the Board\u2019s disallowance ruling. The district court denied the Director\u2019s requested declaratory relief and the Director\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The district court affirmed the Board\u2019s ruling and granted summary judgment in favor of the Secretary. The Director timely appealed. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">A grant of summary judgment is reviewed <em>de novo. Ashton v. Cory, </em>780 F.2d 816, 818 (9th Cir.1986). We must determine \u201cwhether any genuine issue of material fact remains for trial and whether the district court correctly applied the substantive law.\u201d <em>State of Washington, Department of Social Services v. Heckler, </em>722 F.2d 1451, 1453 (9th Cir.1984). Judicial review of a ruling by the Appeals Board is limited to considering whether the Board committed a \u201cclear error of judgment\u201d and whether it considered the \u201crelevant factors.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">The Director argues that section 1903(o) is both silent and ambiguous as to whether it applies to Hawaii\u2019s free no-fault program. The Director\u2019s position is not persuasive. Although section 1903(o) is silent about whether it applies to Hawaii\u2019s free no-fault program, it is not ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-8\">We interpret section 1903(o) to prohibit provisions in insurance policies that deny medical coverage on the ground that an individual is a welfare recipient. There is no ambiguity in the language of section 1903(o). If a person would have received medical coverage under an insurance plan but for the fact that he is a welfare recipient, the state cannot receive matching funds to cover that person\u2019s medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-11\">No-fault automobile insurance policies in Hawaii must provide for medical coverage. Hawaii has, however, enacted a specific exception for its free no-fault policies that allows insurers to exclude medical welfare recipients from receiving medical coverage. The personal no-fault automobile insurance policy issued to Ms. Kanakanue under Hawaii's free no-fault plan contains a clause that states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b996-12\">A No-Fault policy issued to certified public assistance recipients at no cost under Hawaii Joint Underwriting Plan shall not include benefits under subpara-graph a., b. and c. for any person receiving public assistance benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b996-13\">Ms. Bras did not receive medical coverage under Ms. Kanakanue\u2019s free no-fault policy specifically because Ms. Bras was a welfare recipient. As a welfare recipient, she was excluded from receiving medical coverage by a specific provision in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-14\">The Director has failed to show that section 1903(o) is ambiguous or that section 1903(o) does not apply to Hawaii\u2019s free no-fault program. We therefore do not have to reach the question whether the Secretary's interpretation of section 1903(c) is reasonable. \u201cIf the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Chevron U.S.A. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781-82, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). As the Supreme Court has stated: \u201cCourts are not authorized to rewrite a statute because they might deem its effects susceptible of improvement.\u201d <em>Badaracco v. Commissioner, </em>464 U.S. 386, 398, 104 S.Ct. 756, 764, 78 L.Ed.2d 549 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-15\">Section 1903(o) unambiguously prohibits provisions in insurance policies that deny medical coverage on the sole ground that an individual is a welfare recipient. The automobile insurance policies issued under Hawaii\u2019s free no-fault program specifically exclude welfare recipients from receiving medical coverage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>therefore, correctly affirmed the ruling of the Appeals Board. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b995-11\">. The Appeals Board is responsible for hearing and deciding a State\u2019s request for reconsideration of a disallowance of federal funding. A decision by the Appeals Board is a final admin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>istrative action on a matter. <em>See </em>45 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-16.23 (1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b996-16\">. We emphasize, lest there be any doubt, that this is not a case where medical insurance is simply not a part of free policies issued to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>welfare recipient drivers. Medical insurance is part of the free no-fault policies, and only injured welfare recipients are excluded from coverage.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
