Munson, J., denying plaintiffs\u2019 application for an evidentiary hearing to determine the appropriate educational placement for their daughter Amy for the 1990-91 school year. Judge Munson denied plaintiffs\u2019 application on the ground that they did not present any compelling reasons justifying their failure to follow ordinary administrative procedures under the Education for the Handicapped Act (EHA), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1400 et seq., prior to seeking a determination from the district court. Plaintiffs argue that they have already exhausted administrative remedies with respect to their daughter\u2019s placement for the 1989-90 school year and that to require that they do so for 1990-91 will have the effect of delaying a final administrative decision beyond the point at which it can be meaningfully challenged in the district court. For reasons given below, we dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-21\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b177-22\">Amy Frutiger, now a 15-year old, has had a history of academic difficulties, although she was not classified as learning disabled until August 1988. Plaintiffs live in Hamilton, New York. At their request, the Hamilton Central School District\u2019s Committee on Special Education (CSE) agreed in July 1988 to pay for a private evaluation of Amy at Children\u2019s Hospital in Boston, Massachusetts. The results of that evaluation indicated that Amy suffered from language-based learning disabilities affecting her skills in spelling, gram<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>mar and reading comprehension. Following this evaluation, the CSE devised an individualized educational program (IEP) for Amy for the school year 1988-89, which placed her in a regular 7th grade class with a minimum of three hours of resource room services per week and the availability of counseling on an as-needed basis. The IEP was modified several times during the course of the 1988-89 school year to deal with difficulties that arose due to academic stress and deficiencies in reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">In June 1989, the CSE met to conduct its annual review of Amy\u2019s program and placement and to develop a new IEP for the 1989-90 academic year. The CSE proposed a continuation of the program adopted in 1988- 89 with the specification of only two additional annual goals: improvement of written language and successful completion of eighth grade. Plaintiffs objected to the CSE\u2019s recommendations and, pursuant to 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(b)(2), requested an impartial hearing, which was scheduled for the beginning of the 1989 school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">During the summer of 1989, plaintiffs placed Amy in a summer program at the Landmark School, a private residential school in Massachusetts that is not on the New York State Education Commissioner\u2019s list of approved schools. As a consequence of Amy\u2019s report to the staff at Landmark of an episode that occurred during the week of final examinations at Hamilton public school, her parents were advised that she \u201cwas at substantial risk emotionally.\u201d As a result, plaintiffs decided to continue to enroll Amy at Landmark for the 1989- 90 school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">An impartial hearing on the CSE\u2019s recommendation for Amy\u2019s placement at public school for 1989-90 was held on September 20 and October 12, 1989, pursuant to plaintiffs\u2019 earlier request in June. In a decision rendered in November 1989, the hearing officer concluded that the classification and placement recommended by the CSE was appropriate, that the residential placement at Landmark was not required and that plaintiffs should not be reimbursed by New York State for the cost of the placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">Pursuant to 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(c), plaintiffs appealed this decision to the Commissioner, who issued a ruling in March 1990. The Commissioner sustained the appropriateness of the CSE\u2019s classification of Amy as learning disabled, but found that its determination of her IEP was inadequate because it failed to set forth in sufficient detail her specific educational needs, e.g., with respect to the time to be spent for therapeutic counseling and resource room programs. The Commissioner held that because of this lack of specificity it was impossible to determine on the record before him whether Amy\u2019s program was appropriate. He therefore remanded the case to the CSE for further assessment of her emotional needs and recommendation of a more specific educational program. However, the Commissioner agreed with the decision of the hearing officer that a residential placement was not appropriate and that plaintiffs were not entitled to reimbursement for the cost of Landmark School. He reasoned that a residential placement was not the least restrictive alternative for Amy and that in any event Landmark is not an approved school' for the placement of New York State pupils with handicapping conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">In April 1990, shortly after the Commissioner\u2019s decision, plaintiffs commenced the present action against the School District and the Commissioner. Their complaint invoked the EHA and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and consisted of five separate causes of action. The first four raised issues concerning improprieties in the determination of Amy\u2019s IEP for the 1989-90 year, and the fifth raised issues concerning Amy\u2019s IEP thereafter. Plaintiffs requested the following relief: (1) that the district court make an appropriate determination of Amy\u2019s right to a free educational placement and program and direct defendants \u201cto carry out\u201d their respective \u201cresponsibilities\u201d; (2) that plaintiffs receive an award of money damages under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 against the School District for its violation of their procedural and substantive rights under the EHA by, among other things, causing plaintiffs to suffer extensive delays in their administrative proceedings; (3) that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Commissioner\u2019s action in remanding Amy\u2019s case to the CSE be declared in violation of the finality requirements of the EHA; and (4) that plaintiffs receive attorney\u2019s fees, costs and disbursements for undertaking the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">While the action was pending in the district court, the CSE commenced its review of Amy\u2019s educational program in compliance with the Commissioner\u2019s remand; by June 1990, the CSE developed a more specific program for Amy for the school year 1990-91 while working in consultation with plaintiffs. The new program recommended that Amy receive a minimum of five hours of individualized attention in the resource room per week and a minimum of two psychological counseling sessions per week of 30 minutes duration. The School District\u2019s Board of Education approved the program shortly thereafter and plaintiffs were so notified by letter on June 22, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Plaintiffs apparently did not agree with the CSE\u2019s program recommendation for the 1990-91 school year. However, they did not seek an administrative review before an impartial hearing officer. Rather, in August 1990 plaintiffs made an application to the district court, by order to show cause, seeking (1) an accelerated evidentia-ry hearing to determine Amy\u2019s placement for the 1990-91 school year, and (2) summary judgment against the Commissioner, presumably for his alleged violation of the finality requirement of the EHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">In a decision issued from the bench on September 4, 1990, Judge Munson denied plaintiffs\u2019 application for an evidentiary hearing to determine Amy\u2019s educational placement for 1990-91. The judge held that plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies under the EHA before seeking review of an educational placement decision in federal court. He stated that whatever impact the Commissioner\u2019s decision to remand to the CSE regarding the 1989-90 school year may have had on plaintiffs\u2019 right to a timely placement for that period, it did not excuse them from exhausting administrative remedies with respect to the appropriate placement for 1990-91. Judge Munson also expressed doubt that the Commissioner\u2019s remand to the CSE violated the finality requirements of the EHA. Thereafter, in an order dated September 10, 1990, the judge reaffirmed his denial of an evidentiary hearing to determine Amy\u2019s educational placement for 1990-91, and denied plaintiffs\u2019 motion to certify an interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">Defendants-appellees School District and the Commissioner argue to us that we must dismiss the appeal because the order of the district court under attack is not appealable: Plaintiffs-appellants apparently claim that the order is appealable only because their application in the district court constituted a motion for a preliminary injunction, denial of which is appeal-able under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). We believe that defendants have the better of this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">It is worth noting that in the district court the plaintiffs never characterized their application as a motion for a preliminary injunction, nor did the district court treat it as such. On the contrary, the judge regarded the application as a request for a special evidentiary hearing that would circumvent certain steps in the administrative procedure of the EHA. Also, after the district court denied their application plaintiffs sought certification under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), a tacit recognition that they were not entitled to an appeal as of right under \u00a7 1292(a)(1). Only by retrospectively characterizing their motion as one for injunctive relief can plaintiffs now argue that the district court\u2019s decision falls within the class of orders that are appealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">More fundamentally, the district court did not grant, modify or deny a request for preliminary injunctive relief. Rather, it ruled that it would be improper for it to hold a hearing to determine an appropriate placement for Amy for the 1990-91 school year because plaintiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, a requirement that is \u201cnormally\u201d a jurisdiction<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>al prerequisite under \u00a7 1415(e)(2) of the EHA for judicial review of a recommended educational program and placement. <em>Honig v. Doe, </em>484 U.S. 305, 326-27, 108 S.Ct. 592, 605-06, 98 L.Ed.2d 686 (1988). The district court\u2019s order thus operates, in effect, as a stay of that portion of plaintiffs' action involving Amy\u2019s 1990-91 placement, pending plaintiffs\u2019 required exhaustion of their administrative remedies. No hearing was held on the merits of the parties\u2019 claims concerning the appropriateness of the School District\u2019s recommended placement of Amy for that year or on the propriety of preliminary injunctive relief with respect to her placement.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">It is well settled that an order of the district court that merely continues a case and does not reach the merits of parties\u2019 opposing claims is merely a step in the processing of a case and does not fall within the range of interlocutory orders appeal-able under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). See, e.g., <em>Switzerland Cheese Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. E. Horne\u2019s Market, Inc., </em>385 U.S. 23, 25, 87 S.Ct. 193, 195, 17 L.Ed.2d 23 (1966); <em>International Products Corp. v. Koons, </em>325 F.2d 403, 406 (2d Cir.1963); <em>Ramirez v. Rivera-Dueno, </em>861 F.2d 328, 334 (1st Cir. 1988), cert. denied, \u2014 U.S. \u2014, 110 S.Ct. 73, 107 L.Ed.2d 40 (1989). The Ninth Circuit has pointed out the significance for appellate jurisdiction of the distinction between interlocutory orders that are injunctive and those that are procedural:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">An injunction may be defined as an order that is directed to a party, enforceable by contempt, and designed to accord or protect some or all of the substantive relief sought by a complaint in more than temporary fashion. It is to be contrasted with an order by a court that regulates the conduct of the litigation, which is not considered an injunction for the purposes of appellate jurisdiction, even though punishable by contempt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-8\"><em>Gon v. First State Insurance Co., </em>871 F.2d 863, 865-66 (9th Cir.1989) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">It is clear to us that the district court\u2019s order here is procedural rather than injunc-tive and thus not appealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(1). The court denied the relief requested, i.e., an evidentiary hearing. The court made no final or preliminary determination regarding plaintiffs\u2019 substantive claims, either with respect to Amy\u2019s placement for the 1990-91 year or, for that matter, with respect to the placement for the 1989-90 year and plaintiffs' EHA and \u00a7 1983 claims against the School District and the Commissioner with regard to that earlier year. These latter claims remain before the district court, awaiting further adjudication. The court\u2019s order was not directed to either party for the purpose of according or denying protection to their substantive rights as delineated in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">Furthermore, it is well established that an order granting or denying a stay to await the result of proceedings pending before an agency is not the grant or denial of an injunction, and consequently such an order is not appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). See <em>Pepper v. Miani, </em>734 F.2d 1420, 1421 (10th Cir.1984); see generally 9 J. Moore, B. Ward &amp; J. Lucas, Moore\u2019s Federal Practice \u00b6 110.20[4.-3]. In sum, we conclude that the district court\u2019s order is not appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). See also <em>David D. v. Dartmouth School Committee, </em>775 F.2d 411, 424 (1st Cir.1985), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1140, 106 S.Ct. 1790, 90 L.Ed.2d 336 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-12\">It is possible to argue \u2014 although plaintiffs do not \u2014 that the order here is appealable because in fact it amounted to dismissal of the fifth cause of action in the complaint, which apparently sought relief with respect to the 1990-91 school year. However, this mischaracterizes the order, which did not deny relief on the merits but postponed consideration of the issues. Moreover, even if the order were characterized as a dismissal of one cause of action, the others still remain. Under the circumstances there is no right to an appeal unless the district court grants certification under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b), which it has not done. Similarly, to the extent that the district court\u2019s decision can be regarded as a tacit denial of plaintiffs\u2019 motion for summary judgment against the Commissioner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>such a denial is not appealable as a matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Finally, it does remain within our discretion to treat defendants\u2019 appeal as a petition for mandamus under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a), seeking immediate issuance of an order to the district court to conduct the requested evidentiary hearing concerning Amy\u2019s 1990-91 placement. See <em>Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., </em>485 U.S. 271, 288-89, 108 S.Ct. 1133, 1143, 99 L.Ed.2d 296 (1988); <em>Ramirez v. Rivera-Dueno, </em>861 F.2d at 334. However, as the Supreme Court emphasized in <em>Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., </em>issuance of the writ is justified only in \u201cexceptional circumstances amounting to a judicial usurpation of power,\u201d 485 U.S. at 289, 108 S.Ct. at 1143, and such circumstances do not apply in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Accordingly, we decline to reach the merits of the issues raised by plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. Nevertheless, we are sympathetic to plaintiffs\u2019 plight, and are troubled by the pattern of delay that plagued plaintiffs\u2019 attempt to secure a final administrative determination of Amy\u2019s program and placement for the school year 1989-90. It is significant that after utilizing their administrative remedies for 1989-90, plaintiffs never even formally received a final determination for Amy\u2019s IEP for that year; upon remand from the Commissioner\u2019s decision of March 1990, the CSE recommended a revised IEP for the 1990-91 school year, since so much time had already elapsed that it was no longer practical to formulate plans for 1989-90. We do not doubt that the frustration caused by this experience induced plaintiffs to bypass the administrative process in challenging the CSE\u2019s recommended IEP for 1990-91 and to seek immediate review in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">As we have made clear, the various causes of action in plaintiffs\u2019 complaint with regard to the 1989-90 year are still pending in the district court. The issues raised by these causes of action include whether the Commissioner violated the EHA by remanding the administrative proceeding to the CSE or by delaying his decision well beyond the period allowed by the relevant regulations<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or by refusing a residential placement for Amy and reimbursement of plaintiffs for the cost of Landmark School. For all practical purposes, as defendants seem to concede, the administrative record for the 1989-90 year appears to be complete and the issues just mentioned appear to raise principally questions of law. In his oral ruling on plaintiffs\u2019 application, the district court has already expressed a view on the first of these issues, but timely decisions on all of them, particularly the last, will have a significant effect on the litigation regarding 1990-91 and subsequent years.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">The welfare of a child is at stake here, and we urge the parties, under the strong guidance of the district court, to attempt to bring matters to a head, although in an orderly way, and to cooperate in doing so. See <em>Tucker v. Bay Shore Union Free School Dist., </em>873 F.2d 563, 567 (2d Cir. 1989). Time and effort have been spent on matters that did not require it. For example, the parties in this court contradict each other on whether the record of the administrative proceedings for the 1989-90 year has actually been filed in the district court pursuant to 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(e)(2). This is certainly a matter that the district court can determine without further ado. More fundamentally, plaintiffs are entitled to a decision with respect to the issues they raised regarding the 1989-90 school year, and the district court should render such a determination as expeditiously as possible. We realize that the procedures of the EHA are \u201cponderous,\u201d <em>Burlington School Committee v. Massachusetts Dept. of Ed., </em>471 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>U.S. 359, 370, 105 S.Ct. 1996, 2003, 85 L.Ed.2d 385 (1985), but they cannot be allowed to create a Catch 22, in which the requirement of exhaustion of administrativ remedies prevents concerned parents from ever obtaining timely judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">It is well settled that parents may bypass the administrative review process where exhaustion would be futile or inadequate, <em>Honig v. Doe, </em>484 U.S. at 327, 108 S.Ct. at 606; <em>Smith v. Robinson, </em>468 U.S. 992, 1014 n. 17, 104 S.Ct. 3457, 3469 n. 17, 82 L.Ed.2d 746 (1984). Thus, if state administrative bodies persistently fail to render- expeditious decisions as to a child\u2019s educational placement, district courts have the power under \u00a7 1415(e)(2) to assume jurisdiction over the review process on the grounds that exhaustion would be futile or inadequate and thereafter make a final determination as to a child\u2019s program and placement. As we have explained above, because plaintiffs\u2019 August 1990 application did not seek injunctive relief and neither the court nor the parties treated it as such, we have not reached the issue whether Judge Munson would have been justified in applying that doctrine here with respect to the 1990-91 school year. We note, however, that there was considerable support in the record to warrant taking such a step. If similar delays, for which plaintiffs are not responsible, continue with respect to exhaustion of administrative remedies, nothing said here should be construed as foreclosing the district court from applying this doctrine in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction. The School District\u2019s application for damages, including attorney\u2019s fees, under Fed.R.App.P. 38 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1912 is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b181-8\">. Federal regulations pursuant to the EHA state that parents of a handicapped child have the right to (1) a final decision not later than 45 days after the receipt of a request for an impartial due process hearing on their child\u2019s recommended IEP, and (2) a final decision in an impartial review of this hearing by the relevant State educational agency not later than 30 days after the receipt of a request for such a review. 34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 300.506, 300.510, 300.512. It thus appears that the regulatory scheme of EHA contemplates completion of a two-tier administrative review of a child\u2019s IEP within a period of roughly two and one-half months.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
