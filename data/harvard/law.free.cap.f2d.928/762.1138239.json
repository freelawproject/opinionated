Whether the evidence found by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) during the inspection of National\u2019s and Meroe\u2019s work site should be excluded because OSHA violated the companies\u2019 constitutional rights by extending their inspection beyond the \u201cplain view\u201d limits imposed by the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-17\">2. Whether substantial evidence supports the review commission judge\u2019s decision that National and Meroe violated various standards of the Act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-18\">3. Whether the judge erred in failing to grant National\u2019s and Meroe\u2019s motions for summary judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b860-19\">We conclude that the review commission judge properly decided all of these matters and the petition to review should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-21\">National is a construction company which was under contract to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from 1986-1988 to construct a flood control project on Mill Creek in Cincinnati, Ohio. Meroe, a subsidiary of National, was a sub-contractor on this job at the time the inspection occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-22\">On October 21, 1986, an accident occurred on the site when the boom of a concrete pump truck operated by a National employee contacted an energized overhead power line. Because OSHA\u2019s policies and procedures require a comprehensive inspection whenever an accident occurs in a \u201chigh hazard\u201d industry such as construction operations, OSHA, with the consent of the Army Corps of Engineers, began an inspection of the site on October 23, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-23\">OSHA officials did not complete their comprehensive inspection at this time because National Engineering obtained a stay of the inspection on October 24, 1986. This stay was lifted on March 11, 1987. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>April 20, 1987, OSHA issued citations against National but an administrative law judge vacated these citations on May 3, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">OSHA then voluntarily stayed the investigation until the resolution of National\u2019s litigation challenge to the Corps\u2019 authority to consent to an inspection and OSHA\u2019s authority to inspect a project supervised by the Corps. On November 20, 1987, the district court dismissed National\u2019s complaint. National appealed but voluntarily dismissed the appeal on March 15, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">On May 3, 1988, OSHA attempted to complete its comprehensive inspection. It did not seek or obtain a new warrant for access to the job site to conduct the inspection but instead relied on the court order. National refused OSHA access, but the inspection was conducted nevertheless when OSHA again obtained the consent of the Army Corps of Engineers and secured an order from the United States District Court allowing a \u201cplain view\u201d inspection within five days. <em>National Eng\u2019g &amp; Contracting Co. v. United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>687 F.Supp. 1219 (S.D. Ohio 1988). This court affirmed the district court\u2019s order on May 8, 1990, <em>National Eng\u2019g &amp; Contracting Co. v. United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>902 F.2d 34 (table) (6th Cir. May 8, 1990) (unpublished slip op. at Nos. 88-3612, 88-3721), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 111 S.Ct. 344, 112 L.Ed.2d 308 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">Following its inspection, OSHA issued citations alleging that both Meroe and National were liable for each of six \u201cserious\u201d violations of mandatory safety standards promulgated under the OSH Act. National was also charged with seven other serious and one \u201cnonserious\u201d violation. The compliance officers found some of these violations to be obvious, but other violations were apparent only after the compliance officers\u2019 initial observations led them to look more closely at equipment or to question employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">National and Meroe contested these citations in a hearing before an OSHRC judge. The Commission judge held that OSHA conducted a proper inspection of the site based on the Corps\u2019 sufficient consent and the compliance officers\u2019 permissible \u201cplain view\u201d procedures. The judge further found that National had committed eight of the \u201cserious\u201d violations and one \u201cnonserious\u201d violation, and that Meroe had committed five of the six cited violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-12\">A. Constitutionality of the Inspection</p>\n<p id=\"b861-13\">Because the appellants appeal from a denial of a motion to suppress, we must consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the government. <em>United States v. Oates, </em>560 F.2d 45, 49 (2d Cir.1977). OSHA authorizes two types of inspections: an inspection pursuant to a general administrative plan, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 657(a), and an inspection pursuant to an employee complaint, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 657(f). Because the accident of October 21, 1986, triggered OSHA\u2019s administrative policy of inspecting accident sites, this inspection was conducted, pursuant to a general administrative plan. <em>National Eng\u2019g, </em>687 F.Supp. at 1222. The inspection case did not require a warrant because OSHA was acting with the Corps\u2019 consent. <em>See Marshall v. Barlow\u2019s, Inc., </em>436 U.S. 307, 316, 98 S.Ct. 1816, 1822, 56 L.Ed.2d 305 (1978); <em>Donovan v. A.A. Beiro Constr. Co., </em>746 F.2d 894, 898 (D.C.Cir.1984). The Corps, as the contractor of a multi-employer construction site, \u201cpossessed common authority over ... the premises or effects sought to be inspected\u201d and thus could validly consent to OSHA\u2019s inspection. <em>Beiro, </em>746 F.2d at 898 (quoting <em>United States v. Matlock, </em>415 U.S. 164, 171, 94 S.Ct. 988, 993, 39 L.Ed.2d 242 (1974)).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-14\">In ordering the inspection, the district court stated that: \u201cOSHA shall be allowed only to complete the standard administrative \u2018plain sight\u2019 search interrupted by the filing of this lawsuit, in that the inspection shall not exceed five days in duration and shall proceed with normal \u2018plain sight\u2019 procedures.\u201d <em>National Eng\u2019g &amp; Contracting Co. v. United States Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>687 F.Supp. at 1222. No other limitations were placed on the inspection. Elsewhere in its opinion the court referred to OSHA\u2019s obligation to conduct \u201ca comprehensive inspec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>tion\u201d whenever an accident occurs in a \u201chigh hazard industry,\u201d such as construction, and that because of the pending litigation, OSHA had not completed this mandatory \u201ccomprehensive inspection\u201d until June 1988. <em>Id. </em>at 1221.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">Although the district court referred to \u201cthe standard administrative 'plain sight\u2019 search\u201d and \u201cnormal \u2018plain sight\u2019 procedures,\u201d neither the Act nor its regulations refer to \u201cplain view\u201d or \u201cplain sight\u201d inspections or procedures. The \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine, developed by the Supreme Court in <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971), provides that an official who is otherwise authorized to search an individual\u2019s property may further inspect, without a warrant, those matters which he can plainly view. The plain view doctrine \u201cmay not be used to extend a general exploratory search from one object to another until something incriminating at last emerges.\u201d <em>Coolidge, </em>403 U.S. at 466, 91 S.Ct. at 2038. Recently, the Supreme Court further limited this doctrine by requiring police to have probable cause to believe that the item in question is evidence of a crime. <em>Arizona v. Hicks, </em>480 U.S. 321, 107 S.Ct. 1149, 94 L.Ed.2d 347 (1987). In <em>Hicks, </em>a police officer, while searching an apartment in response to reports of gunfire, suspected that a stereo was stolen and lifted it slightly to observe and record the serial numbers. The court held that such a separate search, involving the moving, touching, or further inspection of equipment, was unjustified unless the officer had probable cause to believe that the stereo was stolen. Based on this case, the appellants argue that the compliance officers overstepped the scope of the ordered inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">The appellee, the Secretary of Labor, argues that the compliance officers adhered to the law regulating OSHA plain view searches. The district court\u2019s order referred interchangeably to OSHA\u2019s authority to conduct \u201cplain view\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive\u201d searches. The court imposed no specific restrictions on the inspection aside from the five-day limitation. The Secretary contends that the court\u2019s \u201cplain view\u201d language</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-7\">was an expression of the practical limits of third party consent. The basis for accepting such consent is the judicial recognition that parties do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in premises that they share with another, particularly as to items or conditions in plain view within those premises.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">The D.C. Circuit\u2019s opinion in <em>Beiro, </em>746 F.2d 894, supports the Secretary's approach. In <em>Beiro, </em>a case also dealing with the legitimacy and scope of an OSHA general administrative search conducted pursuant to third party consent, the D.C. Circuit stated that \u201c[tjhere are limits on searches or inspections authorized by third party consent. While authority to consent to the search of a common area extends to most objects in plain view, it does not automatically extend to the interiors of every enclosed space within the area.\u201d <em>Beiro, </em>746 F.2d at 901-02. In the search at issue in <em>Beiro, </em>the compliance officers spoke with employees to confirm that a truck seat belt was inoperable, closely inspected a drill cord to note the inspection dates on the cord\u2019s colored tape, and tested an extension cord to confirm ineffective grounding. <em>Id. </em>at 902-03. These actions resemble those complained of in the present case: testing a cord to confirm reverse polarity, measuring a readily observable cut in an extension cord, and interviewing a worker regarding the hazard caused by the abrasion on the extension cord. Like the inspectors in <em>Bei-ro, </em>these compliance officers tested equipment and interviewed employees to confirm and document plainly observable violations. As the D.C. Circuit commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b862-9\">All of the equipment, here at issue, was in use in the open construction site. Areas of privacy exempted from third party consent have generally involved enclosed or secured places commonly used for preserving privacy. Beiro can hardly claim such an expectation of privacy in equipment being openly used on a large, multi-employer construction site. Furthermore, OSHA\u2019s right to inspect must necessarily include some right of closer ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>animation once an observation is made which justifies a reasonable suspicion that a violation exists____ The effectiveness of OSHA inspections would be largely eviscerated if compliance officers are not given some nominal right to follow up on observations of potential violations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b863-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 903. Although no case in the Sixth Circuit has followed the approach taken by the D.C. Circuit in <em>Beiro, </em>we believe its logic applies to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">The appellants, however, argue that <em>Arizona v. Hicks, </em>a subsequent Supreme Court case, not <em>Beiro, </em>should control. <em>Hicks, </em>though, involved a criminal case, governed by different standards than administrative inspections. As the Supreme Court explained in discussing the issuance of OSHA warrants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b863-7\">Probable cause in the criminal law sense is not required. For purposes of an administrative search such as this, probable cause justifying the issuance of a warrant may be based not only on specific evidence of an existing violation but also on a showing that \u201creasonable legislative or administrative standards for conducting ... an inspection are satisfied with respect to a particular [establishment].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"At-\"><em>Marshall, </em>436 U.S. at 320, 98 S.Ct. at 1824 (quoting <em>Camara v. Municipal Court, </em>387 U.S. 523, 538, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 1736, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967)). Moreover, moving the stereo in <em>Hicks </em>constituted \u201ca \u2018search\u2019 separate and apart from the search for the shooter, victims, and weapons that was the lawful objective of the officers\u2019 entry into the apartment\u201d and thus produced \u201ca new invasion of ... privacy unjustified by the exigent circumstance that validated the entry.\u201d <em>Hicks, </em>480 U.S. at 324-25, 107 S.Ct. at 1152-53. In the present case, closer examination of the equipment and speaking with employees was directly \u201c[]related to the objectives of the authorized intrusion,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 325, 107 S.Ct. at 1152, and within the \u201cwall-to-wall\u201d scope of administrative plan inspections. <em>See Marshall v. North American Car Co., </em>626 F.2d 320, 323 (3rd Cir.1980). Thus, although we believe it is a close case, we conclude, as did the lower court, that the officers did not impermissibly extend the scope of the inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-9\">B. Substantiality of the Evidence Supporting the Various Violations</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">1. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">In a case of this kind, a reviewing court\u2019s task is limited to determining whether the Commission\u2019s factual findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record taken as a whole, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a), and whether its legal conclusions are \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A). In making these determinations, the court should accord great deference to an expert agency\u2019s construction of the statute it administers, <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 844, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2782, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984), and to the credibility findings made by the administrative law judge, <em>Beavers v. Secretary of Health, Educ., and Welfare, </em>577 F.2d 383, 386 (6th Cir.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">2. Legal Framework of OSHA Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">The OSH Act requires that \u201c[e]ach employer ... shall comply with ... standards promulgated under this chapter.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 654(a)(2). To promote this remedial purpose of the statute, the Act and regulations must be liberally construed so as to afford workers the broadest possible protection. <em>Whirlpool Corp. v. Marshall, </em>445 U.S. 1, 13, 100 S.Ct. 883, 891, 63 L.Ed.2d 154 (1980). The Secretary establishes a violation of the Act\u2019s safety standards by proving that the standard applies to the cited conditions, the employer is not in com-pliancy, and the employees were exposed to the hazard. <em>Quality Stamping Prods. v. OSHRC, </em>709 F.2d 1093, 1099 (6th Cir.1983). To establish a \u201cserious\u201d violation, the Secretary must also show a substantial likelihood that an employee could suffer death or serious injury if an accident occurred because of the violation and that the employer knew, or with reasonable diligence could have known, of the violation. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(k); <em>Modern Drop Forge Co. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number><em>v. Secretary of Labor, </em>683 F.2d 1105, 1112 (7th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">The necessary showing that a particular standard applies depends upon the type of standard. Some standards, such as 29 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1926.300(a), .450(a)(1), and .602(a)(3)(i), require the Secretary to show that a hazard exists and that a reasonably prudent and safety-conscious employer would realize the cited condition is hazardous. <em>Ray Evers Welding v. OSHRC, </em>625 F.2d 726, 731 (6th Cir.1980). Most standards, however, only require the Secretary to show that the employer has not complied with their terms. <em>Bunge Corp. v. Secretary of Labor, </em>638 F.2d 831, 835 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">In this case, whether the cited conditions existed is not in dispute. The appellants do not contest the existence of the cited condition. They argue, however, that the conditions do not violate OSHA\u2019s standards because their equipment, despite the conditions, is safe for employee use. The expert agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute, not the employer\u2019s interpretation, is entitled to great deference. <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 844, 104 S.Ct. at 2782. Moreover, as we have said, the Act should be read broadly to afford workers the broadest possible protection. <em>Whirlpool, </em>445 U.S. at 13, 100 S.Ct. at 891. Since the Secretary has shown the existence of the cited conditions, a failure of the employer to comply with the Act, and employee exposure to the hazard, National and Meroe cannot escape liability by claiming that they do not believe their failure to comply with the language of the regulations constitutes a violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">C. Denial of Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">Finally, the appellants contend that OSHRC erred by denying their motion for summary judgment. On appeal, the standard for reviewing this denial is whether the court abused its discretion in denying the motion. <em>Pinney Dock &amp; Trans. Co. v. Penn Cent. Corp., </em>838 F.2d 1445, 1472 (6th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 880, 109 S.Ct. 196, 102 L.Ed.2d 166 (1988). Upon review of agency decisions, the appellate court may hold that the agency abused its discretion if no evidence supports the decision, or if the agency misapplied the law. <em>Oakland County Bd. of Comm\u2019rs v. United States Dep't of Labor, </em>853 F.2d 439, 442 (6th Cir.1988). In this case, we do not believe that the agency abused its discretion in denying the summary judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">First, the Secretary makes a strong argument that any review of the denial is mooted by the subsequent full trial of the matter. In 1990, our circuit held that \u201cwhere summary judgment is denied and the movant subsequently loses after a full trial on the merits, the denial of summary judgment may not be appealed.\u201d <em>Jarrett v. Epperly, </em>896 F.2d 1013, 1016 (6th Cir.1990). The appellants correctly point out that the facts of <em>Jarrett </em>differ from the present case: <em>Jarrett </em>involved the appellate review of a jury verdict following a pretrial ruling denying a motion for summary judgment, not, as in the present case, \u201can administrative hearing before an administrative law judge who had expressly reserved his ruling on the motion for summary judgment.\u201d It is not clear to us, however, why these differences are significant. The decision in <em>Jarrett </em>rested on logic which seems applicable to this case: \u201cwe believe it would be even more unjust to deprive a party of a jury verdict after the evidence was fully presented, on the basis of an appellate court\u2019s review of whether the pleadings and affidavits at the time of the summary judgment demonstrated the need for a trial.\u201d <em>Jarrett, </em>896 F.2d at 1016 n. 1 (quoting <em>Locricchio v. Legal Services Corp., </em>833 F.2d 1352, 1359 (9th Cir.1987)). This logic does not seem to be disturbed by the different factual circumstances under which the case arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-11\">Second, despite the appellants\u2019 argument to the contrary, it appears that the Secretary carried her burden of showing by \u201cdepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file\u201d that \u201cspecific facts show ... a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Celo-tex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 324, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2553, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e)). Although the Secretary\u2019s response to the appellants\u2019 mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>tions for summary judgment could have designated such facts in greater detail and at times simply states that she will show evidence supporting her differing position at trial, she does point to specific deposition testimony and alleges specific facts which show the existence of a genuine material dispute concerning the existence of the violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">For the forgoing reasons, the Commission\u2019s final order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
