The Secretary acquired the vessels as defaulted collateral under the Ship Mortgage Insurance Fund program in Title XI of the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended (\u201cthe Act\u201d). <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7\u00a7 1271-1280 (Supp.1989). Appellants asserted in district court that the Secretary violated two limitations on his sales authority contained in other provisions of the Act: \u00a7 705, which establishes a minimum price for the sale of vessels constructed with subsidies, and \u00a7 508, which imposes restrictions on competition in foreign commerce for vessels sold for scrap. Appellants alleged economic damage as a result of the sale, claiming that the sale of the vessels resulted in a subsidy to Belmont, which allowed Belmont to bid below the appellants for a contract to carry preference cargo under the Cargo Preference Act of 1954. 46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1241(b) (Supp.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">The district court found that \u00a7 1105(c) of the Act grants the Secretary broad discretion to sell vessels repossessed under Title XI at any price and under any terms it deems appropriate. Therefore, the Secretary did not violate \u00a7 508 or \u00a7 705 of the Act when it sold the vessels to Belmont. <em>See Liberty Maritime Corp. v. United States, </em>Civ.Action No. 88-3185, Memorandum Opinion (\u201cMem. op.\u201d) at 20. We agree. Because we find that there was no subsidy involved in the sale, we also reject appellants\u2019 Cargo Preference Act claim of economic harm. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">I. Statutory Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b510-13\">Congress enacted the Merchant Marine Act to \u201cfoster the development and encourage the maintenance\u201d of a merchant marine in the United States for domestic and foreign trade and military support. 46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1101. The Act aims to place \u201cAmerican shipowners on a parity with their foreign competitors, by equalizing the higher cost of building ships in the United States and operating them under American registry.\u201d S.Rep. No. 1721, 74th Cong., 2d Sess. 22 (1936). The statute provides government subsidies, as well as government-backed investments, to encourage the construction and operation of ships in the United States. The provisions of the Act at issue in this case include \u00a7 508 under Title V, \u00a7 705 under Title VII, and \u00a7 1105(c) under Title XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-14\">Title V of the Act provides subsidies for the price of vessels constructed specifically for a United States citizen who has applied to the Secretary for construction of a new vessel for use in foreign commerce. <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7\u00a7 1151-1161. Upon granting the application, the Secretary contracts with an American shipyard for the construction of the vessel for the purchaser. <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1152(a). The Secretary then sells the vessel to the purchaser at a price below the construction cost representing the difference between the actual cost of building a vessel in the United States and the estimated cost of building <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>the same vessel in a foreign shipyard. <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1152(b). The difference between the actual cost of construction and the sale price is called a \u201cconstruction-differential subsidy\u201d or \u201cCDS.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Secretary also places a lien on the remainder of the purchase price owed by the purchaser to protect the government\u2019s interest in the payment of the balance. <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1153.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">When a vessel becomes obsolete, the owner may apply to the Secretary to replace it with a newly constructed vessel. <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1157. Section 508 authorizes the Secretary to scrap or sell the old vessel, and then to authorize construction of a replacement vessel, after the Secretary has determined that the old vessel \u201cis of insufficient value for commercial or military operation to warrant its further preservation.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1158. In the event the purchaser of the old vessel decides not to scrap it, the purchaser must agree not to use that vessel to compete with U.S.-flag vessels in foreign commerce for ten years. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">Under Title VII the Secretary may directly acquire new or reconditioned vessels, constructed specifically for the government, and then charter or sell them. <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7\u00a7 1191-1206. Under \u00a7 705 the Secretary cannot sell an acquired vessel for less than the vessel\u2019s depreciated estimated foreign cost.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1195. Section 705 applies to vessels that have been newly constructed under Title VII or built under Title V and then repossessed because of the buyer\u2019s default on the Title V lien. <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 724, 76th Cong., 1st Sess. 11-12 (1939); H.R. Rep. No. 824, 76th Cong., 1st Sess. 10 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">Title XI establishes a government loan guarantee program to encourage private investment in the construction and rebuilding of ships. <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7\u00a7 1271-1280. As originally enacted, Title XI allowed the government to insure loans from private lenders to ship purchasers for the purchase price of the vessel. In 1972, Congress changed the nature of the government\u2019s participation from insurance to guaranteed bonds. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 92-507, 86 Stat. 909 (1972). Under the current statutory scheme of Title XI, the purchaser issues a bond to the bondholder, who in turn pays the purchase price for the ship. The bond is guaranteed by the government, and in the event of default, the bondholder may pursue the government for its claim. <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1274(a). The government holds a security interest in the purchased vessel in the form of a mortgage and may foreclose on that security interest when the buyer defaults. <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7\u00a7 1273(b), 1275. Title XI established the Federal Ship Financing Fund as a revolving fund to pay claims on the guaran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>teed bonds. <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1272. In order to maintain the solvency of the fund, Congress gave the Secretary the authority to collect fees and sell repossessed vessels and deposit the proceeds into the fund. This authority is set forth in \u00a7 1105(c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARi\">... Notwithstanding any other provision of law relating to the acquisition, handling, or disposal of property by the United States, the Secretary shall have the right, in his discretion, to complete, recondition, reconstruct, renovate, repair, maintain, operate, charter, or sell any property acquired by him pursuant to a security agreement with the obligor or may place a vessel in the national defense reserve. The terms of the sale shall be as approved by the Secretary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A5C\">46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1275(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">II. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">This case involves the sale of three U.S.flag oil tankers by the Secretary under Title XI of the Merchant Marine Act. The original shipowner purchased the vessels in 1972, financed in part by a construction subsidy under Title V, with the remainder of the purchase price funded with bonds guaranteed by the United States under Title XI. In return for the guarantee of the bonds, the United States held a security interest in the form of a first preferred mortgage on each vessel. As a result of the owner\u2019s default on the Title XI guaranteed bonds, the Secretary acquired the vessels. The Secretary solicited bids for the sale of the vessels, and sold all three vessels to Belmont for less than the vessels\u2019 scrap value and significantly less than the minimum price computed under \u00a7 705 of the Act. Belmont was the highest bidder that agreed to keep all three vessels in continued operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Appellants brought suit in the district court claiming that the sale to Belmont violated the minimum price requirement of \u00a7 705 and the noncompetition requirement of \u00a7 508. Appellants contended that the sale, without restrictions on price or competition, enabled Belmont to submit the lowest bid for a \u201cpreference cargo\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> contract in competition with appellants. Appellants allege that this \u201cunfair competition\u201d resulted in economic injury to them. Underlying their claim is the assertion that \u00a7 1105(c) does not preempt other provisions of law in the Merchant Marine Act, such as \u00a7 508 and \u00a7 705. The district court rejected all of appellants\u2019 assertions, denied appellants\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment, and granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, dismissing appellants\u2019 complaint on all counts. Mem. op. at 20. Appellants now appeal the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b512-10\">The Secretary asserts that \u00a7 1105(c) grants the Secretary \u201cdiscretion\u201d to dispose of vessels acquired under Title XI \u201cnotwithstanding any other provision of law\u201d and that such discretion allows him to sell Title XI vessels at a price and for terms that may not conform to other provisions within the Act. On its face, the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause appears to give the Secretary the broadest possible discretion. This court has interpreted similar \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language in other cases to supersede all other laws, stating that \u201c[a] clearer statement is difficult to imagine.\u201d <em>Crowley Caribbean Transport, Inc. v. United States, </em>865 F.2d 1281, 1283 (D.C.Cir.1989) (quoting <em>Illinois National Guard v. Federal Labor Relations Authority, </em>854 F.2d 1396, 1403 (D.C.Cir.1988)); <em>see also Colorado Nurses Ass\u2019n v. FLRA, </em>851 F.2d 1486, 1489-90 (D.C.Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">Appellants contend, however, that the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause only preempts laws relating generally to the sale of property by the United States, not to provisions in the Merchant Marine Act relating specifically to the sale of vessels. According to appellants, the Secretary\u2019s authority to sell repossessed vessels under Title XI allows the Secretary to override other general laws relating to property disposition, but it does not allow the Secretary to override <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>specific provisions elsewhere in the Act governing maritime policy. Such a reading fights the plain terms of \u00a7 1105(c) and essentially appends to the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause the proviso: \u201cexcept that the provisions of law in this Act which relate to the disposition of vessels <em>do </em>apply.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ArD\">The legislative history and the structure and purpose of the Act support the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of its plain language. <em>See K Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., </em>486 U.S. 281, 291-92, 108 S.Ct. 1811, 1817-18, 100 L.Ed.2d 313 (1988); <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984); <em>Coal Employment Project v. Dole, </em>889 F.2d 1127, 1131 (D.C.Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">In 1953, Congress amended \u00a7 1105<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to restrict the sale of mortgaged vessels to \u201ccompetitive bids for not less than the minimum sales price provided by the Merchant Marine Act, 1936, as amended.\u201d Pub.L. No. 83-288, 67 Stat. 626 (1953). Then, in 1972, when the government backing under Title XI was changed from insurance to guaranteed bonds, Congress deleted the minimum price restriction from \u00a7 1105(c) and added \u201c[t]he terms of the sale shall be as approved by the Secretary of [Transportation].\u201d Pub.L. No. 92-507, 86 Stat. 909 (1972). Both the deletion and addition appear to be complementary amendments intended to provide the Secretary with .broad discretion in the disposition of vessels acquired under Title XI. Congress explained that the 1972 amendment was intended to alter the nature of government backing and the corresponding nature of the Secretary\u2019s \u201crights in any security held by him relating to the guarantee security agreement with the obligor____\u201d S.Rep. No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>1137, 92d Cong., 2d Sess. 12 (1972), <em>reprinted in </em>1972 U.S. Code Cong. &amp; Admin. News 3851, 3861-62; H.R.Rep. No. 688, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 12 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Appellants claim that the 1972 amendments were not intended to change minimum price restrictions on the sale of vessels under Title XI, despite the fact that the Congress deleted from \u00a7 1105(c) the clause setting a minimum price. In doing so, appellants rely on the House and Senate Reports for the amendment, which state: \u201cno change in the present practice is contemplated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We read that bit of legislative history, however, <em>more </em>generally as merely indicating that Congress did not intend to alter the Secretary\u2019s \u201cpresent practice\u201d of guaranteeing financing for the construction of vessels, only its form. We think it is reasonable to conclude, as the Secretary does, that the remark did not relate to the pricing of repossessed vessels subsequently sold, and, therefore, that Congress deleted the minimum price provision intentionally. The addition of the sentence \u201c[t]he terms of the sale shall be as approved by the Secretary,\u201d to the end of \u00a7 1105(c) aids that construction by giving the Secretary wide discretion in setting sale price and terms that serve the purposes of the Act.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Appellants correctly note that ordinarily competing sections of a statutory scheme should be construed to give maximum effect to all provisions. <em>See Citizens To Save Spencer County v. EPA, </em>600 F.2d 844, 870 (D.C.Cir.1979). They contend that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation <em>o\u00ed </em>\u00a7 1105(c) essentially nullifies \u00a7 705 and \u00a7 508. According to the Secretary, however, \u00a7 705 and \u00a7 508 continue to apply to transactions other than those governed by \u00a7 1105(c) and so have continuing effect independent of \u00a7 1105(c). Section 705 applies to the sale of vessels acquired by the Secretary under Title VII of the Act, which allows the government to fund construction of new vessels for eventual government ownership and sale. Section 705 also applies to Title V vessels acquired by the Secretary from buyers of Title V vessels who defaulted on their payments. Congress did not, incidentally, indicate that \u00a7 705 should similarly apply to Title XI vessels. Therefore, construing \u00a7 1105(c) to preempt the minimum price restriction in \u00a7 705 does not nullify the impact of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">Section 508 provides the Secretary with the authority to scrap vessels or to sell them for scrap once the Secretary determines that the vessels are of insufficient value to warrant continued operation. The purpose of \u00a7 508 is to remove obsolete vessels from the United States Merchant Marine. 46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1158. The competitive restrictions in \u00a7 508, which preclude scrapped vessels from competing in foreign commerce for ten years, do not apply to vessels sold with the intention of continued operation; those restrictions apply only to vessels sold with the knowledge that they are going to be scrapped, not to be used to compete against other U.S.-flag ships. For example, under \u00a7 507 of the Act, the Secretary may authorize \u201cthe construction and sale of a new vessel to <em>replace </em>a vessel then operated in foreign trade or domestic trade, which in the judgment of the Secretary of Transportation should be replaced because it is obsolete or inadequate for successful operation in such trade\u201d 46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1157 (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1160 (acquisition of obsolete vessels). Because \u00a7 508 applies to vessels scrapped and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>placed under \u00a7 507, it operates without reference to \u00a7 1105(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Appellants also assert that \u00a7 508 applies to vessels sold for \u201cscrap value\u201d in addition to vessels sold for purposes of scrapping. Because the vessels sold to Belmont were sold for less than scrap value, appellants claim that \u00a7 508\u2019s restrictions should apply. Appellants point to no evidence in the plain language, the legislative history, or the purpose of the statute to support their contention that that is how \u00a7 508 must be read. The Secretary has decided in his discretion that \u00a7 508 does not apply to the sale of repossessed vessels under \u00a7 1105(c), and the issue before us is whether the Secretary\u2019s decision is reasonable. <em>See Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. at 2781. We hold that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">Overall, the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of his authority to sell repossessed vessels is fully consistent with the purposes of the Act. The primary purpose of the Act was expressly stated by Congress: \u201cIt is declared to be the policy of the United States to foster the development and encourage the maintenance of ... a merchant marine.\u201d 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101. The sale of vessels in this case comports with this primary purpose. As appellants point out, however, a further purpose of the Act (as evidenced by \u00a7 508 and \u00a7 705) is to protect unsubsidized U.S. shipowners from the unfair competition of subsidized U.S. shipowners. <em>See Seatrain Shipbuilding Corp. v. Shell Oil Co., </em>444 U.S. 572, 586-87, 100 S.Ct. 800, 808-09, 63 L.Ed.2d 36 (1980) (Congress was concerned about \u201cthe entry of subsidized vessels into the domestic trade\u201d because unsubsidized vessels would be \u201cunable to compete with new vessels enjoying the benefits of the 1936 Act.\u201d). Yet another goal in the Act is to maximize the proceeds from the sale of Title XI vessels in order to maintain the solvency of the revolving fund. Although we agree with appellants that \u00a7 1105(c) does not permit the wholesale disregard of the underlying policies of the Act, the Secretary has broad discretion to harmonize the provisions in a way that is consistent with the Act\u2019s overarching purpose. <em>See Seatrain, </em>444 U.S. at 585, 100 S.Ct. at 808 (holding that Congress intended to give the Secretary broad discretion to oversee the administration of the Act.). The Secretary did just that when he decided that keeping vessels operating in this instance was more important than maximizing profits and protecting domestic competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">Congress gave the Secretary \u201cbroad authority to oversee administration of the Act.\u201d <em>Seatrain, </em>444 U.S. at 585, 100 S.Ct. at 808. Where, as here, Congress has conferred such broad discretion on an agency, the agency\u2019s interpretation must be accepted \u201cunless it is manifestly unreasonable.\u201d <em>National Wildlife Federation v. Gorsuch, </em>693 F.2d 156, 174 (D.C.Cir.1982). Although the terms of the Secretary\u2019s sale to Belmont are in some tension with the policies underlying \u00a7 705 and \u00a7 508, they are not inconsistent with the Act\u2019s cardinal goal: to maintain an operating merchant marine. We agree with the district court that \u201c[i]t is neither arbitrary nor unreasonable for [the Secretary] to favor an operating vessel over the money generated by scrapping it.\u201d Mem. op. at 20. In sum, there is no evidence that Congress intended the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause to preempt only laws outside of the Merchant Marine Act (a necessary prerequisite to rebut the plain inference that Congress meant to preempt <em>all </em>other provisions of law, <em>see Consumer Product Safety Comm\u2019n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980)), and the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of its discretion under \u00a7 1105(c) is reasonable. We will consequently defer to his interpretation. <em>See Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. at 2781.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">IV. Cargo Preference Act Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">Appellants also sought declaratory relief in the district court from future competition by Belmont for preference cargo contracts under the Cargo Preference Act of 1954. <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 1241(b). Appellants claim that the Secretary is required to augment bids to reflect capital costs absorbed by the government in the sale of vessels under \u00a7 1105(c) when the sale price is below the minimum imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>by \u00a7 705. They base their claim on the Secretary\u2019s regulations, which prevent recipients of operating-differential subsidies (\u201cODS\u201d) from gaining an advantage over unsubsidized vessels when competing for cargos reserved to the U.S.-flag vessels under the Cargo Preference Act. <em>See </em>46 C.F.R. \u00a7 381.8 (1989). Having already found that the \u00a7 705 minimum price provision does not apply to \u00a7 1105(c), we cannot agree with appellants that the vessels were sold below a \u201cminimum price\u201d to create a \u201chidden subsidy.\u201d Therefore, the Secretary is under no obligation to augment Belmont\u2019s bids for preference cargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">The Secretary\u2019s decision to sell repossessed vessels under \u00a7 1105(c) to Belmont for a price below the minimum sale price computed by \u00a7 705 and without restrictions on competition set forth in \u00a7 508 was consistent with a reasonable interpretation of the discretion conferred on the Secretary by \u00a7 1105(c). When the Secretary sold the vessels to Belmont under \u00a7 1105(c), he balanced the conflicting policies underlying \u00a7 508 and \u00a7 705 with the overall purpose of the Act to maintain an operating merchant marine, an exercise that is completely within the Secretary\u2019s discretion under the Act.

Appellants maintain that Congress could have drafted the notwithstanding language to read \"notwithstanding any other provision <em>of this chapter </em>or any other Act ...\u201d if it intended to preempt other provisions within the Act itself. This is certainly true. <em>See, e.g., </em>the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2292(b); <em>see also Crowley Caribbean Transport, </em>865 F.2d at 1282. However, in <em>Crowley, </em>this court found that \"[t]he word <em>chapter ... </em>appears not to change the meaning [of the notwithstanding clause] in any pertinent way.\" <em>Crowley Caribbean Transport, </em>865 F.2d at 1282 n. 1 (emphasis added). Contrary to appellants' assertion then, the language \u201cnotwithstanding any other provision <em>of this chapter or any other Act </em>\u201d means the same thing as \"notwithstanding <em>any other provision of law.\" </em>The absence of the word \u201cchapter\u201d does not limit the scope of the preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">Appellants also contend that the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d language in \u00a7 1105(c) should be construed the same way as similar language in \u00a7 204(g) of the National Housing Act (\"NHA\"), 12 U.S.C.App. \u00a7 1710(g) (Supp.1990). For example, the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (\"HUD\u201d) discretion under \u00a7 204(g) to dispose of HUD-acquired projects is limited by the specific statutory mandate to seek better housing conditions for low-income groups. <em>See </em>12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701t; <em>Russell v. Landrieu, </em>621 F.2d 1037, 1041 (9th Cir.1980). In the NHA, Congress specifically declared \"that in the administration of those housing programs authorized by this Act ... the highest priority and emphasis should be given to meeting the housing needs of those families for which the national goal has not become a reality____\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1701t; <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441 (setting forth the national goal to provide \"a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family\"). This court found in <em>Russell </em>that although the Secretary of HUD does enjoy some level of discretion under the NHA, he must consider alternative methods of disposing of HUD property that will not conflict with the statutory mandate to provide low-income housing. <em>Russell, </em>621 F.2d at 1041. The court disagreed with the Secretary of HUD\u2019s assertion that his discretion to dispose of property was only limited by the requirement to protect the solvency of NHA\u2019s insurance fund, not by the overall policies and objectives of the NHA. However, the court found that \"[i]f disposition of the property as low-income housing is not feasible, then HUD has no obligation to dispose of the property in that manner.\" <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">The Merchant Marine Act contains no specific statutory mandate requiring that the Secretary's disposal of Title XI vessels comport with the policies underlying \u00a7 508 and \u00a7 705 (to protect domestic competition and to maximize sale proceeds for the fund). Moreover, in this case the Secretary of Transportation concedes that its discretion under \u00a7 1105(c) is limited by the primary purpose of the Act to maintain an operating merchant marine; he is not attempting to dispose of vessels in a manner that conflicts with that statutory mandate. <em>Russell v. Lan-drieu, </em>therefore, does not pose the same issue as this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b513-11\">. Before the 1972 amendment to Title XI of the Act, the statutory section containing the \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d clause was set out in \u00a7 1105(d). When Congress amended the Act in 1972 it moved the clause to \u00a7 1105(c). <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 92-507, 86 Stat. 909 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b514-6\">. With respect to our concurring colleague\u2019s criticism of this brief discussion of the legislative history of \u00a7 1105(c), we note only that we are doing so in response to a specific argument made by appellants based on their interpretation of the same history (Appellants' Brief at 32-33). Although we agree with our colleague that the meaning of \u00a7 1105(c) is clear, appellants\u2019 interpretation of the legislative history, if adopted, might raise a question of whether the meaning is so plain, after all. <em>See Consumer Product Safety Comm\u2019n v. GTE Sylvania, Inc., </em>447 U.S. 102, 108, 100 S.Ct. 2051, 2056, 64 L.Ed.2d 766 (1980) (plain language of the statute is regarded as conclusive \u201c[ajbsent a clearly expressed legislative intention to the contrary\u201d); <em>see also Public Citizen v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, </em>491 U.S. 440, 109 S.Ct. 2558, 2566, 105 L.Ed.2d 377 (1989). For that reason, we choose to reject rather than to ignore their argument that this is so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b516-7\">BUCKLEY, Circuit Judge, concurring:</author>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">I concur in all but the court\u2019s discussion of the legislative history of section 1105(c). As the court readily acknowledges, we deal here with statutory language that is clear on its face, and with an agency interpretation that is consistent with that language. I see no need to probe further. \u201c[W]here, as here, the statute\u2019s language is plain, the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms[,]\u201d <em>United States v. Ron Pair Enterps., Inc., </em>109 S.Ct. 1026, 1030 (1989) (internal quotes and citation omitted); when \u201cthe terms of a statute [are] unambiguous, judicial inquiry is complete,\u201d <em>Burlington No. R.R. Co. v. Oklahoma Tax Comm\u2019n, </em>481 U.S. 454, 461 (1987) (internal quotes and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">As it is, the court\u2019s reading of the legislative tea leaves matches speculation (appellants\u2019) against speculation (the court\u2019s) in an attempt to divine what Congress might have had in mind when, in 1972, it deleted the minimum price provision from the section. In my view, the only reliable evidence of the section\u2019s meaning is its language. As the court acknowledges, that language is unambiguous. Moreover, Congress used a formulation (\u201cnotwithstanding any other provision of law\u201d) that, as the court points out, we have consistently found to mean what it says. That should have been the end of our inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">I disassociate myself from the court\u2019s consultation of legislative history not only because it is unnecessary, but because I am wary of the practice. The legislative process lends itself to manipulation, and the clues to statutory meaning on which courts are prone to rely can mislead as well as illuminate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
