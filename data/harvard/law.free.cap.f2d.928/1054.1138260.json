BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-5\">Appellant Charles LoBosco, a native of Germany, had been in the United States for only a few weeks when he and an acquaintance, John Frasier, traveled to Underground Atlanta to purchase drugs. They met Anthony Willie Gray, who sold them an amount of the drug \u201cTHC\u201d and joined them in their vehicle. Gray passed out from alcohol in the back seat; LoBosco and Frasier felt they had been sold bad drugs and drove to an isolated, wooded area. Lo-Bosco and Frasier then assaulted Gray. According to LoBosco\u2019s confession, LoBos-co stabbed Gray while Frasier held him. At some point, either before the murder or afterwards, LoBosco removed ten dollars from Gray\u2019s pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-6\">After the murder, LoBosco and Frasier went to the residence of Frasier\u2019s girlfriend, Harriet Moore. LoBosco stated, \u201cI killed him with [Frasier\u2019s] knife.\u201d The following day, LoBosco and Frasier went out to bury the body; they were observed; and then they decided to burn the body. Linda Thomas testified that she saw LoBosco near the area where the body was discovered around the time that the body was burned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-7\">LoBosco was eventually arrested and gave a confession. His statement indicated that he committed the murder and robbed Gray. LoBosco was then eighteen years old.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-8\">At trial, Kermish \u2014 LoBosco\u2019s counsel\u2014 decided, after consulting with LoBosco and his father, to convince the jury that LoBos-co wanted to \u201ccome clean\u201d and admit his guilt to encourage the jury to grant mercy. Therefore, Kermish did not challenge the admission of LoBosco\u2019s confession and did not pursue the theory that LoBosco was too high on drugs to have known what he was doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-13\">LoBosco received two life sentences, one for the murder of Gray, the other for the armed robbery. LoBosco did not appeal his sentence to the Georgia courts. His subsequent petition for state habeas relief was denied. The district court also denied all relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-14\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-15\">A. <em>Ineffective Assistance and the Contrition Defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1152-16\">LoBosco argues that the prosecution\u2019s case was not subjected to \u201cmeaningful adversarial testing\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because counsel Kermish used the guilt/innocence phase of his trial to establish LoBosco\u2019s contrition, as opposed to his innocence. Kermish deposed that he did not want to make the jury \u201cmad\u201d by having \u201cstonewalled\u201d them on the issue of guilt. LoBosco argues that Kermish carried this strategy too far by conceding his guilt to the jury and by failing to challenge the state\u2019s evidence. We hold that LoBosco has not shown that counsel Kermish was ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1152-17\">1. <em>Counsel\u2019s Concession of Guilt</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1152-18\">LoBosco maintains that Kermish conceded his guilt during the closing argument to the jury. The attorneys\u2019 closing statements were not recorded, in contravention of Georgia law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> LoBosco cites <em>Francis v. </em>Spraggins<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for the proposition that, where counsel concedes guilt, a new trial is due. In <em>Spraggins, </em>the defendant entered a plea of not guilty. Counsel then admitted the defendant\u2019s guilt during the guilt/innocence phase of the trial. This court held,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1152-19\">Where a capital defendant, by his testimony as well as his plea, seeks a verdict of not guilty, counsel, though faced with strong evidence against his client, may not concede the issue of guilt merely to avoid a somewhat hypocritical presentation during the sentencing phase and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1057\">*1057</page-number>thereby maintain his credibility before the jury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1153-5\">The district court found <em>Spraggins </em>distinguishable because there was no concrete evidence that in LoBosco\u2019s case the defense conceded guilt during closing argument. We agree with the district court\u2019s conclusion but not its rationale. The reason that LoBosco cannot point to any evidence that Kermish conceded LoBoseo\u2019s guilt during closing argument is that the trial transcript reviewed by the district court did not record the attorneys\u2019 closing arguments. The district court refused to hold an evi-dentiary hearing on the matter. We therefore do not know whether there was a direct concession of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-6\">However, our prior cases make our lack of knowledge irrelevant. In <em>Spraggins, </em>there was no evidence that the defendant consented to the strategy.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant in fact took the stand to declare his innocence during the guilt phase of his trial. Here, Kermish felt that no reasonable defense was available, and he spoke extensively with LoBosco and his father prior to initiating the strategy of convincing the jury that LoBosco was being cooperative with the state\u2019s ease. Kermish deposed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-7\">Q What defense did you determine was available to Mr. Lobosco?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-8\">A From a pure defense standpoint I didn\u2019t have one. In my opinion his best defense was to, as I say, start immediately working on the sympathy of the jury and convincing them of his remorse and trying to get out of there without going to the electric chair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-9\">Q And did Mr. Lobosco in effect settle on that approach?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1153-14\">A Yes, sir, we did. And in fact his father agreed with it. And I was under the impression that Lobosco \u2014 Charlie Lo-bosco and his father had also discussed it at times, even when I wasn\u2019t present and had agreed that that was the best.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AD04\">Therefore, even if he did directly concede guilt during the closing argument, Kermish had his client\u2019s consent to enter what amounted to a guilty plea. We also note that LoBosco had already confessed his guilt to the police.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Buttressing (but not necessary to) our conclusion is the fact that LoBosco took the stand during the sentencing phase and openly admitted that he stabbed Gray. This is not a case where the client did not comprehend or agree with the attorney\u2019s strategy. It would have been better practice for Kermish to have placed LoBosco\u2019s consent to the strategy on the record, outside of the presence of the jury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the evidence before us amply indicates that LoBosco was fully informed of, consented to, and assisted in the contrition tactic.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-15\">2. <em>Other Ineffectiveness Claims</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1153-16\">According to LoBosco, Kermish\u2019s ineffectiveness is also demonstrated by his failure to do three things during trial: Kermish did not challenge the introduction of a questionable confession; he ignored evidence that LoBosco may not have had the requisite intent to have committed malice murder; and he neglected to contest the fact that there was no independent evidence to support the armed robbery conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-17\">As to the confession, LoBosco argues that there was ample evidence to show that the confession was untrustworthy \u2014 he was recently arrived from Ger<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1058\">*1058</page-number>many and did not understand the American legal system; the confession itself was written in perfect English, which he was incapable of speaking; he initially refused to confess; and he was only 18 at the time he gave the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\">However, Kermish did not request a suppression hearing pursuant to <em>Jackson v. Denno</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em> </em>because of his strategy \u2014 consented to by LoBosco \u2014 that was designed to show that LoBosco had \u201ccome clean.\u201d The magistrate found that appellant understood English perfectly well at the time of trial (he had been detained for several months) and could have understood counsel\u2019s statement that the <em>Jackson v. Denno </em>hearing was being waived. The magistrate found that LoBosco could understand English at the time he made the statement. Kermish stated in his deposition that he did not have trouble communicating with LoBosco in preparation for the trial. The detective who took the confession testified that, although LoBosco did not want to give a statement initially, he decided he wanted to confess after talking to Frasier, his accomplice. Thus, regardless of the fact that the statement was not challenged as part of Kermish\u2019s trial strategy, we are untroubled by the admission of the confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-5\">LoBosco argues that Kermish should have presented the affirmative defense of voluntary intoxication. Although evidence as to LoBosco\u2019s drug-induced impairment was brought out during the penalty phase of the trial, nothing was presented to the jury during the guilt/innocence phase. LoBosco argues that, to be guilty of malice murder in Georgia, the state must show that he was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of possessing the requisite malice. Yet Kermish never contested this point, despite the fact that Georgia juries may be instructed as to whether evidence of intoxication negated intent to commit murder.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> LoBosco asserts that, where a defense of insanity due to intoxication was the primary, if not the sole, defense available to him, his counsel was ineffective for failing to pursue such a defense.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-10\">Although affirmative defenses such as that of voluntary intoxication are permissible in Georgia,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> LoBosco assented to a trial strategy that precluded such an attempt to escape responsibility for the crime. We also note that LoBosco was driving a car just prior to the murder and had complained that the drugs he had been sold were ineffective. Both of these facts indicate that LoBosco would have had a difficult time showing that his voluntary intoxication rose to a level sufficient to negate intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-11\">Finally, LoBosco argues that his counsel should have challenged the sufficiency of the evidence underlying his armed robbery conviction. He argues that the only evidence presented to prove the robbery was his own statement, which is legally insufficient to support the conviction. As discussed below in section II.D., we agree that counsel erred by not challenging the sufficiency of the armed robbery charge. This error alone, however, is not sufficient to show that Kermish was generally ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-12\">3. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-13\">LoBosco consented to his attorney\u2019s strategy during the guilt phase of the trial. This strategy was designed to impress upon the jury LoBosco\u2019s cooperativeness and remorse over the murder. The concession of guilt (if it happened), the failure to contest the confession, and the failure to pursue an intoxication defense were all aspects of this strategy. Moreover, the confession was admissible, and the intoxication defense was not strongly supported by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1059\">*1059</page-number>circumstances of the crime. Except for the armed robbery issue, LoBosco has not shown that his attorney\u2019s assistance was subpar.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-5\">We also note that LoBosco has not shown sufficient prejudice to warrant relief on ineffective assistance of counsel grounds. The state introduced highly incriminating evidence, including LoBosco\u2019s confession and the testimony of an acquaintance who heard LoBosco admit to the murder. Counsel\u2019s errors, if any, were extremely unlikely to have affected the jury\u2019s verdict on the question of guilt or innocence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1155-6\">B. <em>Admission of the Confession</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1155-7\">As a claim separate from that included in his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, LoBosco argues that his due process rights under <em>Miranda v. Arizona</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>were violated by the admission of his confession. For the reasons discussed above, we refuse to grant relief on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-8\">We also agree with the magistrate\u2019s conclusion that, on the facts of this case, no evidentiary hearing was warranted.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The district court had access to the transcripts of the trial, the state habeas hearing, and Kermish\u2019s deposition in determining that no further evidence needed to be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-9\">C. <em>Denial of Right to Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1155-10\">LoBosco argues that neither Kermish nor the trial court advised him of his right to counsel on appeal; because of this omission, he failed to appeal his conviction.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> However, the magistrate found that Kermish</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1155-12\">testified that no appeal was filed because petitioner and petitioner\u2019s father were pleased with the results of the trial when petitioner was not sentenced to death. In [his] opinion, there were no appealable issues____ Mr. K[e]rmish stated that had petitioner or his father requested an appeal, Mr. K[e]rmish would have informed the court so that the court could either appoint Mr. K[e]rmish for the appeal or find another attorney to represent petitioner. [He] also stated that petitioner was aware that he could appeal the conviction and voluntarily decided not to appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1155-15\">Although LoBosco argues that the magistrate erred and that Kermish testified that he did not advise him of his right to appeal, Kermish deposed that \u201c[c]ertainly [LoBos-co] and I had discussed, as well as myself and the father, that he could appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-16\">The Georgia case cited by appellant in support of his argument that the court must always inform a convict of his right to appellate counsel is not on point, in that it holds that, <em>once </em>a convict has requested to appeal, he must be informed of the right to counsel.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because Kermish\u2019s deposition shows that the matter of an appeal was discussed with LoBosco and his father and that they decided against it, no relief is appropriate on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-17\">D. <em>Armed Robbery Conviction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1155-18\">LoBosco argues that the only evidence to support the armed robbery conviction was one sentence in his two-page confession: \u201cWhile we had [Gray] in the car I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1060\">*1060</page-number>reached in his pocket and got $10 out.\u201d The statement suggests that the victim had passed out from intoxication by the time LoBosco reached for the ten dollars. The state in its brief concedes that LoBosco\u2019s statement was unclear \u201cas to whether [the taking] occurred prior to the beating or after the beating.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-4\">We hold that the evidence was insufficient to support LoBosco\u2019s conviction on armed robbery charges. Under Georgia law, to establish armed robbery requires a showing that the defendant took property by force and that the force was exerted prior to or contemporaneous with the taking.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Because the evidence does not establish that the taking occurred after the assault, there was no armed robbery. Appellant was therefore factually innocent of the charges.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Also, the remark was uncorroborated and cannot serve as the sole evidence for conviction.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1156-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-6\">The district court\u2019s determinations regarding LoBosco\u2019s claims on the issues of ineffective assistance of counsel, improper admission of his confession, and denial of the right to appeal are AFFIRMED. On the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence to support LoBosco\u2019s armed robbery conviction, the district court is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED for the district court to grant the writ of habeas corpus with respect to the conviction for armed robbery.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1152-9\">. <em>United States v.
