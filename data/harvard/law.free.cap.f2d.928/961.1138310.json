Sullivan, Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (Secretary), appeals the district court\u2019s reversal of a decision of the Departmental Appeals Board (DAB). The DAB upheld the Secretary\u2019s penalty of $89,428.95 against plaintiff-appellee, Colorado Department of Social Services (CDSS), for its failure to conduct required inspections to review the care received by Colorado Medicaid recipients. The Secretary argues the statutory penalty should be reinstated because CDSS failed to comply with the valid regulation implementing the statute that requires participating states to review annually the care received by Medicaid recipients. CDSS contends the district court properly disallowed the penalty because this regulation is unreasonable. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-7\">I. <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1058-8\">A. Utilization Control Inspections</p>\n<p id=\"ais-dedup-0\">The Medicaid program was established by Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396 <em>et seq. </em>(Act). Under this program, the federal government provides financial assistance to participating states that reimburse individuals and facilities for health care provided to qualified Medicaid recipients. To receive these funds, a state must submit quarterly reports demonstrating the state \u201chas an effective program of medical review of the care of patients in mental hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and intermediate care facilities ... whereby the professional management of each case is reviewed and evaluated at least annually by independent professional review teams.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(g)(l); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1396a(a)(26), (30), (31). These reviews are referred to as \u201cutilization control\u201d inspections. <em>See State of Wisconsin, Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Soc. Servs. v. Bowen, </em>797 F.2d 391, 393 (7th Cir.1986), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>485 U.S. 1017, 108 S.Ct. 1495, 99 L.Ed.2d 883 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-11\">A state failing to inspect all eligible facilities within its borders providing care to Medicaid' recipients is subject to reductions in federal payments. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(g)(5). These penalties are calculated as a percentage of the payment for the quarter in which the failure occured. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1058-12\">Penalties will not be imposed, however, if the state has inspected 100% of all eligible facilities with 200 or more beds and not less than 98% of all eligible facilities if one of two conditions is present. First, the Secretary cannot penalize the state if it \u201chas exercised good faith and due diligence in attempting to conduct\u201d the required inspections. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(g)(4)(B). Second, the state will not be penalized if it \u201cdemonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it would have [inspected 100% of all eligible facilities] but for failings of a technical nature only.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1058-13\">The Secretary\u2019s regulation implementing section 1396b(g)(4)(B) is found at 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 456.653. This regulation explains a state has exercised \u201cgood faith and due diligence\u201d and thus will not be subject to a penalty if the state \u201cwould have succeeded [in inspecting 100% of all facilities] but for events beyond its control which it could not have reasonably anticipated.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 456.653(a)(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1058-14\">B. The Instant Case</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-15\">The Secretary periodically conducts surveys to ensure states are properly performing utilization control inspections. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(g)(2). In May 1988, a federal survey found CDSS had failed to review the care provided to three Medicaid recipi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"963\">*963</page-number>ents at the Spring Creek Health Care Center in Fort Collins, Colorado. CDSS had relied on the Center\u2019s census of Medicaid recipients, which did not list these three individuals, in conducting an inspection of the facility. The Secretary notified CDSS of these errors on June 8, 1988. CDSS concedes it did not review these patients until June 10, 1988. On September 19, 1988, the Secretary notified CDSS of its failure to perform satisfactory utilization control inspections for the quarter ending March 31, 1988. The Secretary assessed a statutory penalty of $89,428.95 against CDSS.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-4\">CDSS appealed the penalty to the DAB, arguing it had met the requirements of the statutory \u201cgood faith and due diligence\u201d exception and therefore should not have been penalized. CDSS asserted the regulatory interpretation of this exception is invalid because the Secretary exceeded his authority by defining a failure to inspect despite the state\u2019s \u201cgood faith and due diligence\u201d as a failure due to circumstances beyond the state\u2019s control. The DAB disagreed with CDSS, holding the regulation constituted a reasonable interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">CDSS appealed the DAB ruling to the district court. Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. The district court granted CDSS\u2019s motion for summary judgment and reversed the DAB ruling, adopting the reasoning of the court in <em>Delaware Div. of Health &amp; Social Servs. v. United States Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>665 F.Supp. 1104 (D.Del.1987). The district court held the statutory \u201cgood faith and due diligence\u201d exception is a subjective standard. The court concluded the regulatory interpretation is invalid because it constitutes an unduly restrictive objective standard. The court found CDSS\u2019s reliance on the Center\u2019s census of its Medicaid recipients met the supposedly subjective statutory standard and therefore vacated the penalty imposed by the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">On appeal, the Secretary contends the district court erred in rejecting his motion for summary judgment and granting judgment in favor of CDSS. He asserts the regulation implementing the \u201cgood faith and due diligence\u201d exception is a reasonable interpretation of the statute entitled to deference. CDSS maintains that failure to review one recipient cannot equate with failure to inspect the facility caring for that recipient. CDSS further argues the regulation implementing the \u201cgood faith and due diligence\u201d exception is invalid as a contradiction of the plain meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-8\">II. <em>Failure to Inspect a Facility</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1059-9\">We first address the question whether failure to review one recipient in a facility constitutes failure to inspect that facility for purposes of the statutory penalty. Where, as here, Congress clearly has expressed its meaning, we must adopt that expressed intent. <em>See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781-82, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-10\">Because the statute defines an inspection to include the review of care received by each Medicaid recipient, a failure to review one recipient in a facility constitutes a failure to inspect that facility. In 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(26) and (31), Congress requires states participating in the Medicaid program to perform annual \u201con-site inspections\u201d of facilities to assess the care provided to <em>each </em>Medicaid recipient. Congress subjects states to penalties for failure to perform inspections \u201cpursuant to paragraphs 1396a(a)(26) and (31) of this title.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(g)(l). Given the penalty provision\u2019s explicit cross-reference to the definition of an inspection as requiring review of each recipient, we find a failure to review a single recipient constitutes a failure to inspect a facility for purposes of the penalty provision. <em>Cf. K Mart Corp. v. Cartier, Inc., </em>486 U.S. 281, 291, 108 S.Ct. 1811, 1817, 100 L.Ed.2d 313 (1988) (\u201cIn ascertaining the plain meaning of the statute, the court must look to the particular statutory language at issue, as well as the language and design of the statute as a whole.\u201d); <em>Atlantic Cleaners &amp; Dyers, Inc. v. United States, </em>286 U.S. 427, 433, 52 S.Ct. 607, 609, 76 L.Ed. 1204 (1932) (noting presumption that \u201cidentical words used in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">CDSS\u2019s admitted failure to review three recipients at the Center therefore represents a failure to inspect that facility. CDSS is subject to the statutory penalty unless it qualifies for the exception in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(g)(4)(B). Because CDSS met the statutory exception\u2019s initial two requirements of inspecting at least 98% percent of all facilities with fewer than 200 beds and all of the facilities with 200 or more beds, we must determine the proper definition of the exception\u2019s third requirement of exercising \u201cgood faith and due diligence\u201d in attempting to inspect the Center.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(g)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">III. <em>Good Faith and Due Diligence</em></p>\n<p id=\"AZU\">To determine whether the regulation implementing the \u201cgood faith and due diligence\u201d exception is valid, we first must determine \u201cwhether Congress has directly spoken\u201d to the meaning of this phrase. <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. 837, 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 2781. Our review of the statutory language and the legislative history of the Social Security Act convinces us Congress did not address this issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, by its use of the phrase \u201cgood faith and due diligence,\u201d a context-specific standard, Congress implicitly delegated to the Secretary the determination of how \u201cgood faith and due diligence\u201d should be measured. <em>Cf. Estate of Smith v. Heckler, </em>747 F.2d 583, 587 (10th Cir.1984) (\u201cCongress gave the Secretary a general mandate to promulgate rules and regulations necessary to the efficient administration of the functions with which the Secretary is charged by the Act.\u201d); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(g)(l) (state must make a showing <em>\u201csatisfactory to the Secretary </em>\u201d that it has reviewed the care received by each recipient) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-9\">Because Congress\u2019s intent in requiring \u201cgood faith and due diligence\u201d is ambiguous, we must determine whether the Secretary's interpretation in 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 456.653(a)(3) is reasonable. When \u201cthe legislative delegation to an agency on a particular question is implicit____ a court may not substitute its own construction of a statutory provision for a reasonable interpretation made by the administrator of an agency.\u201d <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 844, 104 S.Ct. at 2782-83; <em>see also K Mart, </em>486 U.S. at 291, 108 S.Ct. at 1817 (\u201cIf the agency regulation is not in conflict with the plain language of the statute, a reviewing court must give deference to the agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-12\">The Act repeatedly expresses the goal that states annually review the care received by <em>each </em>Medicaid recipient. We cannot say the regulation\u2019s requirement that a state do everything within its control to ensure all eligible facilities are inspected is an unreasonable implementation of the Act\u2019s requirement that states exercise \u201cgood faith and due diligence\u201d in conducting utilization control inspections. Because the regulation does not contradict the statute\u2019s plain language, we uphold the Secretary\u2019s interpretation. <em>See K Mart, </em>486 U.S. at 291, 108 S.Ct. at 1817; <em>Chevron, </em>467 U.S. at 844, 104 S.Ct. at 2782-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>CDSS advances two arguments to demonstrate the regulation is contrary to the express purposes and plain language of the Act. We find neither argument convincing. First, CDSS contends the fact there is an exception for attempted inspections indicates Congress did not intend to require a state to do everything within its control in reviewing each case. On the contrary, to permit a state to avoid the statutory penalty merely because it made a subjective good faith effort to conduct the required inspections would vitiate clearly expressed congressional intent that the care received by each Medicaid recipient be reviewed annually.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">Second, CDSS asserts that allowing the Secretary to grant an exception only when a state\u2019s failure to inspect is the result of circumstances beyond its control effectively eliminates the exception. The regulation merely limits the availability of the exception to situations where the state has done everything it can to review each recipient\u2019s care. The Secretary has determined this is the diligence due under the Act. Because the identification of the Medicaid recipients receiving care at a particular facility is undeniably an essential element of an inspection, we find the Secretary\u2019s determination reasonable. Moreover, under the \u201ctechnical failings\u201d element of the exception, failures due to circumstances within the state\u2019s control can justify an exemption from the penalty. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 456.653(b). We are not convinced the regulation is unduly restrictive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">IV. <em>Assessment of the Penalty in this Case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1061-7\">We find the penalty proper in this ease. The pertinent facts found by the DAB are either undisputed or supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See Minnesota ex rel. Noot v. Heckler, </em>718 F.2d 852, 860 (8th Cir.1983), <em>aff'd sub nom. Connecticut Dep\u2019t of Income Maintenance v. Heckler, </em>471 U.S. 524, 105 S.Ct. 2210, 85 L.Ed.2d 577 (1985). CDSS attempted to inspect the Center by reviewing those patients the Center identified as Medicaid recipients. The Center failed to identify three recipients, and CDSS consequently failed to review the care received by these individuals. CDSS admits these facts and we already have held as a matter of law that failure to review even a single patient constitutes a failure to inspect that facility. Because a failure to inspect indisputably supports the imposition of the statutory penalty, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(g)(5), the DAB\u2019s finding of a prima facie case for imposition of the penalty was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-10\">The DAB properly concluded that because CDSS\u2019s reliance on the facility\u2019s census of Medicaid patients was within CDSS\u2019s control and did not qualify as a technical failing, the Secretary was permitted to assess the statutory penalty. <em>See </em>42 C.F.R. \u00a7 456.653. Further, CDSS does not contest the DAB\u2019s finding that this reliance was a matter within CDSS\u2019s control.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rather, CDSS contends Congress intended to allow a state to rely on a facility\u2019s census of its Medicaid to determine which patients must be reviewed during an inspection of that facility. Yet the entire purpose of utilization control inspections is to ensure facilities do not provide \u2014 and charge the federal government for \u2014 inappropriate medical care. <em>See generally </em>H.R.Rep. No. 231, 92d Cong., 2d. Sess. (1972), <em>reprinted in </em>1972 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 4989, 5092. If states are permitted to rely on a facility\u2019s census, a facility providing inappropriate care will be encouraged simply not to list those patients. Thus, the recipients most in need of review would go unre-viewed. This is clearly contrary to the underlying purposes of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>We REVERSE the district court\u2019s award of summary judgment in favor of CDSS and its refusal to enter judgment in favor of the Secretary. We REMAND for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1058-9\">. Section 456.653 allows a state to avoid a penalty under the \"failings of a technical nature\u201d exception only if the failure to complete the inspections resulted from circumstances within the state's control. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 456.653(b). This regulation also provides that a state may qualify for this exception only if it corrects any technical failings within thirty days of the close of the quarter. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">. CDSS concedes it has not satisfied the \"technical failings\u201d exception of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396b(g)(4)(B) and 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 456.653(b). We do not address the validity of the regulation implementing this statutory provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1060-7\">. Relying on the decision in <em>Delaware Div. of Health &amp; Social Servs. v. United States Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>665 F.Supp. 1104 (D.Del.1986), the district court concluded Congress has directly spoken on this issue. The <em>Delaware </em>court cited a Conferees\u2019 agreement on the 1977 Social Securtiy Act Amendments that stated: \" 'If a facility is not reviewed, there will be a reduction in matching unless the Secretary finds there was a good faith attempt to review the institution, and there is no evidence that any institution ... is deliberately not reviewed.\u2019 \u201d 665 F.Supp. at 1120 (emphasis of <em>Delaware </em>court omitted) (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 95-673, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 48 (1977), <em>reprinted in </em>1977 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 3039, 3122). The <em>Delaware </em>court held this passage indicates \"the legislature plainly directed the Secretary to employ a subjective standard that focused on the State\u2019s good faith.\u201d 665 F.Supp. at 1124. We do not believe this fragment of legislative history conveys Congress\u2019s clear intent that \u201cgood faith and due diligence\" be judged by a subjective standard. We therefore must defer to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the statutory provision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1061-8\">. CDSS makes a \"slippery slope\u201d argument in an attempt to discredit the DAB finding that because CDSS relied on the Center\u2019s census of Medicaid patients, CDSS\u2019s failure to review each recipient was a circumstance within CDSS\u2019s control. CDSS asserts we should disregard the DAB\u2019s finding that reliance on the Center's patient list was within CDSS\u2019s control. This finding, CDSS claims, is \u201ctoo rigid\u201d because it implies that a failure to identify can never qualify for the \u201cgood faith and due diligence\u201d exception. We fail to see the logic in this argument, and dismiss it summarily.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
