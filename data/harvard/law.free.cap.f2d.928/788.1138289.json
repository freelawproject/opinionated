Horner, </em>[1774] Lofft 576, 591 (Lord Mansfield), but, as this case demonstrates, nine points is not always enough \u2014 especially if the holder of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>the tenth point is assisted by a police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\">At stake here are a couple of gold rings worth about $1,100. On May 26, 1988, Patrolman Steve Mullin of the Delphi City Police Department spotted the rings at the Surplus Store and Exchange (\u201cSurplus\u201d) on Main Street in Lafayette, Indiana. Mullin believed that the rings had been stolen from their true owner, Joyce Fowler. Surplus claimed (and still claims) that it obtained the rings in a bona fide purchase. Undaunted by this claim, Officer Mullin seized the rings, but not before signing a receipt that read: \u201cThe above items are released with the understanding that at this time [Surplus] has a vested interest in them and disposition [of] such is to be made by a court of law.\u201d Officer Mullin promptly disregarded the receipt and, later that same day, released the rings to Ms. Fowler. No notice of this release was given to Surplus, nor was any hearing or other proceeding held before Mullin gave away the rings.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">This incident spawned a suit by Surplus in federal district court under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (\u201c\u00a7 1983\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Surplus named as a defendant only Mullin\u2019s employer, the City of Delphi (\u201cDelphi\u201d). In its brief, broadly-drafted complaint (and amended complaint), Surplus charged that Mullin violated its fourth and fourteenth amendment rights by seizing the rings and giving them to Fowler, \u201cthe purported owner.\u201d The fourteenth amendment claim \u2014 the heart of Surplus\u2019 complaints \u2014 sounds in procedural due process; to wit, Mullin\u2019s actions deprived Surplus of its property interest in the rings \u201cwithout proper judicial hearing.\u201d Surplus alleged further that Mullin took these actions \u201cunder color of State law,\u201d citing in support three Indiana statutes: Ind.Code \u00a7\u00a7 35-33-5-5, 35-43-4-4(h), and 35-43-4-5 (1986 Supp.). The first provision states that all items of property seized by a law enforcement agency \u201cshall be securely held\u201d by the agency, with the exception that, if the item is \u201cproperty obtained unlawfully from its owner,\u201d it may be returned to the owner before trial \u201cin accordance with [Ind.Code \u00a7 ] 35-43-4-4(h).\u201d Ind.Code \u00a7\u00a7 35-33-5-5(a) &amp; (b). The second provision, in turn, allows a law enforcement agency \u201cthat is holding as evidence property over which a person is alleged to have exerted unauthorized control or to have otherwise obtained unlawfully\u201d to return the property to its owner, if the agency follows certain procedures (e.g., photographing the item, obtaining a receipt from the owner, etc.). Ind.Code \u00a7 35-48-4-4(h). The third provision, which is found in the \u201cDefenses\u201d section of the \u201cTheft; Conversion\u201d chapter, shields from criminal liability a person who attempts to return stolen personal property to its owner. Ind.Code \u00a7 35-43-4-5(d). None of these statutes provide for a judicial hearing or other proceeding before the subject property is returned to its owner. Finally, Surplus\u2019 complaints allege that Mullin was acting \u201cin his capacity as an employee of the City of Delphi.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b885-9\">Delphi moved to dismiss both the original and amended complaints, arguing that Indiana tort law provides an adequate remedy for Surplus\u2019 alleged injury. Surplus proffered a lengthy response to Delphi\u2019s motion. In light of the briefing that had taken place, the district court treated Delphi\u2019s motion as one for summary judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 and, on October 5, 1989, entered a memorandum opinion dismissing Surplus\u2019 complaint. (A judgment order to the same effect followed six days later.) The court\u2019s dismissal was \u201cwithout prejudice to enable the plaintiff to pursue whatever claims may be available under the law of Indiana and in the courts of Indiana.\u201d From this final order, Surplus brought a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-10\">There are so many problems with this lawsuit, it is hard to know where to begin. Indeed, this fact is well-illustrated by the district court\u2019s opinion, which touches on a number of possible rationales for the dismissal of Surplus\u2019 action. The district court seems ultimately to rely upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>ground that Indiana tort law provides an adequate remedy, following <em>Parratt v. Taylor, </em>451 U.S. 527, 101 S.Ct. 1908, 68 L.Ed.2d 420 (1981), and <em>Hudson v. Palmer, </em>468 U.S. 517, 104 S.Ct. 3194, 82 L.Ed.2d 393 (1984). <em>See generally Guenther v. Holmgreen, </em>738 F.2d 879, 882 (7th Cir.1984), <em>cert. denied, </em>469 U.S. 1212, 105 S.Ct. 1182, 84 L.Ed.2d 329 (1985) (discussing and applying Parratt\u2019s teaching that \u201ca victim of a property or liberty deprivation who has recourse to an adequate state remedy has not been denied \u2018due process of law\u2019 \u201d). We choose a different tack.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">As mentioned above, Surplus has sued only the municipality of Delphi. \u201c[0]ur first inquiry in any case alleging municipal liability under \u00a7 1983 is the question whether there is a direct causal link between a municipal policy or custom and the alleged constitutional deprivation.\u201d <em>City of Canton v. Harris, </em>489 U.S. 378, 385, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 1203, 103 L.Ed.2d 412 (1989). <em>See also City of Oklahoma City v. Tuttle, </em>471 U.S. 808, 816-20, 105 S.Ct. 2427, 2432-35, 85 L.Ed.2d 791 (1985); <em>Monell v. New York Dept. of Social Services, </em>436 U.S. 658, 690-95, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 2035-38, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978); <em>Leahy v. Board of Trustees, </em>912 F.2d 917, 922 (7th Cir.1990) (\u201cProximate causation between the municipality\u2019s policy or custom and the plaintiff\u2019s injury must be present.\u201d) (quoting <em>Strauss v. City of Chicago, </em>760 F.2d 765, 767 (7th Cir.1985)). Our search for a Delphi policy that meets this requirement begins with Surplus\u2019 pleadings, but they provide no help. In its complaints, Surplus not only fails to point to a specific Delphi policy or custom directly and causally linked to the alleged deprivation, but fails altogether to refer to any sort of Delphi policy or custom linked in any way to the alleged deprivation. In fact, the sole mention of Delphi is a reference to its employment of Officer Mullin, which is both revealing and dooming: the former because, under Surplus\u2019 allegations the only thing that Delphi did or failed to do that could possibly make it culpable for the constitutional violation is employ Officer Mullin, and the latter because that very ground for municipal liability has been explicitly rejected by the Supreme Court. <em>See Harris, </em>489 U.S. at 385, 109 S.Ct. at 1203 (\u201c[A] municipality can be found liable under \u00a7 1983 only where the municipality <em>itself </em>causes the constitutional violation at issue. <em>Respondeat superior </em>or vicarious liability will not attach under \u00a7 1983.\u201d) (emphasis in original) (discussing <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 694-95, 98 S.Ct. at 2037-38); <em>Tuttle, </em>471 U.S. 808, 818, 105 S.Ct. 2427, 2433 (municipal liability cannot be imposed \u201cmerely because of an employment relationship\u201d) (also discussing <em>Mo-nell ).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b886-7\">Surplus\u2019 failure to allege in its pleadings facts which, if true, would meet the municipal policy requirement is itself a sufficient ground on which to dismiss Surplus\u2019 \u00a7 1983 claim. <em>See Leahy, </em>912 F.2d at 922 (citing cases). Moving beyond Surplus\u2019 pleadings and examining its briefs in this court, however, we discover that Surplus believes that it has satisfied the municipal policy requirement (as well as the separate \u201cunder color of state law\u201d requirement) by citing in its complaints three particular Indiana statutes that authorized Officer Mullin to seize <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>and dispose of the rings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These statutes, Surplus argues, are unconstitutional because they fail to require a pre-disposition hearing. Surplus then attempts to make the conceptual leap from these Indiana statutes to Delphi city policy by arguing that Delphi has a \u201cpolicy\u201d of enforcing the statutes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In other words, it is Surplus\u2019 contention that Delphi\u2019s decision simply to enforce these \u201cunconstitutional\u201d Indiana statutes was a \u201cmunicipal policy\u201d that \u201ccaused\u201d the wrongful deprivation of Surplus\u2019 property interest in the rings, and thus the requirements of <em>Monell </em>and <em>Harris, et al. </em>are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\">To formulate this argument is to see its fatal flaws. First, consider what Surplus has <em>not </em>alleged. (The meritless suggestion rejected <em>supra </em>in note 4 aside), Surplus has not claimed that the alleged constitutional violation was caused by a \u201cpolicy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by\u201d Delphi that was itself unconstitutional. <em>See Sims v. Mulcahy, </em>902 F.2d 524, 541-42 (7th Cir.1990) (quoting <em>Patrick v. Jasper County, </em>901 F.2d 561, 565 (7th Cir.1990) (quoting in turn <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 690, 98 S.Ct. at 2035)). Nor has Surplus claimed that the constitutional violation was caused by an \u201centrenched practice with the effective force of a formal policy\u201d that Delphi allowed to develop, which practice or custom was itself unconstitutional. <em>See Gray v. Dane County, </em>854 F.2d 179, 183-84 (7th Cir.1988). Nor has Surplus argued that Delphi, as a matter or policy or custom, enforces the law in a manner or method that caused the constitutional violation, which differentiates Surplus\u2019 claim from the one class of claims in which municipal liability can lie absent a showing of a municipal policy or custom that is itself unconstitutional: the \u201cinadequate training\u201d or \u201cinadequate procedures\u201d cases. <em>See Graham v. Sauk Prairie Police Comm\u2019n, </em>915 F.2d 1085, 1096-1104 (7th Cir.1990) (discussing and applying \u201cinadequate training\u201d and \u201cmunicipal policy\u201d standards from <em>Harris </em>and <em>Tuttle </em>to claim of inadequate pre-employment investigation of police officer\u2019s background); <em>Sims, </em>902 F.2d at 542-45 (applying same to claim against city <em>for </em>failure to monitor and investigate behavior of police during searches). Instead, Surplus argues that Delphi properly can be held liable for the deprivation of its property because Delphi has a \u201cpolicy\u201d of allowing or instructing its police officers to enforce the challenged statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">It is difficult to imagine a municipal policy more innocuous and constitutionally permissible, and whose causal connection to the alleged violation is more attenuated, than the \u201cpolicy\u201d of enforcing state law. If the language and standards from <em>Monell </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>are not to become a dead letter, such a \u201cpolicy\u201d simply cannot be sufficient to ground liability against a municipality. <em>Cf. Tuttle, </em>471 U.S. at 823, 105 S.Ct. at 2436:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"atm-dedup-0\">Obviously, if one retreats far enough from a constitutional violation some municipal \u201cpolicy\u201d can be identified behind almost any such harm inflicted by a municipal official____ But <em>Monell </em>must be taken to require proof of a city policy different in kind from [the \u201cpolicy\u201d of establishing a police force] before a claim can be sent to a jury on the theory that a particular violation was \u201ccaused\u201d by the municipal \u201cpolicy.\u201d At the very least there must be an affirmative link between the policy and the particular constitutional violation alleged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-5\"><em>See also Thompson v. Duke, </em>No. 84 C 5082, slip op. at 5 (N.D.Ill. Jan. 4, 1988) [available on Westlaw at 1987 WL 33188] (rejecting plaintiffs claim that county was liable under \u00a7 1983 for \u201cblindly following\u201d unconstitutional state parole board procedures on the ground that the county's \u201cpractice of simply following state law is not the promulgation or maintenance of a practice which directly causes injury\u201d as <em>Monell </em>requires), <em>aff'd, </em>882 F.2d 1180, 1187 (7th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">All that remains is to distinguish two cases on which Surplus places great reliance for, among other things, the municipal policy requirement: <em>Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., </em>455 U.S. 422, 102 S.Ct. 1148, 71 L.Ed.2d 265 (1982), and <em>Florida Pawnbrokers and Secondhand Dealers Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. City of Fort Lauderdale, </em>699 F.Supp. 888 (S.D.Fla.1988) <em>(\u201cPawnbrokers I\u201d). </em>In <em>Logan, </em>the Court held that a state commission could not destroy a complainant\u2019s recognized property right without a pre-deprivation hearing when there existed an \u201cestablished state procedure\u201d that should \u2014 and could easily \u2014 have provided such a hearing. In such a case, the Court stated, the mere existence of a post-deprivation hearing or remedy was constitutionally inadequate. <em>Id. </em>455 U.S. at 434-37, 102 S.Ct. at 1156-59. For all it teaches concerning procedural due process, <em>Logan </em>is silent as to Monell\u2019s municipal policy requirement \u2014 simply because it did not involve a \u00a7 1983 claim against a municipality. Thus, Surplus\u2019 reliance on <em>Logan </em>for its \u201cofficial policy\u201d argument is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">In <em>Pawnbrokers I, </em>the district court declared Florida\u2019s pawnbroker seizure statute violative of due process and enjoined Fort Lauderdale from enforcing it. Among the many differences between that case and this case are the following: 1) the Florida statute at issue, Fla.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 715.041(2) (West 1988), specifically authorized both the seizure of stolen property from pawn shops and the return of the property to its owner, <em>compare supra </em>note 3; and 2) Fort Lauderdale, by ordinance, expressly incorporated the statute into the municipal code, adding a preamble that stated, \u201cthe City also desires to facilitate the recovery of stolen property for return to victims of burglaries and thefts.\u201d <em>See Pawnbrokers I, </em>699 F.Supp. at 890. <em>See also Florida Pawnbrokers and Secondhand Dealers Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. City of Fort Lauderdale, </em>711 F.Supp. 1084, 1085 (S.D.Fla.1989) <em>(\u201cPawnbrokers II \u201d) </em>(\u201cThe city here did not merely enforce the state statute. As held in the prior order of this court, the city of Fort Lauderdale had a policy of using the statute as one part of a comprehensive plan for dealing with the potential of the pawnbroking business as a market for stolen property.\u201d). Overlooking this second difference, Surplus seizes on the following paragraph in <em>Pawnbrokers I </em>in support of its argument that the municipal policy requirement was satisfied in that case by mere enforcement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-9\">While it is true that the city did not enact the pawnbroker seizure statute, it is equally clear that the city\u2019s policy of enforcing the statute constitutes state action. <em>Monell, </em>[436 U.S. at 690-91, 98 S.Ct. at 2035-36] (local governing bodies are directly liable where, \u201cthe action that is alleged to be unconstitutional implements or executes a policy statement, ordinance, regulation, or decision officially adopted and promulgated by that body\u2019s officers.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">699 F.Supp. at 890. The statement itself refers only to the state action requirement and, viewed in that light, is neither troublesome nor helpful to Surplus. If, however, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>the court by this statement meant to say that simply enforcing state law satisfies the municipal policy requirement of <em>Mo-nell </em>\u2014 which is by no means clear, as Fort Lauderdale officially adopted and promulgated the state pawnbroker statute and the policy behind it \u2014 then we believe that the court fundamentally misunderstood the municipal culpability requirement explicated in <em>Monell, Harris, </em>and <em>Tuttle. </em>We will not, as Surplus invites, follow in those footsteps.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Surplus argues that it had a \u201csuperior claim\u201d to the rings as a result of a \u201cbona fide purchase,\u201d and that it was unconstitutionally deprived of this property interest by Officer Mullin\u2019s state-law-authorized actions. Whatever the merit of its claim on the rings, Surplus cannot hold the City of Delphi liable under \u00a7 1983 for this alleged due process violation unless a policy or custom attributable to Delphi caused the violation; in other words, the fault for the deprivation must lie with Delphi itself, not with Officer Mullin or with the Indiana statutes. Surplus has neither alleged facts that, if true, would meet this municipal policy requirement, nor requested leave to do so. Accordingly, we conclude that Surplus has waived any such contention. The district court\u2019s judgment dismissing Surplus\u2019 complaint is</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b885-6\">. The district court had jurisdiction over this suit under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331, 1343(a)(3), &amp; 1343(a)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b886-5\">. Which is not to say that we disagree with the district court\u2019s conclusion regarding the adequacy and availability of relief under Indiana tort law. In fact, we ordered subsequent briefing on this question after oral argument. After reviewing the supplemental briefs and the Indiana case law, it appears that Indiana tort law may fail to provide an adequate remedy. <em>See </em>Ind. Code \u00a7 34-4-16.5-3(6), (7), &amp; (8) (provisions of the Indiana Tort Claims Act granting immunity to governmental entities, and employees acting within scope of employment, if the injury or loss resulted from \"the performance of a discretionary function,\u201d \"the adoption and enforcement of or failure to adopt or enforce a law (including rules and regulations), unless the act of enforcement constitutes false arrest or false imprisonment,\u201d or \"an act or omission performed in good faith and without malice under the apparent authority of a statute which is invalid\u201d). <em>But see </em>21 Indiana Law Encyclopedia <em>Municipal Corporations </em>\u00a7 410 (\"[A] municipal corporation is liable for injuries resulting from the negligence of officers, agents or employees while engaged in the performance of its ministerial ... functions....\u201d); <em>City of Hammond v. Cataldi, </em>449 N.E.2d 1184, 1186 (Ind.App.1983). We need not, and do not, resolve this issue either way.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b887-5\">. We note briefly that, from our reading of the challenged Indiana statutes, it is not even clear that they \"authorized\u201d the whole of Officer Mul-lin\u2019s conduct. Sections 35-33-5-5(a) &amp; (b) and 35-43-4-4(h) deal only with the disposition of property already in police custody, and thus do not, at least on their face, authorize Mullin\u2019s seizure of the rings. Section 35-43-4-5(d) has no special applicability to police officers or agencies, but simply shields people who try to return stolen property to its owner from liability for the crimes of theft and conversion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b887-6\">. In its reply brief, Surplus also makes the related, but slightly different, argument that all cities can be charged with \"adopting\u201d as a matter of policy all state laws that they do not ignore; i.e., \"Indiana statutes are a source of policy for the municipalities acting under them.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Reply Brief at 6. This argument would render meaningless the entire body of precedent from the Supreme Court and this court that requires culpability on the part of a municipality and/or its policymakers before the municipality can be held liable under \u00a7 1983, and would allow municipalities to be nothing more than convenient receptacles of liability for violations caused entirely by state actors \u2014 here, the Indiana legislature. Thus, it is wholly without merit. Further, counter to Surplus\u2019 suggestion, this argument was not accepted by the Tenth Circuit in the <em>Wolfenbarger </em>cases. <em>See Wolfenbarger v. Williams, </em>774 F.2d 358 (10th Cir.1985) <em>(\"Wolfenbarger I\"</em>); <em>Wolfenbarger v. Williams, </em>826 F.2d 930 (10th Cir.1987) <em>(\" Wolfenbarger II\"). </em>In these cases, both the seizure and subsequent disposition of the stolen merchandise at issue was done by city police officers pursuant to express directives from the district attorney to the chief of police \u2014 directives that mandated procedures different from Oklahoma law, which provided for a pre-disposition hearing before a magistrate. <em>See Wolfenbarger I, </em>774 F.2d at 365; <em>Wolfenbarger II, </em>826 F.2d at 931. Thus, the fault for any due process violation occasioned by these procedures properly lay with the local governmental actors and entities.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
