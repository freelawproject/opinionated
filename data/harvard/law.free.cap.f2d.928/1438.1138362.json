EUGENE DAVIS, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1536-29\">Two employees, T.J. King and A.C. Gay-den, were severely injured in an on-the-job crane accident. The employees filed their tort actions against the crane rental company and the crane manufacturer, which claims were settled before the trial was concluded. This appeal raises two principal issues: (1) whether the district court correctly required the compensation carrier to pay a large portion of the attorney\u2019s fees the employees incurred in prosecuting their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1441\">*1441</page-number>tort actions, and (2) whether the district court correctly resolved several insurance coverage issues. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-6\">In 1986, JALCO Inc. of Texas (JALCO) contracted with Jefferson Parish to construct and install a sewer force main. To complete this project, JALCO leased a crane manufactured by Manitowoc, Inc. (Manitowoc) from Essex Crane Rental Corporation (Essex). In July 1987, the crane\u2019s gantry collapsed, pinning JALCO employee King and nearly severing his arm. Attempting to rescue King, fellow employee Gayden was thrown forty feet into the air when wires attached to the gantry were released. Gayden received severe head injuries, brain damage, and was permanently disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-7\">Both King and Gayden<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sued Essex and Manitowoc. JALCO and its workers\u2019 compensation insurer, Employers National Insurance Company (collectively ENIC), intervened in the suits seeking reimbursement for compensation and medical benefits already paid to King and Gayden. Essex also contended that it was an additional insured under JALCO\u2019s liability insurance policies. To enforce its rights, Essex filed third-party complaints against JALCO\u2019s liability insurance carriers: Employers Casualty Company (Employers Casualty); Interstate Fire and Casualty Company (Interstate); and Stonewall Surplus Lines Insurance Company (Stonewall).</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-8\">Before trial, Gayden settled with Essex, Employers Casualty, Interstate, and Stonewall. In the settlement agreement, Interstate and Stonewall agreed to pay ENIC its full compensation lien, and all parties waived any claims against ENIC regarding the lien. Stonewall and Interstate further reserved the right to dispute coverage of Essex and to seek reimbursement from Essex for their contribution to the settlement. On the morning of trial, Gayden settled with Manitowoc. Gayden agreed to indemnify Manitowoc against any claims by ENIC for reimbursement. King dismissed his claim against Manitowoc. At the end of the first day of trial, King settled with Essex and Employers Casualty. From King\u2019s proceeds of this settlement, King was to pay ENIC its compensation lien. The parties dispute whether ENIC approved any of these settlements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-10\">After settling with the tort defendants, Gayden and King moved to assess and apportion recovery costs, comprised of attorney\u2019s fees and other litigation costs. The plaintiffs alleged that ENIC owed them a proportionate share of the costs of recovery. In September 1989, the district court awarded King attorney\u2019s fees of $60,590.24 deducted from ENIC\u2019s compensation lien of $60,988.26. In January 1990, the district court awarded Gayden attorney\u2019s fees of $189,602.58, an amount equal to ENIC\u2019s compensation lien. These awards left ENIC with a net recovery of $398.02 for benefits paid to King and a net recovery of zero for benefits paid to Gayden. Also in January 1990, the district court ordered Manitowoc, Employers Casualty, and Essex to pay ENIC judicial interest on the Gay-den lien and Essex to pay ENIC judicial interest on the King lien. Manitowoc\u2019s liability for judicial interest was capped as the amount of its settlement. Finally, the district court resolved the insurance coverage disputes as described in detail in section III to follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-11\">Two primary groups of issues are presented on appeal and cross-appeal. The first group deals with the apportionment of attorney\u2019s fees between the plaintiffs and ENIC. The second group deals with Essex\u2019s coverage as an additional insured under JALCO\u2019s liability policies. A secondary issue involves the apportionment of interest between Manitowoc and Employers Casualty in the Gayden case. We will address each of these issues in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1537-14\">ENIC first appeals Gayden\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees against it. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1442\">*1442</page-number>court awarded Gayden attorney\u2019s fees from ENIC based on the Louisiana Supreme Court case of <em>Moody v. Arabie, </em>498 So.2d 1081 (La.1986). The <em>Moody </em>court held that as co-owners of the recovery from the third-party tortfeasor, the employee and employer should share litigation costs in proportion to their interest in the recovery. ENIC argues that it did not pre-approve Gayden\u2019s settlement and therefore <em>Moody </em>should not apply. Gayden argues that ENIC gave prior written approval to his settlement in a letter from ENIC\u2019s attorney to Gayden\u2019s counsel. We need not decide whether ENIC pre-approved Gayden\u2019s settlement, however, because we find that Gayden waived any claim he had to <em>Moody </em>fees in his settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-4\">The settlement agreement, which Gay-den\u2019s curator, undercurator, and attorney signed on his behalf,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1538-5\">5. Interstate and Stonewall will, on behalf of Gayden, pay the entire lien of Employers National Insurance Company, without reduction. All parties hereto waive any claims and defenses they may have against Employers National Insurance Companmy <em>[sic </em>] with respect to the lien.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1538-6\">The district court refused to enforce this waiver because ENIC was not a signatory to the agreement.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, there is no legal requirement that ENIC be a party to the agreement for its terms to be enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-7\">Louisiana law provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1538-8\">A contracting party may stipulate a benefit for a third person called a third party beneficiary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1538-9\">Once the third party has manifested his intention to avail himself of the benefit, the parties may not dissolve the contract by mutual consent without the beneficiary's agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1538-10\">La.Civ.Code art. 1978. In fact, there is no requirement that the third-party beneficiary even be specifically named in the contract. <em>See Andrepont v. Acadia Drilling Co., </em>255 La. 347, 361-64, 231 So.2d 347, 352-53 (1969) (on reh\u2019g) (citing cases). Because ENIC was specifically named in the contract and because the contract conferred specific benefits upon ENIC, <em>i.e., </em>the payment of its compensation lien and the waiver of all claims against it, ENIC\u2019s benefit was not \u201cmerely incidental\u201d to the settlement. <em>See Wagner &amp; Truax Co. v. Barnett Enters., Inc., </em>447 So.2d 1255, 1259 (La.Ct.App. 4th Cir.1984); <em>HMC Management Corp. v. New Orleans Basketball Club, </em>375 So.2d 700, 708 (La.Ct.App. 4th Cir.1979), <em>writs denied, </em>378 So.2d 1384, 379 So.2d 11 (La.1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-14\">Gayden also argues that ENIC never officially accepted the benefit conferred by the settlement agreement. However, express acceptance or consent to the <em>stipulation pour autri </em>by the beneficiary is not required; assertion by the beneficiary of the claim in a legal proceeding, such as this one, may be sufficient. <em>Andrepont, </em>255 La. at 364-65, 231 So.2d at 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b1538-15\">We find that the language in the Gayden settlement clearly intends a waiver of Gayden\u2019s claim for <em>Moody </em>fees. The settlement agreement provides that \u201c[a]ll parties hereto [including Gayden] waive any claims ... against [ENIC] with respect to the lien.\u201d Gayden points to no other claim he had against ENIC with respect to the lien except his claim for recovery costs. We conclude therefore that Gayden waived his claim for attorney\u2019s fees in the settlement agreement. We also conclude that the settlement agreement included a <em>stipulation pour autri </em>which ENIC, as third-party beneficiary, tried to accept both in the district court and on this appeal. We therefore reverse that part of the district court\u2019s judgment which awarded Gayden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1443\">*1443</page-number>$189,602.58 from ENIC.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1539-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1539-6\">ENIC also appeals King\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees against it. Unlike Gayden\u2019s case, no evidence suggests that ENIC approved King\u2019s settlement. Also unlike Gayden\u2019s case, King specifically reserved his rights against ENIC for attorney\u2019s fees. In the settlement, King agreed to pay ENIC\u2019s lien out of the proceeds of his settlement from the defendants. The settlement further provides that \u201c[t]he payment to intervenors [ENIC] is subject to attorney\u2019s fees and costs, according to law, payable to counsel for T.J. King upon motion to the Court.\u201d Thus King\u2019s case, unlike Gayden\u2019s, clearly puts before us the question whether <em>Moody </em>applies to settlements reached without the employer\u2019s prior written approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b1539-7\">King first argues that ENIC\u2019s refusal to approve the settlement has no effect on <em>Moody\u2019s </em>application because ENIC unreasonably withheld its approval of his settlement. Louisiana law in effect at the time of King's settlement provides that \u201cthe employer or his insurer <em>may not unreasonably refuse </em>to approve a final, good faith settlement\u201d between the employee and the tortfeasor. La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 23:1102(C)(2) (emphasis added) (repealed by Acts 1989, No. 454, \u00a7 10 eff. Jan. 1, 1990).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The law further provides that an employer\u2019s refusal to approve an employee\u2019s settlement \u201cwill be prima facie unreasonable if the amount of the tendered settlement is greater than the discounted value of future compensation and medical benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>While the law imposes penalties on the employer if it unreasonably withholds consent and the case goes to judgment,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it is silent as to the result if the employer unreasonably withholds consent and the case is settled.</p>\n<p id=\"b1539-8\">We conclude that the proper application of this statute to an unapproved settlement is dependent on whether the employer\u2019s refusal to approve the settlement was \u201cunreasonable.\u201d The district court did not make a factual finding on the reasonableness of ENIC\u2019s refusal to approve King\u2019s settlement. We will remand the case for it to do so. If on remand the district court determines that ENIC unreasonably withheld consent from King\u2019s settlement, it should deem the settlement approved. The <em>Moody </em>issue would then be easily resolved because <em>Moody </em>fees may be recovered in the event of a settlement as well as judgments. <em>See, e.g., Herrington v. Mayo, </em>550 So.2d 745 (La.Ct.App. 2d Cir.1989); <em>Sama-nie &amp; Barnes v. Lawler, </em>517 So.2d 340 (La.Ct.App. 1st Cir.1987). Thus if on remand the district court finds that ENIC unreasonably refused to approve King\u2019s settlement, its judgment awarding <em>Moody </em>fees to King is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b1539-13\">If, however, the district court finds that ENIC\u2019s refusal to approve King\u2019s settlement was not unreasonable, we conclude there should be a different result. That result is derived from our interpretation of the interplay between <em>Moody </em>and the Louisiana Worker\u2019s Compensation Act. In <em>Moody, </em>the amount of the employee\u2019s judgment against the third-party tortfeasor was insufficient to reimburse the compensation carrier, pay the attorney his contingency fee, and provide a recovery to the injured worker. Applying principles of co-ownership, the Louisiana Supreme Court concluded that the worker and the compensation carrier were co-owners in the worker\u2019s recovery. 498 So.2d at 1085. The <em>Moody </em>court further held that under the doctrine of <em>negotiorum gestio </em>each co-owner is responsible for his proportionate share of reasonable and necessary legal services that accrue to his benefit. <em>Id. </em>The <em>Moody </em>court therefore established a formula for apportioning the recovery costs between the employee and the compensation carrier on an equitable basis, taking into account the benefit each party had received.</p>\n<p id=\"b1539-14\">It is difficult to fit <em>Moody </em>to our facts if ENIC is deemed not to have approved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1444\">*1444</page-number>King\u2019s settlement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> No cases have been cited to us applying <em>Moody </em>to an unapproved settlement. The Louisiana Worker\u2019s Compensation Act, however, imposes stiff penalties on the employee and the third-party tortfeasor who do not obtain the employer\u2019s approval of the settlement. First, the employee forfeits his right to future compensation. La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 23:1102(B). More importantly, if the employee fails to pay the employer its compensation lien out of the proceeds of an unapproved settlement, the third-party tortfeasor must pay such lien to the employer. Id. \u00a7 23:1102(C)(1); see <em>also id. </em>\u00a7 23:1103 (\u201cNo compromise with such third person [tortfeasor] by either the employer or the injured employee or his dependent shall be binding upon or affect the rights of the others unless assented to by him.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1540-4\">We conclude that the legislative scheme imposing such penalties on the employee and tortfeasor for settling without the employer\u2019s consent is incompatible with Moody\u2019s goal of requiring the employer to contribute to the employee\u2019s attorney\u2019s fees when he recovers damages from the tortfeasor.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We conclude that the legislative goals must prevail over Moody\u2019s goals. Consequently, if the district court on remand determines that ENIC did not unreasonably withhold its consent, it should amend its judgment to deny <em>Moody </em>fees to King.</p>\n<p id=\"b1540-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1540-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1540-7\">At the time of the accident, JALCO had three layers of general liability coverage. JALCO had a primary liability policy with Employers Casualty with limits of $500,000; an excess policy with Interstate providing coverage from $500,000 to $1,000,000; and an umbrella policy with Stonewall providing coverage from $1,000,-000 to $5,000,000. Employers Casualty listed Essex as an additional insured and conceded that Essex was covered under its policy. Based on its status as an additional insured in the primary policy, Essex then claimed the benefits of the Interstate and Stonewall policies. However, the district court held that the Interstate policy only covered named insureds and not additional insureds. The district court further found that although the Stonewall policy covered Essex as an additional insured, Stonewall did not \u201cstep down\u201d to cover the layer of insurance provided by Interstate. This ruling left Essex with a gap in its coverage for the Gayden settlement of $500,000 (the amount between Employers Casualty\u2019s maximum policy limits and Stonewall's minimum policy limits).</p>\n<p id=\"b1540-11\">Essex first contests the district court\u2019s holding that it was not insured under the Interstate policy. The district court found that Essex was not insured under the Interstate policy because Essex was not a \u201cnamed insured\u201d under that policy. Essex concedes that it was not a \u201cnamed insured\u201d under the Interstate policy. Essex contends instead that it was an \u201cother insured\u201d under that policy by virtue of its being an additional insured on the underlying Employers Casualty policy. The Interstate policy does not define the term \u201cinsured,\u201d but does include the following language: \u201cThe provisions of the immediate underlying policy [Employers Casualty] are incorporated as a part of this policy except for ... provisions therein which are inconsistent with this policy.\u201d Interstate Policy, pt. I, HI. Thus because the Employers Casualty policy provides coverage for Essex, the Interstate policy also covers Essex as long as that coverage is not \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the Interstate policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1445\">*1445</page-number>The district court held that the addition of Essex as an additional insured on the underlying policy was a provision \u201cinconsistent\u201d with the Interstate policy because Essex was not a \u201cnamed insured\u201d in the Interstate policy. We disagree. We do not find the addition of Essex as an insured as \u201cinconsistent\u201d with Interstate\u2019s policy. Instead we view the addition as supplemental. Because Interstate\u2019s policy provides that it will incorporate the provisions of the immediate underlying policy, it incorporates Employers Casualty\u2019s definition of insured which includes Essex. As an additional insured in the underlying policy, Essex is entitled to insurance coverage from Interstate according to the provisions of the Interstate policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-5\">Interstate also argues against coverage on grounds that it was not promptly notified of Essex\u2019s addition as an insured. However, Interstate\u2019s policy does not require that notice of additional insureds be given. Instead it requires that prompt notice be given for \u201cany change in <em>coverage </em>of the underlying insurance.\u201d Interstate Policy, pt. IV, 111 (emphasis added). The policy also states that it shall only apply to certain \u201ccoverages\u201d which are set out in the declarations page of the policy. <em>Id. </em>pt. I, H 1. In the declarations page, \u201ccoverage\u201d includes general risks such as bodily injury and property damage for which Interstate provides indemnity. <em>Id. </em>Declarations \u00a7 4. Thus the word \u201ccoverage\u201d as used in this policy refers to the nature of the risks insured against and not to the parties insured.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because the Interstate policy does not require notice of additional insureds, Essex\u2019s standing as an insured under the Interstate policy is not affected by lack of notice. We therefore reverse the district court judgment denying the third-party demand of Essex against Interstate.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1541-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-12\">Stonewall appeals the district court\u2019s finding that it covered Essex. Unlike the Interstate policy, the Stonewall policy defined \u201cInsured\u201d as including \u201cany other person or organization who is an additional Insured under any underlying policy of insurance.\u201d Stonewall Policy, Insuring Agreements \u00a7 11(A)(2). Because Essex was an \u201cadditional Insured\u201d on the \u201cunderlying policy\u201d issued by Employers Casualty, the district court held that Essex was insured by Stonewall. However, Stonewall argues that the following provision in its policy negates coverage for an additional insured such as Essex:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"aqg-dedup-1\"><em>Additions. </em>In the event additional Insureds or additional coverages are added to the underlying insurance while this policy is in force, prompt notice shall be given to the Company and the Company shall be entitled to charge appropriate additional premium.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1541-13\">Stonewall Policy, Conditions 112. Stonewall argues that because it did not receive \u201cprompt notice\u201d that Essex was an additional insured on the underlying policy, it did not provide coverage to Essex.</p>\n<p id=\"b1541-14\">As we read the above \u201cprompt notice\u201d provision, it is designed to give Stonewall two options: It allows Stonewall to evaluate whether to charge an additional premium or to cancel the policy on giving thirty days\u2019 notice of its intent to do so.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> These limitations in the notice provision persuade us that the provision is not a condition of coverage. Thus, failure to give Stonewall prompt notice of Essex\u2019s addition as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1446\">*1446</page-number>insured in the underlying policy did not void coverage to Essex under Stonewall\u2019s policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b1542-4\">Stonewall further argues that neither it nor JALCO intended Essex be added to the underlying primary policy issued by Employers Casualty and that the policies should be reformed to reflect that intent. Reformation is an equitable remedy available to parties to an agreement to correct mutual mistakes that result in a written agreement failing to state the parties\u2019 original intentions. <em>Phillips Oil Co. v. OKC Corp., </em>812 F.2d 265, 274 (5th Cir.), <em>cert..denied, </em>484 U.S. 851, 108 S.Ct. 152, 98 L.Ed.2d 107 (1987). It is unclear whether Stonewall has standing to seek reformation of the Employers Casualty policy because it is not a party to that policy. <em>See Blevins v. Manufacturers Record Publishing Co., </em>235 La. 708, 105 So.2d 392 (1958) (reformation is normally unavailable to those who assert rights arising from an agreement to which they were not parties). Assuming without deciding that Stonewall is a proper party to assert reformation, it was required to prove its claim with clear and convincing evidence. <em>Phillips, </em>812 F.2d at 274.</p>\n<p id=\"b1542-5\">To support its contention that JAL-CO never intended Essex to be an \u201cadditional insured\u201d under its Employers Casualty policy, Stonewall produced a flurry of letters between JALCO and Employers Casualty. Stonewall suggests that these letters demonstrate conclusively that JAL-CO only wanted to add Essex\u2019s cranes to its equipment insurance policy and not to add Essex to its general liability policy. However, in March 1987 Employers Casualty sent Essex a certificate of insurance stating that Essex had been added to JAL-CO\u2019s general liability policy. Employers Casualty later conceded that Essex was an insured under its policy at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1542-9\">The district court found that there was \u201ccredible testimony indicating that JALCO intended to add Essex to its primary policy and that it instructed Employers to do so.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This factual finding by the district court is not clearly erroneous. We therefore affirm that part of the district court\u2019s judgment granting Essex\u2019s claim for coverage against Stonewall in excess of one million dollars for the Gayden accident.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1542-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1542-11\">Finally, Manitowoc and Employers Casualty, as Essex\u2019s insurer, appeal the district court\u2019s apportionment of judicial interest between them in the Gayden case. Manitowoc argues that the amount of judicial interest it was ordered to pay was too much, and Employers Casualty argues that it was too little.</p>\n<p id=\"b1542-12\">In May 1989, Gayden settled with crane manufacturer Manitowoc for $35,000. Then in June 1989, Gayden settled with Essex and its insurers for a stipulated present value of $1,120,000. In July 1989, ENIC moved for summary judgment against Manitowoc, Essex, and Essex\u2019s insurers for payment of its Gayden lien. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of ENIC directing Stonewall and Interstate to pay ENIC\u2019s $189,602.58 compensation lien in accordance with their settlement with Gayden. The district court further directed Manitowoc, Essex, and Employer\u2019s Casualty (as Essex\u2019s insurer) to pay ENIC the judicial interest on that lien. That judgment \u201cpretermit[ted] any determination of solidary obligation among Man-itowoc Inc. and Essex Crane Rental Corporation.\u201d In January 1990, the district court entered judgment limiting Manitowoc\u2019s liability for judicial interest to interest on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1447\">*1447</page-number>$35,000, commencing from when suit was filed against it. Manitowoc argues the assessment of judicial interest against it was too high, and Employers Casualty argues it was too low.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-5\">The issue at hand is how to apportion judicial interest on the employer\u2019s compensation lien between codefendants who separately settle with the plaintiff. Employers Casualty argues that the interest should be split fifty fifty. It argues that the judgment against Manitowoc and Essex was a solidary obligation in which each debtor should share equally in the judgment. Employers Casualty relies on Louisiana Civil Code article 1804 which says that \u201c[ajmong solidary obligors, each is liable for his virile portion.\u201d However, the rest of that article states that \u201c[i]f the obligation arises from an offense or quasi-offense, a virile portion is proportionate to the fault of each obli-gor.\u201d La.Civ.Code art. 1804. Although the Gayden action did not go to trial for a judicial apportionment of fault, we conclude that we should accept the parties\u2019 assessment of their own degree of fault as reflected by their respective contributions to Gayden\u2019s overall recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-6\">Gayden\u2019s total recovery was $1,155,000. Essex and its insurers contributed $1,120,-000, and Manitowoc contributed $35,000. Manitowoc\u2019s $35,000 settlement represents three percent of Gayden\u2019s total recovery. Manitowoc is therefore responsible for interest on only three percent of ENIC\u2019s total compensation lien of $189,602.58. Thus Manitowoc will pay ENIC judicial interest only on $5,688 rather than on $35,-000. On remand, the district court shall modify its judgment accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-7\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-8\">In summary, on the <em>Moody </em>issues, we conclude that Gayden waived his claims for <em>Moody </em>fees in his settlement agreement and that this waiver was intended to benefit ENIC. We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s award of <em>Moody </em>fees to Gay-den from ENIC. We remand the <em>Moody </em>issue in King\u2019s case to the district court. If the district court finds that ENIC unreasonably withheld consent of King\u2019s settlement, it will deem the settlement approved. In that event, the district court\u2019s judgment on the <em>Moody </em>issue is affirmed. If, however, the district court finds that ENIC did not unreasonably refuse to approve King\u2019s settlement, we conclude it should amend its judgment to deny <em>Moody </em>fees to King.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-9\">On the insurance issues, we conclude that Interstate\u2019s excess policy which did not list Essex as a \u201cnamed insured\u201d was not \"inconsistent\u201d with the underlying policy which listed Essex as an \u201cadditional insured.\u201d We further conclude that Interstate\u2019s policy did not require notice of Essex\u2019s addition as an insured as a prerequisite to coverage. We therefore reverse the district court\u2019s judgment exonerating Interstate. We conclude that JALCO\u2019s failure to comply with Stonewall\u2019s requirement of prompt notice of additional insureds did not void its coverage of Essex. We further conclude that the district court did not commit clear error in finding that JALCO intended to add Essex to its primary policy. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s judgment against Stonewall.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-11\">Finally, on the judicial interest issue, we conclude that Manitowoc is responsible for interest based solely on the ratio its settlement bears to Gayden\u2019s total recovery. We therefore modify the district court\u2019s judgment apportioning interest between Manitowoc and Essex. Accordingly, we remand the case to the district court for further proceedings and with instructions to modify its judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-12\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1537-15\">.

On cross-appeal, Gayden argues that the district court erred in limiting ENIC's <em>Moody </em>fees to the amount of its compensation lien.

We grant the petition in part and modify our original opinion, 928 F.2d 1438, as outlined below.</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-16\">We initially concluded that in his settlement agreement with the third-party tort-feasors, Gayden waived his claims for all attorney\u2019s fees against ENIC. On petition for rehearing, Gayden argues that he did not waive his claim for attorney\u2019s fees on his entire recovery, but only on those fees based on ENIC\u2019s lien of $189,602.58. In its memorandum decision of October 24, 1989, the district court specifically divided Gay-den\u2019s award for <em>Moody </em>fees into three distinct parts: (1) the past compensation lien; (2) the discounted value of future compensation; and (3) the discounted value of future medical expenses. <em>Moody </em>specifically gives Gayden a right to recover attorney\u2019s fees based on the value of future compensation benefits. <em>Moody v. Arabie, </em>498 So.2d 1081, 1087 (La.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1543-17\">The settlement agreement reads as follows: \u201cAll parties hereto [including Gay-den] waive any claims ... they may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1448\">*1448</page-number>against Employers National Insurance Company <em>with respect to the lien.\u201d </em>(emphasis added) The word \u201clien\u201d as used in this agreement plainly means the compensation for past benefits ENIC paid on behalf of Gayden. It does not include any credit ENIC may receive toward payment of Gayden\u2019s future compensation benefits. On reflection we are persuaded that Gay-den did not waive any claim for attorney\u2019s fees he may have against ENIC with respect to his future compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1544-4\">The district court will have the same task on remand in connection with the Gayden settlement as it has on the King settlement: It must determine whether ENIC unreasonably withheld approval of the Gay-den settlement. If the district court answers this question in the affirmative, Gay-den may recover attorney\u2019s fees from ENIC for that portion of his award which exceeds ENIC\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b1544-5\">Gayden argued to us in brief and oral argument that the district court erred in limiting his <em>Moody </em>fees to $189,602.58, the amount of ENIC\u2019s compensation lien. Because we originally determined that Gay-den waived all attorney\u2019s fees, we did not address this argument in our original opinion. If the district court awards Gayden attorney\u2019s fees on remand, we conclude that those fees are limited to $189,602.58. We base this conclusion on the language in <em>Moody </em>which provides that the employee\u2019s recovery costs may be paid by the employer \u201cout of his share\u201d of the total recovery. 498 So.2d at 1085 n. 1; see also <em>id. </em>at 1087 <em>(Moody </em>fees calculated \u201c[b]y deducting the employer\u2019s proportionate share of recovery costs from the compensation actually paid.\u201d) Thus <em>Moody </em>caps the amount an employer must contribute to an employee\u2019s recovery costs to that amount it would presently receive from an employee recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1544-6\">In summary, the district court on remand should determine whether ENIC unreasonably refused to approve Gayden\u2019s settlement. If its refusal was unreasonable, the district court should award Gayden attorney\u2019s fees from ENIC on the portion of his award that exceeds the $189,602.58 lien. However, in no event should the district court award Gayden attorney\u2019s fees in excess of $189,602.58.</p>\n<p id=\"b1544-7\">The petition for rehearing is otherwise DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
