(\u201cAppel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>lant\u201d) appeals from a jury verdict in favor of defendant-appellees Geovision Corporation and Geovision Systems, Inc. (\u201cAppel-lees\u201d). Appellant is a designer of software that allows personal computers to display geographical information in the form of maps. Appellees are also in the business of designing computer systems that allow for computer access to geographical information, mostly for use by customers such as municipalities and utilities. Although the two companies are not in exactly the same line of business, they are sufficiently close for the jury to have found that use of the name \u201cGeovision\u201d by both created a likelihood of confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Although the jury found that use of the name \u201cGeovision\u201d by both parties was likely to cause confusion, the jury also found that Appellant did not have priority of use with regard to such trademark.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant argues that the jury\u2019s finding as to priority was tainted because the district court erred by giving the jury a special interrogatory that established January 9, 1986, as the date on which Appellees first used the name \u201cGeovision\u201d in interstate commerce.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant also argues that the district court erred by responding to the jury\u2019s query regarding the meaning of the term \u201csale\u201d with a supplemental instruction defining a \u201csale\u201d as the passing of title from seller to buyer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We conclude that appellant\u2019s challenges on appeal are without merit and we therefore affirm in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">With regard to Appellant\u2019s first argument, we cannot agree that jury interrogatory 2 was improper when Appellant itself gave January 9, 1986 as the date that Appellees first used the trademark in interstate commerce. In the pretrial order, Appellant stated the legal issue to be tried as follows: \u201cWas Plaintiff GEOVISION, Inc. using the name \u2018GEOVISION\u2019 in interstate commerce prior to January 9, 1986.\u201d Pretrial Order, at 5(a). Also in the pretrial order, Appellant stated that Appellees\u2019 \u201cfirst sale under the name of Geovision occurred on January 9, 1986.\u201d Pretrial Order Attachment C at 2. In its opening statement at trial, Appellant again gave January 9, 1986 as the date that Appellees first sold goods under the trademark \u201cGeo-vision.\u201d R2-31. Finally, when the district court proposed the jury interrogatory, not only did Appellant state no objection, R6-823, R7-828, but also complimented the court on doing an \u201cexcellent job.\u201d R7-826.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">It was not until after the jury left the courtroom to commence deliberations that Appellant made even a vague objection to the interrogatory. At that time, Appellant said \u201cI really wonder why the language \u2018prior to January 9, 1986\u2019 is in there ...,\u201d to which the court replied, \u201cbecause that\u2019s the position you adopted in the pretrial order____\u201d R7-905. This untimely and vague objection is not sufficient to persuade us that the district court abused its discretion in holding Appellant to the pretrial order and its other statements that January 9, 1986 was the appropriate date.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-14\">Appellant next argues that the district court erred by giving the jury a sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>plemental instruction defining the term \u201csale\u201d as the passing of title from seller to buyer. Appellant argues that this definition erroneously \u201comitted the definition of a \u2018present sale\u2019 that is defined in O.C.G.A. \u00a7 11-2-106(1) as ... a sale which is accomplished by the making of a contract.\u201d Brief of Appellant at 35-36. Appellant wanted this definition added to the instruction because it alleges that, at the least, it used the trademark in a contract of sale prior to January 9, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1127 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">The term \u201cuse in commerce\u201d means the bona fide use of a mark in the ordinary course of trade, and not made merely to reserve a right in a mark. For purposes of this chapter, a mark shall be deemed to be in use in commerce\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">(1) on goods when\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">(A) it is placed in any manner on the goods or their containers or the displays associated therewith or on the tags or labels affixed thereto, or if the nature of the goods makes such placement impracticable, then on documents associated with the goods or their sale, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">(B) the goods are sold or transported in commerce</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">Although there is a dearth of authority regarding the meaning of the words \u201csold or transported\u201d in \u00a7 1127, we conclude that an unperformed contract of sale is insufficient to constitute the use of a mark in commerce. The plain meaning of \u00a7 1127 requires that the mark be placed on the product (or on the associated documents if the nature of the product makes that impracticable) and that the product be sold or transported in commerce. Thus, the statutory term \u201csold\u201d obviously contemplates a product with the mark on it. Therefore, a mere contract of sale without a product and mark is not within the statutory meaning of a sale.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To constitute \u201ca <em>bona fide </em>sale of the trademarked products in interstate commerce[, ... t]he products bearing the mark should be shipped, mailed, or otherwise sent ... in the ordinary course of trade in effecting a sale.\u201d 1 J. Gilson, <em>Trademark Protection &amp; Practice </em>\u00a7 3.02[2], at 3-34 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">Our conclusion that a mere contract of sale is not sufficient rejects appellant\u2019s only challenge to the supplemental \u201csale\u201d instruction. Thus, we need not, and do not, elaborate further on the meaning of the statutory term, \u201csold.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"AqW\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b484-6\">. Appellees filed a counterclaim in conjunction with their answer seeking to enjoin Appellant from further use of the name. However, the counterclaim was apparently neither pursued in the district court nor on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\">. Jury Interrogatory 2 requested a yes or no response to the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">Prior to January 9, 1986 did the plaintiff in the regular course of business make a bona fide sale or delivery of one of its products in interstate commerce that had attached or affixed to the products or the product's containers or wrappings, tags and labels the mark \"GEOVISION\"?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b484-9\">. The district court\u2019s supplemental instruction relied on the Georgia Uniform Commercial Code, O.C.G.A. \u00a7\u00a7 11-2-106(1) and 11-2-401(2) and provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-17\">Now, Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury, a sale consists in the passing of title from the seller to the buyer for a price. Unless otherwise agreed, title passes to the buyer at the time and the place at which the seller completes his performance with reference to the physical delivery of the goods.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-18\">If the contract requires or authorizes the seller to send to the buyer but does not require him to deliver goods at a destination, title passes to the seller at the time and place of shipment. But if the contract requires delivery at destination, title passes on delivery at destination.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b485-10\">. Contrary to Appellant\u2019s assertions, <em>Taunton </em>v. <em>Allenberg Cotton Co., Inc., </em>378 F.Supp. 34, 39 (N.D.Ga.1973), did not hold that a contract for sale is equivalent to a sale under Georgia law. Rather, <em>Taunton </em>stated only that \u201d[i]t is clear under the Georgia Law that a contract to sell, <em>as distinguished from an actual sale, </em>can relate to a commodity which is not in existence at the time the contract is executed.\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b485-23\">. Appellant\u2019s other arguments are without merit and warrant no discussion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
