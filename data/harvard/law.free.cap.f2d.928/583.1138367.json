We hold that Colon consented to the search of her bag. We remand the issue of whether appellees were illegally seized before that consent was given.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-24\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b680-25\">Agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) Task Force regularly observe passengers departing the express bus from New York City at the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority bus terminal (\u201cthe terminal\u201d) in Buffalo, New York. New York City is the principal source for drugs sold in western New York, and DEA agents believe that the express bus is often used by drug traffickers. Employing a \u201cdrug courier profile,\u201d each month the agents question about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>eighty disembarking passengers and make three to four arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">On August 3, 1989, DEA agents saw Marcos Montilla and Nitza Colon leave the express bus gate and enter the terminal. Montilla was carrying a red duffel bag; Colon was carrying a blue duffel bag. Agent Bruce Johnson testified that Montil-la and Colon appeared to be nervous when they entered the terminal, that they looked around furtively, and that they were talking \u201cvery, very quietly with each other.\u201d As they walked through the terminal, Johnson observed them looking over their shoulders and scanning the terminal. When Montilla and Colon reached Agent Paul Terranova, who was standing against a wall of the terminal, they made a sharp turn and walked rapidly toward an exit, once again looking over their shoulders.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">Terranova and Johnson signaled to each other their suspicion of Montilla and Colon. Johnson approached appellees in an area between the inner doors of the terminal and the outer revolving doors that lead to the street. Johnson testified that he identified himself as a law enforcement officer, displayed his badge, and \u201casked if [he] could speak to them.\u201d According to Johnson, Montilla and Colon both answered \u201cyes\u201d to this question. He then asked them whether they understood English, and they again responded \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Johnson asked appellees for identification. Colon produced a social services card and stated that she lived on Mariner Street in Buffalo. Montilla said that he had no identification and that he was from New York City. As Terranova approached, he noticed a bulge in Montilla\u2019s rear pocket, pointed to it and asked Montilla whether he was sure that he did not have any identification. Terranova testified at a suppression hearing that Montilla pulled out a wallet and stated \u201cyes I do.\u201d The wallet contained three identification cards. One bore the name \u201cRobert Rutkowski\u201d while the other two were in Montilla\u2019s name. Terra-nova questioned Montilla about the Rut-kowski identification, but Montilla remained silent.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">While Terranova was questioning Montil-la, Johnson asked Colon what she had done in New York City, and how long she had been there. Colon answered that she had been in New York City for two weeks. One of the agents commented that she did not appear to have much luggage for a two-week stay. Colon shrugged her shoulders and did not answer. At this point, Johnson testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b681-9\">I explained that we were members of the Drug Enforcement Task Force and we were looking for narcotics, and I said, would you mind if we took a quick look through your bags____ I said, you\u2019re not under arrest, you don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to. At that point [Colon] said, yes, and [Montilla] nodded his head yes and unzipped both bags.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b681-12\">Terranova gave similar testimony concerning the request to look through the bags.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-13\">Montilla\u2019s bag contained only clothing and personal items. A search of Colon\u2019s bag, however, revealed a hard shape wrapped in an article of clothing. Inside the clothing was a plastic bag containing a taped package. Terranova testified that \u201cthe manner in which it was packaged and hidden is very consistent with subjects that travel with narcotics.\u201d The agents then asked appellees to accompany them to the terminal security office. In the taped package was white powder that was ultimately found to be cocaine. Montilla and Colon were placed under arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-14\">While the white powder was being tested, Johnson summoned a Spanish-speaking Border Patrol agent, John Crocitto, based on the suspicion that appellees were illegal aliens. Crocitto gave both appellees <em>Miranda </em>warnings. He testified that he spoke with Colon mostly in English and read the <em>Miranda </em>warnings to her in English. She indicated that she understood. Crocitto said that Montilla had little knowledge of English and that he read the <em>Miranda </em>warnings to Montilla in Spanish. After the warnings, Montilla told Crocitto \u201cthat the problem was his and had nothing to do with [Colon], and that he was ready to face whatever was coming in his direction.\u201d Montilla admitted that he had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>brought the cocaine from New York City. When asked how the package had gotten into Colon\u2019s bag, Montilla said that he had put it there. Crocitto did not hear Montilla speak English at any time.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-4\">Montilla and Colon were indicted for possessing with intent to distribute cocaine and for conspiracy to commit the substantive offense in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846 (1988) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 (1988). Appellees moved to suppress the physical evidence of the cocaine found in Colon\u2019s bag. At the suppression hearing the government argued that the initial questioning of Montilla and Colon was justified by a reasonable suspicion that they were transporting drugs. The government also contended that Colon consented to the search of her bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The district court ruled that \u201cthe officers were not justified in stopping the individual defendants, seeking identification and asking to examine their baggage,\u201d <em>United States v. Montilla, </em>733 F.Supp. 579, 584 (W.D.N.Y.1990). Observing that many travelers carry duffel bags, do not carry large amounts of luggage, speak in a confidential tone to their traveling companions, and \u201care anxious to be on their journey after a long bus ride,\u201d Judge Curtin held that the information initially available to the agents was insufficient to match a legitimate drug courier profile. <em>See id. </em>at 582-83, 584. The government does not challenge this ruling on appeal. The district court also ruled that, even if the decision to stop appellees was justified, neither appellee had given knowing and voluntary consent to the search of the bags. <em>See id. </em>at 584.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">In a motion for reconsideration, the government argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the initial questioning of Montilla and Colon was a consensual encounter rather than a seizure for Fourth Amendment purposes, that Colon and Montilla consented to the search of their bags, and that, in any event, Montilla had no standing to challenge an illegal search of Colon\u2019s bag. The district court denied the motion, stating that the District of Columbia Circuit cases on which the government\u2019s new argument was based were \u201cwrongly decided\u201d in light of <em>Reid v. Georgia, </em>448 U.S. 438, 100 S.Ct. 2752, 65 L.Ed.2d 890 (1980) (per curiam). <em>See United States v. Montilla, </em>739 F.Supp. 143, 144 (W.D.N.Y.1990). Addressing the facts of the encounter with Montilla and Colon, the court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AdY\">considering all of the circumstances in this case, it would be reasonable for the defendants to assume that they were not free to leave. The agents had Montilla\u2019s identification, they had identified themselves as federal agents, they never told the defendants that they were free to leave, and they had the bags under control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-10\"><em>Id. </em>Finally, the court declined to address the government\u2019s standing argument, observing that \u201c[t]his argument was not raised during the time of the original hearing, and the court sees no need to consider it at the present time.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-11\">The government now appeals the district court\u2019s suppression order pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3731 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b682-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b682-13\">On this appeal, the government has abandoned its earlier position that the agents had a reasonable suspicion to detain defendants for questioning under the authority of <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). We thus first consider whether Colon consented to the search of her bag. Because we conclude that she did,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we then address whether that consent was invalid because it was given in the course of an illegal seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-14\">A. <em>Colon\u2019s Consent to the Search</em></p>\n<p id=\"b682-15\">The district court found that Colon did not voluntarily consent to the search of her bag. <em>See </em>733 F.Supp. at 584; 739 F.Supp. at 145. We disagree. The district court\u2019s credibility findings, which are binding upon us, accepted the DEA agents\u2019 version of events concerning the search of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Colon\u2019s bag. The agents testified that they told Montilla and Colon that they were narcotics officers who were looking for drugs. Johnson then asked them: \u201c[W]ould you mind if we took a quick look through your bags____ [Yjou\u2019re not under arrest, you don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to.\u201d Colon answered \u201cyes\u201d to this question and Montilla nodded his head. <em>See </em>739 F.Supp. at 144-45; 733 F.Supp. at 581. The record is unclear as to whether Johnson or Montilla unzipped the bags. However, Colon in no way objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">In its initial opinion, the court stressed the \u201cstudied, offhand manner\u201d in which the request was made and in particular the fact that the agents avoided using the word \u201csearch.\u201d The court also noted that the agents held appellees\u2019 identification, and that Colon did not open her own bag for the search. <em>See </em>733 F.Supp. at 584. On reconsideration, the court reaffirmed its conclusion that Colon\u2019s affirmative response to the request to search was insufficient to indicate consent. The court speculated that the word \u201cyes\u201d may have been used as an acknowledgement of a series of statements rather than consent to the request to search or may have had a different meaning to someone such as Colon who was \u201cprimarily a Spanish-speaking individual.\u201d <em>See </em>739 F.Supp. at 145.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">The district court\u2019s conclusions are not supported by the testimony it accepted as true. Whether avoiding the word \u201csearch\u201d or requesting a \u201cquick look\u201d might be viewed as \u201coffhand\u201d is beside the point in view of the fact that the agents unambiguously informed appellees that they were looking for narcotics and that they wished to look through the bags. There is no reason to believe that Colon, who did not testify at the suppression hearing, viewed that request as \u201croutine,\u201d \u201coffhand,\u201d or not likely to lead to serious consequences if narcotics were discovered. Moreover, the district court stated in its second opinion that the agents held only Montilla\u2019s identification when the request to search was made. <em>See </em>739 F.Supp. at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">Finally, Colon\u2019s words and actions indicated that she consented to the search. There is no evidence that Colon had any trouble understanding the agents\u2019 request to look in her bag. She spoke primarily in English at all relevant times, and no one testified that she had any difficulty understanding questions or framing answers. There is, therefore, no reason to discount Colon\u2019s direct and unambiguous answer to the request to search her bag.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">B. <em>The Initial Encounter and Questioning</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">We now consider whether Colon\u2019s consent was vitiated because she and Montilla were illegally seized when the agents initially approached and questioned them. We reiterate that if a seizure occurred, it was illegal, because the government makes no claim that the agents had probable cause for an arrest or that the encounter was a stop valid under <em>Terry v. Ohio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-13\">As the Supreme Court has repeatedly observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-14\">Obviously, not all personal intercourse between policemen and citizens involves \u201cseizures\u201d of persons. Only when the officer, by means of physical force or show of authority, has in some way restrained the liberty of a citizen may we conclude that a \u201cseizure\u201d has occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2q\"><em>Michigan v. Chestemut, </em>486 U.S. 567, 573, 108 S.Ct. 1975, 1979, 100 L.Ed.2d 565 (1988) (quoting <em>Terry, </em>392 U.S. at 19 n. 16, 88 S.Ct. at 1878 n. 16). A person has been seized for purposes of the Fourth Amendment \u201conly if, in view of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident, a reasonable person would have believed that he was not free to leave.\u201d <em>United States v. Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 554, 100 S.Ct. 1870, 1877, 64 L.Ed.2d 497 (1980) (plurality opinion of Stewart, J.); <em>see also Chesternut, </em>486 U.S. at 573, 108 S.Ct. at 1979 (unanimous Court applying <em>Mendenhall </em>standard); <em>INS v. Delgado, </em>466 U.S. 210, 215, 104 S.Ct. 1758, 1762, 80 L.Ed.2d 247 (1984); <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>460 U.S. 491, 502, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 1326, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983) (plurality opinion of White, J.); <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>897 F.2d 26, 30 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 110 S.Ct. 3250, 111 L.Ed.2d 760 (1990). The Court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>noted that this standard is \u201cnecessarily imprecise\u201d and that \u201cwhat constitutes a restraint on liberty prompting a person to conclude that he is not free to \u2018leave\u2019 will vary, not only with the particular police conduct at issue, but also with the setting in which the conduct occurs.\u201d <em>Chesternut, </em>486 U.S. at 573-74, 108 S.Ct. at 1979-80. Examples of circumstances that may lead a reasonable person to conclude that he or she is not free to leave include \u201cthe threatening presence of several officers, the display of a weapon by an officer, some physical touching of the person of the citizen, or the use of language or tone of voice indicating that compliance with the officer\u2019s request might be compelled.\u201d <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. at 554, 100 S.Ct. at 1877; see <em>also United States v. Sugrim, </em>732 F.2d 25, 28 (2d Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings under the familiar \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard. <em>See United States v. Mast, </em>735 F.2d 745, 749 (2d Cir.1984). However, there exists some uncertainty concerning the appropriate standard of review for the ultimate determination of whether a reasonable person would have felt free to leave. <em>See United States v. Ceballos, </em>812 F.2d 42, 47 n. 1 (2d Cir.1987). Although the Supreme Court has not spoken unequivocally on this subject, we believe that findings as to what the various parties to such an encounter said or did are subject to the clearly erroneous standard. However, whether those statements and acts resulted in a seizure is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Cf. United States v. Patrick, </em>899 F.2d 169, 171 (2d Cir.1990) (reviewing <em>de novo </em>whether probable cause to arrest existed on the basis of the district court\u2019s factual findings).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">The \u201creasonable person\u201d test is an objective standard that \u201callows the police to determine in advance whether the conduct contemplated will implicate the Fourth Amendment\u201d and \u201censures that the scope of Fourth Amendment protection does not vary with the state of mind of the particular individual being approached.\u201d <em>Chesternut, </em>486 U.S. at 574, 108 S.Ct. at 1980. Such an objective inquiry pointedly eschews consideration of intent and involves an essentially legal assessment of whether the particular circumstances would warrant the belief that a person has been detained. Moreover, the Supreme Court\u2019s own practice suggests strongly that it views the seizure issue as a legal question. In <em>Florida v. Royer, </em>Justice White's plurality opinion applied the <em>Mendenhall </em>test without relying on, or deferring to, the trial court\u2019s seizure ruling. <em>See </em>460 U.S. at 501-02, 103 S.Ct. at 1326-27. Similarly, in <em>Chesternut </em>a unanimous Court reversed the magistrate\u2019s determination that the defendant had been seized, again without deference to the trier of fact. <em>See </em>486 U.S. at 574, 108 S.Ct. at 1980 (\u201cApplying the Court\u2019s test to the facts of this case, we conclude that respondent was not seized by the police____\u201d). We thus hold that the seizure issue is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">On the government\u2019s motion for reconsideration, the district court ruled that Montilla and Colon were illegally seized when the agents approached and questioned them. <em>See </em>739 F.Supp. at 144. Although the district court based its ruling on \u201call of the circumstances in this case,\u201d it enumerated four facts as decisive: (i) the agents had Montilla\u2019s identification; (ii) they had identified themselves as federal agents; (iii) they never told appellees that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>they were free to leave; and (iv) the agents had appellees\u2019 bags under their control. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">Before assessing the legal significance of these findings, we consider whether they are supported by the record. The first three findings are undisputed. However, the district court\u2019s finding that the bags were under the agents\u2019 control is clearly erroneous. There is no evidence of any action by the agents that could reasonably be deemed an assertion of control over the bags until they conducted the search. <em>See </em>783 F.Supp. at 581. Accordingly, we conclude that the agents did not have control over the bags until the search.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">The remaining findings are insufficient to support the legal conclusion that Montilla and Colon were seized. Johnson testified that he approached Montilla and Colon and asked whether he might speak with them, to which Colon answered \u201cyes\u201d and Montilla nodded. <em>See </em>739 F.Supp. at 144-45; 733 F.Supp. at 581. The agents did not have Montilla\u2019s identification when they initiated the encounter and retained it only when they discovered that he was carrying identification in two different names. In any event, the district court expressly found that the request to search the defendants\u2019 bags was more or less simultaneous with the examination of their identification. <em>See </em>733 F.Supp. at 581. Whatever minimal coercive effect the discussion of the identification may have had, it was not a sufficient show of force or authority to undermine the consensual nature of the encounter as recounted by Johnson. Similarly, it was entirely appropriate for the agents to identify themselves as federal drug enforcement agents. Such identification does not convert the consensual encounter into a seizure. <em>See Royer, </em>460 U.S. at 497, 103 S.Ct. at 1324 (plurality opinion of White, J.). Finally, although it is true that the agents did not tell appellees that they were free to leave or to refuse to talk to the agents, the encounter as described by Johnson \u201cpossessed none of the indicia of force or authority that typically earmark[] a Fourth Amendment seizure.\u201d <em>United States v. Barrios-Moriera, </em>872 F.2d 12, 15 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 110 S.Ct. 364, 107 L.Ed.2d 350 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">The district court made incomplete factual findings regarding the initial encounter because of its view of the governing law. In support of the claim that no seizure occurred, the government relied in the district court on a number of recent District of Columbia Circuit cases that found there was no seizure in circumstances similar to the instant case. <em>See United States v. Maragh, </em>894 F.2d 415 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 111 S.Ct. 214, 112 L.Ed.2d 174 (1990); <em>United States v. Winston, </em>892 F.2d 112 (D.C.Cir.1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 110 S.Ct. 3277, 111 L.Ed.2d 787 (1990); <em>United States v. Lloyd, </em>868 F.2d 447 (D.C.Cir.1989). The district court expressed the opinion that \u201c[i]n view of <em>Reid v. Georgia ... </em>these cases were wrongly decided.\u201d 739 F.Supp. at 144 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">We believe that the district court\u2019s reliance on <em>Reid </em>was misplaced. That case raised only the question of whether a DEA agent had reasonable suspicion to stop and question a suspect. The state courts had apparently assumed a seizure had occurred and \u201caddressed only the question whether the agent\u2019s actions were justified by articu-lable and reasonable grounds of suspicion.\u201d 448 U.S. at 443, 100 S.Ct. at 2755 (Powell, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-12\">Our own cases are consistent with those of the District of Columbia Circuit. In <em>Barrios-Moriera, </em>for example, we held that an agent who followed a suspect into the common hallway of an apartment building and pursued him up the stairs to the door of his apartment did not seize the suspect. <em>See </em>872 F.2d at 15. Similarly, in <em>Moreno, </em>agents \u201casked the defendants to \u2018come over here for a second.\u2019 \u201d When one suspect did not comply, an agent displayed his badge and called out to him. <em>See </em>897 F.2d at 28. We held that defendants were not seized and voluntarily agreed to speak to the agents. <em>See id. </em>at 30-31. In contrast, in <em>Ceballos, </em>we found a seizure where agents went to defendant\u2019s place of work, requested that he accompany them to their office in a manner that conveyed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>strong sense of urgency, and compounded the initial impression that the defendant was legally obliged to accompany the agents by denying his request to follow them to the office in his own vehicle. <em>See </em>812 F.2d at 48-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Despite our ruling that the district court\u2019s findings do not support its conclusion that Montilla and Colon were illegally seized, we cannot conclude that the encounter was necessarily consensual. Because of the government\u2019s shifting positions and the district court\u2019s view of the law, the district court never found whether Johnson\u2019s version of events \u2014 a simple request to speak with appellees in the non-coercive atmosphere of a public place to which they responded \u201cyes\u201d \u2014 was accurate. If so, we believe the initial encounter was consensual and lawful for the same reasons stated in our discussion concerning Colon\u2019s consent. If the district court finds Johnson\u2019s version of events inaccurate, it should make findings as to what actually occurred, and the appropriate legal principles can then be applied to those facts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We therefore remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b682-7\">. Because we find that Colon consented to the search, we do not address the government's argument that Montilla lacked standing to challenge the search of Colon\u2019s bag.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b684-5\">. There is a conflict among the circuits concerning the appropriate standard of review regarding the seizure issue. The D.C. Circuit recently has adopted a <em>de novo </em>standard of review for Fourth Amendment seizure issues. <em>See United States v. Maragh, </em>894 F.2d 415, 417-18 (D.C.Cir.), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 111 S.Ct. 214, 112 L.Ed.2d 174 (1990). However, other circuits that have directly considered the issue appear to have adopted a \"clearly erroneous\u201d standard of review. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Rose, </em>889 F.2d 1490, 1495 (6th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Gray, </em>883 F.2d 320, 322 (4th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Teslim, </em>869 F.2d 316, 321 (7th Cir.1989). <em>But see United States v. Mines, </em>883 F.2d 801, 803 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 110 S.Ct. 552, 107 L.Ed.2d 549 (1990) (\"findings of fact\u201d are reviewed for clear error while \" \u2018[t]he ultimate conclusion of the lawfulness of a seizure ... is reviewed de novo\u2019 \u2019\u2019) (quoting <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>812 F.2d 1250, 1253 (9th Cir.1987)); <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>843 F.2d 1089, 1092 (8th Cir.1988) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b686-6\">. If the district court finds that the encounter with appellees constituted an unlawful seizure, it should then consider whether the illegal stop tainted Colon's consent to the search of her bag. <em>See Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963). Under <em>Wong Sun, </em>an illegal stop would invalidate Colon\u2019s consent to the search unless the government bears its burden of showing that the taint of the initial stop had been dissipated before the consent was given. <em>See Brown v. Illinois, </em>422 U.S. 590, 603-04, 95 S.Ct. 2254, 2261-62, 45 L.Ed.2d 416 (1975); <em>United States v. Vasquez, </em>638 F.2d 507, 527 (2d Cir.1980); <em>United States v. Ceballos, </em>812 F.2d 42 (2d Cir.1987). In determining whether the taint of an illegal stop has been dissipated, we consider four factors: whether a <em>Miranda </em>warning was given, the temporal proximity of the stop and the consents, the presence of intervening circumstances, and the purpose and flagrancy of the illegal stop. <em>See Brown, </em>422 U.S. at 603-04, 95 S.Ct. at 2261-62; <em>United States v. Oguns, </em>921 F.2d 442, 446-47 (2d Cir.1990); <em>Ceballos, </em>812 F.2d at 50. It appears that in the instant case it is extremely unlikely that the government can satisfy its burden of showing that the taint of an illegal seizure had been dissipated before Colon consented to the search. However, given the lack of findings as to the initial encounter, we are unprepared to reach that conclusion as a matter of law.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
