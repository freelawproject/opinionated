The petition for en banc rehearing does not appear to take issue with or suggest any error in our conclusion that the Administration\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-22\">discussion of the final stage manufacturing industry excludes the certification problems of manufacturers using cutaway or stripped chassis, concedes that the impact on manufacturers\u2019 pass-through certification limits is unknown, and nowhere provides numbers or estimates of the impact on small businesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-23\">This evidence from the record reveals that the Administration did not carefully consider the compliance problem of final-stage manufacturere, despite the many attempts of initial and final-stage manufacturers to bring the problem to the Administration\u2019s attention. The Administration\u2019s responses to these attempts consist of a few sentences with no additional information or study of the issue. Because the Administration did not show its work and elaborate on how it reached its conclusions, we are left to suppose either that the statements rest on studies not made part of the record \u2014 in which case we cannot provide adequate review \u2014 or they rest on the Administration\u2019s conjecture. Neither scenario leads us to view the proposed amendment favorably.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-24\">In view of the absence in the rehearing petition of any effective argument which takes issue with or cases doubt on the Court\u2019s holding as stated above, the petition is denied. Judge Guy adheres to his dissenting opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-25\">Accordingly, it is so ORDERED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
