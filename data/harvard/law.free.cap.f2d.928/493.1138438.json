Rosenthal appeals from an order entered in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Edward R. Korman, District Judge) granting summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee Prudential Property <em>&amp; </em>Casualty Company (\u201cPrudential\u201d). Rosenthal, an attorney, commenced this action to recover under an insurance policy issued by Prudential for losses he sustained in a fire. Prudential asserted, as an affirmative defense, that Rosenthal\u2019s refusal to submit to an examination under oath (\u201cEUO\u201d) constituted a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>material breach of the terms of the policy. Following a conditional denial of Prudential\u2019s first summary judgment motion, the district court granted Prudential\u2019s second summary judgment motion, finding as a matter of law that Rosenthal\u2019s continued failure to submit to an EUO constituted a material breach of his obligations under the policy. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">On October 13, 1988, while Rosenthal\u2019s property was insured under the Prudential policy, a fire destroyed the premises. Prudential started a routine investigation into the fire. Three months later, before the investigation was completed, Rosenthal commenced this action on the policy. In its answer, Prudential raised an affirmative defense that Rosenthal had materially breached the contract of insurance by refusing to submit to an EUO.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Shortly thereafter, Prudential moved for summary judgment. In opposition, Rosen-thal claimed that his refusal to submit to an EUO was not \u201cwillful\u201d because he had relied in good faith on the advice of his counsel. The district court denied the motion \u201con the condition that [Rosenthal] comply with the contractual obligation for submitting to an examination and inspection.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">During the ensuing five months, Rosen-thal\u2019s EUO was scheduled no less than six times. On one occasion, Rosenthal appeared, testified for two hours and terminated the examination because he had another appointment. Subsequent attempts to complete Rosenthal\u2019s testimony failed because he continued to insist on adjournments to accommodate, <em>inter alia, </em>his law practice. Two of the adjournments, including the last one on November 8, 1989, were not on Prudential\u2019s consent and a default was noted on the record when Rosenthal and his counsel failed to appear for the examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Prudential moved a second time for summary judgment. In opposition, Rosenthal again claimed that his refusal was not willful \u2014 this time because of scheduling conflicts. Rosenthal professed that he was willing to reschedule the EUO at a mutually convenient date after November 8, 1989, but Prudential refused to agree to any further adjournments. This time the district court granted Prudential\u2019s motion, finding that Rosenthal\u2019s continued refusal to submit to an EUO was willful and constituted a material breach of his obligations under the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-10\">Rosenthal countered with a motion for reargument on \u201cnew evidence\u201d grounds. He claimed that Prudential had actually agreed to reschedule the EUO for November 14, 1989. The district court denied the motion for reargument, noting both the inconsistency in Rosenthal\u2019s position and the fact that this purported agreement to adjourn until November 14, 1989 was curiously omitted in Rosenthal\u2019s opposition to Prudential\u2019s second summary judgment motion. Rosenthal now challenges the district court\u2019s grant of Prudential\u2019s second summary judgment motion and its denial of Rosenthal\u2019s motion for reargument.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b590-12\">The insured's compliance with a request to appear at an EUO is a condition precedent to the insurer\u2019s obligation to indemnify. <em>See Ausch v. St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>125 A.D.2d 43, 50, 511 N.Y.S.2d 919, 925 (2d Dep\u2019t), <em>appeal denied, </em>70 N.Y.2d 610, 522 N.Y.S.2d 110, 516 N.E.2d 1223 (1987) (citing <em>Bulzomi v. New York Central Mut. Fire Ins. Co., </em>92 A.D.2d 878, 459 N.Y.S.2d 861 (2d Dep\u2019t 1983)). The insured\u2019s willful failure to appear at an EUO constitutes \u201ca material breach of the cooperation clause and a defense to an action on the policy.\u201d <em>Ausch, </em>125 A.D.2d at 50, 511 N.Y.S.2d at 925 (citation omitted). Although Rosenthal has no quarrel with these principles of law, he claims that his conduct was not willful and that he should have one last chance to comply. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-13\">When the insured\u2019s failure to fulfill his obligations under an insurance policy \u201cis indicative of a pattern of non-co-operation [sic] for which no reasonable excuse for noncompliance has been proffered,\u201d <em>Bulzomi, </em>92 A.D.2d at 878, 459 N.Y.S.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>862, his conduct is properly deemed willful. <em>See Lentini Bros. Moving &amp; Storage Co. v. New York Property Ins. Underwriting Assoc., </em>53 N.Y.2d 835, 836, 440 N.Y.S.2d 174, 175, 422 N.E.2d 819, 820 (1981), <em>aff'g, </em>76 A.D.2d 759, 428 N.Y.S.2d 684 (1st Dep\u2019t 1980); <em>Ausch, </em>125 A.D.2d at 50, 511 N.Y. S.2d at 925; <em>Caramanica v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., </em>110 A.D.2d 869, 870, 488 N.Y.S.2d 426, 427 (2d Dep\u2019t 1985); <em>Bulzomi, </em>92 A.D.2d at 878-79, 459 N.Y.S.2d at 862. The willfulness of Rosenthal\u2019s breach seems clear. Purported \u201cscheduling conflicts\u201d simply cannot justify a thirteen-month delay that included six adjournments. <em>See, e.g., Bulzomi, </em>92 A.D.2d at 878, 459 N.Y.S.2d at 862 (refusal willful where insured had three opportunities to appear for EUO).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">The district court\u2019s refusal to make the dismissal conditional was also proper. To the extent that New York law allows a recalcitrant insured a \u201clast opportunity\u201d to cooperate, <em>see Pogo Holding Corp. v. New York Property Ins. Underwriting Assoc., </em>73 A.D.2d 605, 606, 422 N.Y.S.2d 123, 124 (2d Dep\u2019t 1979), Rosenthal was afforded such an opportunity when the district court denied Prudential\u2019s first summary judgment motion on the condition that he submit to the EUO.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">We note, however, that New York courts have recently retreated from affording an insured a \u201clast opportunity\u201d when the insured\u2019s refusal to cooperate is willful. <em>See Evans v. International Ins. Co., </em>App.Div., 562 N.Y.S.2d 692 (1990); <em>Pizzirusso v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>143 A.D.2d 340, 341, 532 N.Y.S.2d 309, 310 (2d Dep\u2019t), <em>appeal dismissed, </em>73 N.Y.2d 808, 537 N.Y.S.2d 478, 534 N.E.2d 316 (1988); <em>Averbuch v. Home Ins. Co., </em>114 A.D.2d 827, 829, 494 N.Y.S.2d 738, 739-40 (2d Dep\u2019t 1985); <em>Azeem v. Colonial Assurance Co., </em>96 A.D.2d 123, 125-26, 468 N.Y.S.2d 248, 250 (4th Dep\u2019t 1983), <em>aff'd mem., </em>62 N.Y.2d 951, 479 N.Y.S.2d 216, 468 N.E.2d 54 (1984); <em>Williams v. American Home Assurance Co., </em>97 A.D.2d 707, 708-09, 468 N.Y.S.2d 341, 343 (1st Dep\u2019t 1983), <em>aff'd mem., </em>62 N.Y.2d 953, 479 N.Y.S.2d 216, 468 N.E.2d 54 (1984). Indeed, the New York Court of Appeals has held, \u201c[wjithout indicating approval\u201d of <em>Pogo, </em>that \u201c[i]n view of the insured\u2019s unexcused and willful refusal to comply, there is no reason to deny summary judgment dismissing the complaint unconditionally.\u201d <em>Lentini, </em>53 N.Y.2d at 836-37, 440 N.Y.S.2d at 175, 422 N.E.2d at 820. The Court of Appeals\u2019 subsequent affir-mances of <em>Azeem </em>and <em>Williams </em>suggest that a finding of willfulness extinguishes any \u201cright\u201d to a \u201clast opportunity.\u201d We intend to follow this direction from New York\u2019s highest court.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">Finally, we reject Rosenthal\u2019s claim that reargument was improvidently denied. As Rosenthal\u2019s \u201cnew evidence\u201d directly contradicted his earlier factual claims, the district court did not abuse its discretion by disregarding that \u201cnew evidence\u201d and denying reargument. <em>See Reisner v. General Motors Corp., </em>671 F.2d 91, 93 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>459 U.S. 858, 103 S.Ct. 130, 74 L.Ed.2d 112 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b591-10\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed in all respects.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
