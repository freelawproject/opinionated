It presents exclusively the same jurisdictional question which, in <em>Mead </em>v. <em>Peterson-King Co. </em>(1970), 24 Mich App 530, 533, 534, was dealt with by Division 3 as the \u201cfirst issue on appeal.\u201d By our order of August 26, 1970, entered upon application for leave to review <em>Mead, </em>the latter was held in abeyance pending decision of the appeal now at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">February 13, 1959 Harold Modeen, a regular employee of self-insuring Consumers Power Co., sustained a compensable injury arising out of and in the course of his employment. He engaged counsel (Sessions &amp; Barlow of Muskegon) to sue certain allegedly negligent third parties, pursuant to the 1952 amendment of \u00a7 15 of part III of the workmen\u2019s compensation law (MCLA 413.15 [Stat Ann 1968 Rev \u00a7 17.189]). By agreement of employee Modeen and employer Consumers, the latter did not join in the suit but did cooperate fully with Mr. Modeen in the prosecution thereof. It is stipulated that, as the suit neared trial, \u201c # * # a settlement was reached between Mr. Modeen and Consumers Power Co. on one side and certain of the defendants [Wilde and Reeths] for a total of $75,000.\u201d May 15, 1961 the suit as against defendants Wilde and Reeths was dismissed with prejudice upon stipulation and order of the court. Separately and on the same date the remaining defendant was correspondingly dismissed, apparently without monetary contribution. Excepting as noted in this opinion, all details of the agreed settlement and final disposition of the suit appear in the appeal board\u2019s opinion, quoted <em>post.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>The general release of third-party defendants Wilde and Reeths was signed by Mr. Modeen and also by his wife. She is the present plaintiff. The release is in the usual unconditional form and needs no expatiation. The release by Consumers Power Co. of the same defendants was executed and delivered separately. Consumers\u2019 May 22, 1961 letter to Sessions &amp; Barlow, by which Consumers paid its agreed share of \u201cattorneys fees and expenses\u201d incurred in connection with the third-party suit, reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\u201cGentlemen:</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">\u201cEnclosed, pursuant to our agreement, is Consumers Power Company\u2019s check No. 767, dated May 18, 1961, made payable to Sessions <em>&amp; </em>Barlow, in the amount of $3,450.08.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">\u201cThis check is in full payment of Consumers Power Company\u2019s share of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses in the above matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Mr. Modeen died in 1966 from causes not related to his compensable injury. Shortly thereafter his widow engaged present counsel to file the instant application for claimed benefits under the workmen\u2019s compensation law, \u201crequesting apportionment of the costs of the third-party recovery week by week against the employer.\u201d The opinion of the appeal board, on review of denial by the referee of the plaintiff\u2019s application, proceeded to affirmance this way:</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">\u201cPlaintiff suffered a personal injury that arose out of and in the course of his employment on 2-13-59, and received compensation voluntarily paid at the rate of $40.00 per week until 4-22-61, when a third-party settlement in the total amount of $75,000.00 was concluded. Workmen\u2019s compensation and medical expenses paid by defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>amounted to $11,450.08 leaving a gross sum of $63,549.92 against which was charged attorney fee of $16,678.09, and other expenses of recovery of $121.34. Thus, attorney fees and other expenses of recovery amounted to 26.4% of the third-party settlement proceeds. Defendant had already paid $3,321.91 on his [its] share of the total expenses of recovery, including attorney fees, amounting to $20,121.34.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">\u201cAfter the third-party settlement, plaintiff remained totally disabled until the date of his death on 8-21-66, of causes unrelated to his personal injury of 2-13-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">\u201cUpon plaintiff\u2019s death, his widow filed a petition for hearing which the referee denied and credited defendant for compensation voluntarily paid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Then, having quoted portions of \u00a7 15 with emphasis of the sentence:</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">\u201c \u2018The expenses of recovery above mentioned shall be apportioned by the court between the parties as their interests appear at the time of said recovery.\u2019 \u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">the board went on to rule, in praiseworthy compendium :</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">\u201cThis Board not being the \u2018Court\u2019 mentioned in the Statute does not have the power to \u2018apportion\u2019 the \u2018expenses of recovery.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">May 14, 1969 the Court of Appeals denied leave to appeal, ruling \u201clack of merit in the grounds presented.\u201d This Court, being informed of the upcoming pendency of the <em>Mead </em>case, supra, granted leave to review July 15, 1969 (382 Mich 769).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">No question of Mrs. Modeen\u2019s right if any to dependency benefits, under the workmen\u2019s compensation law, is involved. Today\u2019s issue is sharp; whether in the light of the arms-length settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>agreed to under the statute, both by the employee and his widow with the assistance of able counsel, the department is vested with jurisdiction to provide for the plaintiff widow more \u201capportionment\u201d than she and her husband obtained when they signed off in May of 1961. To provide due understanding of the contention we quote plaintiff\u2019s counsel directly:</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\u201cIn a nutshell what plaintiff wants is to be reimbursed for the cost of recovery of each week\u2019s credit the employer takes <em>as it is taken, </em>surely not an exorbitant and preposterous request. Our problem is that although our request seems reasonable we can\u2019t find a forum to make it in.\u201d (Emphasis supplied by counsel.)</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">Then, having referred to the appeal board\u2019s presently quoted opinion and to said \u00a7 16, counsel proceed:</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">\u201cThe Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Board members are reluctant to assert its authority in this situation; they feel they are not a \u2018Court\u2019 (which is true) and they apparently feel that this ongoing apportionment of the recovery is reserved by the statute to a \u2018Court\u2019 (which we feel is not true). Thus, the tribunal charged by law with responsibility for determination of all other compensation problems is diffident about asserting its authority in this one. Hence our problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">To \u201cfind a forum to make it in\u201d counsel rely particularly upon \u00a7 16 of part III of the statute. The section read, originally (CL 1915, \u00a7 5469):</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">\u201cSec. 16. All questions arising under this act, if not settled by agreement by the parties interested therein, shall, except as otherwise herein provided, be determined by the industrial accident board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>The pertinent part of the section reads now (MCLA \u00a7 413.16 [Stat Ann 1960 Bev \u00a7 17.190]):</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">\u201cSec. 16. All questions arising under this act shall be determined by the compensation commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">Agreeing with the appeal board\u2019s jurisdictional decision, we find that an available measure of long since recorded judicial thought tends to expose with clarity the purpose of the legislature when, by \u00a7 15, that body undertook to provide a means for determination of questions of apportionment of fees and expenses when such questions arise out of litigation instituted under \u00a7 15. Utilizing the same or correspondingly certain language, and starting with 1915 <em>Mackin </em>v. <em>Detroit-Timkin Axle Co., </em>187 Mich 8, this Court has repeatedly advised the legislature as well as the profession that the former industrial accident board, now the appeal board, is not a \u201ccourt\u201d and \u201cis not possessed of judicial power.\u201d Attest, among others: <em>Jones </em>v. <em>St. Joseph Iron Works </em>(1920), 212 Mich 174; <em>Bankers Trust Co. of Detroit </em>v. <em>Tatti </em>(1932), 258 Mich 357; <em>Michigan Mutual Liability Company </em>v. <em>Baker </em>(1940), 295 Mich 237; <em>Dation </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Co. </em>(1946), 314 Mich 152, and <em>Bonney </em>v. <em>Citizens\u2019 Mutual Automobile Insurance Company </em>(1952), 333 Mich 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">In the last cited case, having referred to <em>Dation, </em>the Court stated correctly the view we take of plaintiff\u2019s attempt to employ the department for determination of a question the legislature has vested exclusively with the circuit court. To quote <em>Bonney, </em>at 440:</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">\u201cThe statutory grant of exclusive jurisdiction to the workmen\u2019s compensation commission does not deprive a court of the jurisdiction to determine rights arising out of an entirely different relation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>ship and in an entirely different type of proceeding in which the employer and employee relationship is only incidentally involved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">\n<em>To recapitulate:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Amended \u00a7 15 was designed to provide a new right of action which, prior to effectiveness of the amendment, was unknown excepting when the suing employee was willing to assume the risk of a binding \u201celection\u201d of remedy. The new right had to be exercised, however, under and pursuant to the amendment, for within its jurisdictional four corners lay all of the benefits intended. Nowhere except in the forum provided by \u00a7 15 does the workmen\u2019s compensation law, or any other law, authorize apportionment of these \u201cexpenses of recovery.\u201d That by the second paragraph of the section is definitely made a matter for agreed settlement of \u201cclaims as their interest shall appear\u201d or, failing that, for judicial determination \u2014 under the next to last paragraph \u2014 by the <em>court </em>in which the plaintiff\u2019s action is pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The plaintiff widow, whose rights if any under the workmen\u2019s compensation law were and are derivable through her husband, took part in the agreed settlement. That settlement was made in view of the institution and pendency of her husband\u2019s suit. Presumably, she partook of the not exactly niggard fruits thereof. A part of such fruits was the stipulated and paid sum of $3,450.08, as and for an agreed apportionment of \u201cexpenses of recovery.\u201d No fraud, mistake, or other judicially cognizable right having been claimed, or shown, plaintiff\u2019s husband was as much bound by the apportionment, and by the paid amount thereof, as if that apportionment had been determined by the court at the time under the penultimate paragraph of \u00a7 15. So was his wife, and so is his widow. There remains no forum for determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>or redetermination of what then was validly done and effected by monetary distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Affirmed, no costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b480-5\">T.
