On February 3, 1966, a warrant was issued for defendant\u2019s arrest on suspicion of his having been an accomplice in this robbery. Defendant was arrested at his place of employment. He was not informed of his right to have counsel present during any custodial interrogation and prior to his making any statement, nor did he waive any of these rights. During the custodial interrogation and without counsel present, defendant made a writ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>ten confession concerning the armed robbery of December 21, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"Atj\">Defendant\u2019s jury trial was held on June 27, 1966, two weeks subsequent to the <em>Miranda </em>decision<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which became effective on June 13, 1966. Defendant\u2019s confession of February 3, 1966, was admitted into evidence through the testimony of detective Woronko, who had interrogated defendant. Defendant was found guilty of the crime of robbery armed, and on July 18, 1966, was sentenced to 7-1/2 to 15' years imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"AQV\">\u25a0 At the time of trial, defendant objected to the use of the confession on the ground that it was inadmissible under the standards laid down in <em>Miranda. </em>The Court of Appeals reversed his conviction and remanded to the trial court for retrial with the express instruction that the contested confession not be admitted.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">The Court of Appeals specifically held that the trial court was in error in admitting the confession in light of the fact that the defendant had not been informed of his constitutional right to have counsel present during the interrogation period.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">Upon remand, the defendant was again tried on July 29 and 30, 1968, by a jury and before the same judge. The contested confession was again admitted over the strenuous objection of the defendant, upon the finding of the trial judge that it was admissible under Title II of the Federal Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968. Defendant was again found guilty and again sentenced to 7-1/2 to 15 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">On August 28, 1969,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals held that the Federal Omnibus Crime Control Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>referred to only Federal prosecutions and thus was inapplicable to this case. In addition, the Court of Appeals held that the trial court was bound to follow the law as stated by the appellate court. The Court of Appeals then reversed and again remanded for a new trial without the use of the confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">The people thereafter petitioned for rehearing, relying upon this Court\u2019s decision in <em>People </em>v. <em>Woods, </em>382 Mich 128, decided August 4, 1969. On rehearing, the Court of Appeals adhered to its earlier opinion and again remanded.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We granted leave to appeal (383 Mich 776).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The issue before this Court is whether the standards set down in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>concerning the rights of an accused during custodial interrogation are applicable to all trials commenced after June 13, 1966, or whether the standards are applicable only to prosecutions commenced after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(1966), 384 US 719 (86 S Ct 1772, 16 L Ed 2d 882), decided one week after <em>Miranda, </em>the court stated (p 721):</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">\u201cIn this ease we are called upon to determine whether <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>378 U.S. 478 (1964), and <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, ante, </em>p 436, should be applied retroactively. We hold that <em>Escobedo </em>affects only those cases in which the <em>trial began </em>after June 22, 1964, the date of that decision. We hold further that <em>Miranda </em>applies only to cases in which the <em>trial began </em>after the date of our decision one week ago.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">This is the holding of the <em>Johnson </em>case and would, without more, be controlling upon this Court. However, the court also said (p 733):</p>\n<p id=\"b816-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>\u201cIn the light of these additional considerations, we conclude that <em>Escobedo </em>and <em>Miranda </em>should apply only to <em>cases commenced </em>after those decisions were announced.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">This statement was, of course, in conflict with the earlier one quoted above. \u201cProsecutions commenced\u201d and \u201ctrials commenced\u201d are clearly not synonymous. However, the court then seemingly disregarded the statement when it stated (p 734):</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">\u201cBecause <em>Escobedo </em>is to be applied prospectively, this holding is available only to persons whose <em>trials began </em>after June 22, 1964, the date on which <em>Escobedo </em>was decided. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">\u201cThis we have done in <em>Miranda, </em>and these guidelines are therefore available only to persons whose <em>trials had not begun </em>as of June 13, 1966.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">In <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Delaware </em>(1969), 395 US 213 (89 S Ct 1677, 23 L Ed 2d 253), the court held that the standards set down in <em>Miranda </em>did not apply to persons whose retrials had commenced after the date of <em>Miranda </em>if the original trial had begun before that date. Chief Justice Warren, speaking for the court, stated (p 219):</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">\u201cIn <em>Johnson, </em>after considering the need to avoid unreasonably disrupting the administration of our criminal laws, we selected the commencement of trial as determinative. We of course could have applied <em>Miranda </em>to all judgments not yet final, although they were obtained in good-faith reliance upon constitutional standards then applicable. See <em>Linkletter </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>381 U.S. 618 (1965). As we pointed out, however, that choice \u2018would [have] impose [d] an unjustifiable burden on the administration of justice.\u2019 384 U.S., at 733. On the other hand, we could have adopted the approach we took in <em>Stovall [Stovall </em>v. <em>Denno </em>(1967), 388 US 293 (87 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>S Ct 1967, 18 L Ed 2d 1199)] and <em>Desist [Desist </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1969), 394 US 244 (89 S Ct 1030, 22 L Ed 2d 248)] and made the point of initial reliance, the moment the defendant is interrogated, the operative event. See Schaefer [Schaefer, <em>The Control of \u2018Sunbursts\u2019: Techniques of Prospective Overruling, </em>42 NYU L Rev 631, (1967)] at 646. But in an effort to extend the protection of <em>Miranda </em>to as many defendants as was consistent with society\u2019s legitimate concern that convictions already validly obtained not be needlessly aborted, we selected the commencement of the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">These statements from <em>Jenkins </em>while not controlling because they are dicta, in that case, are nevertheless instructive and do appear to give evidence of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s intent. None of the justices dissented from Chief Justice Warren\u2019s statement on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Thus, while the United States Supreme Court has made conflicting statements as to the date of application of the <em>Miranda </em>decision, we feel that it has been sufficiently clear to hold that <em>Miranda </em>applies to all trials commenced in Michigan after June 13, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The Michigan Supreme Court has also previously clearly enunciated the law on this point in question in the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Fordyce </em>(1966), 378 Mich 208. The Court stated (p 211):</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">\u201cOn June 20, 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>[1966], 384 US 719 (86 S Ct 1772, 16 L ed 2d 882), held that the guidelines set forth in <em>Miranda </em>are available only to persons whose trials had not begun as of June 13, 1966.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey, supra, </em>although there was one reference to the term \u201cprosecution commenced,\u201d the court stated at three separate points <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>in the decision that the determinative date was \u201ctrial commenced.\u201d The people quote several statements which, they assert, support their contention that \u201cprosecution commenced\u201d applies. However, these statements merely indicate why the court applied <em>Miranda </em>prospectively and not whether the \u201cprosecution commenced\u201d or \u201ctrial commenced\u201d is the applicable date.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Thus, while the United States Supreme Court might have chosen to limit <em>Miranda </em>to confessions taken after June 13, 1966, clearly it did not do this. There are several reasons to support our conclusion on the choice of \u201ctrials commenced.\u201d First, the choice of \u201cprosecutions commenced\u201d could not serve any useful purpose. If the court felt that reliance was the prime factor, the applicable date should be \u201call confessions obtained after June 13, 1966.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cProsecutions commenced\u201d certainly would not lend itself to the test of reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Second, the United States Supreme Court in asserting an applicable date attempts to lend uniformity and certainty to the decisions of lower and state courts. The choice of \u201cprosecutions commenced\u201d accomplishes neither of these purposes. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1876), 33 Mich 112, in discussing when a prosecution is commenced, the Court stated (P H9):</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">\u201cThe issuing of the warrant in good faith, and delivery to an officer to execute, is a sufficient commencement, if it appears that the defendant was afterwards arrested upon that warrant and bound over for trial.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>See, also, <em>People </em>v. <em>Clement </em>(1888), 72 Mich 116, and <em>In re Grzyeskowiak </em>(1934), 267 Mich 697.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">In Virginia, however, prosecution is commenced at arraignment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Other states have different rules. For example, in California and in Florida, the filing of an indictment is the commencement of the prosecution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Thus, the problem of equal protection presents itself. If a warrant was issued in Michigan on June 12, 1966, and the suspect arrested and interrogated, his confession could be used against him. However, if a warrant was issued in Virginia on June 12, 1966, and a suspect was arrested and interrogated but not arraigned until June 14, his confession could not be used against him. Thus, the Federal constitutional protection of a citizen would vary from state to state. This is precisely what the equal protection clause in the Federal constitution seeks to prevent.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Third, the application of the \u201cprosecution commenced\u201d rule in Michigan could conceivably create very anomalous situations. For example, if a warrant was issued on June 12, 1966, and the suspect was not arrested and interrogated until subsequent to June 13,1966, under this rule any confession even though obtained after <em>Miranda </em>could be used against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">The people cite <em>People </em>v. <em>Woods </em>(1969), 382 Mich 128, as authority to support the \u201cprosecutions commenced\u201d theory. However, as a majority of the Court of Appeals pointed out, <em>Woods </em>is not inconsistent with the \u201ctrials commenced\u201d theory. <em>People </em>v. <em>Whisenant </em>(On Rehearing 1970), 21 Mich App <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>518, 522. In <em>Woods, </em>this Court, per Justice Black, after thoroughly analyzing the pertinent authorities, ruled that <em>Miranda </em>did not apply to retrials if the first trial occurred prior to the <em>Miranda </em>decision. This, of course, was the conclusion that the United States Supreme Court reached in <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Delaware, supra. </em>Nothing we say today is inconsistent with that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">However, there is an alternative ground upon which we affirm the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals in <em>People </em>v. <em>Whisenant </em>(1968 [No. 1]), 11 Mich App 432, had reversed and remanded for a new trial without the admission of the confession. The trial court disregarded the order of the Court of Appeals and again allowed in the confession. As the Court of Appeals stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Whisenant </em>(1969 [No. 2]), 19 Mich App 182, 189:</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">\u201cIt is fundamental law that the last utterance of an appellate court determines the law of the case, and upon remand for another trial subsequent to the appeal, the trial court is bound to follow the law as stated by an appellate court. If a litigant has any objection to the law as stated by the appellate court, his redress is an application for rehearing to the deciding court or an appeal to a still higher tribunal. <em>George </em>v. <em>Wayne Circuit Judge </em>(1953), 336 Mich 543; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Hurson </em>(1919), 206 Mich 139; <em>American Insurance Co. of Newark </em>v. <em>Martinek </em>(1921), 216 Mich 421; <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Underwood </em>(1897), 112 Mich 186. In CL 1948, \u00a7 600.314, as amended by PA 1964, No 281 (Stat Ann 1969 Cum Supp \u00a7 27A.314) it is provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">\u201c\u2018(1) The decisions on appeal of the Court of Appeals are final, except as reviewed by the Supreme Court as provided by Supreme Court rule.\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>OCR 1963, 800.4 added October 9, 1964, effective January 1, 1965, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">\u201c \u2018The decision of a majority of the judges of a Division or panel in attendance at the hearing shall constitute the decision of the Court. Decisions of the Court of Appeals are final except as reviewed by the Supreme Court on leave granted by the Supreme Court.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The trial court in this case clearly disregarded the order of the Court of Appeals. Such action is not to be tolerated, and we agree with the above statement of the Court of Appeals as to the limited function that remains with a lower court when an appellate court speaks.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b821-7\">T.

Who knows or even may estimate whether \u2014 should Mr. Whisenant appeal successively to our two appellate Courts from yet another conviction for this 1965 offense \u2014 still another <em>nunc pro tunc </em>decision of retroactivity will emanate from high judicial Lansing, requiring another trial for the same offense ? It is manifest time for abject surrender, by the people, to Mr. Whisenant. Hopefully, he will not sue the people or their legal representatives for malicious prosecution. He will have two years within which to make up his mind on that, under MCLA \u00a7 600.5805 (Stat Ann 1962 Rev \u00a7 27A.5805).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">I cannot agree with the summary statement of facts put forth in the first paragraph of the majority opinion. Let the actual testimony relate the circumstances which led up to Mr. Whisenant\u2019s voluntarily written confession.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (For that testimony see <em>Whisenant I </em>(1968), 11 Mich App at 434-436).. I suggest that he now go discharged rather than permit him to draw anew upon a steadily dwindling public treasury for still more of this squandermania of public money<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014 upon useless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>trials and appeals. He is free by this Court\u2019s order of April 21, 1970 *<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and doubtless will remain so (absent still another felony added to his record) should there be another trial and series of appeals resulting from this 1965 armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">Turning to the specific merits of the people\u2019s stated question: Whether\u2014with Mr. Whisenant\u2019s <em>confession </em>made in February of 1966 and his <em>prosecution </em>commenced that same month\u2014he is entitled to another (a third that is) trial because his <em>first </em>trial commenced seven days <em>after Miranda </em>(cited below) was handed down June 13, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Charlie Lee Woods </em>(1969), 382 Mich 128, 138, 139, this Court <em>ruled\u2014unanimously:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">\u201cWe align our judgment with those of the State courts which view <em>Miranda </em>as applying only to <em>prosecutions commenced </em>after <em>Miranda </em>became prospectively effective.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">There is nothing ambiguous about this. Indeed, no one claims there is. It is instead coolly proposed and voted that the Court repudiate its solemn word, recorded less than two years ago. I stand by the united endorsement quoted; not today\u2019s disavowal.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">This man Whisenant, tried and convicted twice for this 1965 felony, is now awarded a <em>third </em>trial, all at direct expense of Kent County as new brilliandeers of the law cut more fancy facets on the diamonds of precedent, purposed always toward reduction of the weight and value thereof. Surely curious days of judicially encouraged crime have descended upon us, what with hypertechnically twisted rulings like this which\u2014seemingly at least\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>are designed for but one purpose; that of discouraging and deterring prosecutions despite any number of guilty verdicts rendered by 12 good men and true.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">As noted, Mr. Wbisenant was <em>prosecuted </em>in February of 1966. The felony for which he was prosecuted was <em>committed </em>December 21, 1965. His <em>confession, </em>the admissibility of which is challenged again under <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966), 384 US 436 (86 S Ct 1602, 16 L Ed 2d 694, 10 ALR3d 974), was made <em>when he was arrested in February of 1966. Miranda </em>as said was handed down June 13, 1966. Its qualifier, <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey, </em>was handed down seven days later, 384 US 719 (86 S Ct 1772, 16 L Ed 2d 882). Now in 1971 it is said that, since Whisenant\u2019s first <em>trial </em>did not <em>commence </em>until June 27, 1966, seven days <em>after Johnson </em>arrested retroactivity of <em>Miranda </em>and its predecessors, the rule to apply to his <em>first </em>trial is other than the one which would have applied properly to his <em>1965 crime </em>and his February 1966 <em>prosecution </em>for that crime. The Supreme Court of the United States has not ordered this, nor has it ever disavowed its word in <em>Miranda </em>as found by us in <em>Woods. This Court simply plunges ahead of Miranda by ignoring Woods.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Taylor </em>(1970), 383 Mich 338, 369, 370, Justice Dethmers and I noted the bitter experience of the Supreme Court of California for having relied upon <em>Escobedo </em>(1964), 378 US 478 (84 S Ct 1758, 12 L Ed 2d 977) as having been <em>effected retroactively, </em>\u201conly to be let down when the Supreme Court belatedly ruled as in the <em>Johnson </em>case.\u201d Why should we run that risk, warned now as California was, and warned again as we were by that California Law Review quoted in <em>People </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>starting at 370?</p>\n<p id=\"b825-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>It is enough to state today\u2019s situation. Again, as it will he again, this Court bends the law in favor of the felon and against our far-flung peninsular community. No wonder crime runs rampant in Michigan. This 1971 Court seems unable to af- ' firm any conviction which, in the afterwitted view of its majority, has <em>not </em>been conducted and concluded with the celestial perfection of every trial that takes place at the 12 gates of Heaven. The situation doubtless is now beyond redemption. Are we not committed beyond return to that same flood of lawlessness as were the Romans when they suffered <em>their </em>decline, decay and utlimate <em>fall </em>\u2014 from <em>withini</em></p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">I would direct Mr. Whisenant\u2019s release on motion <em>nolle prosequi, </em>partly to eliminate more waste of prosecutory, judicial and jury-duty time added to the sapping of additional public funds, and partly to terminate the legally presumptive cruelty of his prosecution. After all, the offense for which he has been twice convicted is hut common-place these days.

The Kent County prosecutor and our \u201cone court of justice\u201d must already have given him a raw deal. Let him up, say I.

I live at <em>429 Cadwell N.W., Grand Rapids, Michigan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-11\">I have been advised and I understand that I do not have to make any statement or answer any questions and that any statement I make or answers I give may be used in evidence against me in any criminal prosecution that may result from matters disclosed in this statement. I make the following statement freely and voluntarily, no threats or promises of any nature having been made to me by anyone, and it is the truth to the best of my knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-12\">Signature: <em>Albert Whisenant</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-13\">\n<em>1 met Paul Boyer as I was coming in Tues., Dec. 21 and we began talking and joking and eventually led to something to do. It was approximately 1:00 a.m. then and he showed me a gun and we went riding around. I do not remember who suggested we commit this crime but as we passed the Crystal Flash we noticed only one station attendant and that this particular station was in a fairly secluded </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>\n<em>location. We returned and parked the car and walked to the station and Paul walked in and told the man it was a stickup while I entered the cash drawer and took the money from it. At first the attendant though we were joking because he came toward Paul and Paul fired into the far corner of the garage and the attendant then told us he would give us the money. We told him no and left the station running and from there proceeded back to our home address. We got $85.00 from the station and divided it in my room at 429 Gadwell N.W.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">\n<em>Albert Whisenant</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">R.

The very face of the instrument belies all thought of that. There isn\u2019t a misspelled word or grammatical error in it, or even a minor correction of the running narrative.
