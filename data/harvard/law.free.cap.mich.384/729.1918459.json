The panel\u2019s Order for Discipline on review by the Grievance Board on Respondent\u2019s petition, was affirmed in all respects except the period of discipline was reduced from six to three months.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">The only matter urged by respondent in this review is stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">\u201cWhether Respondent-Appellant * * * was involved in unprofessional conduct in violation of the Michigan Supreme Court Rules and Canons of Ethics so as to justify a three-months suspension from the practice of lawf\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b849-10\">He argues that the board should not credit the client\u2019s version that the $150 was to represent the whole fee for his services in light of the fact that this amount is less than the recommended minimum. He urges that in face of his 15 years of good professional practice, the board should give greater credibility to his version that this sum amounted only to a partial retainer and that the client prom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>ised additional money before the suit would be processed.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Although he acknowledges that the credit to be accorded witnesses\u2019 testimony is specially in the province of the fact finder, by asking us to say they erred in this circumstance, we are persuaded respondent bespeaks a woeful misconception of a lawyer\u2019s responsibility under our rules and the canons of ethics.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Once a lawyer accepts retainer to represent a client he is obliged to exert his best efforts wholeheartedly to advance the client\u2019s legitimate interests with fidelity and diligence until he is relieved of that obligation either by his client or the court. The failure of a client to pay for his services does not relieve a lawyer of his duty to perform them completely and on time, save only when relieved as above.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">Thus crediting fully respondent\u2019s version of the transaction here involved his failure to prevent dismissal of the suit for lack of progress under the circumstances <em>he </em>describes is a violation of Canon 21<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> and misconduct warranting discipline under Rule 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">In urging that the sanction imposed is too severe, respondent argues that it is highly penal and that the complainant will receive no reparation for the grievance. He says that there was no misrepresentation, misappropriation, or misuse of funds involved and that the sanction simply permits a disgruntled client to vent her spleen and satisfy her real anger against her husband which she could not do because of her own failure to pay the required fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-8\">This brings into sharp focus the real purpose of these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>Whatever the motive of the complainant in invoking the grievance procedure, the responsibility of our profession is to provide a fair and full method of ascertaining the validity of the complaint and imposing such sanction on a lawyer\u2019s conduct as may be warranted in the public interest. In this procedure we are not concerned with enforcing the rights of the individuals involved. The civil courts are provided for that. Rather here we seek to make sure that all of us who hold ourselves out to the public as counsellors and agents in the administration of justice will so conduct ourselves as to merit the trust imposed in us.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">We are satisfied from our examination of the record and consideration of the arguments that the discipline imposed is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Conscious that every dereliction of our professional brothers diminishes us all we affirm the order of discipline in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">Respondent shall pay to the State Bar of Michigan the costs of this review.</p>\n<judges id=\"b851-8\">T.
