As to this separate action, see Judge Fitzgerald\u2019s reference thereto with observation that it is \u201cstill subject to the wisdom of the circuit court of Wayne County.\u201d (17 Mich App at 450.)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">So far as concerns the respective opinions of <em>Critchell, </em>we join Division 1 in holding that (p 451):</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\u201cThe quoted portion of \u00a7 56 is intended to prevent tardy claimants from reopening and confusing the disposition of an estate closed more than three months before, and is not intended to bar a prompt attempt to reach an after-discovered asset of the estate.\u201d (Citing <em>Young </em>v. <em>Moore </em>[ED Mich, 1954], 127 F Supp 265 and <em>Melvin </em>v. <em>Reading </em>[1956], 346 Mich 348.)</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The only opinion of <em>Critchell </em>which touches today\u2019s question is that of Justice T. M. Kavanagh, with whom Justices Edwards and Souris concurred. As for the opinion of Justice Carr, supported as it was by Justices Dethmers, Kelly and Talbot Smith, that opinion and the \u201cinferential interpretation\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which the present plaintiff offers made no precedent for want of five endorsers thereof. See reference to the <em>Breckon </em>case, <em>supra, </em>by footnote.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">To set the stated question at rest, the writer advises the profession that had he been ethically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>eligible to participate in the Court\u2019s decision of <em>Critchell, </em>he would have endorsed Justice T. M. Kavanagh\u2019s mentioned opinion. Being now of like view, the undersigned adopts and applies that opinion to this case of <em>Hins, </em>the essential facts of <em>Critchell </em>being the same as here shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">For elaboration, see the factual statement of Division 1 (pp 448-450). The thrust of such statement is that counsel for this plaintiff had actual knowledge of all facts, certainly by July 3, 1964,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which should have galvanized him to prompt action for his client, either in the probate court or by suit in the circuit court against the then validly appointed and acting fiduciary of the Curzenski estate. On that pre-fourth of July date counsel had until August 12, 1964 to act as above. Thereafter he and his client were possessed of another right, that of petitioning within 90 days for setting aside of the closing order of August 12, 1964, pursuant to CL 1948, \u00a7701.19 (Stat Ann 1962 Rev \u00a727.3178 [19]). Yet nothing was done until, pertinently, the jurisdiction of the probate court had passed into history.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Fourteen years ago, in <em>Melvin </em>v. <em>Reading </em>(1956), 346 Mich 348, 354, we tried to advise lawyers consulted and retained as here to \u201cSue first and talk afterward.\u201d As in <em>Critchell, supra, </em>and now here, that advice seems \u201cto have fallen upon deaf ears.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">As this latest \u201cmournful result\u201d <em>(Melvin, supra </em>at 353) comes to record in our books, it is in order that mention be made of a fact all concerned with cases as at bar should carefully consider. It is that our courts must decide them as if no liability insurance existed. Any liability which accrued against a decedent during his lifetime became <em>his </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>liability, whether he had that liability insured or not. When he dies his fiduciary must respond whether the injured person has or has not sued before the death occurred. Hence, if the person injured has not sued prior to the death, and has not made timely claim against the decedent\u2019s estate or commenced timely suit against the latter\u2019s fiduciary (see <em>Kangas </em>v. <em>Lefkco </em>[1963], 369 Mich 341), no remedy survives save upon some showing of fraud committed by any one or several whom equity may hold responsible for the consequences of that fraud. Such is the purpose as well as the effect of our probate code.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">It is equally in order that mention be made of Division l\u2019s significant comment: \u201cThis result would impose the bar of a statute of limitation of three months on this negligence claim instead of the three years normally available under the applicable negligence injuries statute.\u201d True indeed. As in <em>Boike </em>v. <em>City of Flint </em>(1965), 374 Mich 462, 464 and again in <em>Trbovich </em>v. <em>Detroit </em>(1966), 378 Mich 79, 88 (forerunning <em>Grubaugh </em>v. <em>City of St. Johns </em>[1970], 384 Mich 165), such comment prompts observation that the constitutionality of application of the claim-barring provisions of \u00a7 704.56, to a setting as at bar, has not as yet been put to judicial test.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Affirmed. All costs will abide the result of the pending suit of <em>Hinz </em>v. <em>State Farm.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b456-8\">T. M. Kavanagh, C. J., and Adams and T. E. Brennan, JJ., concurred with Black, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b456-9\">T. Gr. Kavanagh, J., concurred in the result.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b456-10\">Swainson and Williams, JJ., did not sit in this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-10\"> No_ opinion of <em>Critchell </em>was endorsed by a majority of our then eight-man Court. The result was no precedent. See <em>Breckon </em>v. <em>Franklin Fuel Company </em>(1970), 383 Mich 251, 278, 279.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b454-10\"> The quotation is from the opinion below, p 452.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b455-7\"><em> </em>The date he wrote State Farm that he had been retained by the plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
