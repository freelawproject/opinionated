G-. Kavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXS\">The explicit language of Art 3, \u00a7 1  provides that if the contract of employment of a tenure teacher in the capacity of principal provides that such teacher shall <em>not </em>have tenure in such capacity, the teacher will be deemed to have tenure as a classroom teacher only. It also provides that the <em>failure </em>of the board to so provide in the contract shall be deemed to constitute the employment of the teacher on continuing contract in such capacity and subject to the provisions of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">There is no dispute that the plaintiff here was a tenure teacher employed by the defendant board in the capacity of principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">The only question we are called upon to determine is whether the employment contract provided that the plaintiff would not have tenure as principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>The defendants argue that the striking of the word \u201ctenure\u201d from the printed form is the equivalent of the statutorily required provision that the teacher would not have tenure. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">Were it not for the requirement of the statute that the contract make provision for <em>no </em>tenure, in order to avoid it, the absence of provision <em>for </em>tenure might be so construed, but the statute\u2019s requirement was intended to obviate the need for construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">We are satisfied that the members of the board did not <em>intend </em>to grant the plaintiff tenure in the capacity of principal in the instant contract. We are satisfied from the record that they did not avail themselves of the only means available under the statute to avoid it.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Accordingly the decision of the Court of Appeals is reversed and the plaintiff is ordered restored to her position as an elementary school principal. The plaintiff is also entitled to the difference in compensation between what she received as a classroom teacher and the salary she would have received as principal from February 13, 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Plaintiff may have costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b466-8\">T.

E. Brennan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIl\">(dissenting). Before the end of his last term of office, our distinguished former colleague, the Honorable John R. Dethmers, had prepared and circulated an opinion in this cause. In my view, Mr. Justice Dethmers stated the law accurately and succinctly. I am pleased to adopt his opinion which follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">Dethmers, J. This cause, like <em>Street </em>v. <em>Ferndale Board of Education </em>(1960), 361 Mich 82, \u201cpresents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>a question of tenure in the capacity as a principal under the teachers tenure act, CL 1948, \u00a7 38.71 <em>et seq. </em>(Stat Ann 1959 Rev \u00a7 15.1971 <em>et seq.)\u201d.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">Plaintiff had been employed by defendant school district for 22 years as a classroom teacher. Then, in 1962, she was appointed an elementary school principal. She served as such from January of 1963 until relieved of her duties as principal February 13, 1967. For that position she had received annual contracts from defendant for the school years 1963-64, 1964-65, and 1965-66, each of which expressly provided that no tenure as principal was to be acquired thereunder. Then, for the school years 1966-67 and 1967-68, she received a contract in which the language in the previous contracts about nonacquisition of tenure did not appear. Throughout the body of the latter contract the word \u201cteacher\u201d alone is mentioned without any use of the term \u201cprincipal\u201d. However, at the top of that contract, in its heading, before the printed words \u201cContract of Employment\u201d the printed words \u201cTenure-Teacher\u201d were stricken out by a typewriter and over the crossed-out words there was typed in \u201cElem. Prins.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">When plaintiff was relieved as principal she was offered the option of employment at her same pay either as a reading improvement coordinator or as a classroom teacher. She objected to any transfer but ultimately took the job of classroom teacher with the understanding that this would not constitute a waiver of any violation of her employment rights. She has been serving ever since as classroom teacher at the same pay received by her as principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Thereafter plaintiff filed a circuit court suit against defendant school district and the superintendent of schools, seeking reinstatement as an ele-</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>mentary school principal. Her claim was that her last contract for 1966-67 and 1967-68 granted her tenure as a principal; that her transfer in positions amounted to a demotion in violation of MCLA \u00a7 38.101 (Stat Ann 1968 Rev \u00a7 15.2001); that no charges were filed nor a hearing allowed her as provided by statute. Plaintiff therefore prayed that defendants be restrained from demoting her to a lesser position and that she be restored to her position as principal. The trial court disagreed with plaintiff\u2019s theory as to tenure and demotion and entered judgment dismissing plaintiff\u2019s complaint and denying her injunctive relief. Plaintiff took an appeal to the Court of Appeals where the judgment below was affirmed (17 Mich App 664). On leave granted plaintiff to appeal, the matter is now here for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The teachers tenure act, as amended, Art 1, \u00a7 1, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"AXG\">\u201cThe term \u2018teacher\u2019 as used in this act shall include all certificated persons employed by any board of education or controlling board of any public educational institution.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ALQy\">Art 1, \u00a7 4, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">\u201cThe word \u2018demote\u2019 shall mean to reduce compensation or to transfer to a position carrying a lower salary.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b468-10\">Art 3, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> provides that after satisfactory completion of the probationary period, a teacher shall not be dismissed or demoted except as specified in the act. The section continues:</p>\n<p id=\"b468-11\">\u201cIf the controlling board shall provide in a contract of employment of any teacher employed other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>than as a classroom teacher, including hut not limited to, a superintendent, assistant superintendent, principal, department head or director of curriculum, made with such teacher after the completion of the probationary period, that such teacher shall not be deemed to he granted continuing tenure in such capacity hy virtue of such contract of employment, then such teacher shall not he granted tenure in such capacity, hut shall he deemed to have been granted continuing tenure as an active classroom teacher in such school district. Upon the termination of any such contract of employment, if such controlling board shall not re-employ such teacher under contract in any such capacity, such teacher shall he continuously employed hy such controlling board as an active classroom teacher. Failure of any controlling hoard to re-employ any such teacher in any such capacity upon the termination of any such contract of employment shall not he deemed to he a demotion within the provisions of this act. The salary in the position to which such teacher is assigned shall he the same as if he had been continuously employed in the newly assigned position. Failure of any such controlling hoard to so provide in any such contract of employment of any teacher in a capacity other than a classroom teacher shall be deemed to constitute the employment of such teacher on continuing contract in such capacity and subject to the provisions of this act. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Under Paragraph 2 of the contract defendants agreed to hire and plaintiff agreed to serve as <em>teacher. </em>Nothing was said about principal. Furthermore, the words \u201cTenure-Teacher\u201d having been stricken from the top of the contract, it is evident that there was no intent to grant tenure as principal. Defendants say that the striking of the word \u201cTenure\u201d was the equivalent of what the provision in MCLA \u00a7 38.91 (Stat Ann 1968 Rev \u00a7 15.1991), above quoted, states, namely, that the hoard may provide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>in a contract of employment that a teacher employed as a principal \u201cshall not be deemed to be granted continuing tenure in such capacity,\u201d the statute providing that in such event tenure as principal is not acquired. The statute as amended in 1941 by Act No. 119 provided that to avoid such acquisition of tenure the board, in its contract of employment, shall <em>\u201cspecifically </em>provide\u201d against tenure. In the amendment by PA 1963, No 242, however the word \u201cspecifically\u201d was omitted and it was provided, instead, that \u201cif the controlling board shall provide in a contract of employment\u201d that there was to be no tenure, then none was to be deemed granted in the special capacity of principal, etc. This gives weight to defendants\u2019 contention that the striking of the word \u201cTenure\u201d at the top of the contract was as effective as a provision stating that there was to be no tenure. This would seem to provide all the specificality on the subject of no tenure necessary under the statute as amended in 1963. We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff acquired no continuing tenure as principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Had plaintiff acquired continuing tenure, she still could have had no complaint relative to the changing of her assignment or positions unless she had been subjected to a demotion. Her transfer continued her at the same pay. In <em>Street </em>v. <em>Ferndale Board of Education, supra, </em>this Court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">\u201c * * # it is contended that plaintiff\u2019s reassignment was a demotion, even though he was continued at the same pay * * * because the position of principal ranks higher professionally than visiting teacher. On what authority, in the record or elsewhere, that assertion is made is not indicated. The trouble with this is that the statute has defined the word \u2018demote\u2019 to mean \u2018to reduce compensation or to transfer to a position carrying a lower salary.\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Plaintiff\u2019s compensation was not reduced. While the record is silent on what other visiting teachers customarily were paid in the district, statements in the briefs that it was less than the amount plaintiff received as principal fail to obviate the fact that the particular job to which plaintiff was reassigned carried, for him at least, the same salary. It is clear from the definition in the act that the demotion against which it sought to protect teachers, as such, was of a monetary rather than a prestige character.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">This language from the opinion in <em>Street, </em>even if <em>dicta, </em>as plaintiff claims, has real application here as expressive of the <em>ratio decidendi </em>in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Affirmed. No costs, a public question being involved.</p>\n<judges id=\"b471-6\">Black, J., concurred with T. E.
