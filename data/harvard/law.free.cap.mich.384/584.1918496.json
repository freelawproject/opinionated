Kelley, </em>Attorney General, <em>Robert A. Derengoski, </em>Solicitor General, and <em>Irving B. Feldman </em>and <em>Bernard Rosner, </em>Assistant Attorneys General, for the people.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b703-6\"><em>Joseph W.

The question:</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">\u201cDoes the Common Pleas Court for the City of Detroit have concurrent jurisdiction with the Recorder\u2019s Court for the City of Detroit to conduct a preliminary examination where the offense charged is alleged to have been committed in the City of Detroit?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">Relying upon the reasoning submitted and the conclusion reached in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ewald </em>(1942), 302 Mich 31, Division 1 responded with a negative answer <em>(People </em>v. <em>Seeley </em>[1970], 24 Mich App 539). The conclusion reads (pp 546, 547):</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">\u201cWe therefore rule, on the basis of the recorder\u2019s court act, as it has been interpreted in the <em>Ewald </em>case, <em>supra, </em>that the Common Pleas Court for the City of Detroit did not have jurisdiction to conduct a preliminary examination in this criminal case. We further rule that the warrant issued by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>circuit court grand juror was a valid warrant, is still alive, and, although arriving in the Recorder\u2019s Court for the City of Detroit by a circuitous route through the common pleas court, rather than directly from the clerk of the circuit court, it should be disposed of as provided by law, <em>i.e., </em>a preliminary examination should be held in recorder\u2019s court, along with such further proceedings as may be required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">Since CL 1929, \u00a7 16301 as viewed and applied in <em>Ewald </em>has since remained unchanged (see MCLA \u00a7 726.12), and since no good reason has been urged upon us for a pertinently new construction of that section, I think we should reapply <em>Ewald.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">The Attorney General\u2019s position here is not so much an appeal to the question of legislative intent as it is for current relief from the consequences of continued application of <em>Ewald. </em>In his application for leave to appeal to this Court he insisted that if the view of Division 1 \u201cis not reversed the Recorder\u2019s Court will again become over-burdened and as a direct result thereof the following harm will occur:\u201d whereupon he specified that the constitutional right of the accused and the statutory right of the people to a speedy trial \u201cwill be materially impaired\u201d; that the state \u201cwill have to expend large sums of money by requesting retired judges to return to service and by sending other judges to Detroit to alleviate the logjam\u201d and, finally, that the appellate decision is clearly erroneous \u201cin that it violates the premise that there is but one court of justice in Michigan.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Then in broad but unsupported sum the Attorney General alleges that the decision of Division 1 \u201cis contrary to the legislative intent and direction which is clearly and unambiguously set forth in the Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>of Criminal Procedure and upheld by the Supreme Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">I am content with Division l\u2019s view and application of <em>Ewald </em>and therefore vote to affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b705-7\">T.
