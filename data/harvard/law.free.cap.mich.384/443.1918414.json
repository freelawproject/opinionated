For details, see the opinion of Division 2, released September 2 (26 Mich App 403). Upon strength of that opinion and our order denying leave entered 12 days later (384. Mich 751), the amendment proposed \u2014 and now in question \u2014 was submitted to the electors November 3 and approved by a strong majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">The ensuing opinion should presay a cautionary note. It is that initiatory \u00a7 2 of Article 12 of the Constitution of 1963 follows generally, yet differs in important respects from the corresponding sections of the Constitution of 1908 as those sections stood when certain of our past decisions were considered and released. Compare said \u00a7 2 with \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of Article 17 of the former Constitution; looking at the latter both in their original aspects and as amended in 1941. \"We shall consider this earmark upon present reference to the <em>City of Jackson </em>case (1947), 316 Mich 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">The acceptable and visibly critical question we are called upon to decide is posed by the Attorney General:</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">\u201cII. Is a petition proposing an amendment to an existing section of the Constitution sufficient when that section as presently in effect <em>[sic] </em>is not inserted under the heading \u2018Provisions of Existing Constitution Altered or Abrogated by Such Proposal if Adopted\u2019 ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">Division 2 responded in the affirmative. The Attorney General contends for a negative answer. We agree with him. The final question, then, is what now to <em>do; </em>the proposed amendment having been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>approved and apparently adopted. That question will come to discussion and determination in the division designated \u201cSecond,\u201d below.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\"><em>First: </em>Section 2 of Article 12 of the Constitution requires that an initiatory amendment shall be published (\u201cin full as provided by law\u201d) with \u201cexisting provisions of the Constitution which would be altered or abrogated thereby.\u201d The same section also requires that the initiatory petition shall be \u201cin the form, and shall be signed and circulated\u201d as prescribed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">The constitutionally beckoned legislation appears in \u00a7 482 of the Michigan election law of 1954, as minor-amended in 1965 (MCLA \u00a7 168.482 [Stat Ann 1970 Cum Supp \u00a7 6.1482]). Section 482 provides, pertinently:</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">\u201c * * * If the proposal would alter or abrogate any existing provision of the constitution, the petition should so state and the provisions to be altered or abrogated shall be inserted, preceded by the words:</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">\u201c \u2018Provisions of existing constitution altered or abrogated by such proposal if adopted.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-10\">The now unmalleable fact of political action is that this initiatory petition did not set forth any provision or provisions of the existing Constitution which would be \u201caltered or abrogated by such proposal if adopted.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although <em>expressly </em>initiating th\u00e9 proposal as an amendment of \u00a7 2 of Article 8, the petition did not under the required heading set forth \u201cexisting\u201d \u00a7 2 of Article 8. Such omission is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>the crus of the Attorney General\u2019s stated question II, above.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Had there been time for decisive judicial action during that critical 8 days of September which ensued upon receipt of briefs for and against the Attorney General\u2019s emergent application for leave to review Division 2\u2019s September 2 decision, the stated omission doubtless would have arrested the initiation and enjoined submission of the mentioned proposal. There was no such time, however, hence our present effort to review and decide that which, hopefully, will result in better timing of appeals to the judicial process for determination of questions of statewide importance that are justiciable and determinable in time for election day. In a word, a word we direct particularly to issues arising from initiated or legislatively proposed constitutional amendments, this petition for mandamus might better have been July-filed <em>in this Court, </em>GCR 1963, 714.1(1) notwithstanding. See the independently supreme authority provided by \u00a7 4 of the judicial article.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">There is no unstilted way to avoid conclusion that the amendment initiated by these plaintiffs will, if given constitutional effect, both alter and amend \u00a7 2 of Article 8 of the Constitution of 1963.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The initiatory petitions were therefore insufficient\u2014 technically at least \u2014 for want of specific compliance with the constitutional complement, \u00a7 482.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-7\"><em>Second: </em>The electors have firmly approved this initiated amendment of \u00a7 2 of Article 8. That they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>have done in the face of omitted specific performance of a constitutionally authorized legislative mandate that initiators <em>shall </em>set forth in their petitions, for the informative benefit of petition-signers, the very constitutional provision or provisions such initiators desire to alter or amend. What is the result? We think the answer appears in the first sentence of the final paragraph of \u00a7 2 of Article 12 (quoted below), viewing it as we should according to the established rules of constitutional construction and the Secretary of State\u2019s salutary corrective action which preceded the November 3 election.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Let us first compare what <em>was, </em>in the initiative portion of the former Constitution, with what now <em>is. </em>Section 2 of Article 17 of the 1908 Constitution read:</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">\u201cAny constitutional amendment initiated by the people <em>as herein provided, </em>shall take effect and become a part of the constitution if the same shall be approved by a majority of the electors voting thereon <em>and not otherwise.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">The 1941 amendment of that same \u00a7 2 read:</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">\u201cAny constitutional amendment initiated by the people <em>as herein provided, </em>shall take effect and become a part of the constitution if the same shall be approved by the number of qualified electors required in section 1 hereof for the approval of amendments proposed by the legislature, <em>and not otherwise.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">Present \u00a7 2 of Article 12 proceeds:</p>\n<p id=\"b568-11\"><em>\u201cIf the proposed amendment is approved by a majority of the electors voting on the question, it shall become part of the constitution, and shall abrogate or amend existing provisions of the constitution </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>at the end of 45 days after the date of the election at which it was approved.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Reading these successive provisions with dne care, one after the other, it is clear from the words employed and understood in 1961-1962 that some less rigid initiatory procedure was written, for \u201cthe common understanding.\u201d Formerly an amendment had to be initiated \u201cas herein provided.\u201d Formerly, if thus initiated, it would become a part of the constitution should it be approved by the designated majority, but \u201cnot otherwise.\u201d In 1963, however, the express requisite of initiation \u201cas herein provided\u201d was eliminated. So was the \u201cnot otherwise\u201d stricture.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">The due and applicable rule of construction is <em>not </em>any one of the many by which we determine legislative intent. It is instead a duty to ascertain \u201cthe common understanding\u201d; a duty to ascertain \u201cthat meaning which it [the provision in question] would naturally convey to the popular mind\u201d; a duty to apply that interpretation \u201cwhich reasonable minds, the great mass of the people themselves, would give it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">In one of the opinions of <em>Lockwood </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>(1959), 357 Mich 517, 567-570, some of these dovetailing rules of constitutional construction were quoted from the writings of great men of our legal past. Here are some of them. The first was written by Mr. Justice Story, the next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>by Mr. Justice Campbell, and the last by Mr. Justice Cooley.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (The Cooley quotation is taken from <em>May </em>v. <em>Topping </em>[1909], 65 W Va 656, 660 [64 SE 848]):</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">\u201c \u2018Constitutions are not designed for metaphysical or logical subtleties, for niceties of expression, for critical propriety, for elaborate shades of meaning, or for the exercise of philosophical acuteness or judicial research. They are instruments of a practical nature, founded on the common business of human life, adapted to common wants, designed for common use, <em>and fitted for common understandings. </em>The people make them, the people adopt them, the people must be supposed to read them, with the help of common sense, and cannot be presumed to admit in them any recondite meaning or any extraordinary gloss.\u2019 (1 Story, Constitution [5th ed], \u00a7 451, p 345.)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">\u201c \u2018The cardinal rule of construction, concerning language, is to apply to it <em>that meaning which it would naturally convey to the popular mind, </em>in all cases where the propriety of such construction is not negatived by some settled rule of law. In all instruments which are submitted for confirmation to the people themselves, and which derive all their validity from a popular vote, such a construction is peculiarly necessary; for otherwise they would be defrauded of the right to frame their own government according to their own will. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dean </em>[1866], 14 Mich 406, 417, 418).\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">\u201c \u2018A Constitution is made for the people and by the people. <em>The interpretation that should be given it is that which reasonable minds, the great mass of the people themselves, would give it. </em>\u201cFor as the Constitution does not derive its force from the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>vention which framed, hut from the people who ratified it, <em>the intent to be arrived at is that of the people, </em>and it is not to be supposed that they have looked for any dark or abstruse meaning in the words employed, <em>but rather that they have accepted them in the sense most obvious to the common understanding, </em>and ratified the instrument in the belief that that was the sense designed to be conveyed.\u201d (Cooley\u2019s Const Lim 81).\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Now let us ascertain what common understanding, what meaning naturally conveyed to the popular mind, what interpretation the great mass of the people themselves would draw reasonably from the quoted simple English of the final paragraph of \u00a7 2 of Article 12. Is it not, and was it not when the Constitution of 1963 was approved and adopted, that if an <em>actually initiated and submitted amendment </em>should be \u201capproved by a majority of the electors voting on the question\u201d (as indeed here), then that amendment \u201cshall\u201d become a part of the Constitution?</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Our answer is \u201cYes.\u201d Hence, this initiated amendment having been approved by a majority of the electors, the result is that \u00a7 2 of Article 8 has been amended so that, as of December 19 last, it has read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">\u201cSec. 2. The legislature shall maintain and support a system of free public elementary and secondary schools as defined by law. Every school district shall provide for the education of its pupils without discrimination as to religion, creed, race, color or national origin.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">\u201cNo public monies or property shall be appropriated or paid or any public credit utilized, by the legislature or any other political subdivision or agency of the state directly or indirectly to aid or maintain any private, denominational or other nonpublic, pre-elementary, elementary, or secondary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>school. No payment, credit, tax benefit, exemption or deductions, tuition voucher, subsidy, grant or loan of public monies or property shall be provided, directly or indirectly, to support the attendance of any student or the employment of any person at any such nonpublic school or at any location, or institution where instruction is offered in whole or in part to such nonpublic school students. The legislature may provide for the transportation of students to and from any school.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">A thought of constitutional substance rather than form should be inserted here. It is that the constitutional purpose of the \u201calter or abrogate\u201d requirement of <em>publication, </em>set forth as it is in the second paragraph of \u00a7 2 of Article 12, is to assure as near as law can provide that, before and particularly <em>on </em>election day, <em>all voters </em>are fully informed of the <em>effect </em>an initiated proposal will have upon an existing constitutional provision (or provisions) should that proposal receive electoral approval. The Secretary of State satisfied that constitutional purpose when he saw to it that his published notice listed existing \u00a7 2 of Article 8 as liable to alteration or amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Comparing the above purpose with the salient requirement of the statute (\u00a7 482), we find that the latter was intended to inform the <em>petition-signer, </em>should he sign, of that same <em>effect. </em>Both methods of dissemination of necessary information to the public are wholesome and desirable, yet the one that counts in controlling substance over the more technical other is that which the <em>elector </em>himself\u2014 not the petition-signer \u2014 receives by the separate action of the Secretary of State. Here the buttonholed petition-signers were <em>not </em>apprised pursuant to \u00a7 482 of such <em>effect-, </em>at least by the petition sheets themselves. But they, along with the far greater throngs of electors on election day, were directly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>notified \u2014 if they would but read \u2014 of that same <em>effect.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The careful reader of <em>City of Jackson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Revenue </em>(1947), 316 Mich 694, 716-718 will note that the Court applied to its decision that which was urged upon it in several of the briefs of the many counsel participating, namely, the \u201celection-cures-error\u201d doctrine. On page 716 the Court opened its discussion by saying:</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">\u201cWe are not here deciding a case where there is a fatal defect in the petitions, as a result of which the proposition should be withheld from submission to the voters. Such were the situations in the <em>Scott </em>and <em>Leininger Cases, supra </em>[202 Mich 629, and 316 Mich 644]. Here we have a situation where we find there were no such fatal defects, but are asked to nullify the act of the voters in adopting an amendment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">Then the Court went on to quote at considerable length from <em>Attorney General, ex rel. Miller, </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1934), 266 Mich 127 (106 ALR 387). The entire purport of the Court\u2019s quotation of <em>Miller </em>is that the courts should look at procedural errors of submission through different eyeglasses, once the electors have voted affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">A fair summary of that which was quoted with approval from <em>Miller </em>appears on page 717:</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">\u201c \u2018Even in case some required form of procedure has been omitted by the legislature in submitting a proposal to amend the Constitution, but the same had been advertised or the notices published and the people have approved it at an election the amendment becomes a valid part of the Constitution.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">This last quotation is a counterpart of present \u00a7 2 of Article 12 of our Constitution. To repeat for emphasis:</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>\u201cIf the proposed amendment is approved by a majority of the electors voting on the question, it shall become part of the constitution, and shall abrogate or amend existing provisions of the constitution # # #</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Supported now by said \u00a7 2 of Article 12 as quoted, we adopt these principles from <em>State </em>v. <em>Winnett </em>(1907), 78 Neb 379, 387, 388 (110 NW 1113, 1116; 10 LRA [NS] 149), where it was said that, if a too strict adherence were given to some of the requirements :</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">\u201cthe will of the people of the state would be defeated by an unimportant accident over which they had no control. If other provisions of the constitution are mandatory and are to be taken literally, those provisions by which the people have consented to place restrictions upon their own power in adopting amendments to the constitution should not be so construed [after approval by the people]. We should inquire into the fair purpose and meaning of such restrictions, and should regard the substance rather than the letter of such requirements.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Our summarized ruling is that after this particular affirmative vote of the electors was certified, the quoted requirement of \u00a7 482 became directory only, and that the requirement was fulfilled to constitutional satisfaction by the manner in which the Secretary of State performed his duty. For demonstrative evidence of such performance, see the appendix hereto. It portrays the Secretary of State\u2019s compliance with the constitutional mandate of due publication of that which was popularly understood as becoming, if approved, a new paragraph \u201cadded\u201d to existing \u00a7 2 of Article 8. Note the \u201cProvision to be <em>Added </em>to Article 8, Section 2 if the proposal is adopted.\u201d and then the heading above the printing of \u201cexisting\u201d \u00a7 2 of Article 8, that is, \u201cExisting Pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>vision of Constitution to which will he <em>added </em>the new language, if adopted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The judgment of Division 2 is vacated. A new judgment will enter on review, determining that \u00a7 2 of article 8 of the Constitution has read and reads now as set forth <em>ante </em>at pp 453, 454. No costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b575-6\">Black, T. E.

I disagree with the <em>per curiam </em>opinion in this case. I agree with the opinion of Judge Holbrook of the Court of Appeals in which he was joined by Judge Fitzgerald.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">Proposal \u201cC\u201d is an addition to art 8, \u00a7 2 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963. It does not alter or abrogate the original provision of that section. Having once denied application for leave to appeal, this Court should not have reopened the <em>Carman </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>The <em>Carman </em>case was litigated by appropriate parties to a final judgment which this Court declined to review. This brought an end to the issues raised in that case. The General Court Rules of 1963 provide:</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">\u201cIf application for leave to appeal is denied after decision by the Court of Appeals, the decision of the Court of Appeals shall become the final adjudication and shall be enforced in accordance with its terms.\u201d GCR 1963, 852.2(4)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">I agree that had there been error in the submission of \u201cProposal C\u201d to the people, absent a fatal defect in the petitions, the \u201celection-cures-error\u201d doctrine would be applicable and a vote of the people would be decisive on the question of the adoption of the amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
