J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ale\">On July 20, 1967, the Michigan Income Tax Act of 1967,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Act\u201d) was approved by the Governor. The Act was scheduled to take effect on October 1, 1967.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Plaintiffs (appellants), a Michigan citizen taxpayer and a Michigan corporate taxpayer, filed a complaint in Oakland circuit court on September 13, 1967, requesting a declaratory judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>ment that the Act is unconstitutional and seeking injunctive relief against its enforcement. The Department of the Treasury, the State Treasurer and the commissioner of the Department of Revenue were named as defendants (appellees). On October 4, 1967, the Honorable William R. Beasley, Oakland circuit judge, granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, treating it as a motion to dismiss. Following affirmance by the Court of Appeals,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> plaintiffs were granted leave to appeal here. 382 Mich 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 first contention <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> is that the Act unconstitutionally deprives the individual plaintiff of the right to vote on referendum which he enjoys as a member of the public under Michigan Constitution of 1963, art 2, \u00a7 9. The section reads, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\u201cThe people reserve to themselves * * *. the power to approve or reject laws enacted by the legislature, called the referendum. <em>* * * </em>The power of referendum does not extend to acts * * * to meet deficiencies in state funds and must be invoked in the manner prescribed by law[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] within 90 days following the final adjournment of the legislative session at which the law was enacted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">The first section<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the Act begins, \u201cThis act is for the purpose of meeting deficiencies in state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>funds.\u201d Section 498<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> reads, \u201cThis act is expressly declared to be necessary to meet established deficiencies, present and future, in state funds.\u201d The final section<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> provides that the Act shall not take effect</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u201cunless the estimated revenues to be collected therefrom are required to meet deficiencies in state funds resulting from appropriations for the expenses of state government and all state institutions contained in total appropriations enacted into law during the current session of the legislature for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1968.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">Plaintiffs\u2019 complaint alleged that there was no deficiency in state - funds at the time the Act was enacted.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> They contend, therefore, that the legislature inserted the language regarding meeting deficiencies in state funds into the Act in a devious attempt to avoid the people\u2019s constitutional power of referendum in view of the above-quoted restrictions on that power.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">We will not concern ourselves with the legislators\u2019 motives for inserting the language regarding deficiencies in the Act. As pointed out in <em>C. F. Smith Co. </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald </em>(1935), 270 Mich 659, at 681:</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\u201c \u2018Courts are not concerned with the motives which actuate the members of the legislative body in enacting a law but only in the results of their actions. Bad motives might inspire a law which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>appeared on its face and proves to be valid and beneficial, while a bad and invalid law might be and sometimes is passed with good intent and the best of motives.\u2019 <em>People </em>v. <em>Gibbs </em>[1915], 186 Mich 127, 134 (Ann Cas 1917 B, 830).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Our review is thus limited to determining whether the phrase \u201cdeficiencies in state funds\u201d in art 2, \u00a7 9 of the 1963 Constitution encompasses future deficiencies \u2014 including those virtually or actually certain to occur as a result of present appropriations\u2014 or whether the language refers only to actual deficiencies in state funds existing at the time the statute in question was enacted.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">We note at the outset that in construing constitutional language we look not for the interpretation which lawyers and legislators, or others well-versed in the subtle shades of meaning of which the English language is capable, might apply. Eather, we adopt the meaning which the ordinary citizens who ratified the constitution would attach to the words under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">\u201c \u2018A Constitution is made for the people and by the people. <em>The interpretation that should be given it is that which reasonable minds, the great mass of the people themselves, would give it. </em>\u201cFor as the Constitution does not derive its force from the convention which framed, but from the people who ratified it, the intent to be arrived at is that of the people, and it is not to be supposed that they have looked for any dark or abstruse meaning in the words employed, <em>but rather that they have accepted them in the sense most obvious to the common understanding, </em>and ratified the instrument in the belief that that was the sense designed to be conveyed.\u201d (Cooley\u2019s Constitutional Limitations [6th ed], 81.)\u2019 \u201d <em>Michigan Farm Bureau </em>v. <em>Secretary of State </em>(1967), 379 Mich 387, 391.</p>\n<p id=\"AsL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Furthermore, under a system of government based on grants of power from the people, constitutional provisions by which the people reserve to themselves a direct legislative voice ought to be liberally construed.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Michigan Farm Bureau </em>v. <em>Secretary of State, supra; </em>42 Am Jur 2d, Initiative and Referendum, \u00a7 5. Previous decisions of this Court requiring strict compliance with constitutionally mandated procedures for exercise of the powers of initiative and referendum should not be read as limiting the occasions upon which those powers may be exercised. See <em>Leininger </em>v. <em>Secretary of State </em>(1947), 316 Mich 644; <em>Scott </em>v. <em>Secretary of State </em>(1918), 202 Mich 629; <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Secretary of State </em>(1916), 192 Mich 512.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">Applying the above principles of construction to the constitutional provision under consideration, we think the conclusion that \u201cdeficiencies in state funds\u201d refers only to such deficiencies as exist at the time of passage of the Act in question is inescapable. If the drafters of the constitution wanted the people to more severely restrict the reserved power of referendum, they should have plainly so advised them by inserting \u201cpresent or future,\u201d or some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>such phrase, before \u201cdeficiencies\u201d in art 2, \u00a7 9. We may not stretch the language ratified by the people so as to allow revenue statutes to avoid the possibility of referendum by reference to <em>anticipated </em>deficiencies,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> resulting from future, simultaneous or even previous appropriations. Since defendants have not denied there was no deficiency in state funds when the Act was passed, we hold that the Michigan Income Tax Act of 1967 was subject to referendum.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Accordingly, defendants were not entitled to summary dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 declaratory judgment action prior to 90 days after adjournment of the 1967 legislative session. Although this constitutional deadline for invoking the power of referendum has <em>long </em>since passed, plaintiffs\u2019 prayer for relief, relying vaguely on our equity powers, requests that we now \u201cprovide an adequate time for securing the required number of signatures.\u201d To so act and thus allow referendum petition campaigns to go on for years flies in the face of the constitutionally mandated time limit. We quote with approval from the Court of Appeals opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">\u201cUnder the circumstance that the attorney general was taking the position that the income tax act was not subject to the power of referendum, the plaintiffs were entirely justified in seeking a declaratory judgment as to their right of referendum before going to the trouble and expense of obtaining the large number of signatures required to place the question on the ballot.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">\u201cIn a case of this kind the moving party is entitled to an expeditious disposition by the courts so that the right of referendum guaranteed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>constitution is not jeopardized. The plaintiffs in this case obtained such an expeditious disposition at the trial court level.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u201cTheir claim of appeal was filed October 19, 1967. No application for emergency consideration by our Court or for by-pass of our Court or for emergency consideration was filed with the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u201cThere is no provision in the constitution extending the time within which a referendum may be sought by reason of the pendency of litigation and it would be extraordinary for the courts to declare such an extension of time. If the plaintiffs desired to exercise the power of referendum they were obliged to proceed within the time provided by the constitution to obtain signatures. It is not claimed that any such effort was made. We conclude that the time for seeking a referendum on the income tax act has expired.\u201d (15 Mich App 364, at pp 375, 376.)</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">We hold plaintiffs\u2019 failure to comply with the constitutional requirements within 90 days from the adjournment of the legislature precludes any action at this time by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Plaintiffs\u2019 next contention is that the Act violates Michigan Constitution of 1963, art 4, \u00a7 24,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> because in addition to imposing a tax it appropriates three million dollars to the revenue division of the Department of Treasury to cover initial expenses of administration and enforcement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This Court has long and consistently said that art 4, \u00a7 24, and similar \u201cone object\u201d provisions in earlier constitutions, are to be construed reasonably \u201cand not in so narrow and technical a sense as unnecessarily to embarrass legislation.\u201d <em>Ryerson </em>v. <em>Utley </em>(1868), 16 Mich 269, 277, citing <em>People, ex rel. Drake, </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number><em>Mahaney </em>(1865), 13 Mich 481, 494.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The object of the Act was to provide for creation and collection of a state income tax. The appropriation in the Act was utterly germane to that object. A statute may authorize the doing of all things which are in furtherance of the general purpose of the Act without violating the \u201cone object\u201d limitation of art 4, \u00a7 24, and so an appropriation in the Act to finance its administration and provisions for disposition of the taxes collected are proper and constitutional. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Burlingame </em>(1891), 88 Mich 438; <em>National Loan &amp; Investment Co. </em>v. <em>City of Detroit </em>(1904), 136 Mich 451; <em>In re Brewster Street Housing Site </em>(1939), 291 Mich 313; <em>Local No. 1644, AFSC&amp;ME, AFL-CIO </em>v. <em>Oakwood Hospital Corporation </em>(1962), 367 Mich 79. For similar provisions in other Michigan taxing acts, see: Michigan sales tax act, CLS 1961, \u00a7 205.75 (Stat Ann 1960 Rev \u00a7 7.546)'; Michigan use tax act, MCLA \u00a7 205.111 (Stat Ann 1960 Rev \u00a77.555[21]); Michigan intangibles tax act, MCLA \u00a7 205.136 (Stat Ann 1960 Rev \u00a7 7.556 [6]).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">The Act imposes an income tax on individuals of 2.6% on corporations of 5.6%, and on financial institutions of 7%. It provides for a $1,200 exemption on each individual and for his dependents, for a sliding scale of tax credits for city income tax paid, and a sliding scale of tax credits for property owners and renters.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Plaintiffs say that the classification of taxpayers into three categories and the Act\u2019s provisions allowing credits for property tax and income tax liability violate Michigan Constitution of 1963, art 9, \u00a7 7, prohibiting an income tax graduated as to rate or base. As the Court of Appeals said, that prohibition applies only to different rates of tax on different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>segments of taxable income of the person being taxed. It does not prohibit the exclusion or exemption from the definition of taxable income of a portion of the taxed person\u2019s receipts. Undoubtedly what the drafters and adopters of that provision in the 1963 Michigan Constitution had in mind was the graduated scheme of the Federal income tax in which rates increase as taxable income does, and that power they wished to deny to the state. Neither the designation of three types of taxpayers with different applicable rates to each, nor the difference in exemptions or exclusions causes this Act to run amiss of that wish and does not violate art 9, \u00a7 7. The rates of tax imposed by the Act are uniformly applicable to all taxable income of every taxpayer in each class. As the Court of Appeals said:</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\u201cThe credits for property and income taxes are allowed against the tax liability of all taxpayers without regard to their income. The limitations upon the amounts of credits that may be claimed by a taxpayer are not based upon the taxpayer\u2019s income; the effect is not to impose a tax violative of the constitutional prohibition against a tax graduated as to rate or base.\u201d <em>(Kuhn </em>v. <em>Department of Treasury, supra, </em>at p 371.)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">By the same token, they are not violative of the equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and of the Michigan Constitution of 1963, art 1, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Affirmed as modified.
