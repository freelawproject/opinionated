Kavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AjF\">This suit was brought by Mary Jane Starbuck to determine her right to the proceeds of an insurance policy on the life of her son, John Starbuck. At the time of her son\u2019s death, such insurance contract designated \u201cPeggy L. Starbuck, wife\u201d, as the primary beneficiary and his mother as the contingent beneficiary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The current conflicting claims to the proceeds, however, are between the mother of John Starbuck and his estate. The wife is not involved in this dispute because shortly before John Starbuck\u2019s death the marriage was terminated by divorce. The judgment of divorce specifically excluded Peggy L. Starbuck from sharing in the proceeds of the policy, pursuant to the directions of MCLA \u00a7 552.101 (Stat Ann 1957 Rev \u00a7 25.131) which provides in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b415-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>\u201cHereafter every decree of divorce shall determine all rights of the wife in and to the proceeds of any policy or contract of life insurance, endowment or annuity upon the life of the husband in which she was named or designated as beneficiary, or to which she became entitled by assignment or change of beneficiary during the marriage or in anticipation thereof, whether such contract or policy was heretofore or shall hereafter be written or become effective, and unless otherwise ordered in said decree such policy or contract shall thereupon become and be payable to the estate of the husband or to such named beneficiary as he shall affirmatively designate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">Complying with this requirement the judgment of divorce provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\u201cIt is further ordered and adjudged, that all rights of the plaintiff [wife] in and to the proceeds of any policy or contract of life insurance, endowment, or annuity upon the life of the defendant [husband] in which she was named or designated as beneficiary, or to which she became entitled by assignment or change of beneficiary during the marriage or in anticipation thereof, whether such contract or policy was heretofore or shall hereafter be written or become effective, shall hereupon become and be payable to the estate of the defendant [husband], or such named beneficiary as he shall affirmatively designate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The problem presently litigated arose when, subsequent to the divorce, the now deceased husband failed to name a \u201cprimary beneficiary\u201d to replace his divorced wife. Absent a subsequent designation of a new primary beneficiary, the estate of John Star-buck claimed that the cited statute and the judgment of divorce required the proceeds to be paid into the \u00e9state.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The mother, however, contested the estate\u2019s claim. She argued that the statute required only the nam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>ing of an alternative taker and that her son\u2019s designation of her as a \u201ccontingent beneficiary\u201d satisfied the requirements of the statute and entitled her to take the proceeds of the insurance policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The insurance company, faced with the dual claims, deposited the money with the clerk of the trial court \u2014 willing to pay either, but not both.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">' After quoting the statute and the virtually identical language in the judgment of divorce (above quoted), the trial court found:</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">\u201c * # # that in order for the contingent beneficiary to take, some positive action would have had to be taken after the divorce to name her as beneficiary. The words \u2018shall\u2019 and \u2018affirmatively\u2019 as defined above would indicate <em>future positive action. </em>The insured\u2019s naming her as contingent beneficiary previously couldn\u2019t be considered to be a future positive action.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">\u201cIt is my opinion, therefore, that because the primary beneficiary was living and couldn\u2019t take by operation of law, then this court, by interpreting the same law, should determine who is entitled to the proceeds. The law states that the estate should unless there is another beneficiary named by the insured by taking positive future action to do so. This he did not do. Therefore, it is my determination that the proceeds should be payable to the estate.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">On appeal to the Court of Appeals, the trial court\u2019s decision was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">It is perhaps pertinent to note at this point that the insurance policy does not enumerate any events upon which the mother would receive the proceeds of the policy aside from her designation as the \u201ccontingent\u201d beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-12\">We are, thus, confronted with a need for a determination of both the statutory and contractual rights of the mother in the instant insurance proceeds. Does the disqualification of the wife to take, due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>her divorce, allow the \u201ccontingent\u201d beneficiary to take under the contract? And, secondly, does the quoted statute require the husband to affirmatively designate a new beneficiary subsequent to the divorce in order to preclude payment of the proceeds into his estate ?</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">Prior to the addition in 1939 of the above-quoted portion of the statute to MCLA \u00a7 552.101, the wife was entitled to the proceeds of the policy when she remained the designated primary beneficiary <em>after a divorce. Ancient Order of Hibernians </em>v. <em>Mahon </em>(1922), 221 Mich 213, and <em>Guarantee Fund Life Association </em>v. <em>Willett </em>(1927), 241 Mich 132. The effect of the amendment, as stated in the title to the statute, in the judgment of divorce, and, in the statute itself, was to affect the interest of the <em>wife </em>in the insurance policy and thus cure the situation where a divorced wife could <em>inadvertently receive </em>the proceeds of a perhaps forgotten policy. \u201cInadvertently receive\u201d should be stressed for the statute does not prohibit the husband or the divorce judgment itself from retaining or renaming the wife as the primary beneficiary. It simply requires affirmative action on the part of the court or husband to retain the divorced wife as the primary beneficiary and thus eliminate what could be, and usually appears to be, the inadvertent payment of the life insurance proceeds to a divorced wife.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The question now arises both under the contract and the statute: \u201cIs the meaning of a \u2018contingent beneficiary\u2019 in the life insurance policy under the circumstances of this case sufficient to entitle such a contingent beneficiary to take?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">It would appear that the statute would have no interest in eliminating the taking by such a third party. The statute is concerned, as its title suggests, with the parties to the divorce and with the elimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>of an inadvertent transfer of life insurance proceeds to a divorced wife. The naming of a contingent beneficiary at whatever time is therefore sufficient to show positive indication by the husband of an intent to have such a beneficiary alternatively take upon the disqualification of his wife, regardless of why she was unable to take. There is, in most instances, nothing about a judgment of divorce which would suggest that the divorce would alter a husband\u2019s thinking relative to a <em>contingent </em>beneficiary receiving the proceeds of an insurance policy on his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">The statute, then, would appear interested in <em>whether </em>a husband affirmatively indicated an alternative taker, <em>not </em>with <em>when </em>such an indication is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">This brings .us finally to the terms of the policy itself. As stated above, the designation \u201ccontingent beneficiary\u201d appears with no further indication of its meaning. Its normal meaning would be that of an \u201calternative\u201d taker of the proceeds if the primary beneficiary cannot take. Perhaps the most common reason anticipated for such primary beneficiary\u2019s inability to take would be the death of the primary beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">But obviously this \u201cusual reason\u201d is not the exclusive reason.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Couch on Insurance (2d ed) dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>cusses the import of an insured naming a contingent beneficiary, and says (\u00a7 27:2):</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\u201cThe naming of contingent beneficiaries in the initial contract of insurance has the same effect with respect to the ultimate disposition of the proceeds of the policy as though the insured made a change of beneficiary after death or disqualification of the original beneficiary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">We, therefore, hold that as a matter of contract interpretation a contingent beneficiary will be qualified to receive the proceeds of an insurance policy upon the disqualification of the primary beneficiary unless a provision of the insurance contract requires a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">On the facts of this case we hold that the naming of a contingent beneficiary in the insurance contract satisfies the statutory requirement that a divorced husband affirmatively designate another person if he desires the proceeds of his life insurance to go to someone other than his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b419-8\">T.
