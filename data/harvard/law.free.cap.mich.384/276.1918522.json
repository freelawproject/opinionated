E. Brennan, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">The Case</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Plaintiff commenced this action in March of 1962, seeking recovery of damages for alleged medical malpractice in treatment of her husband. In January of 1963, interrogatories were filed by defendants. which requested plaintiff to:</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u201cIII. State the name and address of every member of the medical profession that you have consulted or had conferences with, or your attorneys have had conferences with or consulted with as proposed expert witnesses to testify on your behalf as to the alleged negligence or malpractice of Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">\u201cIV. List each medical treatise or article that you or your attorneys have used in connection with the preparation of the Declaration in this cause or upon which you rely as a basis for the alleged negligence or malpractice of Defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">\u201cV. State whether you or your attorneys have any written reports received from so-called expert witnesses that you have consulted or intend to use at a trial of this cause and attach copies of said reports hereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">Plaintiff\u2019s answer to the interrogatories was filed on August 2, 1963:</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">\u201c3. I do not have sufficient knowledge to answer interritory [sic] III with reference to my attorneys, hut as to myself, the answer is \u2018none\u2019;</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">\u201c4. I do not have sufficient knowledge to answer interrogatory IV with reference to my attorneys, hut as to myself, the answer is none;</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">\u201c5. I do not have sufficient knowledge to answer interrogatory V with reference to my attorneys, hut as to myself, the answer is I have \u2018none\u2019,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>At a pretrial conference held on February 27, 1964, defendants again requested the names and addresses of those experts who \u201cwill be relied upon to establish the grounds of negligence, malpractice and so forth set forth in the declaration.\u201d Plaintiff resisted the pretrial request; a motion to compel answer to interrogatories or to furnish identity of expert witnesses was filed on July 2, 1964, pursuant to OCR 1963, 313.1, 313.2 and 302.2(1), and a hearing was scheduled for November 27, 1964. The hearing on the motion was adjourned at the request of defendants and was never rescheduled. On March 7, 1967, defendants filed a motion for discovery supported by affidavit which prayed for the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">\u201c(1) For an order requiring Plaintiffs to divulge and disclose the names of all expert witnesses that they intend to call at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">\u201c(2) For an order limiting Plaintiffs in their right to call expert witnesses to those names listed and disclosed pursuant to Order of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">\u201c(3) That this Court set the day of March 18, 1967 for the taking of the deposition of the expert witness or witnesses that Plaintiffs intend to call at the time of trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Plaintiff filed no answer to the motion but filed a post-hearing affidavit in opposition to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">The trial court denied defendants\u2019 motion on July 3, 1967, reasoning that the applicable court rules granted discretion to grant or deny the motion, and rejecting defendants\u2019 contention that the motion should have been granted as a matter of right. An interlocutory appeal from the order denying discovery was taken; the Court of Appeals,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> while affirming the trial court\u2019s right of discretion, held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>that the order denying the requested discovery constituted an abuse of discretion. Pursuant to GCR 1963, 820.1(7), it entered an order requiring plaintiff to divulge the names and addr\u00e9sses of the proposed expert witnesses, restricting plaintiff to the use at trial of those experts divulged, and authorizing defendants to depose such experts at defendants\u2019 expense with respect to the qualifications and experience of the experts in the field of their testimony and whether such experts considered any facts not available to defendants in formulating their opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The issue presented is, very simply, whether the trial court abused its discretion by denying the defendants\u2019 motion to depose plaintiff\u2019s expert witnesses. We hold that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion for two reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">First, because the request came too late. Whatever rights any party may have to obtain the pretrial discovery, such rights are always subject to the trial judge\u2019s right and duty to control the flow of litigation. Standing alone, the fact that the lawsuit was then five years old when the trial judge denied discovery satisfies us that there was not an abuse of discretion in its denial. GCR 1963, 301.7<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> providing that discovery may not be had after the pretrial conference without special motion for good cause shown, was not in effect when this case went through pretrial conferences in February of 1964 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>and again in 1965.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the principle that a judge is responsible for moving his docket is not a new one, and discretion was always lodged in trial judges to deny discovery when that process interfered with expeditious disposition of civil litigation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AWb\">Second, there was no showing made before the trial judge as to any special need for discovery deposition to be taken for plaintiff\u2019s experts. An expert is not a person \u201chaving knowledge of relevant facts\u201d within the meaning of GCR 1963, 302.2.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Neither is an expert a person whose opinion testimony can be secured by means of a subpoena under GCR 1963, 305.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> By definition, an expert is one who gives opinion testimony, and not testimony concerning \u201crelevant facts.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> He has a property right in his opinion and cannot be made to divulge it in answer to a subpoena.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">We do not decide whether in a proper case the testimony of an expert may not be compelled in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>pretrial discovery order, under penalty of prohibiting use of his testimony at trial; all we say here is that, under the circumstances of this case, denial of the requested discovery, sought as a matter of right, was not an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion. Thus, any discussion of the work product privilege is not necessary to this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">The cause is reversed and remanded to circuit court with direction to schedule the case for trial within 30 days. Costs to plaintiff.</p>\n<judges id=\"b401-5\">T. M. Kavanagh, Adams, and T. Gr. Kavanagh, JJ., concurred with T. E. Brennan, C.

I agree with the result reached by the Brethren but cannot accept their premise that a question of judicial discretion is involved. I hold instead that the plaintiff in both cases at bar is possessed of a substantively valuable right to keep inviolate the entire product of preparatory work done and to be done by her counsel, and that the defendants and their counsel, this \u201cone court of justice\u201d as well, are possessed of no license or privilege to pry or nose into that product.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The difference between one\u2019s substantive right and his right to invoke judicial discretion was marked precisely, with ample supporting authority, in recent <em>Moyses </em>v. <em>Spartan Asphalt Paving Company </em>(1970), 383 Mich 314, 325, 326:</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">\u201cA substantive right is like the presence or absence of pregnancy. It exists or does not exist, and cannot be made to depend on any good or dismaying turn of judicial discretion. Hence one\u2019s right of appeal to judicial discretion differs from his substantive rights in that the former is simply the \u2018Power or privilege of the court to act unhampered by legal rule.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>\"We are referred to no Michigan Buie of Court, and to no procedural statute which might be deemed effective under GCB 1963, 16, and to no decision of this Court, holding that a motion for discovery of an opponent lawyer\u2019s ever-provisional witness list, lay or expert, is a proper invocation of judicial discretion. No decision of this Court says that such motions are grantable as a matter of right. And the Gilmore record of our GCB indoctrination meetings of 1962 (as to which see <em>Moyses, supra, </em>at 323, 324) discloses no hint of intention of the drafters or doctrinary discussants, or of any then Justice of this Court, that any part of the new Buies would authorize \u2014 even in the name of judicial discretion \u2014 a motion as here for compulsive opening up of one\u2019s witness-swearing intentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">When and if this Court decides to open up a lawyer\u2019s work product that way, doubtless it will do so by some constitutionally debated Buie of Court, the wording of which may easily make clear a judicial intention of reversing the policy which, for <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Saginaw Circuit Judge </em>(1963), 370 Mich 404, 413, 414, was purposefully written:</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">\u201cDiscovery in the text of today\u2019s issue has become an uncertain variable of provincial discretion, differing according to views of judges among the Federal circuits and Federal districts, and differing undeniably in the respective circuits of our State. The reason, as I see it, is that no court of ultimate authority has as yet defined with precision the \u2018work product of the lawyer,\u2019 and has then declared the extent to which \u2014 if at all \u2014 the traditional privacy of that product may be invaded by discovery proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">To that portion of the text we added, by footnote 2:</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>\u201cConsider, as a related aside, the Topsy-grown practice hy which disclosure of the identity of witnesses the lawyer and his client may or may not call to the stand is \u2014 by some judges \u2014 penalty-compelled at pretrial. This indeed, unless resisted, pries into the attorney\u2019s strategy as well as his \u2018mental impressions\u2019 and \u2018legal theories.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">Apropos the instant demand for discovery of the identity of some expert this plaintiff\u2019s counsel may provisionally intend to call to the stand with vouch,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we went on to say in <em>Wilson </em>at 415, 416:</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u201cBy <em>People </em>v. <em>Pratt </em>[1903], 133 Mich 125 (67 LRA 923), followed in <em>Lindsay </em>v. <em>Lipson </em>[1962], 367 Mich 1, 5, this Court is committed to \u2018a somewhat liberal interpretation\u2019 of the common-law right of professional privilege when the necessary relationship exists. We said, in the <em>Pratt Case </em>at 129:</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\u201c \u2018The privilege is not confined to communications made for the purpose of obtaining advice. It extends to \u201ccommunications made to an attorney in the course of any professional employment, relating to the subject of the employment, and which may be supposed to have been drawn out in consequence of the relation in which the parties stand to each other.\u201d \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\"><em>\u201cPratt\u2019s </em>\u2018liberal\u2019 rule defies discovery of the lawyer\u2019s \u2018work product.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">The defendant seekers of identity rely upon GrCE 1963, 302.2 (1); in particular the phrase therein: \u201cand the identity and location of persons having knowledge of relevant facts.\u201d Not until now has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>anyone claimed in this Court \u2014 under that Rule\u2014 that litigants may force a deposed party or counsel to divulge under penalty the identity of \u201cpersons\u201d whom such counsel has interviewed or consulted for trial-preparational purposes. Both <em>People </em>v. <em>Pratt </em>and <em>Lindsay </em>v. <em>Lipson, </em>both <em>supra, </em>deny such claimed right. And this Court thus far, as <em>Wilson </em>plainly discloses, has shown no disposition to overrule or modify that \u201csomewhat liberal interpretation\u201d of the common-law right of professional privilege when the necessary relationship exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Parenthetically, the searching and thoughtful text <em>of Kelley </em>v. <em>Richardson </em>(1888), 69 Mich 430, 436, 437 in cautious mind, I agree with the Brethren when they say <em>(ante </em>at p 282) that \u201cAn expert is not a person \u2018having knowledge of relevant facts\u2019 within the meaning of GCR 1963, 302.2.\u201d That alone should be enough for summary reversal of the order reviewed, without tiptoeing into and out of the great realm of judicial discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">The right way to test interpretive questions like this is simply to try them out. Let the defendants depose, under Rule 302 (which they haven\u2019t done), either the plaintiff or her counsel, and then commence what is said to be rightful interrogation. If the plaintiff is the first deponent, will she not refer the interrogator to her counsel, the subject after all being the \u201cwork product\u201d they are assembling?<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Then, if counsel are deposed, will not the interrogator be up against the common-law privilege?</p>\n<p id=\"b405-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>The fact is that a conscientious preparationist for legal war is not apt \u2014 the privilege considered \u2014 to disclose to his opponent or opponents any of his work-produced intentions, purposes, or plans, and no law compels him so to do. His intentions are bound to change from left to right or straight ahead, or to some other strategic variable, depending upon developments up to the eve of and during the course of trial. To make it plain, <em>Ms intentions </em>are <em>Ms business.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">To summarize both an appeal and a pair of tragically mired lawsuits:</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">1. Thus far we have not sanctioned <em>any </em>violation of the privacy of <em>any </em>part of <em>any </em>work product trial lawyers construct for their clients. That product is a concomitant of the relationship of attorney and client, and of the privilege arising therefrom. It is a really <em>broad </em>privilege, one we have maintained for the 67 years since <em>Pratt, supra, </em>was decided. The effort here is to invade what is a substantive right. I hold that there is no discretionary power to open it up for anyone, no matter what showing of \u201ccause\u201d the invoker of judicial discretion may exhibit or proffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">2. The first of these cases was commenced by Mr. Klabunde in March of 1962 by what, to that time and as far back as this Court\u2019s beginning session of 1843, was known as a <em>declaration. </em>In the next year, however, stirring hosannas having heralded the General Court Buies of 1963,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mr. Klabunde\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>declaration became a <em>complaint. </em>Then, as veteran lawyers now are wont to say, GCR. procrastination set in.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">It is regrettable, in retrospect, that the trial judge in early 1963 did not for Mr. Klabunde employ the judicial prerogative of then new (GCR) Rule 14. Rule 14 permitted the judge to apply \u201cthe former procedure\u201d upon finding that the new procedure \u201cwould work injustice.\u201d The new procedure in this instance has done just that with a vengeance, our order of November 30, 1970 considered. That order directed <em>immediate </em>trial of these consolidated Klabunde cases, but it cannot help the permanently paralyzed (until 1965 death) Mr. Klabunde. He was defeated totally by unrealistic new Rules of Court and the built-in cunctation they have fostered since 1962, and thereby was denied the privilege of testifying before a jury to that which he knew about the facts and results of his 1960 surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">I join the other Justices in reversal and remand for reinstatement of the order entered by Judge Hughes.</p>\n<judges id=\"b406-8\">Dethmers, J., concurred with Black, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b406-9\">Kelly, J., did not sit in this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b403-9\"> Such decisions can never be safely and finally made in advance of trial. They depend naturally upon developments during trial starting with the <em>voir dire </em>examination. They depend also on possible last minute decisions of consulted experts that they will <em>not testify </em>to any opinion or opinions entertained by them. All persons, \u201cexperts\u201d included, really do have a personal right to retain their opinions, distinguished from knowledge of admissible facts, free from compulsive divulgation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b404-8\"> That is just what Mr. Klabunde did, while still alive and waiting for his unmercifully stalled case to,come to trial. He answered \u201cno knowledge\u201d under oath to defendants\u2019 interrogatory No. 3:</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">\u201cState the name and address of every member of the medical profession that you have consulted or had conferences with, or your attorneys have had conferences with or consulted with as proposed expert witnesses to testify on your behalf as to the alleged negligence or malpractice of Defendants.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b405-7\"> Here are the final notes of the trumpet (copied with reference to source from <em>Husted </em>v. <em>Consumers Power Company </em>[1965], 376 Mich at 60):</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">\u201cAs these new laws of procedure become more .fully understood and utilized, they will earn recognition as the greatest achievement of our generation in advancing the cause of the improvement in administration of justice in this State.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b405-9\">To and including 1962 the eourts of Michigan got along both expeditiously and certainly under no more than 78 rules of Court. Now we have more than 900 of \u201cthese new laws of procedure,\u201d the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>interpretation and application of which is bound to vex lawyers and judges, and time-delayed and expense-dismayed litigants, for many more than the already elapsed 8 years.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
