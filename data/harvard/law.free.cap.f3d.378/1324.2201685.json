Under the transfer statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 (2000), the claims in the Court of Federal Claims are deemed to have been filed on the same date as the plaintiff filed her district court suit. The Court of Federal Claims dismissed the suit before it for lack of jurisdiction under \u00a7 1500 because the remaining claim in the district court suit was the \u201csame claim\u201d as that before it. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">In February 2001 the appellant Bonnie Harbuck filed suit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Georgia against the Secretary of the Air Force alleging sex discrimination in her employment with the Air Force. The first amended complaint contained three counts. Count I alleged that, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e, 2000e-l to 2000e-17, the Air Force had \u201cdiscriminated against Plaintiff on the basis of her sex\u201d by, among other things, \u201c[playing male employees who perform work that is substantially comparable to Plaintiffs [sic] at a higher level than Plaintiff;\u201d \u201c[flailing to advance Plaintiff to the WG-12 or GS-11 level as it did with her male counterparts;\u201d \u201c[i]mpeding Plaintiffs career advancement by giving her lower performance appraisals than it gave her male coworkers, withholding accolades she had earned, failing to properly evaluate her experience and accomplishments, following a practice of favoring male employees over female employees for promotion; and threatening and intimidating Plaintiff.\u201d First Am. Compl. \u00b6 50. Count II charged that the Air Force had willfully violated the Equal Pay Act of 1963, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206(d), \u201c[b]y paying male employees at a higher rate for work which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility and which is performed under similar working conditions to that performed by Plaintiff.\u201d First Am. Compl. \u00b6 52. Count III charged violation of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552a.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-12\">The complaint sought declaratory, injunctive and monetary relief. It sought a declaration that \u201cDefendant has discriminated against Plaintiff on the basis of her sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1327\">*1327</page-number>Rights Act of 1964, by affording males and younger persons opportunities for advancement not afforded to her, by paying males [sic] employees at a higher rate more than her [sic] based on her sex, by following a pattern of favoring male employees over female employees for career advancement opportunities and by making adverse and derogatory statements based on Plaintiffs sex,\u201d and that \u201cthe Defendant has willfully violated the Equal Pay Act by paying Plaintiff less than it paid her male counterparts for work which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility and which is performed under similar working conditions.\u201d The injunctive relief sought included reclassifying Harbuck to a higher grade. The first item of damages sought was \u201cback wages in the amount of the difference between what she actually earned and what she would have earned at the GS-12 level from January 1990 until she is restored to her proper and correct grade.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Approximately a year later Harbuck, represented by new counsel, moved to transfer the Equal Pay Act Count (Count II) to the Court of Federal Claims. The district court granted the motion. It held that because Harbuck was seeking damages of more than $10,000 in that count, it had no jurisdiction over it and that \u201cit is in the interest of justice\u201d to transfer it to the Court of Federal Claims, which would have jurisdiction over \u201cPetitioner\u2019s EPA claim as pleaded.\u201d Order of Aug. 5, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">Following the transfer of Count II, Harbuck filed in the Court of Federal Claims a complaint under the Equal Pay Act. The complaint reiterated the allegations in Count II of the district court complaint. It alleged that the Air Force violated the Equal Pay Act \u201c[b]y paying male employees, specifically Jerry Walker[,] a GS-11, at a higher rate for work which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility and which is performed under similar working conditions to that performed by Plaintiff.\u201d Compl. \u00b6 42. The relief requested included a declaration that \u201cDefendant has willfully violated and retaliated against the Plaintiff in violation of the Equal Pay Act by paying Plaintiff less than it paid her male counterpart, specifically the duties she assumed from male employee, Jerry Walker, GS-11, for work which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility and which is performed under similar working conditions,\u201d the reclassification of Harbuck to a higher grade, and \u201cback wages in the amount of the difference between what she actually earned and what she would have earned at the GS-12 level from January 1990 until she is restored to her proper and correct grade.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">Some months later the district court dismissed the remainder of Harbuck\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-9\">On the government\u2019s motion, the Court of Federal Claims then dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction. <em>Harbuck v. United States, </em>58 Fed.Cl. 266 (2003). The court held that Harbuck\u2019s claim before it was the \u201csame claim\u201d as her claim in the district court and that \u00a7 1500 therefore precluded the Court of Federal Claims from considering her suit. <em>Id. </em>at 269-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-10\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-11\">A. Section 1500 of Title 28 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1001-12\">The United States Court of Federal Claims shall not have jurisdiction of any claim for or in respect to which the plaintiff or his assignee has pending in any other court any suit or process against the United States or any person who, at the time when the cause of action alleged in such suit or process arose, was, in respect thereto, acting or professing to act, directly or indirectly under the authority of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1002-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1328\">*1328</page-number>This is an old statute whose ancestry goes back to the aftermath of the Civil War. <em>See Keene Corp. v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 200, 206-07, 113 S.Ct. 2035, 124 L.Ed.2d 118 (1993). Its purpose was to \u201cforce plaintiffs to choose between pursuing their claims in the Court of Claims or in another court\u201d and to prevent the United States from having to litigate and defend against the same claim in both courts. <em>UNR Indus, v. United States, </em>962 F.2d 1013, 1018, 1021 (Fed.Cir.1992) (in banc). \u201cThe question of whether another claim is \u2018pending\u2019 for purposes of \u00a7 1500 is determined at the time at which the suit in the Court of Federal Claims is filed, not the time at which the Government moves to dismiss the action.\u201d <em>Loveladies Harbor, Inc. v. United States, </em>27 F.3d 1545, 1548 (Fed.Cir.1994) (in banc). Thus, the district court\u2019s dismissal of the remaining counts, after it had transferred Count II to the Court of Federal Claims, was irrelevant to the validity under \u00a7 1500 of the latter court\u2019s subsequent dismissal of that count.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">The statute pursuant to which the district court transferred Count II of the complaint to the Court of Federal Claims was 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631, which provides that \u201c[wjhenever a civil action is filed in a court ... and that court finds that there is a want of jurisdiction, the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer such action ... to any other such court in which the action ... could have been brought at the time it was filed.\u201d That provision further provides that following such transfer, \u201cthe action ... shall proceed as if it had been filed in ... the court to which it is transferred on the date upon which it was actually filed in ... the court from which it is transferred.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This statute permits the transfer not only of the entire case but of separate claims in the action. <em>United States v. County of Cook, Ill., </em>170 F.3d 1084,1087-89 (Fed.Cir.1999). Thus, under \u00a7 1631, Harbuck\u2019s Equal Pay Act claim was deemed filed in the Court of Federal Claims on the same day on which she originally filed that claim as one of the three counts of her district court complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-6\">\u201c[Tjhe \u2018filing\u2019 of the same claim simultaneously in the district court and the Court of Federal Claims by operation of \u00a7 1631 deprives the latter court of jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 1500.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1091. The critical issue in the case, therefore, is whether Harbuck\u2019s Equal Pay Act claim in the Court of Federal Claims was the \u201csame claim\u201d as her Title VII claim in the district court. \u201cDeciding if the claims are the same or distinctly different requires a comparison between the claims raised in the Court of Federal Claims and in the other lawsuit.\u201d <em>Loveladies Harbor, Inc., </em>27 F.3d at 1549 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">B. \u201cFor the Court of Federal Claims to be precluded from hearing a claim under \u00a7 1500, the claim pending in another court must arise from the same operative facts, and must seek the same relief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1551. We agree with the Court of Federal Claims that both of those requirements are met here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">Harbuck\u2019s Federal Claims Equal Pay Act claim and her district court Title VII claim both arose out of the same operative facts: the Air Force\u2019s alleged sexual discrimination by payment of lesser compensation to women than to men for the same or substantially equal work. As noted, her Equal Pay Act claim alleged that the Air Force had violated that Act \u201c[b]y paying male employees, specifically Jerry Walker!,] a GS-11, at a higher rate for work which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility and which is performed under similar working conditions to that performed by Plaintiff\u2019 and \u201cby paying Plaintiff less than it paid her male counterpart, specifically the duties she assumed from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1329\">*1329</page-number>male employee, Jerry Walker, GS-11, for work which requires equal skill, effort, and responsibility and which is performed under similar working conditions.\u201d Her district court Title VII claim alleged that the Air Force had \u201cdiscriminated against Plaintiff on the basis of her sex ... by,\u201d among other things, \u201c[p]aying male employees who perform work that is substantially comparable to Plaintiffs [sic] at a higher level than Plaintiff,\u201d \u201c[flailing to advance Plaintiff to the WG-12 or GS-11 level as it did with her male counterparts,\u201d and \u201cfollowing a practice of favoring male employees over female employees for promotion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Harbuck argues, however, that the two suits involved different claims because the Title VII complaint \u201ccentered on\u201d her non-selection for promotion, and the Equal Employment Act claim \u201ccentered around\u201d her \u201cassuming the position of a male employee ... and not receiving the same pay.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 6. \u201cDeciding if the claims are the same or distinctly different requires a comparison between the claims raised in the Court of Federal Claims and in the other lawsuit.\u201d <em>Loveladies Harbor, Inc., </em>27 F.3d at 1549 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[I]t is \u2018operative facts\u2019 and not legal theories by which claims may be distinguished under \u00a7 1500 when the same relief \u2014 money damages \u2014 is sought.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cClaims are the same where they arise from the same operative facts even if the operative facts support different legal theories which cannot all be brought in one court.\u201d <em>Johns-Manville Corp. v. United States, </em>855 F.2d 1556, 1567 (Fed.Cir.1988). The difference between the two theories upon which she relies are but different manifestations of the same underlying claim that the Air Force discriminated against women by paying them less than men.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">Both claims also \u201cseek the same relief\u2019: money damages. The Equal Pay Act complaint sought, in addition to other formulations of damages, \u201cback wages in the amount of the difference between what she actually earned and what she would have earned at the GS-12 level from January 1990 until she is restored to her proper and correct grade.\u201d This is identical to one of the prayers for relief in the first amended district court complaint. No more is required to trigger the second bar under \u00a7 1500.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">The inclusion of other and different requested relief in the two complaints does not avoid the application of that provision. <em>Keene Corp., </em>508 U.S. at 212, 113 S.Ct. 2035 (holding that \u00a7 1500 applies if \u201cthere [is] some overlap in the relief requested\u201d). As long as the same relief is sought in both cases \u2014 here money damages \u2014 the second prong of the \u00a7 1500 requirement that the \u201csame relief\u2019 be involved in both cases is satisfied. <em>Cf. Johns-Manville, </em>855 F.2d at 1566 (distinguishing the situation before it, where \u201cthe relief sought from both courts is money, but under different theories,\u201d from one in which \u201ca different type of relief is sought in the district court (equitable) from that sought in the Court of Claims (money)\u201d); <em>Loveladies Harbor, Inc., </em>27 F.3d at 1551, 1556 (holding \u00a7 1500 inapplicable because the Court of Federal Claims complaint sought only money damages and the district court complaint sought only equitable relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-9\">C. Finally, Harbuck contends that a \u201cmanifest injustice\u201d would result if she were not able to pursue her Federal Claims Court case. She seeks succor from the district court\u2019s ruling that transfer of her Equal Pay Act claim would be \u201cin the interest of justice\u201d and suggests that it also would be in such interest to allow her Court of Federal Claims case to continue. The \u201cinterest of justice\u201d element under \u00a7 1631, however, relates solely to the transfer of a case. It does not affect or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1330\">*1330</page-number>inform the Court of Federal Claim\u2019s determination whether \u00a7 1500 ousts it of jurisdiction because the \u201csame claim\u201d is pending in another court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">Harbuck\u2019s problem is largely of her own making. As she recognizes, she could and should initially have filed her Equal Pay Act case in the Court of Federal Claims. She states that it was her \u201cformer counsel\u201d who \u201cdid not file the Equal Pay Act Claim in the proper forum.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 10. Indeed, in her brief she refers several times to her former counsel\u2019s mistakes. Unfortunately for her, however, she is bound by the actions of her former counsel. <em>See Link v. Wabash R.R., </em>370 U.S. 626, 634, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962) (Under \u201cour system of representative litigation ... each party is deemed bound by the acts of his lawyer-agent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">In any event, we would have no authority to create an \u201cunfairness\u201d exception to the unequivocal language of \u00a7 1500. Any change in the scope of or exception to that statute is for Congress, and not this court, to make. Our obligation and responsibility is to apply the statute Congress has written. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>Keene Corp., </em>in rejecting the similar argument that \u201c\u00a7 1500 operates in some circumstances to deprive plaintiffs of an opportunity to assert rights that Congress has generally made available to them,\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-6\">the \u201cproper theater\u201d for such arguments, as we told another disappointed claimant many years ago, \u201cis the halls of Congress, for that branch of the government has limited the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims.\u201d We enjoy no \u201cliberty to add an exception ... to remove apparent hardship,\u201d and therefore enforce the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1004-7\">508 U.S. at 217-18, 113 S.Ct. 2035 (citations and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-9\">The judgment of the Court of Federal Claims dismissing Harbuck\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction is</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
