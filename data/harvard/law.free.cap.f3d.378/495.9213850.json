The district court had ruled that the non-diverse defendants were fraudulently joined and refused to certify an interlocutory appeal of that ruling to us. After one unsuccessful attempt to appeal that decision to our court, Plaintiffs continued their efforts to gain an expedited appeal on this issue by attempting to manufacture appellate jurisdiction by voluntarily seeking dismissal of their claims against the diverse Defendant-Appellee, Kansas City Southern Railway Company (\u201cKCS\u201d). In so doing, Plaintiffs have forfeited their right to appeal \u2014 presumably inadvertently \u2014 because we must also dismiss this second appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-17\">I. FACTS &amp; PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b522-18\">This case arises out of a fatal railroad crossing accident that occurred in Scott County, Mississippi. The accident occurred when a van, driven by Lucy R. Shepard, collided with a KCS train. Shepard was killed, and her passenger, Phyllis B. McKee, was injured. Plaintiffs, as representatives of Shepard\u2019s wrongful death beneficiaries, filed this action in Mississippi state court asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>claims under that state\u2019s wrongful death statute. McKee filed a separate negligence action (the <em>\u201cMcKee </em>case\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In addition to KCS,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>three members of the train crew, C.L. Duett, Eric Robinson, and Robert Everett (collectively the \u201ctrain crew\u201d), were named as defendants in both actions for their allegedly negligent operation of the train. While this suit was pending in state court, Defendants propounded requests for admissions asking Plaintiffs to admit that there was no basis for joining the train crew defendants in this action. Plaintiffs failed to respond timely to Defendants\u2019 requests for admissions. Arguing that Plaintiffs\u2019 failure to respond resulted in the conclusive admission that no viable cause of action existed against the train crew,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendants removed the action to federal court on the assertion that the train crew defendants, who are Mississippi residents, were fraudulently joined solely to defeat diversity jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Plaintiffs filed a motion in district court seeking remand to state court. In support of this motion, Plaintiffs submitted a sworn statement by Officer Jeff Pitts, a witness to the collision between KCS\u2019s train and Shepard\u2019s van. The district court ordered that a remand deposition of Officer Pitts be taken and that the parties submit a transcript of his deposition to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">After reviewing Officer Pitts\u2019 deposition, the district court denied Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for remand. The court concluded that Officer Pitts\u2019 deposition \u201cwork[ed] against the plaintiffs\u201d and that they could not establish any cause of action against the train crew. The district court consequently dismissed the train crew defendants from the action. Plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration to which they appended additional evidence and documentation to demonstrate the train crew\u2019s potential liability. The district court denied this motion, too.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-12\">Plaintiffs then appealed the district court\u2019s denial of their motion for remand and dismissal of the train crew defendants to this court. As the district court\u2019s remand decision was not certified for interlocutory appellate review under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) or Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), we dismissed that effort to obtain an interlocutory review because we lacked appellate jurisdiction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">Next, the district court entered a scheduling order establishing a discovery completion deadline and setting the case for trial. Meanwhile, the <em>McKee </em>case had proceeded to trial, and a jury had rendered a verdict in favor of KCS.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On learning of that verdict, Plaintiffs filed a pleading styled Motion for Entry of Final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>Judgment in Favor of Defendant (the \u201cMotion for Final Judgment\u201d). This motion, which professed to rely on Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54, stated that this case and the <em>McKee </em>case involved the same defendant (KCS) and identical issues. In their motion, Plaintiffs asserted that, \u201c[s]inee the Court and [KCS] have previously opined that the jury\u2019s verdict in <em>McKee </em>and the final judgment entered pursuant to that verdict are binding upon the Plaintiff and [KCS] herein, there is no just reason to delay the entry of a final judgment in this action.\u201d Plaintiffs, therefore, asked the district court to \u201cdirect the entry of a final judgment against the Plaintiff and in favor of the Defendant in this action.\u201d Importantly, the Motion for Final Judgment said nothing about whether Plaintiffs were seeking dismissal with or without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">KCS filed a response in which it stated that Plaintiffs had miscited Rule 54 as the governing rule. Instead, explained KCS, \u201c[t]he proper rule under which the Plaintiff should be proceeding is Rule 41(a)(2).\u201d KCS made the following representation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWv\">Defendant [KCS] has no objection to Plaintiffs request for dismissal of her claims against this Defendant and for entry of final judgment <em>with prejudice </em>in this Defendant\u2019s favor. It is apparent from Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion, and from representations by her counsel to this Defendant and the Court, that Plaintiff wishes to terminate proceedings before this Court and appeal to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals this Court\u2019s rulings denying the Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion to Remand and Motion to Reconsider Order Denying Remand. Defendant would agree to entry of an order dismissing Plaintiffs\u2019 claims <em>with prejudice </em>and expressly reserving the Plaintiffs\u2019 right to challenge this Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction over this action on appeal to the Fifth Circuit.(<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">Before the district court ruled on the Motion for Final Judgment, though, Plaintiffs filed yet another motion for reconsideration of the district court\u2019s initial order denying remand. This time they cited evidence from the <em>McKee </em>trial to demonstrate the viability of their claims against the train crew defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">In ruling on Plaintiffs\u2019 two pending motions, the district court first acknowledged that Plaintiffs had predicated their Motion for Final Judgement on Rule 54(b), but agreed with KCS and construed Plaintiffs\u2019 motion as one for voluntary dismissal under Rule 41(a)(2). The district court then granted Plaintiffs\u2019 motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">There is no counterclaim in the instant case and the defendants do not object to the plaintiffs\u2019 motion. Therefore, the above styled and numbered cause is hereby dismissed in accordance with Rule 41(a)(2). As a special condition of this dismissal, the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for this court to enter a final judgment in favor of the defendants ... is hereby granted. This court hereby grants final judgment in favor of the defendants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">In the same order, the district court went on to deny Plaintiffs\u2019 renewed motion for reconsideration of the remand issue. Plaintiffs timely filed their notice of appeal, designating this order as the decision from which they were appealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">Plaintiffs appeal the district court\u2019s denial of their motion for remand. In support, Plaintiffs advance arguments essentially identical to those advanced in McKee\u2019s appeal to this court, contesting the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>court\u2019s denial of her motion for remand.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> By attempting to manufacture appellate jurisdiction through the voluntarily dismissal of the remainder of their action against KCS, however, Plaintiffs have unwittingly stepped into the so-called \u201cfinality trap,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> thereby forfeiting altogether their right to appeal the district court\u2019s remand decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">A. MANUFACTURING APPELLATE JURISDICtion to Obtain a Quasi-Interlocutory Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">The starting point of our analysis is 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, the jurisdictional statute on which Plaintiffs now rely in seeking appellate relief from us. Generally, all claims and issues in a case must be adjudicated in the district court, and a final judgment or order must be issued, before our jurisdiction can be invoked under \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This \u201cfinal judgment rule\u201d creates appellate jurisdiction only after a decision that \u201cends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Here, the district court refused to certify its denial of Plaintiffs\u2019 motion for remand for an interlocutory appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). Neither did the court enter a final judgment pursuant to Rule 54(b) in favor of the dismissed train crew defendants.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">All parties agree that the <em>McKee </em>case and this action involved the same defendant (KSC), identical operative facts, and substantially overlapping legal claims. Additionally, both cases proceeded before the same district judge. Consequently, after the jury rendered a verdict for KCS in the <em>McKee </em>case, the Plaintiff (and possibly the district court as well) apparently expected KCS to raise the defense of <em>res judicata </em>or issue preclusion in this case. Critically, though, nothing in the record reflects any assertion of these defenses by KCS.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Instead, Plaintiffs preemptively filed their Motion for Final Judgment, asking the district court to \u201cdirect the entry of a final judgment against the Plaintiff[s] and in favor of the Defendant in this action.\u201d In effect, Plaintiffs sought to manufacture a final judgment \u2014 and through it appellate jurisdiction \u2014 to obtain an immediate appellate ruling on the question of fraudulent joinder.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">The Plaintiffs\u2019 problem with the strategy they employed is that it runs headlong into the \u201csettled rule in the Fifth Circuit that appellate jurisdiction over a non-final order cannot be created by dismissing the remaining claims <em>without preju</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number><em>dice.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And, a Rule 41(a) dismissal without prejudice is not deemed to be a \u201cfinal decision\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 1291. This rule can be traced back to our decision in <em>Ryan v. Occidental Petroleum Corp.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Ryan, </em>we explained that when a district court grants a party\u2019s request for a voluntary dismissal, he \u201cgets what he seeks, i.e., a dismissal without an adjudication on the merits, and he is entitled to bring a later suit on the same cause of action.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Therefore, a party cannot use voluntary dismissal <em>without </em>prejudice as an end-run around the final judgment rule to convert an otherwise non-final \u2014 and thus non-appealable \u2014 ruling into a final decision appealable under \u00a7 1291.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">Typically, the <em>Ryan </em>rule operates when a plaintiff has filed multiple claims against a single party, or against multiple parties, and the district court has dismissed some but not all of the claims. Then, in an effort to preserve his remaining claims while simultaneously appealing the adverse dismissal, the plaintiff implores the district court to dismiss his remaining claims <em>without </em>prejudice and enter a final judgment.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>Ryan </em>eschews this practice of manufacturing \u00a7 1291 appellate jurisdiction and disallows the manipulative plaintiff from having his cake (the ability to refile the claims voluntarily dismissed) and eating it too (getting an early appellate bite at reversing the claims dismissed involuntarily).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This prohibition of quasi-interlocutory appeals applies equally to a plaintiffs attempt to use a Rule 41(a) voluntary dismissal to construct the jurisdictional basis for appealing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for remand.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-12\">In contrast, when a plaintiff agrees to have his remaining claims dismissed <em>with </em>prejudice, <em>Ryan\u2019s </em>rule is not implicated because the plaintiff is precluded from refiling the same action elsewhere. \u201c[I]f the plaintiff is unsuccessful in challenging the district court\u2019s action, then the dismissal operates as an adjudication on the merits and the litigation is terminated.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, the policy against permitting interlocutory appeals in all but those limited circumstances that are specifically prescribed in the Federal Rules and the Judicial Code is furthered because when \u201cthe appellant voluntarily dismisses his action with prejudice and loses on appeal, the district court is saved the time and effort of conducting extended trial proceedings and there is in addition no possibility of piecemeal appeals.\u201d <footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-13\">The determinative question for the issue here presented, then, is whether the district court\u2019s dismissal of this action was with or without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-14\">B. Dismissal With oe Without Prejudioe?</p>\n<p id=\"b526-15\">Because the district court\u2019s order granting Plaintiffs Motion for Final Judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>ment is silent on the question of prejudice, it is reasonably susceptible to two contradictory readings. On the one hand, the order states that the court is dismissing the action \u201cin accordance with Rule 41(a)(2),\u201d which expressly states that dismissals under that rule are without prejudice \u201c[ujnless otherwise specified in the order.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> On the other hand, the district court\u2019s order purports to engraft a \u201cspecial condition\u201d on the dismissal by granting Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Final Judgment and entering \u201ca final judgment in favor of the defendants.\u201d And, earlier in its order, the district court remarked that Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Final Judgment was \u201cmovfingj for a final judgment <em>with prejudice </em>pursuant to Rule 54(b).\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> As noted previously, though, Plaintiffs\u2019 motion does not state whether the dismissal being sought was to be with or without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">In their reply brief on appeal, Plaintiffs vigorously assert that their motion \u201crequested entry of final judgment, but not with prejudice.\u201d Absent this assertion, we could conceivably interpret the district court\u2019s order either way; and if we were to construe it as a dismissal <em>with </em>prejudice, we.would have appellate jurisdiction and could proceed to resolve Plaintiffs\u2019 challenge to the district court\u2019s denial of their motion for remand.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> But, given (1) Plaintiffs\u2019 most recent insistence that the dismissal at issue was <em>without </em>prejudice and (2) the express language in Rule 41(a)(2) that a dismissal under that rule is <em>without </em>prejudice \u201c[ujnless otherwise specified in the order\u201d (which it is not), we are constrained to conclude that the dismissal was, in fact, <em>without </em>prejudice.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Therefore, the <em>Ryan </em>rule controls our decision, and we must dismiss this appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs\u2019 appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b522-12\">. <em>See McKee v.
