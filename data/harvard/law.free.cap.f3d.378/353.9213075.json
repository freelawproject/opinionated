She contends that the court erred in including a prior state sentence for misdemeanor larceny, which had been imposed by a North Carolina district court, and was being considered de novo by a North Carolina superior court at the time of the federal sentencing. Because execution of the state sentence was stayed pending the trial de novo, the district court erred in attributing two criminal history points to that prior sentence pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>\u00a7 4Al.l(b) (2002); rather, it should have assessed only one criminal history point under \u00a7 4Al.l(e). However, because this error was harmless, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">On December 4, 2002, Martin pleaded guilty in federal court to bank robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) (2000). In calculating its sentencing recommendation for Martin, the Probation Office prepared a presentence report in which it assigned her five criminal history points. Two of these points were attributable to the prior sentence of a North Carolina district court for misdemeanor larceny. In that case, Martin had originally been charged with \u201cFelonious Larceny by an Employee,\u201d but on December 6, 2002, Martin pleaded guilty in a North Carolina district court to misdemeanor larceny and was sentenced to sixty days imprisonment. The record does not disclose whether Martin served any portion of that sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">Within ten days, Martin exercised her statutory right to trial de novo in the state case by filing a timely notice of appeal to a North Carolina superior court. The case was still pending in superior court when the Probation Office prepared its presentence report in Martin\u2019s federal case and remained pending at the time of sentencing. (Approximately a month after sentencing, the State dismissed the misdemeanor larceny charge \u201cwith leave\u201d because Martin failed to appear for the superior court criminal proceeding. Thus, although a basis for her federal sentence, Martin has no conviction or sentence for misdemeanor larceny under North Carolina law.)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">At sentencing in the case at hand, Martin objected to the presentence report, contending that the Probation Office improperly included the sentence attributable to her state misdemeanor larceny conviction in calculating her criminal history category. She argued that the Sentencing Guidelines did not contemplate an \u201cappeal\u201d from a lower trial court to a superior trial court for a trial de novo, and that under North Carolina law, once a defendant exercises her right to a trial de novo, the lower court conviction' becomes a nullity for all purposes. Although the district court found Martin\u2019s argument \u201cinteresting,\u201d it ultimately chose to adopt the calculation recommended in the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">So with five criminal history points, Martin was categorized as a Category III offender, and with an offense level of twenty-two, her applicable guideline range was fifty-one to sixty-three months imprisonment. U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A. The district court imposed a sentence of fifty-two months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">The question before us is whether a prior sentence imposed by a North Carolina district court pending a trial de novo in a North Carolina superior court qualifies as a \u201cprior sentence of imprisonment\u201d under the United States Sentencing Guidelines. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(b). Before turning to that question, we must first understand how the North Carolina criminal trial system operates.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-14\">North Carolina, like many other states, has a \u201ctwo-tier\u201d system of trial courts for some criminal offenses.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>ically, all crimes classified as misdemeanors under North Carolina law are subject to a mandatory two-tier system consisting of district courts (\u201cfirst tier\u201d) and superior courts (\u201csecond tier\u201d). <em>See </em>N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 7A-271, 7A-272(a) (2003). Thus, the State must prosecute all misdemeanors in a state district court in the first instance, and a defendant cannot bypass this district court prosecution. <em>See State v. Martin, </em>97 N.C.App. 19, 387 S.E.2d 211, 213 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">In district court, defendants must either plead guilty or submit to a bench trial. <em>Cf. </em>N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7A-196(b) (\u201c[Tjhere shall be no jury trials in the district court.\u201d). If a defendant is acquitted, all criminal proceedings are terminated. <em>See State v. Harrell, </em>279 N.C. 464, 183 S.E.2d 638, 639-40 (N.C.1971). If, on the other hand, a defendant either pleads guilty or is convicted after a bench trial, she has an absolute right to \u201cappeal\u201d to a superior court and receive a trial de novo with a jury. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1431(b); <em>State v. Sparrow, </em>276 N.C. 499, 173 S.E.2d 897, 902 (1970). A trial de novo in a superior court is the defendant\u2019s <em>only </em>option; North Carolina law provides no avenue for appellate review of the proceedings of a state district court. <em>State v. Golden, </em>40 N.C.App. 37, 251 S.E.2d 875, 877 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">If a defendant chooses to file a \u201cnotice of appeal\u201d with a superior court, the district court conviction is automatically nullified for most purposes. <em>Sparrow, </em>173 S.E.2d at 902 (explaining that a district court judgment is \u201ccompletely annulled\u201d); <em>see also Blackledge v. Perry, </em>417 U.S. 21, 22, 94 S.Ct. 2098, 40 L.Ed.2d 628 (1974) (explaining that under the North Carolina statutory scheme, \u201c[wjhen an appeal is taken, ... the slate is wiped clean; the prior conviction is annulled, and the prosecution and the defense begin anew in the Superior Court\u201d). As for the corresponding sentence, the appeal \u201cstays the execution of portions of the judgment relating to fine and costs ... [and] portions of the judgment relating to confinement when the defendant has complied with conditions of pretrial release.\u201d N.C. GemStat. \u00a7 15A-1431(f). If a defendant withdraws her appeal, a superior court will remand the case to the district court to execute the district court judgment. \u00a7 15A-1431(g), (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">In superior court, the defendant is entitled to a trial de novo, without incurring any prejudice, or even effect, from the district court proceeding. See \u00a7 15A-1431(b); State <em>v. Thompson, </em>2 N.C.App. 508, 163 S.E.2d 410, 412 (1968); <em>cf. State v. Ferrell, </em>75 N.C.App. 156, 330 S.E.2d 225, 226-27 (N.C.Ct.App.1985) (holding that a superior court \u201ccommitted prejudicial error by permitting the State to question the defendant regarding his failure to testify in the district court trial\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). A defendant need not demonstrate error in the district court, nor may a superior court give the judgment of a district court any weight. <em>See Sparrow, </em>173 S.E.2d at 902 (\u201cWhen an appeal of right is taken to the Superior Court, in contemplation of law it is as if the case had been brought there originally and there had been no previous trial.\u201d); <em>see also Blackledge, </em>417 U.S. at 22, 94 S.Ct. 2098. A superior court likewise is in no way bound by the sentence imposed by a district court, and is free to impose what punishment it sees fit. <em>Sparrow, </em>173 S.E.2d at 903. Similarly, the State is not bound by any plea agreement reached in district court and is permitted to pursue the original charges, even if they represent a felony offense. N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 7A-271(b), 15A-1431(b); <em>State v. Fox, </em>34 N.C.App. 576, 239 S.E.2d 471, 473 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">The purpose of the two-tier system is to \u201cprovide [] simple and speedy trials of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>misdemeanor cases in the District Court.\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>312 N.C. 361, 323 S.E.2d 316, 329 (1984). To achieve such efficiency, district courts do not supply the same safeguards available in superior courts. For example, North Carolina district courts do not afford defendants the right to a jury trial, N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 7A-196(b), while all defendants, regardless of the severity of their crimes, are entitled to a twelve-person jury trial in superior court, \u00a7 15A-1201. Moreover, North Carolina district courts do not engage in formal plea colloquies prior to accepting guilty pleas, N.C. Gen.Stat. art. 68, official cmt. (\u201c[I]t is clearly expected the [guilty plea] process should be less formal and not subject to the procedural restrictions placed upon pleas of guilty or no contest in superior court.\u201d); whereas, superior courts must comply with statutorily-mandated procedures to ensure pleas are knowing and voluntary, <em>see </em>\u00a7 15A-1022. And, unlike superior courts, North Carolina district courts are not courts of record and there is no avenue for appellate review of their judgments. <em>Sparrow, </em>173 S.E.2d at 903; <em>see Golden, </em>251 S.E.2d at 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">With this understanding of the two-tiered North Carolina system in mind, the details of which are undisputed, we turn to the sentence at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">Section 4Al.l(b) of the United States Sentencing Guidelines instructs a sentenc- \u2022 ing court to \u201c[a]dd 2 points for each prior sentence of imprisonment of at least sixty days\u201d and not exceeding one year and one month. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(b). Section 4A1.2(a)(l) defines a \u201cprior sentence\u201d as one \u201cpreviously imposed upon adjudication of guilt, whether by guilty plea, trial, or plea of <em>nolo contendere, </em>for conduct not part of the instant offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(l). Section 4A1.2 also directly addresses various dispositions, and specifies when, and if, a sentencing court should include sentences arising from such dispositions in a defendant\u2019s criminal history calculation. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(d), (f)-(j), <em>(l). </em>In a comment to this provision, the Sentencing Commission admonishes that \u201cprior sentences, not otherwise excluded, are to be counted in the criminal history score.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, cmt. background.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">The Guidelines do not specifically address dispositions arising from a two-tier criminal trial system like that employed by North Carolina and other states. Perhaps because of this omission, both the Government and Martin strive to force Martin\u2019s sentence into one of the categories that \u00a7 4A1.2 does expressly address. On the one hand, the Government argues that \u00a7 4A1.2(Z), which provides that \u201c[p]rior sentences under appeal are counted except as expressly provided below,\u201d controls the case at hand. On the other, Martin contends that her sentence is covered under \u00a7 4A1.2, cmt. n. 6, which excludes certain reversed or vacated convictions. Neither of these categories, however, adequately describes the sentence at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">Although North Carolina law refers to the request for a trial de novo in the superior court as an \u201cappeal,\u201d <em>see </em>N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1431, the term \u201cappeal\u201d is a misnomer. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines an \u201cappeal\u201d as a \u201c[r]esort to a superior <em>(ie. </em>appellate) court to review the decision of an inferior <em>(ie. </em>trial) court or administrative agency.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 96 (6th ed.1990). But in \u201cappealing\u201d from the North Carolina district court to superior court, Martin did not seek (and indeed could not seek) review of the district court proceeding or disposition; rather, she requested (and was only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>entitled to request), a trial de novo irrespective of the proceedings or disposition in the \u201cinferior\u201d court. <em>See ante </em>at 356-57. Thus, despite the state nomenclature assigned to the mechanism triggering a new trial (which the Government properly recognizes does not control here), it is clearly not, as the Supreme Court has recognized in similar circumstances, a true \u201cappeal.\u201d <em>See Colten, </em>407 U.S. at 115, 92 S.Ct. 1953 (recognizing that under Kentucky\u2019s two-tier scheme \u201cthe \u2018appeal\u2019 is in reality a trial de novo\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Martin\u2019s contention that her conviction was \u201cvacated,\u201d and thus should be excluded under \u00a7 4A1.2, cmt. n. 6, must also be rejected. As an initial matter, Martin\u2019s conviction was not technically \u201cvacated\u201d as that term is commonly understood. \u201cVacate\u201d means \u201c[t]o render an act void; as, to vacate an entry of record, or a judgment.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1548 (6th ed.1990). And a judgment that is \u201cvoid,\u201d as opposed to one that is merely \u201cvoidable,\u201d \u201cis nugatory and ineffectual so that nothing can cure it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1573. Although Martin\u2019s district court judgment was nullified for most purposes, <em>see ante </em>at 356, it was <em>not \u201cvoid </em>ab initio\u201d as Martin claims. Rather, if Martin had chosen to withdraw her request for a trial de novo, the superior court would have remanded her case to the district court to execute the previously entered judgment. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A-1431(g), (h). Thus, Martin\u2019s conviction was not technically \u201cvoid\u201d or \u201cvacated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Moreover, even if her conviction could roughly be characterized in such a manner, it is nevertheless not the type of vacated conviction warranting exclusion under the Guidelines. The commentary to the Guidelines only excludes convictions vacated \u201cbecause of errors of law or because of subsequently discovered evidence exonerating the defendant,\u201d or those that were \u201cruled constitutionally invalid in a prior case.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, cmt. n. 6. None of these circumstances are present in the case at hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">Although Martin\u2019s state misdemeanor larceny sentence was not \u201cunder appeal\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.2(1), or the result of a \u201cvacated\u201d conviction pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.2, cmt. n. 6, it does fall within one of the other types of dispositions expressly discussed in \u00a7 4A1.2; the \u201cexecution of [Martin\u2019s] sentence was totally ... stayed\u201d under \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">Under North Carolina law, appeal to a North Carolina superior court for a trial de novo <em>\u201cstays </em>the execution of portions of the judgment relating to fine and costs ... [and] stays portions of the judgment relating to confinement when the defendant has complied with conditions of pre-trial release.\u201d N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7 15A-1431(f) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">Of course, whether Martin\u2019s sentence was \u201cstayed\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(3) is a question of federal law. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Stewart, </em>49 F.3d 121, 123 n. 3 (4th Cir.1995). Nonetheless, state law can be informative for the limited purpose of determining the effect of the state court\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Compian-Torres, </em>320 F.3d 514, 516 (5th Cir.2003). And, in this instance, as the Government itself concedes, the state court designation accurately depicts the state of Martin\u2019s sentence during the pendency of her trial de novo in superior court.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">\u201cTo \u2018stay\u2019 an order or decree means to hold it in abeyance, or refrain from enforcing it.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1413 (6th ed.1990). Once a defendant requests a trial de novo in North Carolina superior court, the state district court judgment is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>held in abeyance \u2014 it is not executed, nor is it technically vacated. Rather, as- explained earlier, in the event that Martin chooses to withdraw her request for a trial de novo, the superior court will remand her case to the district court to execute the heretofore \u201cstayed\u201d sentence. N.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 15A~1431(g), (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Because Martin\u2019s misdemeanor larceny conviction in North Carolina district court was one \u201cfor which the ... execution of sentence was totally ... stayed,\u201d it should have been \u201ccounted as a prior sentence under \u00a7 4Al.l(e).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(3). That section, unlike \u00a7 4Al.l(b) (upon which the district court relied to assign Martin two criminal history points), only allots <em>one </em>criminal history point for each prior sentence. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(c). Thus, the district court improperly calculated Martin\u2019s criminal history by assigning Martin five criminal history points rather than four.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nevertheless, this error was harmless; offenders with four or five criminal history points are both classified as Category III offenders, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A., leaving the applicable guideline range unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Although we ultimately uphold the inclusion of Martin\u2019s state misdemeanor larceny sentence in calculating her criminal history, as mandated by the Guidelines, we are cognizant that counting the state sentence at issue here \u2014 a sentence imposed upon an adjudication of guilt in the first tier of a two-tier state system and awaiting a trial de novo in the second tier \u2014 in a defendant\u2019s federal criminal history category could have significant and troubling consequences. Indeed, there are compelling reasons not to count these dispositions at all, or at the very least, to limit their use to circumstances in which the criminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of a defendant\u2019s past criminal history under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">As an initial matter, the adjudication and sentence arising out of the first tier merely constitute an interim disposition in what is, in reality, a bifurcated trial system, and as such, lack any semblance of finality. <em>See, e.g., Justices of Boston Mun. Court v. Lydon, </em>466 U.S. 294, 309, 104 S.Ct. 1805, 80 L.Ed.2d 311 (1984) (agreeing that \u201c[wjhile technically [the defendant] is \u2018tried again,\u2019 the second stage proceeding can be regarded as but an enlarged, fact-sensitive part of a single, continuous course of judicial proceedings ... \u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Moreover, the first-tier proceeding lacks a number of procedural and constitutional safeguards normally afforded to criminal defendants, casting substantial doubt on the reliability of the resulting interim disposition. <em>See ante </em>at 357. Indeed, the Supreme Court has candidly acknowledged that these first-tier \u201cinferior courts are not designed or equipped to conduct error-free trials, or to insure full recognition of constitutional freedoms.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number><em>Colten, </em>407 U.S. at 117, 92 S.Ct. 1953 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Even more troubling, however, basing federal sentences on convictions obtained in first-tier courts that do not afford defendants any right to a jury trial may render two-tier state systems unconstitutional in those instances in which the constitutional right to a jury trial is implicated. Although the Supreme Court has held that the absence of a jury in the first tier, as long as one is eventually provided, does \u201cnot unduly burden[]\u201d a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to a jury trial, in doing so, it presumed that virtually no collateral consequences would result from a judgment rendered in a first-tier court. <em>Ludwig v. Massachusetts, </em>427 U.S. 618, 624-30, 96 S.Ct. 2781, 49 L.Ed.2d 732 (1976); <em>see also Lydon, </em>466 U.S. at 310, 104 S.Ct. 1805 (stating that \u201cvirtually nothing can happen to a defendant at a first-tier trial that he cannot avoid\u201d because\u201c[o]nce the right to a trial de novo is exercised, the judgment at the bench trial is \u2018wiped out\u2019 \u201d); <em>Colten, </em>407 U.S. at 119-20, 92 S.Ct. 1953 (stating that \u201ca defendant can bypass the inferior court simply by pleading guilty and erasing immediately thereafter any consequence that would otherwise follow from tendering the plea\u201d). Mandating inclusion in a defendant\u2019s criminal history of a sentence imposed pursuant to a conviction in the first tier, when the defendant has affirmatively exercised her absolute right to a de novo jury trial in the second tier, would seemingly constitute a significant collateral consequence. Thus, applying the Guidelines as written raises serious questions about the constitutional validity of the two-tier system (in instances where a defendant\u2019s jury trial right is implicated) both in North Carolina and in the many other states employing similar systems.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">Despite these grave, and perhaps unintended, consequences, we believe that the Guidelines\u2019 admonition that \u201c[pjrior sentences, not otherwise excluded, are to be counted in the criminal history score,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, cmt. background, requires the result we reach here. Accordingly, we affirm. But, in doing so, we suggest that the Sentencing Commission carefully consider, in light of the ramifications discussed above, whether, and to what extent, state interim sentences arising out of two-tier criminal trial systems should be included in a defendant\u2019s criminal history category.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b381-8\">. In addition to North Carolina, approximately half of the states appear to employ some type of two-tier system. <em>See Colten v. Kentucky, </em>407 U.S. 104, 112 n. 4, 92 S.Ct. 1953, 32 L.Ed.2d 584 (1972); David A. Harris, <em>Justice Rationed in the Pursuit of Efficiency: De Novo Trials in the Criminal Courts, </em>24 Conn. L.Rev. 381, 382-83 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b385-9\">. We note that the same result could be warranted for another reason; Martin's state misdemeanor larceny sentence may not constitute a \u201cprior sentence of imprisonment\u201d under \u00a7 4Al.l(b). \"To qualify as a sentence of imprisonment, the defendant must have actually served a period of imprisonment on such sentence (or, if the defendant escaped, would have served time).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2, cmt. n. 2. As noted above, we cannot determine from the record whether Martin served any portion of the sixty-day sentence imposed by the North Carolina district court. If, in fact, she did not actually serve at least a portion of that sentence, her misdemeanor larceny sentence would not constitute a \"sentence of imprisonment\u201d under \u00a7 4Al.l(b), and thus could only be accorded one criminal history point as a \"prior sentence not counted in (a) or (b)\u201d under \u00a7 4Al.l(c).

I respectfully decline to join Part IV because, in the circumstances of this case, Martin\u2019s right to a jury trial was not violated. I would therefore not render an advisory opinion as to potential constitutional infirmities in theoretical future cases. Further, I am unwilling to assume, as the court apparently does, that the Sentencing Commission has not already considered what effect should be given to a first-tier state court conviction in a two-tier state system. Given the fact that about half of the States employ such a system, I find it hard to believe that the Commission would have overlooked the matter for fifteen years, particularly when it has considered and provided for even more rare events, e.g., tribal, military, and foreign convictions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
