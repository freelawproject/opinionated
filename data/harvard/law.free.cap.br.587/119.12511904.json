Jones, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This matter comes before the Court on appellant, New Investments Inc.'s (\"New Investments\") appeal from the Bankruptcy Court's final judgment entered on August 26, 2016. Dkts. 1, 17, 18. Appellee, Altanatural Corporation (\"Altanatural\"), filed a brief in opposition, Dkt. 21, and New Investments filed a reply, Dkt. 22.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   New Investments filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and subsequently entered into a purchase agreement with Altanatural for the sale of its main asset-a hotel located in Kirkland, Washington (the \"Property\"). The deed for the sale of the Property did not identify a parking easement (the \"Easement\") granting the use of 14 parking spaces to a neighboring condominium complex. Altanatural did not discover the Easement until after closing. In addition, after closing, New Investment continued to occupy two guest rooms and storage space at the hotel, purportedly without consent from Altanatural.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   New Investments appeals the final judgment of the Bankruptcy Court, arguing that the Bankruptcy Court erred in: (1) calculating damages due to the easement; (2) justifying suspension of performance; (3) interpreting the promissory note and applying the equitable doctrine of recoupment; and (4) applying the waiver/estoppel defense with respect to New Investments' occupation of various guest rooms and storage space.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court affirms the Bankruptcy Court's decision. First, after concluding that there was a reasonable certainty as to the fact of damages, the Bankruptcy Court set the damages due to the Easement at $350,000, which was within the range of admissible evidence. Second, because New Investments' actions constituted a material breach, Altanatural was justified in suspending interest payments under the Promissory Note. Third, Altanatural was entitled to recoup the judgment against the principal balance of the Promissory Note, as the language waiving offset did not include claims that fell within the equitable remedy of recoupment. And finally,\n   the Bankruptcy Court properly rejected New Investments waiver and estoppel defenses, and correctly found that New Investments did not have a right to occupy the hotel property after November 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   For the most part, New Investments has not challenged on appeal the Bankruptcy Court's findings, so the Court draws the factual recitation from the Bankruptcy Court's findings of facts and conclusions of law entered on May 6, 2016 and oral ruling entered on August 18, 2016. Dkt. 18, DR 32 (findings of fact and conclusion of law); DR 44 (oral ruling). On February 4, 2013, New Investments filed a voluntary petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Bankruptcy Case No. 13-bk-10948, Dkt. 1 at 1. New Investments' primary asset was real property including a hotel and restaurant, located at 12233 Totem Lake Way, Kirkland, Washington 98034 (the \"Property\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On September 12, 2013, New Investments and Altanatural entered into Purchase and Sale Agreement and three separate addendums (the \"PSA\"), in which Altanatural agreed to purchase the Property from New Investments for $6,325,228.00. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF No. 1. Altanatural paid $3,000,000 of the purchase price as a down payment, and the remaining $3,325,228.00 in a promissory note (the \"Promissory Note\") executed in favor of New Investments, which was secured by a deed of trust against the Property. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF No. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The PSA required New Investments to: (1) deliver a Special Warranty Deed (\"Special Warranty Deed\") to Altanatural conveying the Property with only those encumbrances permitted by the Special Warranty Deed and (2) deliver quiet possession of the Property and clear, marketable title at closing. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF Nos. 2, 3. The parties closed the sale on October 4, 2013 and the PSA was incorporated into New Investments' Second Amended Plan of Reorganization. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF No. 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Special Warranty Deed did not identify a parking easement (the \"Easement\") that New Investments had granted to a neighboring condominium complex, Chelsea Court II, LLC. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF No. 6. The Easement granted exclusive use of 14 parking spots on the Property. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF Nos. 6-7. In the spring of 2014, Altanatural learned of the Easement. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF No. 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties agreed that New Investments' President, Shabnam Aziz, would train and assist Altanatural following the closing, and that she could occupy guest room 227 at the Property. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF No. 4. Altanatural did not give express consent for New Investments to occupy any other rooms.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Following the closing, New Investments and members of the Aziz family that owned New Investments continued to occupy ten storage rooms and guest rooms 153, 154, 227 and 228 at the Property. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF No. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For several months until November 2014, the parties worked to resolve these issues. During this time, Dr. William Xiong, Executive Vice President of Altanatural, agreed to New Investments' use of the occupied storage rooms, offices, and guest rooms. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF No. 9. On November 13, 2014, Altanatural delivered a letter to New Investments and its counsel, demanding that New Investments pay for its use of the rooms, honor its warranties of title and indemnify Altanatural or otherwise have the Easement removed as encumbrance. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF No. 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After New Investments failed to address the defaults, Altanatural suspended\n   its payments under the Promissory Note and withheld interest payments for November and December and the December 31, 2014 balloon payment. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF No. 11. Until that point Altanatural had made monthly interest payments on the Promissory Note, totaling over $180,000. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF No. 8. The parties negotiated a settlement for several months, and in March 2015 reached an agreement (the \"Settlement Agreement\") on the material terms of a resolution: a balloon payment of $2,990,000.00 (reduced from $3,325,228.00) from Altanatural to New Investments; allocation of the payment in a manner proposed by New Investments; and a right for New Investments to use the hotel rooms on the Property through December 31, 2015. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF No. 17. However, the Bankruptcy Court determined that the Settlement Agreement was not enforceable, and therefore it was not approved. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF No. 18; DR 44 at 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Between November 2014 and December 2015, storage rooms 1-7, 9, and 10 contained items that were associated with the hotel and/or were not occupied. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF No. 18. Storage room 8 was occupied for 377 days and contained non-hotel items. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF No. 19. Guest rooms 153, 154, and 156 were not occupied, and it is unclear whether the two offices were occupied in a manner that would preclude use by Altanatural.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   From November 2014 to October 2015, Shabnam Aziz occupied guest room 288, and her parents, Sheraly Aziz and Zeri Aziz, occupied guest room 227. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF No. 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 23, 2015, Altanatural filed an adversary proceeding against New Investments. Adversary Case No. 15-ap-01188, Dkt. 1. On August 20, 2015, Altanatural moved for partial summary judgment, claiming a breach of warranty on the Special Warranty Deed and the PSA. Dkt. 18, DR 2. On October 8, 2015, the Bankruptcy Court held oral arguments on Altanatural's motion for partial summary judgment. Dkt. 18, DR 41. On November 12, 2015, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order granting Altanatural's motion in part, leaving the issue of damages for trial. Dkt. 18, DR 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Trial was held on March 10 and 11, 2016. Dkt. 18, DR 42. On May 6, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law following trial. Dkt. 18, DR 32. On July 21, 2016 the Bankruptcy Court held a subsequent hearing to set the judgment amount and the parties submitted additional briefing. Dkt. 18, DR 43. On August 18, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court made an oral ruling that it incorporated into its findings of fact and conclusions of law. Dkt. 18, DR 44. The Bankruptcy Court then entered a judgment against New Investments in the principal amount of $415,848.00 that would be recouped against the remaining payments due under the Promissory Note. Dkt. 18, DR 44 at 21. The Bankruptcy Court stayed enforcement of the judgment pending the appeal, but set aside $230,000 to pay the judgment and any fees and costs that Altanatural accrued. Dkt. 18, DR 49.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   New Investments promptly appealed.

Calculation of Damages due to Easement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   First, New Investments contends that the Bankruptcy Court erred in determining the amount of damages sustained due to the breach of warranty under the Special Warranty Deed. Dkt. 17 at 16-17. The parties agree that this issue is a mixed question of law and fact, and that the Bankruptcy Court's finding of fact 31 that the value of the Property was diminished by $350,000 should be reviewed based on clear error and conclusion of law 12 that the damages calculation was the cost of building under unit parking spots should be reviewed\n   <em>\n    de novo. See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 17 at 6, Dkt. 21 at 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The crux of New Investments' attack on appeal is that Altanatural failed to establish damages with \"reasonable certainty,\" Dkt. 17 at 11-20, but this standard focuses more on determining the\n   <em>\n    fact\n   </em>\n   of damages, rather than fixing the amount of damages within a mathematical certainty. The Washington Supreme Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   There is a clear distinction between the measure of proof necessary to establish the fact that the plaintiff has sustained some damage and the measure of proof necessary to enable the jury to fix an amount. Formerly, the tendency was to restrict the recovery to such matters as were susceptible of having attached to them an exact pecuniary value, but it is now generally held that the uncertainty that prevents a recovery is\n   <em>\n    uncertainty as to the fact of the damage and not as to its amount and that where it is certain that damage has resulted the mere uncertainty as to the amount will not preclude the right of recovery.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Gaasland Co., Inc. v.

Dkt. 17, 21. In determining the amount of damages, the Bankruptcy Court adopted the testimony of Mark Lukens, a hotel appraiser, and found that the fair market value of the Property was diminished by $350,000 due to the Easement. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF No. 31, CL No. 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   New Investments argues that Mr. Lukens' testimony that it would cost approximately $350,000 to build 14 under unit parking spaces was not based on tangible evidence. Dkt. 17 at 18-20. Altanatural contends that the damage award was within the range of damages testified by Mr. Lukens and Shabnam Aziz, New Investments' officer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dkt. 21 at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Mr. Lukens was qualified as an expert witness in the field of property appraisals, specializing in hospitality appraisals such as hotels, and was qualified to provide his opinion on the diminution of value caused by the Easement. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF No. 25. Mr. Lukens testified that the diminution in value to the Property was $775,000 based on the loss of 14 parking spots. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF No. 26, 30. This amount was calculated by considering the addition of 20 hotel units to the Property, which was the highest and best use of the Property and was also consistent with what both New Investments and Altanatural had intended for the Property. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF No. 26 (the land on which the Property sits is larger than required for the Property's current size). Mr. Lukens testified that because of the Easement, adding 20 units to the Property would effectively leave the Property 14 parking spaces short. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF No. 27-30. However, he testified that those spaces could be incorporated into the construction of the additional 20 units through under unit parking, and that it would cost approximately $25,000 to $30,000 build each under unit parking space. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF Nos. 27-31; DR 42 at 228. Mr. Lukens was qualified to testify as to the diminution of value of the Property, and also noted that he consulted several contractors about under unit parking in the area.

DR 32 at CL No. 13; Dkt. 18, DR 44 at 12-14. New Investments argues that the Bankruptcy Court misapplied the election of remedies doctrine, and that once Altanatural elected to suspend its performance it should have been barred from also receiving damages because suspension and damages are inconsistent, and Altanatural received a windfall. Dkt. 17 at 20-21. New Investments does not challenge any of the underlying findings of fact, and solely challenges conclusion of law 13, wherein the Bankruptcy Court held that Altanatural was legally justified in suspending payments under the Promissory Note because of New Investments' breach. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at CL No. 13. Altanatural contends that the Bankruptcy Court correctly relied on Washington contract law and case law from other federal circuit courts in finding that Altanatural was legally justified in suspending payments under the Promissory Note. Dkt. 21 at 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   New Investments correctly argues that Altanatural could choose between continuing performance and ceasing performance.

Thus, it follows that Altanatural could not cease performance under the contract but still retain benefits they received, but had not paid for; otherwise, the breach would work as an inequitable windfall for Altanatural. However, when the Bankruptcy Court found that New Investments' breach was material it did not excuse Altanatural's obligations under the PSA and Special Warranty Deed. Nor did Altanatural elect to terminate the PSA or Special Warranty Deed. Rather, the court found the accrual of interest on the Promissory Note was suspended until New Investment cured its material breaches.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 18, DR 32 at CL No. 13; DR 44 at 12-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Neither Washington case law nor the Restatement (Second) (hereinafter \"Restatement\") on Contracts provide specific guidance as to the suspension of interest payments during a material breach.

Given this, the Bankruptcy Court did not err in determining that the term \"offset\" did not include recoupment as defined under the Bankruptcy Code.

Jan. 4, 1996) for the proposition that \"recoupment\" falls within the meaning of \"any right of offset\" which was prohibited under the Promissory Note. Dkt. 17 at 27-28. However,\n   <em>\n    Braunstein\n   </em>\n   does not support New Investments' argument. In\n   <em>\n    Braunstein,\n   </em>\n   the debtor and Rockwell had a reciprocal relationship-Rockwell provided raw steel to the debtor, and the debtor paid Rockwell; and the debtor in turn forged steel for Rockwell, and Rockwell paid the debtor.\n   <em>\n    Braunstein,\n   </em>\n   1996 Bank. LEXIS 105 at *6. Rockwell's provision of steel to the debtor was governed by an agreement stating: \"Rockwell's purchases of articles produced from the steel from [debtor] are to be made under terms and conditions separately agreed by the parties which shall be independent of this Agreement\n   <em>\n    and without any right of setoff.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Id. at *\n   </em>\n   7 (emphasis original). The court interpreted this provision as a waiver not only of the debtor's right to setoff but also of Rockwell, and that Rockwell therefore could not have satisfied the debt at issue by setoff.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8. The court also found that recoupment did not apply to the reciprocal obligations between the debtor and Rockwell, because the parties structured their contracts as separate and distinct, therefore, recoupment did not apply.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In the instant case, however, the PSA, Promissory Note, and Special Warranty deed were all a part of the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   transaction which was approved by the Bankruptcy Court. Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF No. 1-3. Thus, the Bankruptcy Court appropriately applied the recoupment remedy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Newbery,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7647793,6459237\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/95/1392/\">\n    95 F.3d at 1398-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation omitted). Therefore, the Court concludes that the Bankruptcy Court did not err in finding that section 10 of the Promissory Note only waived the right to setoff or offset, and did not waive the right to recoupment.

Dkt. 18, DR 32 at FF Nos. 19-20; CL Nos. 7-8. Based on the testimony of Dr. Xiong, the court found that the cost of renting equivalent offsite storage approximated at $10 per day per storage room.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7647793,6459237\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/95/1392/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at FF No. 23.
