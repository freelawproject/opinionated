(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AP Doc. 1.) The plaintiff (and debtor in a related chapter 11 bankruptcy case) opposes the Motion (AP Doc. 29) (the \"Response\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and seeks to enforce two other \"jurisdiction\" clauses in the certificate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons set forth herein, the Motion is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FINDINGS OF FACT AND STIPULATIONS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Bankruptcy Filing\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff Veros Energy, LLC (\"Veros\") is a limited liability company organized under the laws of the state of Kansas. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BK\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doc. 8; BK Doc. 258 at 4.) Veros previously operated a biodiesel fuel plant (the \"Plant\") in Moundville, Alabama, its principal place of business. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BK Doc. 60 at 8; BK Doc. 258 at 4.) Veros leased the real property, fixtures, and improvements comprising the Plant from the two Kansas entities that own and manage Veros-Allam Alternative Energy, LLC and Lies Energy, LLC (together, the \"Owners\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BK Doc. 10; BK Doc. 59 at 38; BK Doc. 60 at 6, 11; BK Doc. 60, Ex. SOFA 14; BK Doc. 190, Ex. 1 at 7; BK Doc. 190, Ex. 2 at 3; BK Doc. 258 at 4-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On March 26, 2015, a boiler at the Plant exploded. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BK Doc. 36; BK Doc. 60 at 4; BK Doc. 60, Ex. SOFA 8; AP Doc. 48 at 2.) Following the explosion, Veros ceased production at the Plant. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BK Doc. 12 at 2; BK Doc. 13 at 2; BK Doc. 14 at 2; BK Doc. 60 at 10; BK Doc. 83,\n   <em>\n    passim\n   </em>\n   ; BK Doc. 190 at 3.) Shortly thereafter (on April 6th) Veros filed a petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   with this court (BK Doc. 1) (the \"Petition\"), commencing case number 15-70470 (the \"Bankruptcy Case\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the time of the explosion, Veros was insured by Lloyd's of London (\"Lloyd's\") surplus line insurance coverage (the \"Insurance\") effected through defendant GCube Insurance Services, Inc. (\"GCube\") on behalf of members of a Lloyd's syndicate (collectively, the \"Underwriters\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BK Doc. 70 at 1-2; BK Doc. 70, Ex. A; BK Doc. 91,\n   <em>\n    passim\n   </em>\n   ; AP Doc. 1, Ex. 1; AP Doc. 38; AP Doc. 48 at 2.) The certificate of insurance executed by GCube on June 5, 2004 (AP Doc. 1, Ex. 1) (the \"Certificate\") provided for an initial coverage term of May 22, 2014 to May 21, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Certificate at 2.) A few weeks after the Petition date, GCube notified Veros that the Insurance would not be renewed as a consequence of Veros's bankruptcy filing. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BK Doc. 70, Ex. B.) The nonrenewal notice purported to cancel the Insurance effective as of May 21, 2015-24 days after the date of the nonrenewal notice. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On Veros's motion (BK Doc. 70),\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and after notice and a hearing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court entered an order determining that the Insurance was effective until at least the 60th day after the date of the nonrenewal notice (as a matter of applicable state law) and that GCube's attempted, earlier cancellation violated the automatic stay imposed by the Bankruptcy Code. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BK Doc. 91.) GCube issued a second, post-Petition, nonrenewal notice that provided for a July 20, 2015 cancellation date, and, on May 27, 2018, Veros wired GCube the sum of $13,566.00 for the unpaid premium due.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (BK Doc. 91; BK Doc. 108, Bank Statement at 1;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   AP Doc. 48 at 2-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A little less than two months after the Insurance expired, Veros filed a motion to sell substantially all of its assets, which the court granted, in part. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BK Docs. 190, 258, 261, 262.) Simultaneous with Veros's closing of the court-approved sale (the \"Sale\"), the Owners consummated a sale of the Plant to the purchaser of Veros's assets. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BK Doc. 296.) Several months after the Sale closing, Veros proposed a chapter 11 plan of liquidation (BK Doc. 451) (the \"Plan\") to administer the remaining assets of its bankruptcy estate (the \"Estate\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plan,\n   <em>\n    passim\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the court-approved disclosure statement for the Plan (BK Doc. 450) (the \"Disclosure Statement\"), Veros disclosed that it had made demand on GCube for payment of property damage and business interruption claims under the Insurance contract and that Veros intended to \"assert contractual liability and potential tort liability ... should such claims not be paid....\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Disclosure Statement at 11-12.) The Disclosure Statement specified that Veros planned to bring an adversary proceeding before this court if it was unable to settle its Insurance claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Disclosure Statement at 11.) The Disclosure Statement estimated the value of the Insurance claims at more than $11.8 million, while explaining to creditors that any recovery thereon was uncertain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   No creditor or other party in interest objected to confirmation of the Plan, and the court entered an order confirming the Plan with certain modifications agreed to by Veros, the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors, and the Office of the Bankruptcy Administrator (the \"Confirmation Order\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BK Doc. 494.) GCube received notice of the hearing to consider the Sale, the Disclosure Statement, the hearing to consider approval of the Disclosure Statement, the Plan, the hearing to consider confirmation of the Plan, and the order confirming the Plan. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BK Docs. 197, 397, 416, 455, 495.) To date, GCube has not appeared in the Bankruptcy Case. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BK docket,\n   <em>\n    passim\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The Post-Confirmation Estate\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Plan provides for the Estate to continue in existence post-confirmation, stating: \"Given that [Veros's] assets are being liquidated and [Veros] will ultimately be dissolved, assets will not re-vest in a reorganized debtor, and [Veros's] assets will remain in the Estate and not re-vest upon confirmation.\" (Plan \u00a7 6.6.) The Plan further provides: \"[a]ny settlement or compromise of claims or sales of Estate assets shall require Court approval pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 9019\"; \"[a]ny of [Veros's] rights or cause[s] of action against any party ... shall remain assets of the ... Estate\"; and \"[t]he Court shall retain jurisdiction of this case ... [t]o enforce all causes of action which may exist on behalf of [Veros]\" and \"[t]o approve compromises and settlements of any claims or controversies ... and to oversee the orderly liquidation of the Estate.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7\u00a7 6.6, 6.8, 7.6, 7.8.) \"Court\" is defined in the Plan as \"the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Alabama, Western Division, presiding over reorganization cases\" (i.e., this court) \"or if necessary the United States District Court for said district having original jurisdiction over said reorganization cases\" (the \"District Court\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 1.10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Plan is a \"self-liquidating\" plan in that Veros, which is controlled by the Owners (not a trust or committee), is tasked with liquidating the Estate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plan,\n   <em>\n    passim\n   </em>\n   ; Confirmation Order at 5.) The Plan appoints a post-confirmation committee (comprised of the members of\n   the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors in the Bankruptcy Case) \"to monitor pending contested matters, adversary proceedings, litigation and to help ensure the orderly liquidation of the Estate, as well as to review proposed settlements, assets sales, and to otherwise aid [Veros] in liquidation\" (the \"Committee\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plan \u00a7 6.4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Other than certain blender's tax credits, which are disputed by the Internal Revenue Service, the Insurance claims are the only known Estate assets that Veros has not liquidated. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Disclosure Statement,\n   <em>\n    passim\n   </em>\n   ; Plan,\n   <em>\n    passim\n   </em>\n   ; Post-Confirmation Operating Reports,\n   <em>\n    passim\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   BK Doc. 514; Doc. 610.) To date, holders of (pre-confirmation) allowed priority unsecured claims have been paid in full per the terms of the Plan. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plan Arts. II-IV; Disclosure Statement at 15-19; BK Doc. 517, Reconcile Session Reports; BK Doc. 524, Bank Reconciliations; BK Doc. 554; BK Doc. 558; BK Doc. 571, Bank Reconciliations;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Post-Confirmation Operating Reports,\n   <em>\n    passim\n   </em>\n   .) Additionally, excepting the Owners, each holder of an allowed nonpriority unsecured claim (each, a \"General Unsecured Claim\") has been paid fifty percent of the total allowed amount of its General Unsecured Claim (the \"50% Distribution\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plan Art. IV; Disclosure Statement at 19-28; BK Doc. 524, Bank Reconciliations; BK Doc. 571, Bank Reconciliations;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Post-Confirmation Operating Reports,\n   <em>\n    passim\n   </em>\n   .) The unpaid balance of the (non-Owner) General Unsecured Claims totals less than $1.35 million. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Disclosure Statement at 19-28; BK Doc. 294; BK Doc. 524, Bank Reconciliations; BK Doc. 554; BK Doc. 558; BK Doc. 571, Bank Reconciliations;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Post-Confirmation Operating Reports,\n   <em>\n    passim\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Owners hold General Unsecured Claims totaling more than $16 million in the aggregate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Disclosure Statement at 27-28; BK Doc. 59 at 19, 26.) The Plan subordinates the Owners' General Unsecured Claims to the 50% Distribution. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plan Art. IV.) After the 50% Distribution is achieved, the Owners are entitled to share, pro rata, in additional disbursements to holders of General Unsecured Claims under the Plan. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ; Disclosure Statement at 8-9, 27-28.) Based on the size of their General Unsecured Claims, the Owners will receive more than 92% percent of each additional disbursement to holders of General Unsecured Claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Disclosure Statement at 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Veros's bankruptcy counsel and the Committee's counsel are retained on an hourly fee basis. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BK Doc. 18 at 3, 5; BK Doc. 18, Ex. A at 4; BK Doc. 86 at 4; BK Doc. 104; BK Doc. 147.) Veros's counsel in the AP is retained on a contingency fee basis. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BK Doc. 413 at 1-2;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 413, Ex. A; BK Doc. 478.) All professional fees paid from the Estate are subject to review and approval by the court under a reasonableness standard. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BK Docs. 104, 147, 478;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Plan Art. III.) To date, the court has approved (and the Estate has paid) post-confirmation professional fees and expenses totaling more than $29,500.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BK Docs. 569, 570, 587, 600.) As of the date of the last Post-Confirmation Operating Report, Veros's remaining cash on hand totaled only $5,882.50.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (BK Doc. 615 at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     The AP\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Approximately two months after Plan confirmation, Veros filed the AP, formally alleging its Insurance claims (collectively, the \"Claims\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   against GCube and Kiln Syndicate 510 (\"Kiln\"), the lead Underwriter. In lieu of answering, GCube and Kiln, appearing individually and on behalf the Underwriters,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed the Motion, seeking dismissal of the AP or transfer of the AP to the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the \"SDNY\"). Simultaneously, the Underwriters moved to withdraw the reference of the AP (AP Doc. 15) (the \"Motion to Withdraw\"). The Motion to Withdraw is pending before the District Court and, as of the date hereof, the District Court has not ruled on the Motion to Withdraw. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   District Court Case No. 7:17-MC-00102-MHH.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The court declined to stay proceedings on the Venue Filings pending adjudication of the Motion to Withdraw and held a final, evidentiary hearing on the Motion (the \"Evidentiary Hearing\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AP Doc. 35.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court also held non-evidentiary hearings on the Motion, both before and after the Evidentiary Hearing (collectively with the Evidentiary Hearing, the \"Hearings\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Pursuant to the scheduling order for the Evidentiary Hearing (AP Doc. 35) (the \"Scheduling Order\"), the parties filed a joint report to the court concerning the contract evidencing the Insurance (AP Doc. 38) (the \"Insurance Report\"), as well as a joint stipulation of undisputed facts and conclusions of law for purposes of proceedings on the Motion (AP Doc. 48) (the \"Joint Stipulations\"). Additional oral stipulations were made on the records of the Hearings (collectively, the \"Oral Stipulations,\" and each an \"Oral Stipulation\"), and, without objection and pursuant to a further order, the Underwriters filed additional stipulations following the conclusion of the Evidentiary Hearing (the \"Undue Prejudice Stipulation\"). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AP Docs. 65, 67.) The parties agreed that the Joint Stipulations and the Oral Stipulations were made for purposes of the Hearings only and shall not be deemed admissions for any reason other than proceedings on the Venue Filings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Stipulations at 1; Oral Stipulations.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The following exhibits were admitted on the record of the Evidentiary Hearing, without objection: movants' exhibit 1, the court's order regarding GCube's nonrenewal notice (BK Doc. 91); movants' exhibit 2, the Plan; movants' exhibit 3 (and respondent's exhibit 8), the Certificate; movants' exhibit 4, a demonstrative exhibit related to certain legal arguments made by the movants; respondent's exhibit 1, the declaration of B.R. McNaughton (pertaining to the convenience of the parties and\n   witnesses); and all other documents and pleadings of record in the Bankruptcy Case. No party called a witness to testify at the Evidentiary Hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     The Insurance Contract\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The parties report to the court that the Certificate \"is a complete copy of the subject insurance policy, including its declaration page, certificate of insurance, terms and conditions, and all endorsements.\" (Insurance Report at 1.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties also stipulate that the Certificate is a GCube/Lloyd's contract and that Veros did not draft the Certificate. (Oral Stipulation.) There is no dispute that Veros has paid all Insurance premiums due under the Certificate. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Joint Stipulations at 3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the Motion the Underwriters seek to enforce a \"jurisdiction\" clause that appears on page six of the Certificate, under \"Project 1\" in the subsection titled \"Choice Of Law &amp; Jurisdiction.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion,\n   <em>\n    passim\n   </em>\n   ; Certificate at 6.) The provision states that \"[a]ny disputes between the Insured and Underwriters arising under or in connection with this Insurance policy shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York.\" (Certificate at 6.) This clause is referred to herein as the \"Jurisdiction Clause.\" The parties stipulate that the territory's courts selected by the Jurisdiction Clause are the New York state courts, not the federal courts situated in New York. (Joint Stipulations at 2.) The \"Choice Of Law &amp; Jurisdiction\" section also states that \"[t]he proper and exclusive law of this Insurance shall be the laws of the State of New York\" (the \"Choice of Law Clause\"). (Certificate at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In the Response Veros relies on two other \"jurisdiction\" provisions in the Certificate. The first, appears on page eight of the Certificate, under \"Certificate Provisions\" in the subsection titled \"Service of Suit\" (the \"First Service of Suit Clause\"), and reads, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   It is agreed that in the event of the failure of Underwriters to pay any amount claimed to be due hereunder, Underwriters, at the request of the Assured, will submit to the jurisdiction of a Court of competent jurisdiction within the United States. Nothing in this Clause constitutes or should be understood to constitute a waiver of Underwriters' rights to commence an action in any Court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, to remove an action to a United States District Court, or to seek a transfer of a case to another Court as permitted by the laws of the United States or of any State in the United States. It is further agreed that ... in any suit instituted against any one of them upon this contract, Underwriters will abide by the final decision of such Court or of any Appellate Court in the event of an appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (Certificate at 8.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The remainder of the First Service of Suit Clause pertains to serving process on the Underwriters and makes provision for statutes, like the Alabama Surplus Line Insurance Law, that require unauthorized insurers to provide notice of the statutory appointment of the chief executive officer of the state's insurance department as the insurers' agent for service of process in actions filed in the state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The second \"jurisdiction\" provision cited by Veros appears on page 17 of the Certificate, under the \"General Conditions Applicable to All Sections of Coverage Under This Policy\" (collectively, the \"General Conditions\") in the subsection titled \"Service of Suit Clause (applicable to USA domiciled Insured's only)\" (the \"Second Service of Suit Clause,\" and together with the First Service of Suit Clause, the \"Service of Suit Clauses\"). The Second Service of Suit Clause is virtually identical to the First Service of Suit Clause, with the only potentially relevant distinction being that the Second Service of Suit Clause refers to the \"Insured\" not the \"Assured.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   There is one priority of provision clause in the Certificate (the \"Priority of Provision Clause\"), appearing in the General Conditions in the subsection titled \"Conflict of Wordings.\" (Certificate,\n   <em>\n    passim\n   </em>\n   .) The Priority of Provision Clause reads: \"The conditions contained in the Policy Schedule or in endorsements to the Policy to which this wording is attached shall supersede those of this wording, wherever the same may conflict.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Though GCube is identified in the Certificate as the \"Coverholder\" and the \"Correspondent,\" and is not listed as an Underwriter in the \"Schedule of Underwriters\" appearing on page 28 of the Certificate, the parties stipulate that GCube is an Underwriter, as that term is used in the Jurisdiction Clause and the Service of Suit Clauses. (Oral Stipulation;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Certificate at 28-29.) Likewise, the parties stipulate that Veros is an \"Assured\" within the meaning of the First Service of Suit Clause. (Oral Stipulation.) The Certificate unambiguously identifies Veros as the \"Insured\"-the term used in the Second Service of Suit Clause. (Certificate at 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Other Pertinent Stipulations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   In light of the parties' stipulation that the Jurisdiction Clause selects the New York state courts only, the Underwriters acknowledged that dismissal under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   , not transfer of venue under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), is the appropriate mechanism for compelling compliance with the Jurisdiction Clause.

(considering competing private interests of the parties, \"giving due regard to [both] forum selection clauses,\" and analyzing public interest factors to determine whether transfer under \u00a7 1404(a) would be appropriate). Of course, if considered in isolation, the subject clauses dictate the same result, the court need not reach this issue. Here, however, application of a particular\n   venue provision is outcome determinative, and the court cannot give near determinative weight to the Jurisdiction Clause without nullifying the Service of Suit Clauses (and vice versa).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Considering the competing venue provisions in the Certificate, and the procedural posture of the litigation, the court holds that the\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   analysis is altered by the forum selection clauses, but not to the extent set forth in\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   . The court will give effect to Veros's private interest waiver, but the court will not completely disregard Veros's chosen forum (and require Veros to show why enforcement of the Jurisdiction Clause is unwarranted) as the Service of Suit Clauses at least permit litigation in this forum given the procedural posture of the Claims. Under this analytical framework, and because the public interest factors weigh against dismissal, the Motion is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Moreover, the court concludes that, as a matter of contract interpretation, litigation of the Claims in an Alabama federal forum is permitted by the Certificate. The \"jurisdiction\" clauses in the Certificate are inconsistent and susceptible to more than one reasonable interpretation. Resolving the uncertainty by adopting the reasonable interpretation that most favors the insured (Veros), the Service of Suit Clauses preserved to the Underwriters only two means of enforcing the Jurisdiction Clause-transfer (provided transfer to the state court forum is procedurally available) and commencement of a suit in New York state court. As the AP cannot be transferred to New York state court, and the Underwriters have not commenced an action in New York state court nor sought relief from stay in the Bankruptcy Case to file an action in New York, dismissal is neither necessary nor appropriate under the terms of the Certificate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Service of Suit Clauses are properly characterized as forum selection clauses\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   \"[C]ourts frequently classify forum selection clauses as either permissive or mandatory.\"\n   <em>\n    Global Satellite Commc'n Co. v.

Following the latter approach, the court will undertake to fashion a\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   analysis that takes into account the parties' respective venue consents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In the AP each party is as much a party denying enforcement of a forum selection clause as it is a party seeking to enforce a forum selection clause. While Veros broadly waived its right to raise private interest factors in opposition to the Motion (via the Jurisdiction Clause), the court cannot (and should not) ignore that the Underwriters likewise waived their right to raise private interest factors in support of the Motion (via the Service of Suit Clauses). Accordingly, the court will disregard any private interest factors in its analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The court will not, however, relieve the movants of their burden to show that the\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   analysis is otherwise satisfied. The Underwriters consented to litigate in Veros's chosen forum and did not reserve the right to dismiss the AP. Veros should not be required to show unusual circumstances to litigate in a consensual venue. Likewise, had the Underwriters commenced their own suit in New York state court, they should not be required to show unusual circumstances to continue in that forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Turning to the question of whether, disregarding private interest factors, the Underwriters have met their burden, the court concludes they have not. There is no dispute that the state courts of New York are an adequate and available forum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tazoe v.

The Underwriters fail to show, however, that the public interest factors weigh in favor of dismissal. Although the Underwriters summarily allege that \"all public interest factors ... weigh in favor\" of litigating in a New York forum, the only public interest factor that the Underwriters specifically identify is familiarity of the forum with the law that will govern the case. Veros counters that this is a local controversy and has no nexus to New York and also points to the public interests implicated by the Bankruptcy Case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The factual findings and stipulations set forth above support Veros's assertion that Alabama has a local interest in the case and that, but for the Jurisdiction and Choice of Law Clauses, the litigation is entirely unrelated to New York. Although, to date, no party has demanded a jury trial in the AP, the Underwriters have alluded\n   to the possibility of a jury demand on the records of the Hearings. The Supreme Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   Administrative difficulties follow for courts when litigation is piled up in congested centers instead of being handled at its origin. Jury duty is a burden that ought not to be imposed upon the people of a community which has no relation to the litigation. In cases which touch the affairs of many persons, there is reason for holding the trial in their view and reach rather than in remote parts of the country where they can learn of it by report only. There is a local interest in having localized controversies decided at home.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <em>\n    Gulf Oil Corp. v.

Given the Plant explosion and subsequent shut down, Alabama residents have a compelling interest in having the Claims litigated in this state, particularly if the Underwriters intend to demand a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Veros's bankruptcy filing also implicates public interest factors favoring an Alabama federal forum. The Claims are property of the Estate and are being liquidated for the benefit of creditors. The Owners will not receive any distribution in respect of their\n   <em>\n    equity\n   </em>\n   interests unless and until holders of General Unsecured Claims receive 100 percent of the total allowed amount of such claims (which appears highly unlikely given that the alleged value of the Claims and other Estate assets total less than the allowed amount of the Owners' General Unsecured Claims). Although it is notable that the Owners' General Unsecured Claims were only subordinated to other General Unsecured Claims until the 50% Distribution was achieved (and also that the Owners will be entitled to receive a significant portion of any further Plan disbursements to holders of General Unsecured Claims), this does not diminish the interests of Veros's other creditors in seeing the value of the Claims maximized. Indeed maximizing the value of the Claims is of prime significance to the non-insider holders of General Unsecured Claims, given their fractional disbursements. Based on the Plan and Disclosure statement-neither of which were objected to by GCube-Veros's non-insider creditors had a reasonable expectation that the Claims would be litigated in an Alabama federal forum. The Estate has very limited funds on hand. If Veros is required to litigate in New York, the Post-Confirmation Committee (effectively) will be deprived of the opportunity to perform its duties under the Plan. Irrespective of whether such factors render the Jurisdiction Clause unenforceable as a matter of federal public policy, they are appropriately considered as public interest factors that weigh against dismissal in a federal\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   analysis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bavaria Yachts USA, LLLP v.

N.D. Ga. 2017) (Sacca, J.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Ultimately, the sole public interest factor cited by GCube in support of the Motion-the familiarity of the New York courts with New York law-is outweighed by the above-outlined public interest factors. Federal bankruptcy courts and district courts routinely interpret and apply state law. The parties have not suggested that the Claims involve novel state law issues. Since the court concludes that the Underwriters bear the burden of showing that dismissal is in the interests of justice, and the public interest factors weigh against dismissal, the Motion is due to be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     As a matter of contract interpretation, the Certificate forecloses dismissal of the AP as a means to enforce the Jurisdiction Clause in its present procedural posture.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Employing contract interpretation analysis does not change the result. As the above discussion highlights, the Service of Suit Clauses and the Jurisdiction Clause conflict.

However, the court disagrees with the Underwriters that dismissal is an available mechanism for enforcement of the Jurisdiction Clause, as the Service of Suit Clauses do not reserve to the Underwriters the contractual right to dismiss an action filed in court of competent jurisdiction in the United States. In other words, the Service of Suit Clauses alter the effect of the Jurisdiction Clause in two significant (but limited) ways. First the Service of Suit Clauses authorize Veros to commence litigation in a forum other than New York (provided its claims fall within the scope of the Service of Suit Clauses). Second, the Service of Suit Clauses operate to waive the Underwriters' private interest challenges to Veros's chosen forum when (1) the litigation cannot be transferred to the state court forum selected by the Jurisdiction Clause, and (2) the Underwriters elect not to (or are otherwise foreclosed from) commencing their own action in said state court forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Notably, the Jurisdiction Clause likewise limits the effect of the Service of Suit Clauses. The Certificate provisions that pertain to the Underwriters' rights of removal, transfer, and commencement of a suit in \"any\" court of competent jurisdiction are not complete reservations of rights. The Service of Suit Clauses merely say that nothing in the Service of Suit Clauses should be construed as waiving such rights. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Certificate at 8, 17.) Because the Jurisdiction Clause selects the New York state courts only, (if enforceable) it necessarily restricts the Underwriters from removing to a federal forum, transferring litigation from one federal forum to another, and commencing suit in a federal forum or state court forum outside of New York. Read together, the clauses leave one option to the Underwriters if they elect to proceed in New York state court-the Underwriters must file suit in a New York state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   This interpretation gives effect to all of the \"jurisdiction\" clauses, by recognizing that the Service of Suit Clauses do not foreclose the Underwriters from compelling litigation in New York state court, without nullifying the limited territorial consent memorialized in the Service of Suit Clauses. To the extent there are alternate, reasonable interpretations of the provisions, the court adopts the foregoing interpretation as more favorable to the insured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Dornoch\n   </em>\n   case cited by the Underwriters in support of their alternative interpretation is distinguishable. 666 F.Supp.2d at 366. In\n   <em>\n    Dornoch\n   </em>\n   , the underwriters filed a declaratory judgment action in the SDNY. The insured moved to dismiss the underwriters' action (or to transfer the action) on the basis that the insured had previously filed suit in federal court in Virginia. To support its motion to dismiss or transfer, the insured pointed to a service of suit clause in the parties' agreement, which provided that the underwriters consented \"to the jurisdiction of a Court of competent jurisdiction within the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 370. The plaintiff underwriters defended, relying on a mandatory venue provision in the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   First, the contractual language in\n   <em>\n    Dornoch\n   </em>\n   differs from that of the Certificate. The \"mandatory\" provision at issue in\n   <em>\n    Dornoch\n   </em>\n   specifically stated that \"any action relating to any dispute under this Policy shall only be brought in\" the state and federal courts in New York. The Jurisdiction Clause, on the other hand, refers to \"jurisdiction\" (like the Service of Suit Clauses), stating \"disputes ... shall be\n   subject to the exclusive jurisdiction\" of the New York state courts. The\n   <em>\n    Dornoch\n   </em>\n   court did not have to reconcile competing uses of the term \"jurisdiction.\" As such, in\n   <em>\n    Dornoch\n   </em>\n   , the inclusion of a separate provision conferring personal jurisdiction over the underwriters in the United States (and subjecting the underwriters to service of suit in the United States) could therefore be reconciled with the forum selection clause, which spoke only to venue. Unlike\n   <em>\n    Dornoch\n   </em>\n   , the Underwriters' proffered interpretation of the Certificate requires the court to read \"jurisdiction\" differently in the Jurisdiction Clause than in the Service of Suit Clauses-giving it territorial and personal effect in the former but only personal effect in the latter. To the extent that the language \"submit to jurisdiction\" is ambiguous, both federal and New York state law require the court to construe the ambiguity against the drafter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Global Satellite Commc'n Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9216742\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/378/1269/#p1272\">\n    378 F.3d at 1274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (finding the phrase \"submit to the jurisdiction\" of the chosen venue \"simply ambiguous\" and construing the forum selection clause against the drafter);\n   <em>\n    Majer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1027079\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ad2d/169/501/#p505\">\n    169 A.D.2d at 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=564%20N.Y.S.2d%20722\">\n    564 N.Y.S.2d 722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Had the Underwriters intended to limit their \"consent to jurisdiction\" to personal jurisdiction, they could have done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Second,\n   <em>\n    Dornoch\n   </em>\n   did not involve a determination as to whether the insured's first filed suit was subject to dismissal. As noted above, the court does not construe the Service of Suit clauses as waiving the right of the Underwriters to file suit in New York state court (the contractually selected forum), and the Service of Suit Clauses would not require dismissal of any such suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The arbitration cases cited by the Underwriters also do not compel a different result. Courts that have declined to find a conflict between arbitration clauses and service of suit clauses typically hold that enforcement of a mandatory arbitration provision does not leave the service of suit clause without meaning, as the service of suit clause makes certain that the insured will have recourse to a United States federal or state court to enforce any arbitration award entered in its favor.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McDermott Int'l, Inc. v. Lloyd's Underwriters of London\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527865\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/944/1199/#p1205\">\n    944 F.2d 1199\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1205 (5th Cir. 1991),\n   <em>\n    reh'g denied\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=947%20F.2d%201489\">\n    947 F.2d 1489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 1991). The courts emphasize that such a ruling gives effect both to the insured's waiver of a judicial forum for deciding disputes (evidenced by the arbitration provision) and the underwriters' consent to jurisdiction in a judicial forum when they have refused to pay amounts claimed due under the policy (evidenced by the service of suit clause).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    McDermott Int'l\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527865\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/944/1199/#p1205\">\n    944 F.2d at 1204-06, 1208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, of course, Veros did not waive its right to adjudicate its claims in a judicial forum, and there is no need to preserve a United States judicial forum to enforce the decision of another United States judicial forum. Further, the courts are not unanimous in holding that service of suit provisions do not conflict with arbitration provisions.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Transit Cas. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11847769\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/963/392/#p401\">\n    963 S.W.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   397-99 ;\n   <em>\n    Thiokol Corp. v.

Utah May 6, 1997) (Benson, J.) (applying principles of contract interpretation to resolve a conflict between a service of suit provision and an arbitration provision to hold that the more specific service of suit provision gave the insured an explicit right to bypass the more general arbitration provision).\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   There are numerous cases in which Lloyd's and its syndicates have litigated the meaning of Lloyd's service of suit clauses. These reported cases span more than 67 years. The addition of a sentence reserving the rights of removal, transfer, and commencement of a separate suit to Lloyd's form service of suit clause appears to have been a direct response to the courts' construction of service of suit clauses as venue provisions that waive such rights. Lloyd's could have similarly reserved its right to dismiss or modified the text of the service of suit clause to make clear that the reference to \"jurisdiction\" in the service of suit clauses is limited to personal jurisdiction. It did not do so, and, thus, the court will construe the ambiguity against the insurers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Ultimately, when reconciled with the Service of Suit Clauses, the Jurisdiction Clause does not apply to the Claims in their present procedural posture. Accordingly, the Motion is due to be denied-regardless of whether the Jurisdiction Clause is valid, enforceable, or entitled to near determinative weight in a\n   <em>\n    forum non conveniens\n   </em>\n   analysis.

The court will not require Veros to file suit on the Claims in another forum when the parties' agreement and the confirmed Plan and Disclosure Statement permit litigation in this forum and the Underwriters have not given any indication that they intend to pursue the contractually preserved mechanism for litigating in New York state court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   For the reasons set forth herein, the request to dismiss the AP is due to be denied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   As transfer was offered only as a consensual alternative to dismissal, the request to transfer venue of the AP also is due to be denied.
