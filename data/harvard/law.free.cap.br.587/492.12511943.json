Lynch, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Associated Bank, N.A., a secured creditor, objects to confirmation of the amended Chapter 13 Plan proposed by Anthony Miceli. (ECF No. 30.) Associated Bank objects to the Debtor's proposal to distribute smaller monthly payments to the secured creditor for its mortgage arrearage claim until the allowed claim of the Debtors attorneys is paid in full, after which the payments to the creditor will increase. The creditor contends that this arrangement violates the requirement for confirmation that periodic payments under section 1325(a)(5)(B)(iii)(I) be \"in equal monthly amounts.\" The Debtor argues in response that subsection (B)(iii)(I) does not prohibit a pro rata distribution to certain creditors and, in any case, the requirement does not apply to mortgage arrearage claim at issue here. For the reasons discussed below, this Court concludes that the plan provides for periodic, pro rata payments on secured claims that do not satisfy the equal monthly amount requirement. Because this arrangement is not accepted by the affected creditor the plan as proposed cannot be confirmed and the objection will be sustained.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     JURISDICTION AND PROCEDURE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction to decide this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Internal Operating Procedure 15(a) of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. This matter involves confirmation of a bankruptcy plan and, therefore, is a core proceeding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(L).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The facts are largely undisputed. The Debtor filed his Chapter 13 Petition on December 7, 2017. Two proofs of claim were timely filed and both claimants assert their claims to be fully secured. Of particular interest is the claim of Associated Bank for $72,202.62 secured by a mortgage in the Debtor's principal residence. In it the bank alleges that $23,943.42 of its claim is the \"[a]mount necessary to cure any default as of the date of the petition.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Claim No. 2-1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Debtor prepared his plan on Official Form 113, the new national model plan implemented in December 2017. The plan treats Associated Bank's arrearage claim as secured in Part 3.1, captioned \"Maintenance of payments and cure of default, if any.\" Under the plan the Debtor will continue to pay his monthly contractual installments, currently $477.83, directly to Associated Bank.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   It provides that the existing arrearage will be paid in full through\n   disbursements by the trustee, and lists the arrearage to be $23,943.42, for which it provides an interest rate of \"0.00%\". It bears noting while the plan indicates \"$0.00\" to be the monthly payment on the arrearage, it estimates that the total payments on the arrearage will be $23,943.42. The plan states that \"[u]nless otherwise ordered by the court, the amounts listed on a proof of claim filed before the filing deadline under Bankruptcy Rule 3002(c) control over any contrary amounts listed below as to the current installment payment and arrearage.\" (Amended Plan, Part 3.1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   General Order No. 17-02 of this Court took effect on December 1, 2017. It provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   Unless otherwise provided in a chapter 13 plan, claims of creditors will be paid pro rata in the following order: (1) current mortgage payments under 1322(b)(5); (2) monthly payments on non-mortgage secured claims; (3) costs of administration; (4) mortgage arrears under 1322(b)(5); (5) priority unsecured claims other than costs of administration; and (6) other unsecured claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Miceli's plan provides for sixty monthly payments of $500 to be paid to the trustee, totaling $30,000. From this amount, the Debtor estimates that the trustee will distribute $5,743.00 on administrative expenses and priority claims over the term of the plan, including an estimated $1,800 in trustee's fees and $3,600 attorney's fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the plan states that it anticipates paying 100% of allowed unsecured claims, it estimates them to be \"$0\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In an apparent attempt to square the plan's $0.00 proposed monthly payment with the anticipated total arrearage distribution of $23,943.42, the Debtor states in his response to the objection that his plan intends to pay the Associated Bank arrearage from the Debtor's $500 monthly installments. He explains that the trustee will distribute the funds according to the \"waterfall\" distribution arrangement provided in General Order No. 17-02. The plan proposes to treat the first 6% of each of the trustee's $500 monthly distribution as a cost of administration. The remainder of the trustee's monthly distribution will be paid first to the Debtor's attorney for his fees \"estimated to total $1,800\" until the attorney's claim is paid in full. After that, the remainder will be distributed to Associated Bank to pay in full its mortgage arrearage claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties stand on their briefs and oral argument. The Chapter 13 trustee takes no position on the objection. This determination is based upon these submissions, and takes judicial notice where appropriate of the court's docket of the case and the filings therein and with consideration of the argument of counsel.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lulay Law Offices v.

The plan proposes to pay Associated Bank only its current monthly contractual payment, now estimated to be $477.83, for the first 8 or 9 months, after which the monthly distribution will bump up $470 to $947.83 for the remainder of the plan (with a slightly lower payment in the month the attorney's fees are paid off). Thus, the principal issue for confirmation is whether the plan provisions for the Associated Bank secured claim complies with the in equal payment provisions of section 1325(a)(5)(B)(iii)(I) of the Bankruptcy Code where it provides for the trustee to distribute to the creditor lesser monthly payments until the attorney's fees are paid off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Courts are divided whether a Chapter 13 plan can provide for such a two-step repayment arrangement for paying off attorneys' fees without the secured creditor's consent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   As discussed below, two lines of cases-the\n   <em>\n    \"\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DeSardi\n   </em>\n   approach\" and the \"\n   <em>\n    Erwin\n   </em>\n   approach\"-reach the conclusion that it is permissible to do so. A third line of decisions\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   holds that it is not. After close consideration of this authority and the statutory language, this court concludes that section 1325(a) does authorize confirmation of a plan that requires a secured creditor to accept smaller payments with larger payments to be made only later in the term of the plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    DeSardi\n   </em>\n   line of cases reason that the equal monthly payment provision\n   of section 1325(a)(5)(B)(iii)(I) only requires that the payments to the creditor be equal once they begin and must continue to be equal until they cease.\n   <em>\n    In re DeSardi,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2817435\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/340/790/#p806\">\n    340 B.R. 790\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 806 (Bankr.

M.D. N. C. 2007). These cases emphasize that subsection (5)(B)(iii)(I) does not expressly state when the equal payment requirement applies in contrast to other provisions of the subsection such as section 1325(a)(5)(B)(iii)(II)'s requirement that adequate protection payments on personal property collateral be made \"during the period of the plan\" and section 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii)'s reference to value \"as of the effective date of the plan\" to conclude that the lack of such a provision in subsection (5)(B)(iii)(I) was intended.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re DeSardi,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2817435\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/340/790/#p806\">\n    340 B.R. at 805-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On that limited point this court does not disagree with\n   <em>\n    DeSardi\n   </em>\n   and we do not suggest that section 1325(a)(5)(B)(iii)(I) requires monthly payments to be made throughout the full term of the plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   But neither the plan proposed in this case nor the plans considered in the\n   <em>\n    DeSardi\n   </em>\n   line of cases propose to pay the secured creditor equal periodic payments over a single period. In\n   <em>\n    DeSardi,\n   </em>\n   the debtors proposed to pay the secured creditor a minimal amount as required to provide adequate protection by section 1325(a)(5)(B)(iii)(II) from the inception of the plan for several months followed by larger payments over the remainder of the plant's term sufficient to amortize and pay off the claim. The plan in this case proposes distributing only the current mortgage payments on the mortgage for the initial several months only after which it will include the arrearage payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The court in\n   <em>\n    DeSardi\n   </em>\n   concluded that \"adequate protection payments are not meant to be considered when fulfilling the requirements of the equal payment provision.\"\n   <em>\n    In re DeSardi,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2817435\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/340/790/#p806\">\n    340 B.R. at 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It did so to avoid a perceived conflict between the equal monthly amount requirement in section 1325(a)(5)(B) and section 1326(b)(1)'s provision that \"[b]efore or at the time of each payment to creditors under the plan, there shall be paid ... any unpaid claim [for administrative expenses allowed under section 503(b).]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). While acknowledging the case law to the contrary,\n   <em>\n    DeSardi\n   </em>\n   held that section 1326(b) prohibited payment to any creditor, including secured creditors, until all allowed administrative expenses were paid in full.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2817435\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/340/790/#p806\">\n    340 B.R. at 808-09\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It then concluded that while concurrent payment of attorneys' fees and adequate protection payments may be allowed because legitimate adequate protection payments would constitute an administrative expense entitled to similar priority as attorneys' fees, payments to a secured creditor exceeding the amount required for adequate protection before payment in full of attorneys' fees would violate section 1326(b).\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2817435\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/340/790/#p806\">\n    340 B.R. at 799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Reasoning that it is \"mathematically impossible\" to require equal monthly payments throughout the term of the plan, including the period of adequate protection, the\n   <em>\n    DeSardi\n   </em>\n   court concluded that the \"equal monthly amount\" requirement in section 1325(a)(5) did not apply to adequate protection payments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2817435\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/340/790/#p806\">\n    340 B.R. at 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   This court finds no such conflict between 1325(a)(5)(B)(iii) and section 1326(b). Section 1326(b) only requires payment\n   of allowed administrative expenses \"[b]efore\n   <em>\n    or at the time of\n   </em>\n   each payment to creditors under the plan.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (emphasis added). Clearly, that section permits creditors to be paid concurrently with administrative expenses. Under\n   <em>\n    DeSardi\n   </em>\n   's interpretation, however, the phrase \"or at the time of\" is reduced to surplusage. Had Congress intended to require one class of claims to be paid in full prior to another it easily could have said so, structuring section 1326 like section 726 to specify the order of distribution. Nor does concurrent payment of administrative expenses violate priority rules as the Bankruptcy Code requires only that priority claims be paid in full over the course of a Chapter 13 plan. Section 1322(a)(2) only requires the plan \"provide for the full payment, in deferred cash payments, of all claims entitled to priority under section 507 of this title, unless the holder of a particular claim agrees to a different treatment of such claim.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, section 1326(b) is not structured to fully implement the priority scheme of section 507, as it references only administrative expenses and trustee fees and not all priority claims. Administrative expenses and trustee fees by their nature accrue post-petition and are likely to continue accruing post-confirmation. Section 1326 requires that those charges not be subordinated or deferred pending payment of other claims as it clarifies that they can be paid over time and through the plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Periodic payments to a secured creditor under a Chapter 13 plan in an amount necessary to protect the creditor's interest in depreciating collateral are \"periodic payments\" as such term is used in section 1325(a)(5)(B)(iii)(I). Labeling them as \"adequate protection\" does not change that result, but rather invites the \"elevat[ion] of form over substance ... to sidestep statutory requirements.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Hamilton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046322\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/401/539/#p543\">\n    401 B.R. 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 543 (1st Cir.

Regardless of the label affixed to the \"current contractual installment payments\" and the \"arrearage\" to be made on Associated Bank's claim under the Debtor's plan, they, too, are periodic payments within the meaning of the statute.

This language indicates that what must be paid in equal monthly amounts is the debtor's total periodic payment specifically to or on account of an allowed secured claim, whether paid directly or paid to the trustee in escrow for future distribution.

This court agrees with\n   <em>\n    Hamilton\n   </em>\n   and other courts that section 1322(b)(5) is not \"at odds\" with section 1325(a)(5)(B)(iii)(I) and that nothing in section 1322(b)(5), 1322(e) or 1325(a)(5)(B) indicates that section 1325(a)(5)(B) does not apply to the cure and maintenance of a secured claim through a plan other than on the issue of the amount necessary for cure.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046322\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/401/539/#p543\">\n    401 B.R. at 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   C.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Associated Bank's Additional Arguments\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Having found that Associated Bank has demonstrated that the proposed plan fails to satisfy section 1325(a)(5)(B)(iii)(I) as to its claim, the court will briefly address two additional objections that the Bank raised in its brief in support of its objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   First, Associated Bank argues that the proposed plan is unclear and ambiguous in stating both that it will be paid \"$0 per month\" on the arrearage and that total payments by trustee on the arrearage will be $23,943.42. Although the Debtor clarified in his response to the objection his intent to pay the arrearage\n   <em>\n    pro rata\n   </em>\n   from monthly trustee payments after payment of attorney's fees, the court agrees that the plan is confusing and ambiguous when it indicates both that the trustee will pay over twenty-three thousand toward the arrearage and that the Debtor's monthly payments will be $0. The model plan provides for listing monthly payments in a set amount in section 3.1. If a debtor seeks to propose another form of payment, he should provide for that in his list of non-standard provisions found in section 8 of the form.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Second, Associated Bank contends that delaying the arrearage payments until after the attorney's fees are paid is not a cure \"within a reasonable time\" required by section 1322(b)(5). Because the court finds that the proposed repayment scheme violates section 1325(a)(5)(B)(iii)(I), we need not determine whether it would have\n   been \"reasonable\" absent the equal monthly payment requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Finally, Associated Bank \"question[s] whether the Debtor received proper disclosure of how his attorney's compensation would be paid\" noting that the plan provides for payment to the Debtor's attorney ahead of the mortgage arrears (Associated Bank's brief, ECF No. 35, at *6.) This concern appears to be based on nothing more than speculation and irrelevant to the Bank's objection to confirmation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Accordingly, Associated Bank's objection to confirmation of the Amended Plan will be sustained and confirmation denied. The Debtor will be given until August 9, 2018 to file an amended plan consistent with the court's rulings. A separate order shall be entered giving effect to the determinations reached herein.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Claim 2-1 alleges that the annual interest rate for the claim as of the date of the petition consists of both a fixed rate of 6.69% and a \"variable\" rate of 5.00% and attaches a copy of a purported mortgage and equity loan plan account agreement. According to the agreement, the loan is a revolving line of credit with no fixed term that, instead, requires monthly minimum payments of the \"accrued interest for the statement\" or 1.5% or $50 depending on the nature and amount of the balance.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    Associated Bank does not seem to dispute the amount of the current installment payment, having stated it to be \"currently in the amount of $477.83\" in its original objection filed February 2, 2018. (Objection to Confirmation of Plan, ECF No. 20, \u00b6 8.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    $1,800 plus $3,600 is only $5,400. The plan is unclear who will receive the additional $343 in payments or why, though the Debtor's attorney's fee application filed in the case seeks reimbursement of expenses of $310 for the filing fee and $33 in \"other expenses\" for which only $10 for a credit counseling course is explained.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Virtually all of these cases involve allowed claims secured by personal, as opposed to real, property. The cases considered proposals for \"adequate protection\" payments to lenders while paying attorneys' fees, followed by larger payments after the fees are paid in full. Neither party here contends that the collateral at issue here, real estate, is depreciating in value or that Associated Bank is not adequately protected by the retention of its lien or that subsection (B)(iii)(II) somehow applies.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Williams,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12511638\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/583/453/#p457\">\n     583 B.R. 453\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Bankr.

While section 1326(a)(1)(C) permits certain adequate protection payments to be made directly to secured creditors, section 1326(a)(2) requires all other preconfirmation plan payments to the trustee to be retained by the trustee until confirmation and then distributed in accordance with the plan \"as soon as is practicable\" thereafter.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2). Generally, this results in a secured creditor receiving a lump distribution soon after confirmation of all the preconfirmation plan payments made to the trustee on its behalf. But, an interpretation requiring actual distributions to be equal would require the trustee to continue to hold a portion of the escrowed funds allocating them across the repayment period in equal monthly amounts, thereby delaying repayment o the very secured creditor that the equal monthly amount provision is intended to protect. Such an interpretation would also seem to require adequate protection payments or current monthly installment payments to similarly be held in escrow with delayed payments in a manner apparently contrary to section 1326(a)(1)(C)'s provision for \"adequate protection directly to a creditor\" and section 1322(a)(5)'s \"maintenance of payments while the case is pending.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    For example, in\n    <em>\n     Lamie v.

In other words, the court found that a large payment following a series of equal periodic payments is not itself a periodic payment required to be in an equal monthly amount. This court need not address that issue here, since the Debtor's proposed plan does not include a balloon payment, but notes that such a narrow interpretation of the term periodic payment has not been adopted by any other court and is so narrow as to deprive the statutory provision of almost any practical meaning or effect. To the extent that the interpretation of \"periodic payments\" or \"such payments\" in\n    <em>\n     Cochran\n    </em>\n    is so narrow as to treat the current monthly installment payments and arrearage payments as separate sets of equal monthly payments and permitted by the statute, the court disagrees for the reasons stated earlier.
