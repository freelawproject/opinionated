Previously, on August 1, 2012, Debtor obtained a discharge in a Chapter 7 proceeding. On July 10, 2017, Debtor filed a motion to avoid lien with \"Option One Mortgage Corp serviced by Real Time Resolutions Inc.\" This lien predated the petition date of Debtor's Chapter 7 case. On August 8, 2017, the Court entered an order granting the motion. Section 4b(4) of the form order states: \"The claim of the junior lienholder is to be treated as an unsecured claim and is to be paid through the plan pro rata with all other unsecured claims.\" Section 4b(5) of the form order states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   The junior lienholder's claim on the deed of trust, mortgage or lien shall be allowed as a non-priority general unsecured claim in the amount per the filed Proof of Claim. The junior lienholder is not required to, but may file an amended Proof of Claim listing its claim as an unsecured claim to be paid in accordance it the Debtor's chapter 13 plan. If an amended claim is not filed, the trustee may treat any claim on the debt (secured or unsecured) filed by the junior\n   lienholder as unsecured upon entry of this order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 17, 2017, Debtor's Chapter 13 case was confirmed. On August 29, 2017, Real Time Resolutions, Inc. (\"Creditor\") filed a secured claim in the amount of $307,049.79, including arrears in the amount of $177,235.84 (\"Claim 5\"). On December 15, 2017, Debtor filed an objection to Claim 5. The basis for Debtor's objection is that her personal liability on Claim 5 was discharged in a previous bankruptcy case, and the Court's order avoiding the lien of Creditor means that the claim is no longer secured. On January 24, 2018, Creditor modified Claim 5, identifying the entirety of Claim 5 as unsecured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     APPLICABLE LAW\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    A.

Summary of Analysis\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The avoidance of a consensual lien in a Chapter 13 case is effectuated by a two-step process. First, the Court engages in a \u00a7 506(a) valuation, bifurcating the claim into secured and unsecured portions. Then the Court applies \u00a7 1322(b)(2). If the \u00a7 506(a) valuation results in a \"secured claim[s], other than a claim secured only by a security interest in real property that is the debtor's principal residence\" or an unsecured claim, then the plan may modify the rights of the creditor under \u00a7 1322(b)(2), avoiding the lien. This is the result because the Supreme Court has concluded that after a \u00a7 506(a) valuation, a wholly underwater junior lien is to be treated as an unsecured claim, and unsecured claims are subject to modification under \u00a7 1322(b)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   If the debtor's personal liability on the underlying debt has been discharged in a\n   previous bankruptcy case, however, the issue is more complex. Because there is no\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   liability on the underlying debt, it could be argued that there is no unsecured claim after the \u00a7 506(a) valuation. If there is no unsecured claim, however, the debtor would be ineligible to use \u00a7 1322(b)(2) to avoid the lien. Therefore, lien avoidance is only statutorily permissible if \u00a7 506(a) is interpreted as \"creating\" an unsecured claim for the purposes of the Chapter 13 bankruptcy. As outlined below, this result is logically necessary, and case law, this district's mandatory forms, and policy considerations all weigh in favor of the result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n    :\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The sole basis for Debtor's objection to Claim 5 is that Claim 5 was the subject of (1) a prior discharge and (2) a lien avoidance order. To understand the legal argument made, a brief history of lien avoidance is necessary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Prior to 1992, lien avoidance was available to debtors in both Chapter 7 and 13 proceedings, and for junior liens that were both wholly underwater and partially underwater.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Gaglia v.

In 1992, however, the Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Dewsnup v. Timm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227736\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/410/\">\n    502 U.S. 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6507836\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/112/773/\">\n    112 S.Ct. 773\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6227736\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/502/410/\">\n    116 L.Ed.2d 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992), which held Chapter 7 debtors could not strip down a partially unsecured lien to the value of the collateral. In reaching conclusion, the Supreme Court noted the definition of secured claim in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), which states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   An allowed claim of a creditor secured by a lien on property in which the estate has an interest, or that is subject to setoff under section 553 of this title, is a secured claim to the extent of the value of such creditor's interest in the estate's interest in such property, or to the extent of the amount subject to setoff, as the case may be, and is an unsecured claim to the extent that the value of such creditor's interest or the amount so subject to setoff is less than the amount of such allowed claim. Such value shall be determined in light of the purpose of the valuation and of the proposed disposition or use of such property, and in conjunction with any hearing on such disposition or use or on a plan affecting such creditor's interest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Supreme Court also noted the language of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 506\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d), which states, in relevant part: \"To the extent that a lien secures a claim against the debtor that is not an allowed secured claim, such lien is void.\" Prior to\n   <em>\n    Dewsnup\n   </em>\n   , courts have interpreted \u00a7 506(a)(1) and \u00a7 506(d), when read in conjunction, to establish a method by which debtors could void a lien to the extent such a lien was wholly or partially unsecured. The Supreme Court, however, rejected that reading, deferring to the \"pre-Code rule that liens pass through bankruptcy unaffected.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20506\">\n    at 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In rejecting such a reading, the Supreme Court foreclosed the possibility of using \u00a7 506 as an independent mechanism to avoid wholly or partially underwater liens. Nevertheless, the Eleventh Circuit continued to allow Chapter 7 debtors to strip off wholly underwater liens, noting that the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Dewsnup\n   </em>\n   had decided on the facts of a partially underwater lien.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re McNeal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3722883,3664958\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/735/1263/\">\n    735 F.3d 1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2015, however, the Supreme Court returned to the issue, and rejected the\n   Eleventh Circuit's approach, holding that Chapter 7 debtors could not avoid wholly underwater liens through the operation of \u00a7 506. While it is not exactly clear how \u00a7 506 could be applied differently depending on whether the lien is wholly or partially unsecured, the Supreme Court concisely reasserted that \"\n   <em>\n    Dewsnup\n   </em>\n   defined the term 'secured claim' in \u00a7 506(d) to mean a claim supported by a security interest in property, regardless of whether the value of that property would be sufficient to cover the claim....\n   <em>\n    Dewsnup\n   </em>\n   's construction of 'secured claim' resolves the question presented here.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Nevertheless, Chapter 13 debtors have a different mechanism by which they can avoid liens which are partially or wholly underwater:\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201322\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2), which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (b) Subject to subsections (a) and (c) of this section, the plan may -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (2) modify the rights of holders of secured claims, other than a claim secured only by a security interest in real property that is the debtor's principal residence, or of holders of unsecured claims, or leave unaffected the rights of holders of any class of claims\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Prior to 1993, bankruptcy courts had allowed Chapter 13 debtors to use the above provision to avoid both wholly and partially underwater liens.

After\n   <em>\n    Nobelman\n   </em>\n   , Chapter 13 debtors were still permitted to use \u00a7 1322(b)(2) to avoid liens which were \"secured\" by their principal residence, if such lien was wholly underwater (and thus, pursuant to \u00a7 506(a)(1), not \"secured\").\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re Tanner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11204928,11203454\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/1357/\">\n    217 F.3d 1357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1359-60 (11th Cir. 2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   An additional wrinkle, however, is present when a debtor files a \"Chapter 20\" case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   A Chapter 20 case involves a debtor who received a discharge in a Chapter 7 case and subsequently (technically within four years) files a Chapter 13 case.

C.D. Cal. 2009) (citations omitted). There are at least two significant questions that arise when a Chapter 13 debtor attempts to avoid a wholly underwater junior lien after obtaining a Chapter 7 discharge: (1) whether avoidance of the junior lien is permissible and (2) how the holder of the\n   junior lien should be treated during the pendency of the Chapter 13 plan. Furthermore, there is an additional important question here: how much weight should the Court give the language of the lien avoidance motion and the subsequent order granting the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The two preliminary questions identified above are legally complex - although a brief description is adequate to reveal the issues. Under the\n   <em>\n    Nobelman\n   </em>\n   lien avoidance procedure, a debtor first seeks a valuation under \u00a7 506(a)(1). Pursuant to \u00a7 506(a)(1), the claim is secured \"to the extent of the value of such creditor's interest in the estate's interest in such property,\" and is an \"unsecured claim to the extent that the value of such creditor's interest or the amount so subject setoff is less than the amount of such allowed claim.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Here, because the entire claim is underwater, the application of \u00a7 506(a)(1) leads to a conclusion that the amount of the secured claim is zero. Pursuant to \u00a7 506(a)(1), the remainder of the claim is unsecured. The issue, however, is whether \u00a7 506(a)(1) presupposes that\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   liability exists on the claim in the first place. If \u00a7 506(a)(1) does not implicitly contain such a presumption, then the plain language of the statute reads that any part of the claim determined not to be secured is automatically unsecured. In effect, a Chapter 20 debtor would have a choice regarding wholly underwater junior liens: treat the claim as either wholly secured or wholly unsecured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   If \u00a7 506(a)(1) does implicitly contain an assumption that, for an unsecured claim to remain,\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   liability must have existed on the claim in the first place, a different problem arises. As noted above, section 1322(b)(2) allows Chapter 13 debtors to \"modify the rights of holders of secured claims, other than a claim secured only by a secured interest in real property that is the debtor's principal residence, or of holders of unsecured claims.\" And\n   <em>\n    Nobelman\n   </em>\n   requires a two-step, sequential process for lien avoidance of wholly underwater junior liens by Chapter 13 debtors: (1) the application of \u00a7 506(a)(1), then (2) the operation of \u00a7 1322(b)(2). In order for \u00a7 1322(b)(2) to be applicable, however, and thus lien avoidance possible, the \u00a7 506(a)(1) valuation must reach one of two results: (1) a secured claim, other than a claim secured by real property that is the debtor's principal residence; or (2) an unsecured claim. Clearly, if Claim 5 is secured, it is only secured by Debtor's principal residence. Therefore, the only way \u00a7 1322(b)(2) can be applied is if the operation of \u00a7 506(a)(1) results in an unsecured claim. The result is logically unambiguous, and simply unavoidable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court's form motion and order, as well as case law, implicitly and explicitly recognize this dilemma for debtors. The lien avoidance motion filed by Debtor included the following request: \"Respondent's claim on the junior position lien shall be allowed as a nonpriority general unsecured claim in the amount per the filed Proof of Claim.\" [Dkt.

And, as noted in the introduction section, the Court's order granting the motion contains the following: \"The claim of the junior lienholder is to be treated as an unsecured claim and is to be paid through the plan pro rata with all other unsecured claims.\" [Dkt.

Multiple bankruptcy courts in California, however, have recognized the consequences noted above. The first opinion nationally to address the issue appears to have come from this district.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Akram\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11120156\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/259/371/#p377\">\n    259 B.R. 371\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 377 (Bankr.

The holding of that case was: \"the '\n   <em>\n    Lam\n   </em>\n   -stripping\" of these secured claims in the chapter 13 case resulted in valuing the secured claims at zero secured, for chapter 13 plan purposes, and turned the full amount owed to each creditor (pursuant to that creditor's Note) into a general unsecured claim, for chapter 13 plan purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11120156\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/259/371/#p377\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11120156\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/259/371/#p377\">\n    at 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Akram\n   </em>\n   does not appear to be universally accepted, however, it has been cited approvingly by the BAP and is the majority position on the issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Eaton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%206810924\">\n    2006 WL 6810924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *6 (9th Cir.

Even\n   <em>\n    Okosis\n   </em>\n   , the decision commonly referred to as detailing the \"fourth option\" which provided a rationale to validate lien stripping in Chapter 20 cases (see footnote 4), concluded that the claim must be treated as an unsecured claim in the plan.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3759384\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/451/90/#p96\">\n    451 B.R. 90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 96 (Bankr. D.

Quite simply, the Chapter 20 debtor cannot have its cake and eat it too. Creditor's claim, originally secured by property of the estate, is converted to an unsecured claim against the estate after lien avoidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Not only do logical reasoning, case law, and this district's practice demand the result,\n   but the equities concur. A Chapter 13 debtor can propose plans which pay creditors three different categories of dividends: (1) 0%; (2) more than 0%, but less than 100%; or (3) 100%. In either of the first two cases, treatment of the claim as an unsecured claim would not affect the amount the debtor pays into the plan. Only in the situation where the debtor is not paying the entirety of its disposable income into the plan does the situation affect the debtor. In other words, only in those cases where the Chapter 13 debtor has the ability to pay some or the entire resulting unsecured claim would the result impact the Chapter 13 plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, there is no (other) mechanism under the bankruptcy code that would allow a debtor to avoid a lien and discharge the\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   liability without the obligation to make a good faith effort to make payment on the claim. For all the reasons outlined above, Debtor's efforts at finding a loophole to avoid the requirement are logically incompatible with the Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Based on the foregoing, the motion to disallow claim is DISALLOWED.

Courts that allow lien avoidance in Chapter 20 cases have recognized a fourth way for a Chapter 13 case to end: closure without discharge.
