In general, the Plan reserves,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   without limitation, all bankruptcy causes of action, such as claims for fraudulent conveyances, preferences, equitable subordination, declaratory judgments, suits to determine the nature, extent, validity, and priority of liens and security interests, or others provided under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, as well as prepetition claims such as claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, lender liability, fraud, trespass to try title, and others.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Plan also makes provision for specific claims against HSB. Included with that provision are facts and circumstances for which Artho contends the estate maintains its claims against HSB.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The alleged facts, while not identical, are similar to those alleged in Artho's complaint against HSB.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Plan asserts that the alleged facts, if true, \"could nullify the validity of the liens asserted by bank ... and also give cause for the award of a judgment against the bank and others acting in concert ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Plan was confirmed on June 19, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On September 3, 2015, Artho filed his Debtor's Report of Sale of Personal Property, confirming that the debtor's real estate, farm machinery, and equipment were sold at an auction held on August 14 and 15, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Report of Sale of Personal Property reflected a net of $41,388.45 to Artho on account of the sale of his farm machinery and equipment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Artho separately filed the Debtor's Report of Sale of Real Property on October 6, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Report of Sale of Real Property reflected total dollars received from the sale of $3,632,358.95.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   From those funds, distributions were made to secured creditors, including HSB, and for fees of professionals; $99,411.89 was turned over to Artho; the remaining funds from the sales of real and personal property were deposited in Artho's counsel's trust account to pay unsecured creditors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Unlike the Report of Sale of Personal Property, the Report of Sale of Real Property does not contain information about the purchasers of the real estate tracts. By the Court's order, entered November 6, 2015, the Report of Sale of Real Property was approved, including\n   the distributions contained in the referenced report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Artho filed an amended complaint on May 31, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   He alleges six causes of action against HSB, four of which are also alleged against the other named defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The causes of action against HSB are: (1) fraud by false promises; (2) civil conspiracy to commit fraud by false promises; (3) duress; (4) civil conspiracy to commit duress; (5) civil conspiracy to violate\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20152\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5) ; and (6) conspiracy to violate\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Artho asserts the four conspiracy-based causes against the other defendants, as well.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In support of these claims, Artho alleges that HSB had promised him additional time to conduct an auction of certain assets, the proceeds of which would pay HSB's loans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   The auction was to occur in April 2015 and was necessary, Artho says, because he was not able to secure financing to pay the HSB loans otherwise.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relatedly, Artho contends that he was not able to secure financing from other lenders or otherwise sell his assets because of HSB's interference in the process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   Artho says he relied on the alleged promise made by HSB to allow him time to hold a private auction conducted by an auctioneering company that would publicize and market the assets available for auction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Artho contends, however, that prior to the planned April 2015 auction, HSB posted all of Artho's property for foreclosure in February 2015 for a foreclosure sale in March 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   The pending foreclosure caused Artho to seek relief in the bankruptcy Court under chapter 12.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As stated, the terms of Artho's chapter 12 Plan provided for an auction of his property, farm equipment, and machinery. At the bankruptcy auction, Outpost was the successful bidder on two tracts of Artho's real property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   The significance of Outpost's purchase of the two tracts is, Artho alleges, their proximity to other real property owned by Outpost and their having new water wells that could benefit Outpost's land.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   Artho contends that the Defendants sought to acquire these tracts at below-market prices because of their value to the business operations of each Defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Artho alleges that HSB sought information related to the production quantities of the newly completed water wells and with this information decided\n   that portions of Artho's land would be advantageous to the other defendants. Artho alleges that the Defendants, by their agents, intimidated other \"good-faith bidders\" at the auction to help secure the identified properties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Despite an alleged fair market value of more than $15,000,000, all of Artho's auctioned property sold for $3,648,528.95.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   Artho claims that but for the actions of the Defendants-the false promise, the impending foreclosure, and the unlawful conduct at the bankruptcy auction-he could have refinanced the indebtedness owed to HSB or otherwise acquired the funds necessary to pay such indebtedness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   By its motion to dismiss, HSB asserts that Artho's complaint fails to properly allege subject matter jurisdiction as required by Rule 12(b)(1), to state a claim upon which relief may be granted under Rule 12(b)(6), and to comply with Rule 9(b) for allegations of fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Particularly, HSB says that Artho lacks standing to prosecute claims that were not explicitly reserved in the confirmed chapter 12 Plan and that he lacks standing to assert a claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20152\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5), which is a criminal statute without a private remedy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   HSB's motion contends that the allegations of Artho's complaint are not plausible and are nothing more than conclusory statements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   Summarily, HSB seeks dismissal of Artho's complaint, and of specific causes, for the following additional reasons: (1) the complaint does not plead facts with particularity as required by Rule 9(b); (2) the statute of frauds applies to bar claims; (3) the conspiracy claims are barred by the statute of limitations; and (4) the causes alleging duress are barred by res judicata and those related to the bankruptcy auction were waived upon entry of the Court's order approving the sale.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants Shannon T.

In their motions to dismiss, each of the Defendants make identical requests that the Court take judicial notice \"of the filings, claims filed, pleadings, and orders in the main bankruptcy case (Case[ ] No. 15-20046-rlj-12).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   In support of this request, the Defendants rely on\n   <em>\n    Tellabs, Inc. v.

This is the crux of the Defendants' motions to dismiss as applied to the tort claims-and conspiracies to commit those torts. The Defendants allege both that Artho's failure to prove the elements of the related torts necessarily results in dismissal of the conspiracy to commit fraud by false promises and conspiracy to commit duress claims. Artho's claims of conspiracy do not describe a meeting of the minds, nor do they establish an agreement between HSB and the other defendants to cause injury to Artho. While the complaint may allege conduct by each party that could have resulted in injury to Artho, such conduct, under the law, is not actionable as a conspiracy where there is no evidence of an agreement to cause the injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schlumberger Well Surveying Corp. v.

In this suit by a minority partner, the Fifth Circuit\n   reversed and remanded the district court's dismissal for failure to state a claim. In so doing the court stated, \"[s]uch a dismissal is not proper 'unless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"324954\" index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/756/1161/#p1180\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Conley v.

The Fifth Circuit went on to discuss other deficiencies arising from the complaint's failure to comply with Rules 8 and 9 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The district court did not, however, base its decision to dismiss on these failures. The Fifth Circuit, nonetheless, instructed, \"[b]ut such deficiencies do not normally justify dismissal of the suit on the merits and without leave to amend, at least not in the absence of special circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6161830\" index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/355/41/#p45\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The opinion appears to support the proposition that courts are in favor of granting leave to amend the complaint instead of dismissing the complaint without the opportunity to cure deficiencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Artho's request for leave to amend his complaint should be denied for three reasons. First, under consideration is Artho's first amended complaint-this is his second attempt to state a claim upon which relief may be granted-and the law supports the Court's exercise of discretion to deny leave to amend when the plaintiff has been given a previous opportunity to correct deficiencies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    65\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, Artho's response to the Defendants' motions to dismiss does not include any proposed amendments to the complaint nor does it allege additional facts that could survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. Although Artho attempts to raise an issue with his signature on the related HSB loan documents, this argument is foreclosed by both judicial estoppel and res judicata. Likewise, despite multiple opportunities for which it could be achieved, Artho has failed to produce the email by which he claims HSB accepted his position regarding the auction that was to occur prior to the bankruptcy. Nor does Artho allege an act committed by HSB that was illegal and caused him economic duress. Also absent are any facts related to a meeting of the minds between the Defendants, a necessary element to plausibly allege a conspiracy cause of action. In fact, Artho's response does nothing more than recite the same or similar facts as those raised in the first amended complaint. Third, any cause of action related to the post-petition bankruptcy auction is barred by res judicata by the Court's order approving the Report of Sale of Real Property. Artho's request to amend his complaint, therefore, is futile and must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Count 1-Fraud by False Promises\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Artho's reservation of claims in his chapter 12 Plan, particularly claims against HSB, preserved Artho's standing to bring such claims. But his false promise claim against HSB is subject to the Statute of Frauds and thus fails as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   His related, reliance-based fraud claim that survives the Statute of Frauds defense likewise fails. The promises allegedly made by HSB, which Artho claims he relied on and which caused him damages, contradict the underlying terms of the notes that are secured by Artho's real property. Artho's complaint does not demonstrate that he justifiably relied on such promises. Artho alleges that he was unable to obtain alternative financing because\n   HSB told other lenders that it would not release its liens against Artho's property even if the debt to HSB was paid. This allegation, not addressed above, cannot support the claim for fraud by false promises because it does not meet the \"who, what, when, where, and how\" standard required for pleading fraud with particularity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spicer\n   </em>\n   , 751 F.3d at 365. Count 1 of the complaint, therefore, must be dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    66\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Count 2-Civil Conspiracy to Commit Fraud by False Promises\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The complaint fails to allege facts which, if taken as true, establish a meeting of the minds to commit fraud by false promises. Rather, assertions are made to allow for inferences regarding the relationship of the parties. Such inferences, however, are not enough when the underlying injury could not have resulted from the alleged conspiracy (i.e., the tort cannot be established from the pleaded facts). Count 2 of the complaint must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Count 3-Duress\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Issuing a notice of foreclosure on account of a legitimate past-due debt and refusing to accept or consider collateral, where there is no legal duty to accept or consider same, are not unlawful acts. As such, the complaint fails to allege facts of a threat to perform an action for which HSB had no legal right to engage. This is a critical element to establishing a claim for economic duress; thus, Count 3 of the complaint will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Count 4-Civil Conspiracy to Commit Duress\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   As described by the dismissal of Count 2, Count 4 should also be dismissed for failure to allege facts of a critical element of the civil conspiracy: a meeting of the minds. Likewise, the failure of an alleged object of the conspiracy necessitates dismissal of the claim for conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Count 5-Civil Conspiracy to violate\n     <extracted-citation index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20152\">\n      18 U.S.C. \u00a7 152\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (5)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Count 5 must be dismissed for failure to allege facts that result in a meeting of the minds between two or more of the Defendants to commit the substantive crime. Additionally, Artho lacks standing to pursue an action against the Defendants for the substantive crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Count 6-Conspiracy to Violate\n     <extracted-citation index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201962\">\n      18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1962\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (b)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Again, the complaint does not allege a necessary element to plausibly allege a conspiracy because there is no showing of a meeting of the minds. Furthermore, the Defendants could not conspire to commit the underlying injury because neither Artho nor his business is an enterprise for purposes of the RICO statute. Count 6 of the complaint will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    Doc. No. 1. All \"Doc.
