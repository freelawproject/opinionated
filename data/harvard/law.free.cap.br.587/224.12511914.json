The Court must address whether the Trustee may avoid an unrecorded mortgage and preserve it for the benefit of the estate. Insomuch as Puerto Rico law provides that a mortgage is inexistent unless it is registered, the Trustee may not avoid an unrecorded mortgage. For the reasons that follow, the Court denies the Trustee's request for judgment on the pleadings and dismisses the adversary case against defendant Banco Popular de Puerto Rico (hereinafter \"Banco Popular\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    Procedural History\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Debtor, Eduardo Rivera Mercado (hereinafter \"the Debtor\"), acquired real property located in Orocovis, Puerto Rico on August 21, 2002. In May 2014, the Debtor executed a note and mortgage deed over the real property in favor of Metro Island Mortgage, Inc., which was later transferred to Banco Popular. The mortgage deed was never presented in the Puerto Rico Property Registry for the purpose of recording a lien on the real property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Debtor filed for bankruptcy under chapter 7 on December 15, 2015 (Case No. 15-09902, Docket No.1). Subsequently, the Trustee filed an adversary action for avoidance of the unrecorded mortgage and to preserve the avoided mortgage for the benefit of the estate. The Trustee moved for judgment on the pleadings against Banco Popular (Docket No. 10). Banco Popular opposed (Docket No. 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Standard for Judgment on the Pleadings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, made applicable in bankruptcy proceedings through Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7012, provides that \"[a]fter the pleadings are closed but within such time as not to delay the trial, any party may move for judgment on the pleadings.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The standard for evaluating a Rule 12(c) motion for judgment on the pleadings is essentially the same as that for deciding a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause of action. Under both Rule 12(b)(6) and 12(c) standards, \"[t]he trial court must accept all of the nonmovant's well-pleaded factual averments as true, and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.\"\n   <em>\n    Rivera-Gomez v. de Castro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10545157\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/843/631/#p635\">\n    843 F.2d 631\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 635 (1st Cir.1988).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    AIG Prop.
