Laney, III, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  The matter before the Court arises from the Motion for Relief from the Automatic Stay (the \"Motion\") filed by RentalAccess, LLC (the \"Movant\"). On June 8, 2018, the Court heard oral arguments on the Motion. The primary issue in this case is whether the Court should characterize the contract as a lease or a security interest. Before addressing this question, the Court must also address a two procedural issues.\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"majority\">\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Having carefully considered the parties' arguments and applicable law, the Court finds the parties entered into a lease agreement, which the Bankruptcy Code requires a debtor to timely reject or assume. Therefore, subject to the limitations set forth in the accompanying order, the Court GRANTS the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL FINDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Prior to filing this case, the Debtor entered into an agreement regarding the use of a portable storage shed. At a location in Phenix City Alabama, the Debtor signed a document titled \"Rental Purchase Agreement and Disclosure\" dated December 5, 2016 (the \"Agreement\"). Although the Debtor believed she interacted with an agent of Premier Portable Buildings, the Agreement listed RentalAccess LLC as the lessor and owner of the building and directed the Debtor to remit payment to the Movant at a particular Post Office Box.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Since purchasing the shed, the Debtor has used it exclusively to store household items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Agreement described the transaction as lease throughout the document. In particularly relevant parts, it provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   D. The term of this agreement is one month.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   E. Renter may renew this agreement for consecutive terms of one month by making rental payments in advance for additional month Renter wishes to rent the property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   F.

If [the Debtor] renews this agreement forty-eight (48) consecutive months, on time for a total cost of $4,600.32... and otherwise complies with this agreement, then [she] will acquire ownership of the rented property. At any time after [the Debtor] has made the first rental payment, [the Debtor] may aquire [sic] ownership of the rented property by tendering 60% of the difference between the total of scheduled payments and the total amount paid on the account....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Movant's Ex. A. \u00b6\u00b6 D.-F.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 7, 2017, the Debtor filed a Chapter 13 Petition. Pet. (Doc. No. 1). The\n   Debtor also filed a Chapter 13 Plan (the \"Plan\") on the same day. Chapter 13 Plan (Doc No. 2). The Plan contained a provision for payment to Premier Portable Buildings to satisfy a claim secured by an \"8 x 12 Portable Utility Building.\"\n   <em>\n    See Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 (e). In accordance with the procedures of this Court, the Bankruptcy Notification Center served the plan on all creditors on the creditor matrix created by the Debtor. Notice of Service of Plan (Doc. No. 9). Among other creditors served, the Plan was sent to Premier Portable Buildings at 120 Brett Chase Suite C, Paducah, Kentucky 42003-5766.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   No interested party opposed confirmation and on May 11, 2017 the Court confirmed the Plan as originally filed.

The Movant argues that it is entitled to relief from the Automatic Stay because the contract between it and the Debtor was a lease. Because the Debtor's plan did not provide for the assumption of the Agreement, it is presumed the lease is rejected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20365\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2), 1322(b)(7).

M.D. Fla. 1994). Such consequences create cause for granting the Movant relief from the automatic stay, as the Movant's interest in the leased property is no longer adequately protected by the creation of a bankruptcy estate and by payments through the Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Before addressing whether the agreement creates a lease or a security agreement, the Court must address two threshold issues. First, the Court must determine whether the confirmation of the Plan binds the Movant. Second, the Court must determine which state's law governs the interpretation of the Agreement. After addressing these issues, the Court addresses whether the agreement creates a lease or a security interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A.

Accordingly, Tennessee law shall apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Notably, the Movant failed to present the foreign law. In a Federal Court, however, this failure is less fatal to the movant's case. First, unlike Georgia's Civil Practice Act, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44.1\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   only requires notice of reliance on foreign law when the law originates from another country.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Fed.

So while the Movant did not notice the parities of his intent to rely on Tennessee law nor did it adequately cite appropriate authority establishing the law of that state,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court will take judicial notice of the laws of Tennessee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     C.

The Tennessee Rental-Purchase Agreement Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2047-18-601-614\">\n    Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 47-18-601-614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , defines a \"rental-purchase agreement\" as an agreement:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   for the use of personal property by a natural person primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, for an initial period of four (4) months or less (whether or not there is any obligation beyond the initial period) that is automatically renewable with each payment and that permits the consumer to become the owner of the property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tenn.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2047-18-601-614\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 47-18-603(7). Meeting the requirements of a rental-purchase agreement creates favorable designation under Tennessee law. The act states that a rental-purchase agreement \"shall not be construed to be... [a] 'security interest' as defined in [ UCC Sec. 1-203 ].\" Ten Code Ann. \u00a7 47-18-603(7)(F).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Here, the evidence clearly establishes that the Agreement between the Debtor and the Movant was a \"rental-purchase agreement\" under Tennessee law. The Debtor's testimony establishes that the Debtor has always used the shed to store household items. The lease duration is less than four months and the agreement allows the Debtor to become the owner of the storage shed. Accordingly, the Agreement is designated a \"rental-purchase agreement\" and Tennessee law prohibits the Court from characterizing it as a security interest. With such a designation, the Court does not need to apply the test set forth in UCC \u00a7 1-203.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As a final note, though Tennessee's Rental-Purchase Agreement Act explicitly exempts the Agreement from the application of \u00a7 1-203, the Agreement would not otherwise be interpreted as a security interest. Section 1-203's test requires the Court to consider the term of the lease and whether the lessee is bound to renew the lease. Here, the term of the lease, one (1) month, is not greater than the remaining economic life of the storage shed. Further, the Debtor is not obligated to renew the lease. She may discontinue the lease at any time without breaching the agreement. Therefore, even if this court were to interpret the agreement under Georgia law,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   it would come to the same conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Central Rents v.

Further, the document directed the Debtor to make payments to the Movant. At the hearing, neither party could explain why two documents were executed.
