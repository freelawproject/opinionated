Ferrari (the \"Debtor\") by plaintiff David R. Brown, not individually but as the chapter 7 trustee for the Debtor's bankruptcy estate (the \"Trustee\"). The Trustee objects to the Debtor's discharge pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A), (a)(3), and (a)(5) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons outlined below, the Court finds in favor of the Trustee and against the Debtor on Counts II and III of the complaint and holds that the Debtor is not entitled to a discharge under \u00a7\u00a7 727(a)(3) and (a)(5). As for Count I, the Court finds that the Trustee has failed to meet his burden under \u00a7 727(a)(2)(A). As such, that count will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Internal Operating Procedure 15(a) of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.

(Pretrial Stmt. \u00b6 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) The case was involuntarily converted to chapter 7 on the motion of FirstMerit Bank, N.A. (\"FirstMerit Bank\") on October 17, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ; Bankr. Dkt. 127.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Debtor is a licensed real estate broker and the president and sole shareholder of Best Seats Available, Inc. (\"Best Seats\"), a ticket broker. (Pretrial Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 7 &amp; 8.) The Debtor owns a home located at 810 Brentwood Drive in Bensenville, Illinois (the \"Home\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) The Trustee alleges that the Home is the Debtor's most valuable asset and that, on the Petition Date, it was worth between $300,000 and $500,000. (Pretrial Stmt., Trustee's Claims, at 1 \u00b6 1.) The Debtor obtained an appraisal of the Home in November 2015 which reflected a value of $330,000. (Pretrial Stmt. \u00b6 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the Petition Date, the Home was encumbered by a purchase money mortgage which is currently held by JPMorgan Chase Bank (\"Chase Bank\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) The Debtor's amended schedule D shows\n   the amount owed on the first mortgage as $148,119.85. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28; Bankr. Dkt. 45.) On the Petition Date, the Home was also encumbered by a junior mortgage allegedly securing an equity line of credit in the amount of $375,000. (Pretrial Stmt. \u00b6 33; Trustee Exs. 7 &amp; 8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) The junior mortgage was the subject of a separate adversary proceeding brought by the Trustee under \u00a7\u00a7 506(a)(1), 547, and 548. (Adv. No. 16-00757.) That case was dismissed in December 2017 after the Trustee agreed to accept $110,000 for the purchase of the estate's interest in the Home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Adv. Dkt. 38;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Bankr. Dkt. 166 &amp; 170.) The circumstances surrounding the junior mortgage, and related matters, however, are relevant to this adversary proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In order to understand the issues before the Court here, some history is required. On February 11, 2005, Stave Properties, Inc. (\"Stave\"), an Illinois corporation owned by the Debtor and an individual named Joseph Betancourt (\"Betancourt\"), executed a note and a mortgage in favor of Mount Prospect National Bank (\"Mount Prospect Bank\") on the property commonly known as 2170-2174 North Stave Street in Chicago (the \"Stave Note\"). (Pretrial Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 12 &amp; 13.) On the same day, the Debtor executed in favor of Mount Prospect Bank both a guaranty of the Stave Note and a second mortgage on his Home to secure his guaranty of the Stave Note (the \"Stave 2nd Mortgage\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.) The Stave guaranty was also secured by a mortgage on Betancourt's home. (Tr. 133:22-134:1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) FirstMerit Bank is the successor-in-interest to Mount Prospect Bank as to both the Stave Note and the Stave 2nd Mortgage. (Pretrial Stmt. \u00b6 15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 17, 2015, FirstMerit Bank obtained a judgment against Stave, the Debtor, and Betancourt on the Stave Note and guarantees in the amount of $246,772.95. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) Thereafter, the Debtor and Betancourt satisfied the judgment, with Betancourt paying approximately $220,000 and the Debtor paying about $24,000 to FirstMerit Bank. (Tr. 134:1-6.) As a result of those payments, a Notice of Satisfaction of Judgment was filed by FirstMerit Bank on April 21, 2015 (Trustee Ex. 13), and on May 4, 2015, a Release of Mortgage as to the Stave 2nd Mortgage was recorded with the DuPage County Recorder's Office (Pretrial Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 17 &amp; 18; Trustee Ex. 14). Thus, as of April 21, 2015, the Debtor's Home was encumbered by only the Chase Bank mortgage, and the Debtor had approximately $182,000 of equity in the Home (using the appraisal figure provided by the Debtor). (Pretrial Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 22 &amp; 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At all times relevant, the Debtor, along with his daughter Maria Ferrari (\"Maria\"), had another obligation owing to FirstMerit Bank. According to the Debtor, that obligation was in the amount of approximately $300,000 and was secured by a mortgage on a single-family lot located on Cortland Street in Chicago. (Tr. 130:6-25.) The Debtor testified that the property securing the debt was ultimately sold and that a deficiency of approximately $80,000 remained owing to FirstMerit Bank. (Tr. 131:22-132:8.) The Debtor further testified that he tried to work with FirstMerit Bank to resolve the Cortland obligation but was unsuccessful in doing so. (Tr. 130:4-133:5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The amended proof of claim filed by FirstMerit Bank in the Debtor's case conflicts\n   with the Debtor's testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to that proof of claim, filed on February 5, 2018 and identified as No. 5-2, FirstMerit Bank alleges an unsecured claim in the amount of $248,100.77. (Bankr. Dkt., Claims Register, Claim 5-2 at 1-3.) The attachments to the proof of claim indicate that the obligation arose from a promissory note executed by 2425 W. Cortland Properties, Inc., a company of which the Debtor served as president and Maria as secretary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-28.) The note was dated April 30, 2010 in the original principal amount of $312,062.74 and was secured by a mortgage on the Cortland Street property, as well as property located in Lombard, Illinois, owned solely by Maria and her husband Juan Salgado. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26-30.) The indebtedness was further secured by a commercial guaranty executed by the Debtor and a personal guaranty executed by Maria. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 31.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   FirstMerit Bank ultimately obtained an Order Appointing Selling Officer and Judgment of Foreclosure and Sale with respect to the note, mortgage, and guarantees. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-12.) That order, dated October 26, 2015, provides that the total judgment amount owing was $248,100.77, of which $89,093.45 was principal, $33,435.16 accrued interest as of October 19, 2015, and $125,572.16 attorney's fees and costs as of October 14, 2015. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On July 2, 2015, the Debtor executed a number of documents, including the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (i) Mortgage and Security Agreement apparently in favor of Nationwide Mortgage and Realty LLC (\"Nationwide\") to secure an open-end revolving home equity line of credit and future advances, with a credit limit of $375,000 (Pretrial Stmt. \u00b6 33; Trustee Ex. 8);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (ii) Mortgage and Security Agreement in favor of Michael Auriemma (identified\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   ), identical to the document executed in favor of Nationwide except that the name of the lender was handwritten in as Auriemma (Trustee Ex. 7);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (iii) Balloon Home Equity Line of Credit Agreement and Disclosure Statement in favor of Nationwide as lender (Trustee Ex. 9);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (iv) Balloon Home Equity Line of Credit Agreement and Disclosure Statement, identical to Trustee Exhibit 9 but undated (Pretrial Stmt. \u00b6 37; Trustee Ex. 10).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The mortgages reflected a credit limit of $375,000 and maturity dates of July 2, 2020; the Nationwide mortgage had a balloon-payment rider attached to it. (Pretrial Stmt. \u00b6 34, Trustee Exs. 7 &amp; 8.) Both mortgages state that the \"Mortgagee secures advances so made, regardless of whether the monies are advanced or applied within 18 months of recording this Security Instrument.\" (Pretrial Stmt. \u00b6 35; Trustee Exs. 7 &amp; 8 at \u00b6 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The testimony and documents at trial paint a very confusing picture as to who made the various loans that the Debtor allegedly obtained and to whom any obligations were owed. The Debtor testified that the loans were all made to him by his long-time friend and neighbor Michael Auriemma (\"Auriemma\"), who is the owner and manager of Nationwide, a mortgage broker. (Tr. 40:24-41:4, 47:3-9.) The Debtor admitted that his signature appeared on the various mortgage documents but said that he was confused by and had no explanation as to why he had apparently executed\n   identical documents in favor of both Nationwide and Auriemma. (Tr. 44:2-17, 47-58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Debtor did not receive $375,000 when he executed the mortgages or the other documents described herein or at any time before or after their execution. (Tr. 186:13-187:17.\n   <strong>\n    )\n   </strong>\n   Instead, the Debtor testified that the junior mortgage(s) and related documents were executed to secure previous and otherwise unsecured loans that he had received from Auriemma over a three-year period, beginning in 2012, in the total amount of $240,000. (Tr. 58:17-72:17, 138:8-148:15, 187:12-22, 192:17-22.) Of that, the Debtor testified, $202,000 were cash loans, and $38,000 was for an interest reserve. (Tr. 58:17-72:17, 74:1-6, 192:17-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Debtor had no receipts for the money allegedly loaned to him by Auriemma, nor did he execute any promissory notes in favor of Auriemma for any of the loans. (Tr. 74:8-75:21.) The Debtor testified that the loans consisted of the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (i) $50,000 loaned from Auriemma in 2012 so that the Debtor could remodel a hot dog stand that he owned. (Tr. 59:10-25, 140:4-24.) According to the Debtor, the loan from Auriemma was given to him in cash, in a briefcase, in fifty- and one-hundred-dollar bills, which the Debtor put into a personal safe in his Home and which he then used as needed to pay the contractors for the work done on the hot dog stand. (Tr. 60:4-61:18.) The Debtor admitted that he had no documents evidencing either the receipt of the $50,000 or the disbursement of the cash to pay for the hot dog stand remodel. (Tr. 59:8-61:18.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (ii) $50,000 in cash loaned from Auriemma to the Debtor in 2013 to purchase a 2010 Mercedes Benz. (Tr. 61:19-62:19, 141:2-9.) The Debtor produced a certificate of title for the car, issued on September 30, 2013, which shows him as the title holder and Auriemma as the first lienholder. (Tr. 141:17-142:3; Trustee Ex. 12.) The Debtor did not produce a bill of sale or a receipt for the car. (Tr. 66:19-23.) Nor did he produce any documents evidencing the receipt of the $50,000 from Auriemma or the payment to the seller for the car. The Debtor testified that the purchase price of the car was $35,000. (Tr. 66:3-7.) He did not testify as to what he did with the remaining $15,000 except to say that he did not return the difference to Auriemma. (Tr. 66:8-18.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (iii) $40,000 in cash loaned from Auriemma in 2014, $25,000 of which the Debtor gave to his attorneys to pay their fees and the rest of which he used to pay real estate taxes, his previous attorneys, business operating expenses, and other bills. (Tr. 67:15-25, 142:7-143:22.) The Debtor produced no documents showing either the receipt of the $40,000 or the disbursement of the cash, nor did he provide attorney's fee bills, receipts, or checks, despite his testimony that he paid his attorneys partially by check and partially by credit card. (Tr. 68:11-70:13, 143:18-19.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (iv) $12,000 in cash loaned from Auriemma in 2014 and wired from an MB Financial account to the Debtor's attorneys on October 2, 2014 for payment to a title company in order to close on a condominium sale in connection with the Stave development. (Tr. 70:14-71:9, 144:5-19.) The Debtor produced a copy of the wire transfer from the MB Financial account to his attorneys\n   Brown Udell Pomerantz &amp; Delrahim showing that the transfer took place. (Trustee Ex. 11.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (v) $50,000 in cash on or about July 2, 2015 when the Debtor executed the junior mortgage on his Home. (Tr. 71:10-20, 145:3-9.) The Debtor testified that he used the money to purchase tickets to resell through Best Seats and to pay for some business expenses. (Tr. 71:22-72:17, 164:18-24, 187:16-188:23). The Debtor provided no documents evidencing either the receipt of the $50,000 in cash or its use by Best Seats or otherwise.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Less than four months after the July 2, 2015 transaction(s) occurred, the Debtor filed his voluntary petition for bankruptcy relief. The Trustee subsequently filed two adversary complaints, one against Auriemma and Chase Bank on December 27, 2016, which, as discussed above, was ultimately resolved and dismissed, and the current complaint against the Debtor on April 12, 2017. After the Debtor filed his amended answer, the case proceeded to trial on January 9 and 17, 2018, and the matter was then taken under advisement. Having reviewed all of the evidence admitted at trial, the transcript of the proceedings, the arguments of the parties, and the applicable law, the Court is now ready to rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Section 727(a) denies a discharge to a debtor who has been unscrupulous in various ways.

Thus, it is not unreasonable to expect and require the Debtor to maintain adequate records reflecting his financial affairs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   After several requests from the Trustee, the Debtor produced some records in connection with Best Seats, including tax documents, credit card statements, annual reports, bank statements, an inventory list, profit-and-loss statements, schedules of receivables and payables, and QuickBooks printouts. (Debtor Exs. 6-25, 28-30, 33-39.) Most of these exhibits, however, were not examined or considered in any detail during the trial that took place in January 2018, nor were they admitted into evidence. Rather, the Debtor submitted the exhibits to the Court with the pretrial materials, and they were discussed only generally at trial. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. 81:25-96:19.) Moreover, the records produced were incomplete, lacked detail, and, except for the one documenting the $12,000 wire transfer, did not account for the $202,000 in cash allegedly loaned to the Debtor by Auriemma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In his defense, the Debtor testified that his ticket brokerage company is\n   primarily a cash business. However, he also testified about various records that are generated for purchases or sales through Best Seats. (Tr. 180:15-183:8.) The Debtor further testified that the cash allegedly borrowed from Auriemma was paid to many third parties, including contractors who were remodeling the hot dog stand, sellers and purchasers of tickets through Best Seats, real estate taxing authorities, attorneys, and others. Thus, there were potentially dozens of sources of information and documentation that could have established the expenditure of the funds that the Debtor claims he borrowed from Auriemma. Although the Trustee requested production of such information, the Debtor produced absolutely no documentation evidencing the expenditures. Likewise, although the Debtor testified that Auriemma was a sophisticated businessman who owned Nationwide, a licensed mortgage brokerage firm, the Debtor produced no documents reflecting the receipt or disposition of any funds from Auriemma or Nationwide, except for the one wire transfer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Debtor tried to explain his lack of records in connection with both Best Seats and the disposition of the alleged Auriemma funds by claiming that his Home had been flooded in 2014. (Tr. 165:4-168:23.) According to the Debtor, he operated his ticket brokerage business out of his Home, and a flood in the basement where he kept some of his records caused them to be destroyed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In support of this contention, the Debtor produced a letter from State Farm to Best Seats; however, the letter, dated March 15, 2013, referred to a February 3, 2013 date of loss, not a 2014 occurrence. (Tr. 166:19-169:11; Debtor Ex. 5.) Moreover, the letter refers only to a claim for lost jewelry, noting that the jewelry was not covered because \"it d[id] not meet the insuring agreement of business personal property.\" (Debtor Ex. 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The other problem with the Debtor's explanation for his failure to keep or preserve records is that only one of the alleged Auriemma cash loans at issue was made prior to the claimed flood loss date of February 2013. According to the Debtor, the rest of the loans were all obtained after the date of the alleged flood. Further, by the Debtor's own testimony, the one alleged loan that was extended in 2012, purportedly for the remodeling of the Debtor's hot dog stand, was entirely a cash transaction for which there were no records. Thus, the Debtor's explanation for his inability to maintain or produce business records was completely lacking in credibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court and creditors are not obligated to reconstruct the Debtor's financial situation and are not required to take his word for his financial affairs in the absence of adequate records. Nor does the Trustee need to issue subpoenas or otherwise search for records from third parties in order to recreate a picture of the Debtor's financial condition or support his incredible justification for failing to keep records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Union Planters Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9446242,9512348\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/283/896/\">\n    283 F.3d at 899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Trustee bears only the burden of demonstrating the inadequacy of the Debtor's records,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Costello\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9092555\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/299/882/#p896\">\n    299 B.R. at 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and he has sufficiently satisfied this burden without difficulty. Thus, the Court finds that the Debtor has failed to keep or preserve adequate recorded information from which his true financial condition or business transactions might be ascertained with any kind of accuracy. The Court further finds that the Debtor has not offered any reasonable justification for his failure to maintain adequate financial records.

Less than three months later, on July 2, 2015, that equity was no longer available after the Debtor executed mortgages and security agreements in favor of Nationwide and/or Auriemma in the face amount of $375,000. In attempting to provide an explanation for the loss or disposition of that equity, the Debtor said that he needed to execute the financial documents, thereby losing the equity, in order to secure previously unsecured debts of $240,000 owed to Auriemma, as well as to obtain additional financing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Debtor's explanation is troubling and unsubstantiated. According to his testimony, the loan transactions were entirely in cash, and the Debtor produced no evidence showing the receipt of the funds or, for that matter, their subsequent use. As discussed above, the Debtor used the cash that was purportedly borrowed from Auriemma to pay various third parties, and, thus, any number of records documenting the use of the money could have been produced, including real estate tax bills and receipts, invoices for attorney's fees, credit card statements, and documents in connection with purchases and sales through the Debtor's ticket brokerage business. Despite these possible sources of documentation, the Debtor provided no records evidencing either the receipt of the $240,000 or the disposition of the funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As a result, the Debtor has failed to provide a satisfactory explanation for the disposition of both the $182,000 of equity in his Home and the $240,000 in loan proceeds from Auriemma. Thus, the Debtor's discharge must be denied under \u00a7 727(a)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    Section 727(a)(2)(A)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Finally, a debtor's discharge may be denied under \u00a7 727(a)(2)(A) when the debtor, \"with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud a creditor ..., has transferred, removed, destroyed, mutilated, or concealed ... property of the debtor, within one year before the date of the filing of the petition[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A).

In deciding whether a debtor has acted with intent to defraud for purposes of \u00a7 727, the Court should consider the Debtor's \"whole pattern of conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Richardson v. Clarke (In re Clarke)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1287463\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/332/865/#p870\">\n    332 B.R. 865\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 870 (Bankr. C.D. Ill. 2005) (internal quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In this case, as outlined above, in April 2015, the Debtor had at least $182,000 in Home equity that could have been available to pay his creditors. In July 2015, with an obligation of at least $80,000 owing to FirstMerit Bank in connection with the Cortland transaction, the Debtor executed a junior mortgage in the amount of $375,000 in favor of his friend Auriemma both to secure previously unsecured loans from Auriemma and to obtain additional cash from him, all totaling $240,000. Despite the Debtor's claim that he was trying to settle with FirstMerit Bank (and that he would have done so had the Bank been more reasonable), it is beyond dispute that he executed the junior mortgage at a time\n   when he owed a substantial debt to the Bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Debtor testified that the execution of the junior mortgage was not done with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors. Rather, the Debtor said, he was simply obtaining an additional cash \"advance\" and also fulfilling a pledge to Auriemma to secure otherwise unsecured loans because equity in his Home was now available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Based on this transaction, the Court finds that the Debtor transferred or removed the equity in his Home within one year of the filing of his bankruptcy petition for purposes of \u00a7 727(a)(2)(A). In doing so, he certainly preferred Auriemma over his other creditors, including FirstMerit Bank. Whether that action-combined with the Debtor's \"whole pattern of conduct\"-establishes that he acted with fraudulent intent with regard to his other creditors, however, is more difficult to conclude. Although the Debtor had a close relationship with Auriemma, the evidence does not sufficiently establish the other badges of fraud to permit the Court to find that the Debtor actually intended to defraud his creditors. As such, the Court does not find in favor of the Trustee on Count I of the complaint, and that count will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court finds in favor of the Trustee and against the Debtor on Counts II and III of the adversary complaint and holds that the Debtor is not entitled to a discharge under \u00a7\u00a7 727(a)(3) and (a)(5). As such, the Debtor will be denied a discharge under those counts. The Court further finds that the Trustee has failed to meet his burden under \u00a7 727(a)(2)(A) in Count I of the complaint. Accordingly, that count will be dismissed. A separate order will be entered consistent with this Memorandum Opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    Unless otherwise noted, all statutory references are to the Bankruptcy Code,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101\n    </extracted-citation>\n    to 1532.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Unless otherwise noted, all references to \"Pretrial Stmt. \u00b6 ----\" are to the Statement of Stipulated Facts contained in the Joint Pretrial Statement, as amended, filed in this adversary proceeding, No. 17-00192, on December 30, 2017 at Docket No. 35.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    Unless otherwise noted, all references to \"Bankr.
