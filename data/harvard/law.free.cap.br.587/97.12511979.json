The BAP Clerk's office issued a notice of deficiency requesting the parties to explain why these appeals should not be dismissed. Ms. Wilkins' counsel responded by requesting an extension of time to appeal under Rule 8002(d)(1)(B), claiming excusable neglect. Appellee, John J. Menchaca, the chapter 7 trustee, maintained that the standards for excusable neglect were not met and therefore the appeals should be dismissed. Appellee, Schreiber Family Trust (SFT),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   responded similarly and also contended that counsel's request for an extension of time to appeal was untimely under Rule 8002(d)(1)(B). Therefore, the Panel was required to dismiss the appeals for lack of jurisdiction. SFT subsequently filed a motion to dismiss these appeals on these same grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In light of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Hamer v.

FRAP(4)(a)(5) addresses the time deadlines for extending the 30-day period by motion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (5) Motion for Extension of Time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (A) The district court may extend the time to file a notice of appeal if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (i) a party so moves no later than 30 days after the time prescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (ii) regardless of whether its motion is filed before or during the 30 days after the time prescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires, that party shows excusable neglect or good cause.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (B) A motion filed before the expiration of the time prescribed in Rule 4(a)(1) or (3) may be ex parte unless the court requires otherwise. If the motion is filed after the expiration of the prescribed time, notice must be given to the other parties in accordance with local rules.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (C) No extension under this Rule 4(a)(5) may exceed 30 days after the prescribed time or 14 days after the date when the order granting the motion is entered, whichever is later.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In a unanimous decision, the\n   <em>\n    Hamer\n   </em>\n   court held that FRAP(4)(a)(5)(C), which limits the length of any extension, was a mandatory claim-processing rule because the time limit arises from a rule, in contrast to a non-waivable and non-forfeitable jurisdictional requirement arising from a statute. The court emphasized:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Only Congress may determine a lower federal court's subject-matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, a provision governing the time to appeal in a civil action qualifies as jurisdictional only if Congress sets the time. A time limit not prescribed by Congress ranks as a mandatory claim-processing rule, serving to promote the orderly progress of litigation by requiring that the parties take certain procedural steps at certain specified times.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611264\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/13/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The court further noted that the distinction between a jurisdictional rule and a claim-processing rule is \"critical\" because \"[f]ailure to comply with a jurisdictional time prescription ... deprives a court of adjudicatory authority over the case, necessitating dismissal-a 'drastic' result.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611264\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/13/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, \"[m]andatory claim-processing rules are less stern.

A strict construction of the 14-day time deadline for appeals from a bankruptcy court is consistent with the broader policies underlying the Bankruptcy Code. Time deadlines in bankruptcy are abundant and require all parties in interest to move swiftly so that estates can be administered and distributions can be made within a reasonable time. A strict time deadline for filing an appeal from a bankruptcy court's decision advances the interests of the parties by wrapping up the bankruptcy case in a timely manner and giving finality to the entire process. Accordingly, there is a legitimate policy interest embodied in a strict time deadline for appeals from a bankruptcy court's decision.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Jackson\n   </em>\n   , 585 B.R. at 419-20,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%202172693\">\n    2018 WL 2172693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7-8 (noting that the time-value of money and the depreciation of assets are benefitted by the quick appeals deadlines and the ability to make future financial decisions based on the finality of court determinations).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In sum, applying the bright line rule for transfer of adjudicatory authority between Article III courts articulated by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Hamer\n   </em>\n   -statutory deadlines are jurisdictional, non-statutory deadlines are not-suggests that the 14-day time deadline specified in Rule 8002(a) is a mandatory claim-processing rule subject to waiver. However, at the end of the day, the time deadline is incorporated in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) by reference to \"in the time provided by Rule 8002\" and has been consistently construed by the Ninth Circuit as a jurisdictional requirement. We thus conclude that the 14-day time deadline in Rule 8002(a) is a jurisdictional requirement that acts as an immutable constraint on our authority to consider and hear appeals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bowles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573311\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/205/#p209\">\n    551 U.S. at 214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3573311\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/551/205/#p209\">\n    127 S.Ct. 2360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that a court has no authority to create equitable exceptions to jurisdictional requirements).

Excusable Neglect\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In her December 4, 2017, response to the Panel's notice regarding the timeliness of this appeal, Ms. Wilkins sought an extension of time to appeal pursuant to Rule 8002(d)(1)(B). Rule 8002(d)(1) permits the bankruptcy court to extend the time to file a notice of appeal upon a motion filed within 21 days after the 14-day appeal deadline expired (or 35 days after the entry of the order being appealed) if the party shows excusable neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Ms. Wilkins' request was made 42 days after entry of the last orders she is seeking to appeal, beyond the deadline established by Rule 8002(d)(1). Appellees promptly objected to appellant's excusable neglect request, the chapter 7 trustee within two days and SFT within nine days. Regardless whether the deadline to seek an extension for excusable neglect is a jurisdictional time bar or a claim-processing rule, Ms. Wilkins failed to comply with the requirements to seek such an extension and SFT promptly objected to her attempt. Therefore, the request for an extension of the deadline to appeal fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
