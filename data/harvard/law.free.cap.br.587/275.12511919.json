The Committee has also filed a motion for stay of the Conversion Order pending appeal (Misc. No. 17-276) (\"Motion to Stay\"). Appellees, the United States Trustee (\"Trustee\") and the DDTL Parties\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   have each moved to dismiss the appeals.

BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 16, 2016, the Debtors filed for relief under chapter 11. Following court-approved sales of substantially all of their assets, the Debtors and the Committee, on September 8, 2016, filed the Joint Motion of the Debtors and Creditors' Committee for an Order Approving Settlement by and Among the Debtors, the Creditors' Committee, the Purchaser and the Ad Hoc Noteholders Group (B.D.I. 560) (\"Settlement Motion\"). The Settlement Motion sought approval of a \"structured dismissal\" that included a case-ending mechanism and a settlement agreement to distribute assets to certain creditors. While the motion was pending before the Bankruptcy Court, the Supreme Court issued\n   <em>\n    Czyzewski v. Jevic Holding Corp.\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272916\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/973/\">\n    137 S.Ct. 973\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=197%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20398\">\n    197 L.Ed.2d 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2017), a landmark decision that held that a bankruptcy court cannot approve end-of-case distributions that do not follow ordinary priority rules without the affected creditors' consent. The Committee maintained that its settlement was still permissible under a pre-\n   <em>\n    Jevic\n   </em>\n   decision,\n   <em>\n    In re ICL Holding Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341264,4345242\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/802/547/\">\n    802 F.3d 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir. 2015). In that case, the Third Circuit held that a party that purchased a debtor's assets could pay money to certain creditors to resolve their objections to the sale, even though such payment did not follow normal priority rules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ICL\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341264,4345242\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/802/547/\">\n    802 F.3d at 555-56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Third Circuit reasoned that while the secured lenders paid cash to resolve sale objections, those funds were not paid at the debtor's direction, were not proceeds from the secured lenders' liens, did not at any time belong to the estate, and would not become part of the estate even as a pass-through.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4341264,4345242\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/802/547/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The proposed settlement at issue here was a structured transaction whereby the Debtors transferred assets to their secured creditor in an asset sale, and in turn, the secured creditor would transfer these assets to a settlement trust for distribution to unsecured creditors while skipping creditors of higher priority. The Committee posited that this was permissible because the settlement assets to be distributed to unsecured creditors were not estate property. The Bankruptcy Court rejected that argument, holding that, even if\n   <em>\n    ICL Holding\n   </em>\n   survived\n   <em>\n    Jevic\n   </em>\n   , the proposed settlement, as a matter of fact, did not fall within the ambit of\n   <em>\n    ICL Holding\n   </em>\n   , and thus denied the motion to settle. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civ. No. 17-757, D.I. 10-1, 5/16/17 Hr'g. Tr. at 246:23-248:15). The Settlement Denial Order was entered on May 16, 2017. (B.D.I. 963). On May 30, 2017, the Committee timely appealed the Settlement Denial Order. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civ. No. 17-757, D.I. 1). The Debtors did not appeal the Settlement Denial Order, nor did any individual creditor or other party in interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 23, 2017, the Debtors moved to convert their chapter 11 cases to chapter 7 pursuant to \u00a7 1112(a) of the Bankruptcy Code (B.D.I. 1008) (\"Conversion Motion\"), citing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , the administrative insolvency of the chapter 11 cases. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5; B.D.I. 1126). The Committee urged the Bankruptcy Court to deny the Conversion Motion based on an \"equitable analysis of the facts,\" namely, that the Debtors had agreed to support the Settlement Motion, that conversion would jeopardize the Committee's appeal of the Settlement Denial Order, and that, absent reversal of the Settlement Denial Order, the unsecured creditors stood no chance of recovery on their claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   B.D.I. 1028 at 1-3, 13-16) (citing\n   <em>\n    In re Adler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8931146\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/329/406/\">\n    329 B.R. 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2005) ). The Bankruptcy Court held a hearing on the Conversion Motion on September 27, 2017. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Misc. No. 17-276, D.I. 1-1, 9/27/17 Hr'g. Tr.). The Debtors' Conversion Motion was supported by the Trustee and DDTL Parties. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   B.D.I. 1024; 9/27/17 Hr'g. Tr. at 29:15-35:8). The Bankruptcy Court concluded that no evidentiary hearing was necessary and converted the cases to chapter 7, effective October 2, 2017 (B.D.I. 1130) (the \"Conversion Order\"), based on,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , \u00a7 1112(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors' undisputed eligibility to be debtors under chapter 7, and the \"record that has been established over months of this case\" regarding administrative insolvency of the cases. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   9/27/17 Hr'g. Tr. at 35:10-39:16). The Committee timely appealed the Conversion Order on October 11, 2017. (B.D.I. 1145). On the same day, the Committee moved for a stay pending appeal in this Court, bypassing the Bankruptcy Court. (Misc. No. 17-276, D.I. 1). No other party appealed the Conversion Order. The Debtors' cases are now in Chapter 7, and the Trustee has appointed a Chapter 7 trustee. (B.D.I. 1143).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Trustee and the DDTL Parties have moved to dismiss the appeal of the Settlement Denial Order (Civ. No. 17-757, D.I. 43 &amp; 44) and the appeal of the Conversion Order (Civ. No. 17-1430, D.I. 8 &amp; 9) (\"Motions to Dismiss\"). The merits of the appeal of the Settlement Denial Order are fully briefed. (Civ. No. 17-757, D.I. 25, 33, 38, 42). Merits briefing on the appeal of the Conversion Order was stayed at the request of the parties pending the Court's decision on the Motions to Dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civ. No. 17-1430, D.I. 29). The Motions to Dismiss are fully briefed (Civ. No. 17-757, D.I. 43, 44, 45, 48, 49; Civ. No. 17-1430, D.I. 8, 9, 30, 31, 32). On February 9, 2018, the Court held oral argument on the Motions to Dismiss. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civ. No. 17-757, D.I. 57).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. CONTENTIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Trustee and DDTL Parties argue that, immediately upon the conversion of the Chapter 11 cases on October 2, 2017, \"the Committee automatically dissolved and ceased to exist.\" (Civ. No. 17-1430, D.I. 8 at 4). \"As mandated by the structure of the Bankruptcy Code, established by case law, and accepted by commentators, the Committee automatically dissolved upon the conversion of Constellation's case to chapter 7.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 9 at 2). \"Accordingly, the Committee had neither the power nor authority to file the Notice of Appeal [of the Conversion Order] on October 11, 2017.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 8 at 4). \"Moreover, as the Committee is now dissolved, it has neither the power nor authority to continue to prosecute the Conversion Appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8931146\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/329/406/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   According to the Trustee, the sole appellant has dissolved, and therefore all pending suits, by or against it, must abate. (Civ. No. 17-757, D.I. 44 at 5-6). \"The Supreme Court has held that, absent statutory authority providing otherwise, just 'as the death of [a] natural person abates all pending litigation to which such a person is a party, dissolution of a corporation at common law abates all litigation in which the corporation is appearing.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. v. Oklahoma\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6139964\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/273/257/#p259\">\n    273 U.S. 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 259,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6139964\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/273/257/#p259\">\n    47 S.Ct. 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6139964\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/273/257/#p259\">\n    71 L.Ed. 634\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1927) ). Similarly, litigation against a government-owned corporation abated once the corporation was dissolved by Congress. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6) (citing\n   <em>\n    Asociacion de Empleados del Area Canalera (ASEDAC) v. Panama Canal Comm'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046660\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/1309/#p1314\">\n    453 F.3d 1309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1314 (11th Cir. 2006) ) (finding \"no explicit or implicit expression of Congressional intent to prevent the abatement of any lawsuit filed against [the wholly government owned corporations] prior to their dissolution\"). The Trustee cites the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Oklahoma Natural Gas\n   </em>\n   as instructive:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   [C]orporations exist for specific purposes, and only by legislative act, so that if the life of the corporation is to continue even only for litigating purposes it is necessary that there should be some statutory authority for the prolongation. The matter is not really procedural or controlled by the rules of the court in which the litigation pends. It concerns the fundamental law of the corporation enacted by the state which brought the corporation into being.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Oklahoma Natural Gas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6139964\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/273/257/#p259\">\n    273 U.S. at 259-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6139964\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/273/257/#p259\">\n    47 S.Ct. 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to the Trustee, there is no reason to treat dissolution of the Committee differently: \"Much like a private corporation, a creditors' committee is an artificial entity created by statute, and it can exist only under the express law of the sovereignty by which it was created. After dissolution, there must be some statutory authority for the prolongation of its life for its litigation to continue, whether on its own or by a substituted party. As no statutory authority provides for the continued ability of the Committee to maintain litigation following its dissolution, the appeal must be dismissed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Committee raises several arguments in opposition to the Motions to Dismiss. The Committee argues that the Motions to Dismiss should be denied because they are premised solely upon the Conversion Order, which should be reversed. (Civ. No. 17-276, D.I. 23 at 3). According to the Committee, the Bankruptcy Court erred as a matter of law by declining to conduct an evidentiary hearing on whether conversion was appropriate or justified at that time in the chapter 11 cases. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3-4; Civ. No. 17-757, D.I. 45 at 17-19). The Committee further argues that, even if Conversion Order was properly entered, no provision of the Bankruptcy Code compels the Committee's dissolution upon conversion. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civ. No. 17-757, D.I. 45 at 8-16). Finally, even if the Bankruptcy Code mandates the Committee's dissolution\n   post-conversion, the Committee contends that it enacted a bylaw amendment purporting to transfer its rights in the appeal to an ad hoc committee of its former members, which now may pursue the Committee's rights in the appeal. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22-23).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    III. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Court has jurisdiction over the appeals pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). An order converting a case to chapter 7 is a final appealable order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Fleurantin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=420%20Fed.%20Appx.%20194\">\n    420 Fed.Appx. 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 196 (3d Cir. 2011),\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Rosson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3937656,3857325\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/545/764/\">\n    545 F.3d 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 770 (9th Cir. 2008) (joining \"all other courts of which we are aware that have considered the issue\" in holding \"that a bankruptcy court order converting a case from one under another chapter of the Bankruptcy Code to one under Chapter 7 is a final and appealable order\") (footnotes omitted). The Settlement Denial Order is also a final order. Under the \"merger rule,\" prior interlocutory orders merge with the final judgment in a case, and are reviewable on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Elfman Motors, Inc. v. Chrysler Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"906101\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/567/1252/#p1253\">\n    567 F.2d 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1253 (3d Cir. 1977) (\"the appeal from a final judgment draws in question all prior non-final orders and rulings which produced the judgment\"). Consequently, the interlocutory Settlement Denial Order has merged with the final Conversion Order and is now reviewable on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"906101\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/567/1252/#p1253\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Committee Automatically Dissolved Upon Conversion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Because the Debtors' chapter 11 cases have now been converted to cases under chapter 7, Appellees argue that the Committee has automatically dissolved, and the appeals must be dismissed. Appellees argue that, upon conversion, the legal entity that was the Committee ceased to exist; therefore, it had no authority to appeal the Conversion Order, and, as the sole appellant of the Settlement Denial Order, no longer has the authority or power to continue its appeal of that order either. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civ. No. 17-757, D.I. 43 at 4). According to the Trustee, numerous courts and commentators agree that a chapter 11 committee terminates upon conversion to chapter 7. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 44 at 2-3). Moreover, continued existence post-conversion as proposed by the Committee would raise a host of practical issues not addressed at all by the Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Rules. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 48 at 6-7). Conversely, the Committee argues that \u00a7 348 of the Bankruptcy Code, which governs the effect of conversion, does not provide for the automatic termination of the Committee nor for the loss of its rights. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 45 at 3, 9). The Committee argues that Bankruptcy Code is silent as to the effect of conversion on the rights and duties of a creditors' committee and that case law has implicitly recognized the right of a committee to continue an appeal post-conversion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court agrees that the legal entity that was the Committee automatically dissolved and ceased to exist as of the conversion of the chapter 11 cases to chapter 7. An official committee of unsecured creditors is created when appointed by the Trustee under \u00a7 1102 of the Bankruptcy Code, and it exists only under the framework of chapter 11. Section 103(g) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that, subject to an exception not applicable here, \u00a7\u00a7 1101 through 1146-which include the creditors' committee formation provision in \u00a7 1102 and the creditors' committee's powers and duties in \u00a7 1103-\"apply\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   in a case under such chapter\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , chapter 11.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20103\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) (emphasis added).

No. 17-757, D.I. 45 at 10-11). However, \u00a7 103(g) expressly provides that \u00a7 1103, and its subsection (c)(5) \"catchall provision,\" apply only to a case in chapter 11.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20103\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). According to the Trustee, the Committee's post-confirmation cases are easily distinguished, as they address a committee's role in cases where a plan of reorganization was confirmed-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , successful chapter 11 cases, to which chapter 11 provisions continued to apply. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civ. No. 17-757, D.I. 48 at 4). The DDTL Parties assert that, contrary to the Committee's arguments, these post-plan confirmation cases do not stand for the proposition that the Committee has \"a statutory grant of power to protect its own interests, regardless of time or circumstance, including following conversion of a chapter 11 case to chapter 7.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , D.I. 49 at 4).

Because the Committee asserts that the Conversion Order was entered erroneously,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Committee argues that it should be reconstituted and allowed to pursue both appeals. According to the Committee, a holding by this Court that a committee dissolves automatically upon conversion\n   will run afoul of due process and should not be permitted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   Taken together, the Conversion Order and the relief sought in the Motions to Dismiss would mean that a bankruptcy court can grant a debtor's motion to convert without any opportunity for an opposing party-even an estate fiduciary such as an official committee of unsecured creditors-to be heard or afforded due process. Instead, debtors would have the unilateral ability to divest an official committee of its statutory rights, and all related rights and powers arising under law, including vested appeal rights. Permitting conversion to operate as a dissolution of a committee and the forfeiture of all of its vested rights runs afoul of basic due process and should not be permitted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   (D.I. 45 at 5). The Court does not accept the Committee's \"parade of horribles\" argument. Any creditor could have appealed the Settlement Denial Order or the Conversion Order. No creditor chose to take on the expense of appealing either order, and they are now time-barred from doing so.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2) ; FED. R. BANKR. P. 8002(a)(1). The Bankruptcy Code also permits a creditor to intervene in a pending appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. BANKR. P. 8013(g). The appeal of the Settlement Denial Order was docketed June 14, 2017, and the Conversion Motion was filed on June 23, 2017. (B.D.I. 1008). Any creditor could have opposed conversion or sought to intervene in the appeal of the Settlement Denial Order within the time period provided by the Bankruptcy Rule 8013(g),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   but no creditor did so. The Committee argues that \"even if a debtor ordinarily has a right to convert, it was improper for a bankruptcy court to issue an order of conversion where to do so interferes with, or requires dismissal of, a pending appeal.\" (Misc. No. 17-276, D.I. 23 at 4). As the Trustee points out, the Committee \"suggests no limiting principle.\" (Civ. No. 17-757, D.I. 48 at 7). For this Court to adopt the Committee's position, and hold that a case may never be converted \"where to do so would interfere with ... a pending appeal,\" would merely introduce another avenue for potential gamesmanship and abuse in the proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    D.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D.I. 45 at 22).

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Trustee argues that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 25(c), which governs the substitution of parties and speaks to the situation in which \"an interest is transferred\" during the pendency of an action, applies only if \"substantive law allows the action to continue\" upon dissolution of a party. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Civ. No. 17-757, D.I. 48 at 9-10) (citing 7C Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur Miller, FED. PRAC. &amp; PROC. CIV. \u00a7 1958 (3d ed. 2007) ). There is no provision in the Bankruptcy Code that permits the Committee to hold or transfer rights or interests, nor is there any provision that permits the Committee to transfer its statutory duties to another entity. And there could be no \"transfer\" here, because the nature of any interests the Committee, as a statutory body and fiduciary, asserted in the appeal of the Settlement Denial Order are of wholly different cloth than personal interests held post-conversion by individual creditors. Only Congress may determine whether there is a successor in interest to a dissolved federal entity. The entity may not on its own name a successor to which it transfers its interests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Organic Cow, LLC v.

R. Civ. P. 25(c) where federal commission adopted resolution to transfer rights before dissolution, but no federal statute authorized the transfer). Unsurprisingly, the Committee cites no case where a creditors' committee has been permitted to reconstitute itself post-conversion pursuant to its own bylaws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, the Court rejects the Committee's argument that it is \"properly viewed as a creature of state law.\" (Civ. No. 17-757, D.I. 45 at 16). As an entity created and empowered by federal statute to exist solely for the duration of a chapter 11 bankruptcy case in a federal bankruptcy court, the Delaware statutes governing Delaware corporations are clearly inapplicable to the Committee. The question of whether the Committee may litigate post-conversion is solely one of federal law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ASEDAC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6046660\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/1309/#p1314\">\n    453 F.3d at 1316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (looking to federal statute to determine whether there was successor liability for federal corporation).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   A creditors' committee exists only under the statutory framework of the Bankruptcy Code. When these cases converted, the chapter 11 order for relief became an order for relief under chapter 7, the statutory predicate for the existence of Committee no longer applied, and the Committee automatically dissolved. As the Committee has dissolved, it has no capacity or authority\n   to appear before this Court, including filing the notice of appeal of the Conversion Order and any filings made in further prosecution of the appeal of the Settlement Denial Order. Because the Committee has no capacity to pursue these appeals, and there is no co-appellant to pursue these appeals, the appeals must be dismissed. Accordingly, the Court dismisses the Motion for Stay Pending Appeal as moot.
