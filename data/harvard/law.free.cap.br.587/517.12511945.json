No. 1] (the \"\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   \"), filed by Anthony Kontos (the \"\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff\n   </em>\n   \"), Independent Administrator of the Estate of Charles Vournazos (the \"\n   <em>\n    Decedent\n   </em>\n   \") in the above-captioned adversary case (the \"\n   <em>\n    Adversary\n   </em>\n   \"). The Complaint seeks a determination of dischargeability of debt under section 523(a)(4) of title 11 of the United States Code,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (the \"\n   <em>\n    Bankruptcy Code\n   </em>\n   \") and objects to the discharge of Denitza P.

While the Plaintiff has not proven all the grounds alleged, he has satisfied at least one of the grounds for denial of the nondischargeability of debt under section 523(a)(4). The Plaintiff is therefore entitled to a finding of nondischargeability on the elements he has established. Similarly, the Plaintiff has satisfied some but not all of the allegations under section 727(a). The Defendant's discharge will also be denied for those provisions of section 727(a) that the Plaintiff has proven.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   JURISDICTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The federal district courts have \"original and exclusive jurisdiction\" of all cases the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Compl., at \u00b6 3. The Plaintiff alleges that, at the conclusion of the Decedent's life, the Decedent was unable to manage his health and finances, so he enlisted the assistance of the Defendant as caregiver to assist him in those tasks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14. The Defendant's responsibility as caregiver involved receiving and opening the Decedent's mail, paying his bills, managing his medication and planning travel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In order to complete her responsibilities, the Defendant was granted access to both the Decedent's debit card pin number and access to the Decedent's checkbook. Tr. at p. 79, Apr. 25, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Plaintiff further alleges that, prior to the Decedent's death, the Decedent became extremely forgetful and confused and was often disorientated. Compl., at \u00b6 6. The Plaintiff contends that the Defendant, through the Defendant's role as caregiver, was able to exploit the access she had to the Decedent's finances by writing and cashing unauthorized checks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Plaintiff further alleges that \"throughout the period of at least three years prior to this [sic] death, [the Defendant] wrote regular checks to herself from [the Decedent's] bank account including but not limited [to] those allegedly representing her claimed 'salary.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7. The Defendant allegedly wrote checks to herself in excess of $600,000.00, which totaled more than double her claimed annual salary.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. Even after the death of the Decedent, the Defendant continued to write checks to herself from the Decedent's account totaling a combined amount of $37,500.00.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. The Plaintiff claims that the Defendant owed a duty to the Decedent and the transfer of substantial sums of money from his accounts was a breach of such duty.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After failing to succeed on a motion to dismiss the Complaint, the Defendant filed her Answer to Plaintiff's Adversary Complaint [Adv. Dkt. No. 18] (the \"\n   <em>\n    Answer\n   </em>\n   \"). Through the Answer, the Defendant denies that the Decedent had any significant medical condition affecting his mental abilities. Answer, at \u00b6 4. Further, the Defendant denies signing any checks drafted against the Decedent's bank account.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8. The Defendant also denies that the Decedent could not manage his health or financial affairs during the last three years of his life and, further, that the Decedent ever entrusted the Defendant with those responsibilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Defendant asserts in the Joint Pre-Trial Statement [Adv. Dkt No. 23] (the \"\n   <em>\n    Pretrial Statement\n   </em>\n   \") that she had a close relationship with the Decedent, a relationship that was more significant than that of a caregiver. Pretrial Stmt., at p. 12. The Defendant claims that this relationship was the result of the Decedent making the decision to never marry, have children or maintain any significant relationships with family members.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Defendant does not deny that, through this special relationship, she received a wide range of financial benefits from the Decedent. The Defendant contends that she \"was a more acceptable object of [the Decedent's] generosity than relatives with whom [he] had little contact and no emotional bonds.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On April 25, 2018, the court conducted a half-day trial on the matter (the \"\n   <em>\n    Trial\n   </em>\n   \"). At the conclusion of the Trial, the parties were directed to submit their closing arguments via post-trial briefs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [Scheduling] Order [Adv. Dkt. No. 37]. Both the Plaintiff and the Defendant submitted their post-trial briefs, though the Plaintiff's was one day late.

In response, the Defendant testified that the transfer was to her son for money that she held on his behalf, which allowed him to purchase an apartment in Bulgaria,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 114, the Defendant provided no records to that effect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Later, the Defendant explained that some of her money had gone to repair the apartment,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 116, an apartment she claims was owned by her son and not her. Other explanations involved helping family members, again with no records to support them. Even if these explanations were believable, none of them are meaningful in light of the magnitude of the missing funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The Defendant has failed to satisfactorily explain, within the meaning of section 727(a)(5), the loss and deficiency of the funds received from the Decedent. As section 727(a)(5) requires no showing of fraudulent intent,\n   <em>\n    Prairie Prod. Credit Assoc. v. Suttles\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Suttles\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6034905,6126646\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/819/764/\">\n    819 F.2d 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 766 (7th Cir. 1987), the foregoing suffices and the Plaintiff has met his burden of proof. Denial of the Defendant's discharge is, therefore, also proper under section 727(a)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    11 U.S.C \u00a7 727(a)(6)(A)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Section 727(a)(6)(A) provides that a court shall grant a debtor's discharge unless the debtor \"has refused, in the case-to obey any lawful order of the court, other than an order to respond to a material question or to testify.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6)(A). The Complaint details that the Defendant was issued a summons under Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 2004, which serves as a lawful court order. Compl., at \u00b6 27. Defendant was asked to produce records relating to her bank accounts, in addition to documents relating to the trade-in of a Mercedes GLK. PX No. 8. However, the Defendant failed to produce the requested documentation. When asked if the Defendant attempted to get the requested records from her bank the Defendant responded: \"No.\" Rule 2004 Exam Transcription, at p. 5. When the Defendant was asked if she acquired information pertaining to her vehicle, she stated that it was her intent to request the documents the following day from the dealership.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    at p. 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ultimately, the Defendant never produced the requested records as required by the summons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Section 727(a)(6)(A) gives the court discretion to determine if violation of a court's order is so severe as to require denial of discharge.\n   <em>\n    Clark v. Tieszen\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    In re Tieszen\n   </em>\n   ), Case No. 98B27403,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1999%20WL%20669263\">\n    1999 WL 669263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (Bankr. N.D. Ill. Aug. 24, 1999) (Squires, J.). In exercising that discretion, the court notes that the offending acts alleged by the Plaintiff are each matters that could have been addressed with\n   discovery orders under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 37 and/or 45. The court is not of the opinion that simple discovery disputes should be, absent more such pattern of obstruction or willful contempt, escalated to the level of denial of discharge. The exception in section 7272(a)(6)(A) regarding material questions and testimony implies as much. Perhaps had orders under these rules been issued and refused, the matter would be different. As it stands, however, the Defendant's actions are better handled by the preceding sections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Further, as the Fourth Circuit has noted, \"the term in section 727(a)(6)(A) is 'refused' not 'failed.' \"\n   <em>\n    Smith v.

While the Plaintiff has demonstrated that the Defendant failed to comply with these requests, more must be done to demonstrate that the Defendant refused to comply. It was not, and the court therefore declines relief under this section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   CONCLUSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The court therefore finds that the Plaintiff has proven by a preponderance of the evidence that section 523(a)(4) has been satisfied and that the Defendant's debt due to the Plaintiff is not dischargeable. The Defendant has committed fraud and defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity and has committed embezzlement. Further, the Plaintiff has proven by a preponderance of the evidence his claims under sections 727(a)(3) and (a)(5). The Defendant will be denied a discharge in her bankruptcy case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   As a result, by separate judgement order entered concurrently herewith, judgment in favor of the Plaintiff will be rendered on both Counts of the Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <em>\n    JUDGMENT ORDER\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The matter before the court arises out of the Adversary Complaint Objecting to and Opposing Dischargeability of Debt [Adv.
