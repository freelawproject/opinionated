The issue here is important and straightforward. The Debtors signed the promissory note, a New York Fixed Rate Note, on December 3, 2003, in favor of IndyMac Bank, F.S.B. (\"IndyMac\"), secured by a mortgage on their condominium located at 319 East 105 Street, Unit # 5E, New York, New York 10029 (the \"Property\"). At some time thereafter, IndyMac endorsed the note in blank. IndyMac failed on July 11, 2008 and was taken over by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the \"FDIC\"). The FDIC sold most of IndyMac's assets to OneWest Bank (\"OneWest\"), which was acquired by CIT Group (\"CIT\") in July 2014. No evidence has been offered that Ditech or Green Tree Servicing, LLC (\"Green Tree\"), with which Ditech merged in 2015, acquired assets from or had any contractual relationship with IndyMac, OneWest or CIT. No evidence has been offered to show who is in possession of the original note endorsed in blank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   New York law is clear that in order to have standing to file a proof of claim, or to foreclose on a mortgage, the holder of the note endorsed in blank must offer competent proof that it possesses the note. Ditech filed the Claim on December 26, 2017, without producing any proof that Ditech has the original note endorsed in blank. Despite multiple requests over many months by Debtors' counsel to Ditech and its counsel to provide evidence that Ditech holds the note, Ditech has failed to provide any proof thereof. Ditech's standing issue had been raised at a March 19, 2018 conference before this Court. Ditech's counsel filed a notice of appearance in this case on April 18, 2018 (ECF Doc. # 23) and filed on the same day a letter (the \"Letter,\" ECF Doc. # 24) advising the Court \"of an apparent standing dispute\" with respect to Ditech's Claim, and that counsel \"had requested Ditech to provide the original collateral file for the subject loan.\" The Debtors' counsel filed the Objection on May 3, 2018, noticed for hearing on June 19, 2018, with a response deadline of June 12, 2018. Ditech's counsel was served with notice of the Objection but did not file a timely response, and neither did Ditech's counsel appear at the June 19, 2018 hearing. The\n   Court took the matter under submission.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As discussed below, the Court laid out the legal requirements for an alleged mortgagee to establish standing to file a proof of claim in\n   <em>\n    In re Minbatiwalla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5876952\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/424/104/\">\n    424 B.R. 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 2010). The requirements have not changed since that decision. Ditech failed to meet those requirements. For the reasons explained below, the Court sustains the Debtors' Objection to the Claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On September 25, 2017 (the \"Petition Date\"), the Debtors filed their voluntary petition under chapter 11, and have since been managing their property as debtors in possession. (Obj. \u00b6 5.) The Debtors are the owners of the Property. The Debtors' Schedule A lists the value of the Property as ranging from $700,000 to $750,000. (ECF Doc. # 12-1 at 3.) According to the Debtors' Schedule D, the Property is subject to a lien held by IndyMac for a disputed claim in the amount of $400,000. (ECF Doc. # 12-3 at 1.) Schedule D lists IndyMac's claim as a contractual claim incurred in 2003. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Schedule E/F lists \"Indymac Federal Bank\" as having a $410,000 disputed claim. (ECF Doc. # at 2.) Ditech is listed on the creditors' list for \"notice purposes only.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 26, 2017, Ditech filed a proof of claim in this case for money loaned in the amount of $455,424.72, including interest and prepetition arrears, secured by the Property. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Claim at 1-2.) Ditech's Claim includes (i) the Debtors' loan payment history from June 2008 to November 2017 (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-15), (ii) a copy of the note, dated December 15, 2003, whereby the Debtors promised to pay the principal amount of $247,500.00 (the \"Note,\" Claim Part 2 at 1-3), (iii) the recordation of lien on the Property (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4), (iv) the mortgage (the \"Mortgage,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-23), and an affidavit (\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 25) and a certificate of merger (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 26) stating that Green Tree was merged into DT Holdings LLC and Ditech Mortgage Company and that such merger resulted in the entity Ditech as of August 31, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 19, 2018, the Court held a case management conference during which the Debtors' counsel raised the issue of Ditech's standing to file the Claim. On April 18, 2018, Ditech's counsel filed a notice of appearance (ECF Doc. # 23), and a letter advising the Court \"of an apparent standing dispute\" with respect to Ditech's Claim (ECF Doc. # 24). The letter stated that Ditech's counsel \"has requested Ditech to provide the original collateral file for the subject loan to my office.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The letter further explained \"[u]pon receipt of the file, my office is agreeable to coordinate with the Debtors' counsel to arrange a reasonable opportunity for the Debtors' counsel to review the file at our office.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ditech's counsel has not provided proof that Ditech has the original note endorsed in blank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 3, 2018, the Debtors objected to Ditech's Claim, arguing that Ditech had \"produced no documentation, be it the original note and mortgage or an assignment of same permitting them to have standing to assert its claim.\" (Decl. at 1.) The Debtors submit that they have no liability to Ditech, and that Ditech's Claim should be expunged. (Obj. Ex. A.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As explained below, New York law and bankruptcy law are clear that standing to\n   file a proof of claim in the bankruptcy court, or to permit foreclosure of a borrower's property in state court, requires that the lender or its agent (usually a loan servicer) holds the promissory note on which the mortgage is based. Standing to file a proof of claim or to lift the automatic stay to permit foreclosure involve largely the same analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Ditech's Claim asserts a claim against the Debtors for money loaned in the amount of $455,424.72, including interest and prepetition arrears, secured by the Property. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Claim at 1-2.) Ditech's Claim attached the Debtors' loan payment history, the Note, endorsed in blank, the recordation of lien on the Property, and the Mortgage. The original payee of the Note was IndyMac. Because Ditech is not the original holder of the Note, to establish its standing as an assignee, Ditech was required under New York law to provide proof of an assignment, or by demonstrating that it has physical possession of the Note endorsed in blank.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Conde-Dedonato\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061002\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/391/247/#p250\">\n    391 B.R. at 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Thus, a mortgage and note can be transferred by delivery, and do not have to be evidenced by a written assignment.\") Some courts have also recognized standing where the creditor has filed one or more affidavits from individuals with personal knowledge establishing facts supporting standing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    HSBC Bank USA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%204374284\">\n    2007 WL 4374284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (requiring multiple affidavits and a valid power of attorney from alleged assignee to demonstrate standing).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   But Ditech failed to satisfy any of these requirements. Ditech failed to produce either the original Note, an assignment thereof, or any affidavit supporting its standing; and any effort by Ditech to prove standing through proof of assignment of the Mortgage alone would similarly fail. \"[F]oreclosure of a mortgage may not be brought by one who has no title to it and absent transfer of the debt, the assignment of the mortgage is a nullity.\"\n   <em>\n    Lippold\n   </em>\n   , 457 B.R. at 297 (omitting citation). Instead, the Note shows an assignment in blank from IndyMac as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   PAY TO THE ORDER\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   WITHOUT RECOURSE\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   INDYMAC BANK F.S.B.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Vincent Dombrowski\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   VINCENT DOMBROWSKI\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   [\n   <em>\n    illegible\n   </em>\n   ]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   (Note at 3.) The assignment in blank (as a result of the blank space between \"PAY TO THE ORDER OF\" and \"WITHOUT RECOURSE\") from IndyMac required Ditech to prove it had possession and was the holder of the Note.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Idicula\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4162353\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/484/284/#p287\">\n    484 B.R. at 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that delivery and possession of the original note endorsed in blank is the legal basis for the authority of claimant to lift the automatic stay). Ditech did not provide any evidence of such possession.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Moreover, Ditech filed its Claim as \"Ditech Financial LLC fka Green Tree Servicing LLC\"; the Claim includes a certificate of merger stating that Green Tree was merged into DT Holdings LLC and Ditech Mortgage Company, and the merger resulted in the entity Ditech. But no evidence was provided of any relationship between IndyMac (the original payee on the Note), OneWest, which acquired most of IndyMac's assets from the FDIC, or CIT, which acquired OneWest, on the one hand, and Ditech or Green Tree, on the other hand. IndyMac endorsed the Note in blank, but no evidence has been provided as to what happened to the Note after IndyMac endorsed it in blank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Ditech's counsel learned about the standing dispute no later than March or April 2018. One thing that is clear is Ditech has not provided any proof of what happened to the Note, or that Ditech ever owned it. Therefore, Ditech has failed to present evidence to demonstrate that it has standing to assert its Claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Ditech Has Not Satisfied Its Prima Facie Burden to Support Its Proof of Claim\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Ditech has not met its evidentiary burden under the Bankruptcy Code and Rules to substantiate its Claim. Only properly prepared and supported proofs of claim constitute\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   evidence of the validity and amount of a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. BANKR. P. 3001(f). Bankruptcy Rule 3001(c) required that Ditech attach either the original or the duplicate of the Note.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FED. R. BANKR. P. 3001(c) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lundberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%204829846\">\n    2008 WL 4829846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (\"If, however, the claimant fails to allege facts in the proof of claim that are sufficient to support the claim,\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   by failing to attach sufficient documentation to comply with Fed. R. Bankr. P. 3001(c), the claim is not automatically disallowed; rather, it is merely deprived of any\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   validity which it could otherwise have obtained.\"). While Ditech's Claim attached a photocopy of the Note endorsed in blank, no evidentiary support was provided that at any point in time the original of the Note endorsed in blank was delivered to Ditech and that it possesses that original today. As this Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Minbatiwalla\n   </em>\n   ,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Upon request of the debtor, the creditor has an obligation to provide an additional documentation underlying its summary and affidavit (such as the original note and mortgage, or a written assignment), within two weeks after dispatch or communication of such a request, or the debtor can file an objection based on a lack of adequate documentation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5876952\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/424/104/\">\n    424 B.R. at 117\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Debtors' counsel repeatedly requested that Ditech produce documentation establishing its standing. As discussed above, the standing issue was raised with the Court in March and April 2018, and Ditech's counsel filed a letter stating that it had requested Ditech to provide the collateral file. (ECF Doc. # 24.) Ditech's counsel represented that it would file such documentation on the docket.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Debtors' Claim Objection is Sustained and the Claim is Expunged\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Because Ditech has not satisfied its burden demonstrating that it has standing to assert its Claim, and did not make a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   showing that it is the holder of the Note, the Debtors' Objection is sustained.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Minbatiwalla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5876952\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/424/104/\">\n    424 B.R. at 119-20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"in certain circumstances\n   claims can be disallowed for failure to support the claim with sufficient evidence ... because absent adequate documentation, the proof of claim is not sufficient for the objector to concede the validity of a claim\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   However, it appears that a lien exists on the Property. Although Ditech does not demonstrate that it holds the Note, the original Mortgage was recorded against the Property. The Debtors' schedules list the Property as being subject to a lien held by IndyMac for a disputed claim of $400,000 (ECF Doc. # 12-3 at 1); and IndyMac is listed as having a disputed contractual claim incurred in 2003. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Debtors signed the Note to IndyMac in 2003. Ditech asserts the Claim for approximately the same amount as IndyMac's disputed claim listed by the Debtors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Parrish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8963411\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/326/708/#p718\">\n    326 B.R. at 718-19\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that even where a creditor fails to attach sufficient documentation to its proof of claim, where the debtor schedules a claim that is substantially similar to the claim at issue by the purported assignee, but to the benefit of a different creditor, the debtor's acknowledgment in schedules that a lien exists against the property enable the court to sustain the objection but permit the filing of new proofs of claim).
