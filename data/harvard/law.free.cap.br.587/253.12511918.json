LANE, UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Before the Court is the motion (the \"Motion\") [ECF No. 232] of Antonio Reinaldo Rabelo Filho, the foreign representative for the debtors in the above-captioned Chapter 15 cases (collectively, the \"Chapter 15 Debtors\"), requesting that this Court give full force and effect and grant comity in the United States to the foreign restructuring plan (the \"Brazilian RJ\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plan\") confirmed in their Brazilian judicial reorganization (the \"Brazilian RJ Proceeding\") pending before the Seventh Business Court of Rio de Janeiro (the \"Brazilian RJ Court\") and also seeking related relief pursuant to Sections 105(a), 1145, 1507(a), 1521 and 1525(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Chapter 15 Debtors include Oi S.A. (\"Oi\"), Telemar Norte Leste S.A. (\"Telemar\"), Oi Brasil Holdings Co\u00f6peratief U.A. (\"Coop\"), and Oi M\u00f3vel S.A. (\"M\u00f3vel\"). Three affiliates of Oi-Portugal Telecom International Finance B.V. (\"PTIF\"), Copart 4 Participa\u00e7\u00f5es S.A. (\"Copart 4\"), and Copart 5 Participa\u00e7\u00f5es S.A. (\"Copart 5\")-are also debtors in the Brazilian RJ Proceeding, but are not debtors in these Chapter 15 proceedings. These three affiliates, together with the Chapter 15 Debtors, are referred to collectively as the \"Brazilian RJ Debtors.\" The Brazilian RJ Debtors and their non-debtor affiliates are referred to collectively as the \"Oi Group.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Several parties have interposed objections to the language of the proposed order submitted by the Chapter 15 Debtors on the Motion, but these objections have since been resolved. That leaves only one objection to the Motion-an objection (the \"Objection\") [ECF No. 245] filed by Pharol, SGPS S.A. (\"Pharol\"), Bratel B.V. and Bratel S.\u00c0.R.L. (\"Bratel,\" and, together with Pharol and Bratel B.V., the \"Pharol Parties\"), who are direct and indirect shareholders of Debtor Oi. Numerous other parties with an economic stake in the Brazilian RJ Proceedings have submitted statements in support of the Motion, including the Steering Committee for an Ad Hoc Group of Bondholders of Oi (the \"Steering Committee\"), the International Bondholder Committee (the \"IBC\"), and noteholder Solus Alternative Asset Management. One party, Jasper R. Berkenbosch, who is the insolvency trustee appointed in the Dutch insolvency proceeding of Chapter 15 Debtor Coop, has reserved his right to interpose an objection based on whether the plan proposed by Coop in those Dutch proceedings receives approval from creditors and the Dutch courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Nowhere in the Objection do the Pharol Parties ask this Court to rule on any of the legal issues that are still pending in proceedings in Brazil, including the pending appeals of decisions of the Brazilian RJ Court or an arbitration and mediation associated with the Brazilian RJ Proceeding. But the Pharol Parties do request that this Court exercise its discretion to delay giving full force and effect and granting comity to the Brazilian RJ Plan until all the proceedings in Brazil have been resolved. For the reasons discussed below, however, the Objection is overruled and the Motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Oi Group and the Filing of the Brazilian RJ Proceeding\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Oi Group is among the world's largest integrated telecommunications service providers, with over 70 million customers.\n   <em>\n    Declaration of Antonio Reinaldo Rabelo Filho in Support of the Motion for Order Granting Relief to (I) Enforce the Brazilian Reorganization Plan and (II) Grant Related Relief\n   </em>\n   (the \"Supporting Factual Declaration\") [ECF No. 230] at \u00b6 4. The Oi Group is also a critical source of telecommunications services in Brazil.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It is Brazil's largest fixed telephone service provider, with a market share of 34.5% of the total fixed-lines in service in the country.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On June 20, 2016, the Brazilian RJ Debtors initiated the Brazilian RJ Proceeding through the filing of a joint voluntary bankruptcy petition in the Brazilian RJ Court. Supporting Factual Decl. at \u00b6 20. The Brazilian RJ Debtors sought to restructure approximately BRL $65 billion\n   in third-party debt, which constituted the largest restructuring case in Brazil's history.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Ojas N. Shah was initially appointed as the foreign representative for the Brazilian RJ Proceeding with respect to of the Chapter 15 Debtors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The third-party indebtedness of the Oi Group that is subject to the Brazilian RJ Proceeding consists generally of four types of debt: (i) unsecured export credit facilities guaranteed or insured by export credit agencies or other quasi-governmental financial institutions; (ii) unsecured bonds and like securities issued, varyingly, under New York law, English law, and Brazilian law; (iii) two series of securities issued through Brazilian financial institutions, which consist of interests in lease payments owed by certain of the Brazilian RJ Debtors for the use of real property leased from other Brazilian RJ Debtors; and (iv) secured and unsecured bilateral and syndicated Brazilian bank debt.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 9. Because the Oi Group is financially integrated, certain of the group's entities engage in intercompany borrowing and lending.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10. As a result, certain of the Brazilian RJ Debtors owe intercompany debt, which is subject to restructuring under the Brazilian RJ Plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Proceedings in this Court\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On June 21, 2016, the day after commencing the Brazilian RJ Proceeding, Mr. Shah-on behalf of each of the Chapter 15 Debtors-petitioned for commencement of these Chapter 15 proceedings seeking recognition of the Brazilian RJ Proceeding as the foreign main proceeding of each of the Chapter 15 Debtors [ECF Nos. 7, 8]. On July 22, 2016, this Court entered the\n   <em>\n    Order Granting Recognition of Foreign Main Proceeding and Certain Related Relief\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 38], holding, among other things, that the center of main interests of each of the Chapter 15 Debtors is in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and recognizing the Brazilian RJ Proceeding as the foreign main proceeding of the Chapter 15 Debtors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On July 18, 2017, consistent with an order of the Brazilian RJ Court and pursuant to a resolution of the board of directors for each of the Chapter 15 Debtors, the Chapter 15 Debtors simultaneously (i) revoked the appointment of Mr. Shah as foreign representative of its Brazilian RJ Proceeding in the United States and his related power-of-attorney, and (ii) appointed Antonio Reinaldo Rabelo Filho as foreign representative (the \"Foreign Representative\") in the United States for its Brazilian RJ Proceeding and granted him a power-of-attorney to act as such.\n   <em>\n    See Disclosure Pursuant to\n    <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201518\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1518\n    </extracted-citation>\n    Regarding Substitution of Foreign Representative\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6 [ECF No. 79]. Thus, Mr. Rabelo replaced Mr. Shah as the foreign representative of the Brazilian RJ Proceeding for each of the Chapter 15 Debtors. Supporting Factual Decl. at \u00b6 107.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On July 7, 2017, Mr. Berkenbosch commenced a Chapter 15 proceeding in this Court-Case No. 17-11888-requesting that this Court terminate its prior order recognizing the Brazilian RJ Proceeding as a foreign main proceeding for Chapter 15 Debtor Coop and instead recognize Coop's Dutch bankruptcy proceeding as its foreign main proceeding. [ECF No. 69]. Both Mr. Rabelo and the Steering Committee filed objections to this request. [ECF Nos. 105, 108]. Mr. Berkenbosch and the IBC filed replies to these objections. [ECF Nos. 123, 124]. After extensive litigation-including a trial-this Court issued a memorandum decision denying recognition of the Dutch petition and declining to modify or terminate its prior recognition of the Brazilian RJ Proceeding as the foreign main proceeding for Coop. The issues in that litigation were\n   complex and will not be discussed in depth here in the interest of brevity. But they are set forth in detail in two written decisions:\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Oi Brasil Holdings Cooperati\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    f U\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    A\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268677\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/578/169/\">\n    578 B.R. 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

S.D.N.Y. 2018) (denying request for partial reconsideration of that decision). Of note, however, is that the warring parties in that litigation stand united today in support of the Foreign Representative's motion to grant comity to the Brazilian RJ Plan and for related relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Events in the Brazilian RJ Proceeding\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Since the filing of the Brazilian RJ Proceeding, the Brazilian RJ Debtors have negotiated with stakeholders through the course of a highly contentious, year-and-a-half long, multijurisdictional restructuring process. Supporting Factual Decl. at \u00b6 25. These discussions ultimately led to the consensual approval and subsequent confirmation of the Brazilian RJ Plan in Brazil.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12420939\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/582/358/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Several bondholder groups actively participated in the restructuring process, including through litigation in the Brazilian courts. Supporting Factual Decl. at \u00b6 26. For instance, both the Steering Committee, as well as the IBC, filed pleadings with and requested relief from the Brazilian RJ Court throughout the Brazilian RJ Proceeding.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12420939\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/582/358/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Creditors of Coop and PTIF, two entities of particular contention in the process, also participated extensively. Specifically, creditors Syzygy Capital Management, LTD. and Capricorn Capital Ltd.-funds managed by Aurelius Capital Management, LP-both filed pleadings with and requested relief from the Brazilian RJ Court.\n   <em>\n    Post-Trial Memorandum of Decision\n   </em>\n   [ECF No. 174] at 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The first draft of the Brazilian RJ Plan was filed on September 5, 2016, in compliance with the timeline required under the Brazilian bankruptcy law. Supporting Factual Decl. \u00b6 27. Both prior and subsequent to this filing, company management attended in-person meetings in New York and Brazil with various parties-in-interest, including the Oi Group's Brazilian bank creditors, the Brazilian telecommunications regulator Ag\u00eancia Nacional de Telecomunica\u00e7\u00f5es (\"ANATEL\"), lenders under the Oi Group's export credit facilities, and representatives of bondholder groups, such as the Steering Committee, members of the IBC, and other significant holders of the notes issued by Oi, Coop and PTIF. Seventh Statement Notifying the Court of the Status of the Restructuring (the \"Seventh Declaration\") [ECF No. 201] at \u00b6 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On March 28, 2017, the Brazilian RJ Debtors filed its first series of proposed modifications to the Brazilian RJ Plan, on the basis of requests made by parties during negotiations. Supporting Factual Decl. at \u00b6 29. Further modifications were considered in the following months, and a revised version of the Brazilian RJ Plan was filed on October 11, 2017.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12420939\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/582/358/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On numerous occasions during October, November and December of 2017-prior to the filing of the final version of the Brazilian RJ Plan-representatives from certain creditors met with the company and its financial and legal advisors to discuss additional modifications.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On November 27, 2017, the company filed a new version of the Brazilian RJ Plan along with a modified draft term sheet that incorporated feedback from discussions with various stakeholders, including ANATEL, Caixa Econ\u00f4mica Federal, Ita\u00fa Unibanco, and Banco do Brasil. Seventh Declaration at \u00b6 4. These modified terms went on to become the material economic terms of the final Brazilian RJ Plan.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Company also came to an agreement with the IBC and the Steering\n   Committee on the material economic terms of a new equity capital infusion to follow implementation of the Brazilian RJ Plan and the backstop of that offering by certain bondholders.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Supporting Factual Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 27, 31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   While the Brazilian RJ Plan was being revised, other events were taking place. Notice of the filing of the first draft of the Brazilian RJ Plan was published on September 30, 2016, after which creditors of the Brazilian RJ Debtors had 30 business days to file objections to the Brazilian RJ Plan. Supporting Factual Decl. at \u00b6 28. Following the filing of various objections, the Brazilian RJ Court set the General Meeting of Creditors (the \"GCM\") on approval of the Brazilian RJ Plan for October 9, 2017 on first call and, if necessary, October 23, 2017 on second call.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Brazilian RJ Court postponed the GCM several times, with final dates set for December 19 and 20, 2017 on first call and, if necessary, February 1 and 2, 2018 on second call.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In anticipation of this pending creditor vote, on November 16, 2017, the Brazilian RJ Court entered a decision that revoked the power to participate in the restructuring process of those it found to be conflicted members of Oi's executive officers that had been appointed by Oi's board of directors (i.e., members nominated or appointed by certain of Oi's shareholders). Seventh Declaration at \u00b6 5. In that decision, the Brazilian RJ Court also vested sole authority over the restructuring process with Oi's chief executive officer and directed him to present the final Brazilian RJ Plan no later than December 12, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Following this decision, the Brazilian RJ Debtors filed a new version of the Brazilian RJ Plan on December 12, 2017. Supporting Factual Decl. at \u00b6 31. The GCM was then held on December 19 and 20, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   During the course of the GCM, the Brazilian RJ Plan was further modified with input from voting parties, and consolidated into a final version dated December 20, 2017.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This was the version approved by the creditors and ultimately confirmed, with certain modifications, by the Brazilian RJ Court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Under Brazilian bankruptcy law, the GCM could only be assembled on first call if attended by creditors, or their valid representatives, that held more than 50% of the value of total allowed claims in each of the Brazilian RJ Debtors' four creditor classes: labor-related claims (\"Class I\"); secured claims (\"Class II\"); unsecured claims, statutorily or generally privileged claims, and subordinated claims (\"Class III\"); and claims held by \"small companies\" under Brazilian law (\"Class IV\").\n   <em>\n    Declaration of S\u00e9rgio Ricardo Savi Ferreira in Support of the Motion for Order Granting Relief to (I) Enforce the Brazilian Reorganization Plan and (II) Grant Related\n   </em>\n   Relief (the \"Supporting Legal Declaration\") [ECF No. 231] \u00b6\u00b6 29, 32. Attendance at the GCM easily met this quorum requirement, with the following percentages by value of claims in attendance: 92.28% of Class I, 100% of Class II, 98.57% of Class III, and 59.04% of Class IV. Supporting Factual Declaration, Exhibit C at 5-6. Indeed, the GCM was of unprecedented size, drawing participation from over 36,000 creditors, in what the Brazilian RJ Court described as, \"numbers never before seen in a Brazilian judicial reorganization proceeding.\" Supporting Factual Decl., Exhibit C at II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Creditors in attendance or represented at the GCM had the option of voting for, against, or abstaining from voting on, the Brazilian RJ Plan. Supporting Legal Decl. at \u00b6 29; Supporting Factual Decl. at \u00b6 48. But prior to voting on approval of the Brazilian RJ Plan itself, creditors voted on\n   whether they wanted the Brazilian RJ Plan to proceed on the terms of a consolidation of the Brazilian RJ Debtors. Supporting Factual Decl. at \u00b6 49. Since the Oi Group is economically interconnected through related intercompany agreements, guarantees, and obligations, and because managerial, administrative, and financial decisions are made by Oi for the benefit of the entire Oi Group, the Brazilian RJ Plan is based on the consolidation of the assets and liabilities of all the Brazilian RJ Debtors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 49. Consolidation was for voting and distribution purposes only and the Brazilian RJ Plan does not cause the corporate consolidation or merger of the Brazilian RJ Debtors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   This consolidation was overwhelmingly approved by the creditors of the Brazilian RJ Debtors at the GCM, with the following percentages by value of claims approving: 99.5% of Oi claim holders, 96.87% of M\u00f3vel claim holders, 99.88% of Telemar claim holders, 97.68% of Coop claim holders, 99.09% of PTIF claim holders and 100% of Copart 4 and Copart 5 claim holders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Minutes of the GCM at 5-6, attached as Exhibit F to the Supporting Factual Decl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Following the vote approving consolidation, the creditors of the Brazilian RJ Debtors voted on approval of the Brazilian RJ Plan on a consolidated basis. Supporting Factual Decl. at \u00b6 53. The Brazilian RJ Plan was voted on and approved in overwhelming numbers in every class at a GCM that was also attended by a record number of creditors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Confirming Brazilian RJ Plan (the \"Brazilian Confirmation Order\") [ECF No. 230-3] at 5-6, attached as Exhibit C to the Supporting Factual Decl.

Supporting Factual Decl. at \u00b6 53.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On January 8, 2018, the Brazilian RJ Court entered the Brazilian Confirmation Order ratifying and confirming the Brazilian RJ Plan, but modified certain provisions relating to the reimbursement of creditors' advisor fees and the eligibility of bondholders to participate as backstop investors under the contemplated backstop agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brazilian Confirmation Order at 9, attached as Exhibit C to the Supporting Factual Decl. The Brazilian Confirmation Order was published on February 5, 2018. Supporting Factual Decl. at \u00b6 56. Under Brazilian law, a creditor has five business days from the publication of a confirmation order to file a motion for clarification, and, within fifteen business days after a decision on such motion is published, may file another motion for clarification or an interlocutory appeal of the same. Supporting Legal Decl. at \u00b6 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Several motions for clarification and interlocutory appeals have been filed with respect to the Brazilian Conformation Order. Supporting Factual Decl. at \u00b6 57. Although still subject to certain pending appeals, the Brazilian Confirmation Order and Brazilian RJ Plan have not been stayed, either fully or partially, and therefore remain in full force and effect, according to their terms, as of the date that the Foreign Representative's Motion was filed with this Court. Supporting Legal Decl. at \u00b6 44; Supporting Factual Decl. at \u00b6 57. A stay was sought by the Pharol Parties, among others, but was denied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Giuliano Colombo in Support of Steering Committee's Reply at \u00b6\u00b6 13-15, 17 (the \"Colombo Declaration\") [ECF No. 258].

Supporting Factual Decl. at \u00b6 118. The Brazilian RJ Court rejected the Partial Reconsideration Request, including the request for the Extraordinary Meeting.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Despite this, the Extraordinary Meeting was held and attended by a number of shareholders, including Pharol and Bratel.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On February 13, 2018, the state public prosecutor filed a request with the Brazilian RJ Court to suspend the rights of the shareholders who attended and signed the minutes of the Extraordinary Meeting and that those shareholders be removed from their positions for at least two years starting from the granting of the judicial reorganization.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . On March 7, 2018, the Brazilian RJ Court granted the prosecutor's request and issued a decision that suspended the \"political rights\" of those shareholders who voted at the Extraordinary Meeting and removed the members of the Board who were appointed by such shareholders, until the new equity contemplated by the Brazilian RJ Plan has been issued to creditors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 119.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Bratel has taken several appeals from decisions issued by the Brazilian RJ Court, including, but not limited to, an appeal of the Brazilian RJ Court's order revoking the power of the allegedly conflicted members of Oi's executive officers and the Brazilian RJ Court's order vesting authority over the restructuring process in Oi's CEO.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objection at 5-7. Bratel has also appealed the Brazilian Confirmation Order, and that appeal remains pending. Objection at \u00b6 5. In its appeal of the Brazilian Confirmation Order, Bratel asserts that the Brazilian RJ Court lacked jurisdiction to rule that a shareholders' meeting is unnecessary and that the shareholder rights provided for under Brazilian corporate law are not eliminated or superseded by Brazilian insolvency law, and therefore confirmation of the Brazilian RJ Plan without shareholder involvement or participation violated their rights. Objection at \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Pharol Parties are still actively pursuing their rights in the various proceedings in Brazil, including Bratel's appeals of the various decisions made by the Brazilian RJ Court and other Brazilian courts, as well as Bratel's pursuit of its interests as equity holders in both the mediation and the arbitration pending in Brazil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Conditions Subsequent in the Brazilian RJ Plan\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Brazilian RJ Plan sets forth the following conditions subsequent: (1) the restructuring of certain bondholder credits under the Brazilian RJ Plan shall take place by July 31, 2018; (2) a contemplated capital increase shall occur by no later than July 31, 2018, and (3) the contemplated rights offering shall occur no later than February 28, 2019. Supporting Factual Decl., Exhibit A at \u00a7 12.1. The Brazilian RJ Plan provides that the relevant creditors may approve a waiver or modification of a condition subsequent, by resolution of the holder of a simple majority of claims present and voting at a meeting called for the purpose of waiving or modifying the condition(s) subsequent described above.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 12.2. Absent a waiver by the procedure set forth in the Brazilian RJ Plan, failure of any condition subsequent that is not waived may result in the termination of the Brazilian RJ Plan, at the discretion of the Brazilian RJ Court following consultation\n   with the judicial administrator and public prosecutors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     The Brazilian Arbitration\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   At some point, Bratel commenced an arbitration against Oi, pursuant to an arbitration clause in Section 68 of Oi's bylaws. Objection at \u00b6 6. The arbitration was commenced to, among other things, call a shareholders meeting to discuss the terms of the Brazilian RJ Plan affecting shareholders (i.e., dilution, capital increases and corporate governance issues), issues on which shareholders contend they have a right under Brazilian corporate law to appear and be heard and to prevent Oi from implementing the terms of the Brazilian RJ Plan that the Pharol Parties assert violate shareholders' rights. Objection at \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Oi initiated a proceeding before the Superior Court of Justice to determine which entity-the Brazilian RJ Court or the arbitrator-has jurisdiction over these issues. Objection at 8. Oi objected to the arbitration on the basis that only the Brazilian RJ Court has jurisdiction, and Bratel argued in response that there was no legal basis to transfer jurisdiction from the arbitrator to the Brazilian RJ Court. Objection at \u00b6 6. This jurisdictional question is currently pending decision. Objection at \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Bratel sought a preliminary injunction in the arbitration. In a decision on March 5, 2018, the arbitrator issued an order that, among other things, (i) recognized arbitral jurisdiction to consider the issues raised by Bratel; (ii) suspended the effects of possible approval of any resolution resulting from the meeting of Oi's Board of Directors on March 5, 2018, in which the Board deliberated on the capital increase, debt exchange, issuance of new shares and subscription bonus contemplated under the Brazilian RJ Plan. Objection at 8. The arbitrator's decision precluded Oi from implementing the capital increase, subject to a monetary penalty.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   However, the Superior Court of Justice granted a preliminary injunction at Oi's request, staying the effects of the decision rendered by the arbitrator. Objection at 8-9. The Superior Court of Justice also appointed the Brazilian RJ Court to decide any other preliminary injunction requests. Objection at 9. Bratel has filed an appeal of this injunction, which is currently pending.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   It is the Pharol Parties' position that the arbitrator's decision is stayed only as to the penalty, and that therefore under the arbitrator's decision Oi may not proceed with the implementation of the capital increase. Objection at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    F.\n    <em>\n     The Brazilian Mediation\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In addition to the arbitration, on April 2, 2018, the Brazilian RJ Court ordered Oi and shareholders Bratel and Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Mondiale to participate in mediation in an effort to resolve their disputes. Objection at \u00b6 7. Rejecting Oi's effort to exclude Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Mondiale from the mediation, the Brazilian RJ Court issued its decision on April 18, 2018, approving Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Mondiale's participation and ordering mediation to proceed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A mediator has been appointed, and substantive meetings were scheduled throughout the remainder of May. All parties to the mediation, including Oi, were to participate in a joint mediation conference during the week of May 21, 2018.

Similarly, the requests for instructions directing the Indenture Trustee to take certain actions with respect to securities in\n   accordance with the terms of the Brazilian RJ Plan, is also relief of a type available under U.S. law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Rede\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4195402\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/515/69/#p91\">\n    515 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   93 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201142\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (providing that a court \"may direct ... any ... necessary party to execute or deliver or join in the execution or delivery of any instrument required to effect a transfer of property dealt with by a confirmed plan, and to perform any other act ... that is necessary for the consummation of the plan\");\n   <em>\n    In re Washington Mut., Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201563880\">\n    2012 WL 1563880\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *38 (Bankr.

That plan is the culmination and ultimate resolution of the extensive Brazilian RJ Proceeding that was already granted recognition by this Court. It is impossible for the Brazilian RJ Plan to be fully consummated without granting recognition given the conditions subsequent in the plan. These conditions subsequent include, among other things, the issuance of U.S. securities, which cannot take place without an order granting the relief requested by the foreign representative. Granting the Foreign Representative's Motion is, therefore, essential to implementation of the restructuring and complete distributions and therefore consummation of the Brazilian RJ Plan. In granting the requested relief, the Court notes that the Brazilian RJ Plan is overwhelmingly supported by the stakeholders in the case, and that all stakeholders have had the opportunity to be heard in the Brazilian RJ Proceeding and to protect their rights under Brazilian law. As to the Pharol Parties, this is amply demonstrated by the extensive proceedings involving them in Brazil, including Bratel's appeals of decisions of the Brazilian RJ Court, as well as the existence of the arbitration and mediation in Brazil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In addition, the Court also concludes that the relief requested by the Foreign Representative here properly constitutes \"additional assistance\" pursuant to Section 1507 of the Bankruptcy Code. Specifically, the relief requested by the Foreign Administrator meets each of the factors in Section 1507.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The first factor of Section 1507(b) examines whether the additional assistance will reasonably assure \"just treatment of all holders of claims against or interests in the debtor's property.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201507\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). Case law relating to former Section 304(c) found this requirement to be satisfied where the foreign insolvency law provides a comprehensive procedure for the orderly resolution of claims and the equitable distribution of assets among all of the estate's creditors in one proceeding.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Treco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11130023,11136791\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/240/148/\">\n    240 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   158 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Culmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6546294\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/25/621/#p629\">\n    25 B.R. 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 629 (Bankr.

As described in greater detail in the Supporting Legal Declaration, Brazilian bankruptcy law provides such a comprehensive procedure, while at the same time maintaining the company's business and activities. Supporting Legal Decl. at \u00b6\u00b6 4-5, 15. Consensual approval of a plan under Brazilian law requires votes from a specified majority of each class of claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 33. This requirement has been met because all classes under the Brazilian RJ Plan voted overwhelmingly in its favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Brazilian bankruptcy law also provides additional creditor protections that justify granting comity in these circumstances. For instance, under Brazilian bankruptcy law creditors have the right to object to a plan within 30 business days after notice of its publication.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. Creditors may\n   also oppose a plan and propose amendments thereto during the GCM, up until a final approval by creditors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 27. Additionally, within five days of publication of a confirmation order, creditors may file a motion for clarification, and, within fifteen days of its publication, creditors may file an interlocutory appeal to the appellate court.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 43. Creditors are also given notice of decisions made by the Brazilian RJ Court, with the deadlines for filing appeals commencing from the date on which creditors are notified of such decision by means of a publication.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   A judicially appointed administrator also provides additional oversight of the process, ensuring that accurate information is distributed to the creditors and informing the Brazilian RJ Court if a debtor fails to meet its obligations under a confirmed plan or commits an act that violates the Brazilian bankruptcy law.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 15-17, 39.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The second factor in favor of granting comity under Section 1507 requires that the additional assistance reasonably assure \"protection of claim holders in the United States against prejudice and inconvenience in the processing of claims in such foreign proceeding.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201507\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2).

This argument takes several forms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   As a threshold matter, the Pharol Parties suggest that the Foreign Representative is trying to rush these enforcement proceedings through the Court too quickly. But this is wrong on several levels. The Foreign Representative's Motion was scheduled on ordinary notice in this Court and all interested parties were given a chance to be heard. Moreover, the Brazilian RJ Plan was confirmed over four months prior to the hearing on the Motion and all parties in interest have had at least that much notice of the plan's milestones and timeline, which were expressly incorporated in the Brazilian RJ Plan. Even before that point, multiple creditor constituencies were involved in active negotiations with the Brazilian RJ Debtors for months about the mechanics of any plan. To suggest that the Chapter 15 Debtors are now seeking an expedited request here to somehow short-circuit the process in Brazil is a clear mischaracterization of the facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Additionally, the Pharol Parties provide no timeline for how long this Court should wait until deciding the Foreign Representative's Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Objection at 21 (subsection caption stating that: \"The Enforcement Motion should be adjourned until all appeals, arbitration and mediation proceedings have been exhausted in Brazil.\"). In the face of a complaint by the Chapter 15 Debtors about the lack of any temporal limits to the Pharol Parties' approach, the Pharol Parties suggested at the hearing on the Motion that the Court simply delay proceedings until a further status conference on June 18, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. 78:3-6, May 29, 2018 (counsel for the Pharol Parties suggesting that parties come back for a status conference on June 18\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   when they might have a clearer picture on unresolved issues). Such a timeline would be highly problematic, however, as this is only a few days' prior to the deadline for at least two of the conditions subsequent that require relief from this Court to implement. Moreover, this approach would effectively provide the very same stay pending appeal that the Pharol Parties sought and were denied by the Brazilian courts. It is not this Court's role to effectively second-guess or overrule the determinations made by the Brazilian courts, particularly under the guise of comity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Perhaps to address these problems, the Pharol Parties suggest that the Chapter 15 Debtors call a meeting to allow creditors to vote on waiving the deadlines contained in the Brazilian RJ Plan. As a threshold matter, such an approach is exceedingly unlikely to offer a lasting solution here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. 81:12-19, May 29, 2018 (counsel to the Foreign Representative noting that \"to let all of the so-called unfinished business in Brazil play out\" could take years). But it is also exceedingly unlikely to work. As counsel to the Steering Committee noted at the hearing on the Motion, such a meeting would be extremely difficult to convene due to the thousands of creditors involved in the case and, in any case, his own client is currently not prepared to extend or waive the deadlines in the Brazilian RJ Plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. 85:5-15, May 29, 2018. That is not surprising given that the Brazilian RJ Plan was approved only after a lengthy and highly contentious process, and the deadlines contained therein were heavily negotiated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222238\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/533/83/#p103\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Against this backdrop, the possibility of getting all creditors to vote in favor of\n   delay-much less the extended delay sought by the Pharol Parties-is highly implausible. More importantly, it would be starkly at odds with comity for this Court to insert itself into the Brazilian process in such an intrusive way by effectively requiring the Brazilian RJ Debtors to convene another meeting of creditors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    SNP Boat Serv.

But these tests actually weigh against their position. As detailed above, the Brazilian RJ Debtors, various parties in interest and numerous creditor constituencies were involved in extensive negotiations regarding the terms of the Brazilian RJ Plan. These negotiations were ultimately successful, as the vast majority of creditors voted overwhelmingly in favor of the Brazilian RJ Plan. The Brazilian RJ Plan has been confirmed and such confirmation has not been stayed by the Brazilian courts. Numerous creditors have acted in reliance on the timely consummation of the transactions required by the Brazilian RJ Plan. Denying the relief requested by the Foreign Representative would work to the detriment of these vast creditor constituencies, instead serving only the parochial interests of the Pharol Parties. Indeed, three major creditor constituencies-the Steering Committee, the International Bondholder Committee and Solus-have all filed pleadings supporting the relief requested by the Foreign Representative. To grant the objection would essentially give the Pharol Parties-that do not even claim to speak for the interests of all shareholders-a pocket veto over the entire process, notwithstanding the wishes of the vast majority of stakeholders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Relatedly, the Pharol Parties suggest that granting the Foreign Representative's request would \"create[ ] a significant risk of legal and commercial uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the pending appeals in Brazil.\" Objection at \u00b6 31.

In fact, failure to grant the Motion and implement the Brazilian RJ Plan by the deadlines provided would cause more uncertainty. It would seriously risk the failure of the restructuring under Brazilian law and create the possibility of a mandatory liquidation of the Oi Group. That is because the Brazilian RJ Debtors' proceeding may be converted to a bankruptcy liquidation proceeding known as a\n   <em>\n    falido\n   </em>\n   following the occurrence of certain events, one of which is the failure of the Brazilian RJ Debtors to comply with the terms of an approved and confirmed judicial reorganization plan.

Following conversion to such a proceeding, a debtor is declared not capable of reorganizing and the debtor's assets are placed into liquidation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4159656\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/482/86/#p94\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, denial of the Motion would put at risk the entire global restructuring of the Brazilian RJ Debtors and their non-debtor affiliates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Moreover, a delay in granting the Motion would adversely affect creditors that are holding over USD $20 billion in restructured debt, including over USD $5 billion in New York law-governed bonds that have already been novated by the Brazilian RJ Plan under Brazilian law, and are entitled under the plan to receive a distribution of new securities. Foreign Representative's Reply to Objection of Pharol at \u00b6 5 [ECF No. 253]. Without a grant of the relief requested by the Foreign Representative, the Oi Group will be unable to successfully restructure its New York law-governed debt per the terms of the Brazilian RJ Plan. As explained above, the Brazilian RJ Plan has a timeline by which certain conditions subsequent must occur for the plan to become effective. The Brazilian RJ Plan provides that the non-occurrence of these events by July 31, 2018 results in termination of the plan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brazilian RJ Plan \u00a7 12.1, attached as Exhibit A to the Supporting Factual Declaration [ECF No. 230-1]. These conditions require, among other things, the issuance of U.S. securities, which cannot take place without this Court granting the relief requested by the Foreign Representative. Granting the Foreign Representative's Motion is, therefore, a prerequisite to implementation of the restructuring and complete distributions, and therefore consummation of the Brazilian RJ Plan. Importantly, the steps and timeline discussed above were incorporated in the Brazilian RJ Plan, which was subsequently approved by the Brazilian court in the Brazilian Confirmation Order. A delay in granting the relief requested could result in those parties having their claims discharged in Brazil, but not in the United States, which in turn could lead to the Chapter 15 Debtors facing lawsuits in the United States for debts that have already been discharged under Brazilian law. Foreign Representative's Reply to Objection of Pharol at \u00b6 5. The equities therefore clearly weigh in favor of granting the relief that these creditors approved of through their votes in favor of the Brazilian RJ Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   A grant of the Motion now is also consistent with the notion that Chapter 15 affords\n   greater deference after the recognition of a foreign proceeding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   Once a case is recognized as a foreign main proceeding, [C]hapter 15 specifically contemplates that the court will exercise its discretion consistent with principles of comity.

The principles of comity behind those decisions are very much at odds with the Pharol Parties' position.

The language in the proposed order, however, has been further revised to incorporate the Pharol Parties' concerns, and now additionally provides that in the event of a termination of the Brazilian RJ Plan, this Court's order would \"be deemed\n   <em>\n    void ab initio\n   </em>\n   to the extent rendered as such under Brazilian law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8451127\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/351/103/#p112\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, as the Court stated at the hearing, the Pharol Parties can always return to this Court to protect their rights under U.S. law to the extent necessary, a fact the Pharol Parties recognize.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Objection at 20 n.16. For these reasons, therefore, the Court finds that any legitimate issues raised by the Pharol Parties as to the proposed order have been properly addressed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   For all these reasons, the Court grants the Motion and the relief requested by the Foreign Representative and overrules the Objection in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    In fact, the Pharol Parties have not argued that the relief requested here would violate the public policy interests of the United States.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    The Court also finds that the other relief requested by the Foreign Representative is appropriate under the circumstances, including the requested injunctions, exculpations, and exemption relief under Section 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code. As this additional relief is not subject to a specific objection by the Pharol Parties, the Court will refrain from a detailed analysis as to each of these requests for relief.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    The Pharol Parties complain that granting the relief now would frustrate processes overseas such as the mediation.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Objection at \u00b6 23. But as the Brazilian courts that ordered the mediation also refused to grant a stay of the confirmation order, it is difficult to see how the existence of the mediation weighs in favor of the Pharol Parties.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    Of course, the Court takes no position on the merits of the Pharol Parties' appeals or other proceedings in Brazil. Despite the Pharol Parties having attached no less than four legal opinions regarding Brazilian law to its papers, the parties here actually have agreed that these issues of Brazilian law are not for this Court to decide.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Objection at \u00b6 21 n.14 (noting that the Pharol Parties offer the opinions not for the purpose of asking the Court to revisit the Brazilian Confirmation Order or to prejudge the outcome of the appeals, but rather to establish that the appeals are not frivolous).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    The Objection appears to be inconsistent on the issue of equitable mootness. On the one hand, it complains that the relief sought here could render foreign appeals moot while, on the other hand, it states that Brazilian law does not recognize the doctrine of equitable mootness.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Objection at \u00b6\u00b6 19-20.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
