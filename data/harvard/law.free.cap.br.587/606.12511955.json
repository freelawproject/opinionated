(D.I. 93.) Although Tribune Media Company and Tribune Media Retirees (Class 1F Creditors) raise different arguments in their respective appeals, the court will collectively refer to them as the\n   \"Appellees.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequently, on July 16, 2014, Aurelius appealed the court's decision. (D.I. 95.) On September 21, 2015 the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the court finding that Aurelius's appeal is equitably moot, but reversed the court finding that the Trustees' appeal is not equitably moot. (D.I. 102 at 23.) Presently before the court is the Appellants' appeal asking the court to find that the Bankruptcy Court erred in confirming the DCL Plan. (D.I. 109 at 1.) For the reasons that follow, the court will affirm the Bankruptcy Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 8, 2008, the Tribune Company (\"Tribune\") and its affiliates, the owners and operators of the\n   <em>\n    Chicago Tribune\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    Los Angeles Times\n   </em>\n   , and other newspapers, television stations and media properties nationwide, filed voluntary petitions for Chapter 11 protection. (D.I. 59 at 3.) The bankruptcy filings occurred approximately one year after Tribune and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the \"Debtors\") completed a leveraged buyout (\"LBO\") in December 2007. (D.I. 40 at 12-15.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prior to the LBO, Tribune had a market capitalization of approximately $8 billion and around $5 billion in debt. (D.I. 60-1 at 4.) Tribune's debt included (1) $10.2 billion in LBO debt; (2) $1.2 billion in \"Senior Notes,\" for which the Trustees served as indenture trustee; (3) around $1 billion in subordinated debt-the PHONES Notes and the EGI Notes; and (4) $265 million in \"Other Parent Claims\" consisting of $105 million of claims by Tribune Media Retirees (\"TM Retirees\"), $9 million of trade and miscellaneous debt, and the $151 million \"Swap Claim\" arising from termination of an interest rate swap agreement tied to the LBO debt.\n   <em>\n    In re Tribune Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673142\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/464/126/#p137\">\n    464 B.R. 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 137-41, 194-95 (Bankr. D. Del. 2011) (\"\n   <em>\n    Tribune I\n   </em>\n   \"); (D.I. 110 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Trustees represent the interests of certain pre-LBO debt treated as \"Class 1E Creditors\"-Tribune's Senior Noteholders-in the Plan. (D.I. 109 at 3.) Two other series of Tribune Notes-the PHONES notes and the EGI Notes-are contractually subordinate to the Senior Notes. (D.I. 109 at 3.) The Senior Notes are referred to as \"Senior Indebtedness\" in the contract governing the PHONES Notes and as \"Senior Obligations\" in the contract governing the EGI Notes. (D.I. 109 at 3.) According to the subordination agreements, if Tribune went bankrupt, any recovery by the PHONES and EGI Notes would be payable to the Class 1E Creditors. The Plan, however, provides that any recovery from those Notes are distributed pro rata between Class 1E and Class 1F.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The latter has about 700 creditors in it, the majority of whom \"are individuals and small-business trade creditors.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Tribune Co. et al.\n   </em>\n   , Nos. 12-cv-1072,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%202797042\">\n    2014 WL 2797042\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (D. Del. June 18, 2014) ; (D.I. 93.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before trial, the parties stipulated to the monetary impact of the PHONES and EGI subordination on distributions to the Trustees and holders of Other Parent Claims. (D.I. 109-1 at A95-98.) Among other things, the parties agreed that the Trustees' initial recoveries under the plan would increase from 33.6% (31 million) to 35.9% ($461 million) if they were the only creditors entitled to benefit from the relevant subordination agreements. (D.I. 109-2 at A95-98.) The difference between the Trustees' recovery under the Plan (33.6%) and the Trustees' desired recovery had they been able to enforce all of their alleged subordination rights (35.9%) was 2.9% by recovery percentage. (D.I. 110 at 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During the bankruptcy case, Tribune and its primary creditor constituents negotiated a compromise of various avoidance claims related to the LBO. The holders of the LBO debt agreed to contribute nearly $535 million in guaranteed settlement payments plus litigation trust interest. This produced another $225 million in settlement value.\n   <em>\n    Tribune I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3673142\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/464/126/#p137\">\n    464 B.R. at 153-54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Tribune then proposed its Plan, which provided for the Trustees and holders of Other Parent Claims to share the settlement consideration. (D.I. 109-2 at A118.) The Trustees objected, arguing they alone were entitled to recoveries otherwise allocable to the subordinated PHONES and EGI Notes and that, as a consequence, the Plan unfairly discriminated against them by sharing those recoveries with the class of Other Parent Claims. To address this issue, the Bankruptcy Court established a procedure for resolving this and other \"Allocation Disputes.\" (D.I. 109-2 at A100-03.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court's 2012 confirmation order came after it had held more than ten days of evidentiary hearings and multiple days of subsequent legal argument; issued a 2011 confirmation opinion on competing plans for reorganization; issued a reconsideration decision after extensive briefing; and held a separate two-day evidentiary hearing and issued an Allocation Ruling that directly addressed the exact inter-creditor disputes raised in the Appellants' appeals. On April 9, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court concluded that even if the Trustees were correct in asserting that no other creditor could benefit from the PHONES and EGI Subordination Agreements, any discrimination resulting from a sharing of the subordination recoveries was immaterial and permitted by \u00a7 1129(b)(1). (D.I. 109-2 at A124-28.) In making this finding, the Bankruptcy Court rejected the Trustees' argument that \u00a7 510 of the Bankruptcy Code (the \"Code\") overrides \u00a7 1129(b)(1) and requires \"full implementation[,]\" or enforcement, of subordination agreements. (D.I. 109-2 at A122-23.) At the same time, the Bankruptcy Court determined that it was not necessary to decide whether any of the Other Parent claims were entitled to seniority over the PHONES and EGI Notes because the alleged discrimination was not material. The Bankruptcy Court nevertheless held that the Swap Claim comprising 57% by amount of all the Other Parent Claims was a senior debt just like the LBO itself. (D.I. 109-2 at A119-20 n.19.) This reduced the alleged discrimination against the Trustees to 0.9% of their initial recovery percentage from 34.5% to 33.6% and made the Plan \"even less vulnerable to a charge of 'unfair discrimination.' \" (D.I. 109-2 at A119-20 n.19, n.21.) On December 31, 2012, the Fourth Amended Plan was \"substantially consummated\" and distributions\n   were made, including the payment of approximately $91 million to over 700 Class 1F Creditors. (D.I. 111 at 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Subsequently, on June 18, 2014, the court determined that the parties' appeals were equitably moot. (D.I. 93.) Aurelius appealed arguing that the case was not equitably moot and sought a Settlement that was not unreasonably low. The Trustees appealed, representing certain pre-LBO debt treated as \"Class 1E Creditors\" in the Plan, arguing that they had subordination agreements with the holders of two series of pre-LBO notes Tribune issued called the PHONES Notes and the EGI Notes which were worth a total of around $30 million. (D.I. 60-1 at 8-9.) On September 21, 2015, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the District Court in part concluding that, while Aurelius' appeal is equitably moot, \"the Trustees' appeal is not[.]\" (D.I. 102 at 23.) The Third Circuit remanded the matter for a determination on the merits concluding that, in the event the court reverses the Bankruptcy Court, some relief might be fashioned without unraveling the Plan or harming third parties who relied on its confirmation.

DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On appeal, Appellants challenge the Bankruptcy Court's determination that the subordination agreements do not have to be enforced. Specifically, Appellants make three arguments: (1) that the bankruptcy court erroneously refused to enforce the subordination agreements, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201129\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) ; (2) even if the subordination agreements were not enforceable, the bankruptcy court erred in holding the plan does not \"discriminate unfairly\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   against the Senior Notes; and (3) that the bankruptcy court erred in holding that a contract claim resulting from Tribune's termination of interest-rate hedges (the \"Swap Claim\") was senior debt under the two subordination agreements. (D.I. 109 at 3.) The court will address each issue in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Enforcement of the Subordination Agreements is Not Required\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    a. Textual Analysis of \u00a7 1129(b) and \u00a7 510(a)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   First, Appellants argue that the Bankruptcy Court erred in its reading of \u00a7 1129(b)(1)'s \"notwithstanding\" provision because the statutory text and legislative intent of the Bankruptcy Code requires enforcement of the subordination agreement when a plan is being \"crammed down\" on dissenting creditors. (D.I. 109 at 1, 8.) Specifically, Appellants assert that the text of \u00a7 1129(b)(1) singles out the only portion of \u00a7 1129(a) that does not apply, paragraph eight, and says that \"all\" other requirements apply. (D.I. 109 at 11.) In contrast, Appellees point out that the Bankruptcy Court previously determined that the Appellants' position regarding the \"notwithstanding\" provision \"is not supported by relevant decisional law.\" (D.I. 110 at 13); (D.I. 109-2 at A122.) The court agrees with the Bankruptcy Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Section 510(a) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that \"[a] subordination agreement is enforceable in a case under this title to the same extent that such agreement is enforceable under applicable nonbankruptcy law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20510\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Section 1129(b)(1) of the Code, however, provides that the court \"shall confirm\" a plan over the objection of an impaired dissenting class \"\n   <em>\n    [n]otwithstanding\n   </em>\n   section 510(a).\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201129\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1). Applying the plain meaning of the word \"notwithstanding,\" the Bankruptcy Court held that the \"notwithstanding\" provision meant that Section 1129(b)\"is applied without prevention or obstruction of any applicable subordination agreement.\" (D.I. 109-2 at A123); (D.I. 110 at 12.) In making its conclusion, the Bankruptcy Court utilized the Third Circuit decision\n   <em>\n    In re Goody's Family Clothing, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , which held that \"notwithstanding\" as used in a different section of the bankruptcy code \"means 'in spite of or 'without prevention or obstruction from or by.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3696297,5716115\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/610/812/\">\n    610 F.3d 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 817 (3d Cir. 2010),\n   <em>\n    aff'd by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Federal-Mogul Global, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4144035,3898919\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/684/355/\">\n    684 F.3d 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 369 (3d Cir. 2012) ; (D.I. 109-2 at A123.)

Similarly, Professor Klee's 1995 Article explains that \u00a7 1129(b)(1), in his opinion, \"appears to have the anomalous result of overriding \u00a7 510(a) and eliminating enforcement of subordination agreements\" in cramdown cases.

The Swap Claim is Entitled to Seniority Under the Subordination Agreements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Appellants assert that the \"bankruptcy court erroneously concluded, in a footnote, that the DCL Plan is 'even less vulnerable' to a charge of 'unfair discrimination' because the subordination agreements entitled Class 1F's largest member-the Swap Claim-to receive a share of the subordinate\n   noteholders' recovery.\" (D.I. 109 at 23); (D.I. 109-2 at A119, n.19.) Specifically, Appellants assert the Bankruptcy Court \"committed legal error, reviewed\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , in holding that the Swap Claim was 'Senior Indebtedness' (as defined in the PHONES agreement) and a 'Senior Obligation' (as defined in the EGI agreement).\" (D.I. 109 at 23, 26.) In contrast, Appellee argues that entitlements to seniority under the subordination agreements were heavily litigated in the Bankruptcy Court and holders of the Swap Claim ($151 million) and the retiree claims ($105 million), which comprised 97% of all Other Parent Claims, filed \"voluminous\" briefs arguing that their claims were senior obligations like the Appellants' Senior Notes. (D.I. 110 at 21);\n   <em>\n    In re Spansion, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799288\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/426/114/#p148\">\n    426 B.R. 114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 148-51 (Bankr. D. Del. 2010) (The Bankruptcy Court has particular expertise in interpreting subordination agreements); (D.I. 110 at 22.) Because the Plan's alleged discrimination would have been immaterial if none of the Other Parent Claims were entitled to seniority, the Bankruptcy Court ultimately held that it \"need not decide\" those entitlements. (D.I. 109-2 at A119.) Nevertheless, the Bankruptcy Court believed the entitlements were \"easily determined\" and concluded that the largest of the Other Parent Claims, the $151 million Swap Claim, was a senior obligation entitled to share equally with Appellants' claim. (D.I. 109-2 at A119-20 n.19.) This reduced the alleged discrimination against Appellants to 0.9% of their initial recovery percentage from 34.5% to 33.6% and made the plan \"even less vulnerable to a charge of 'unfair discrimination.' \" (D.I. 109-2 at A119-25 n.19, n.21.) The court, thus, finds no reason to deviate from the Bankruptcy Court's conclusions. Nevertheless, the court will address each of Appellants' arguments on appeal in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    a. Senior Indebtedness under the PHONES Indenture to EGI\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   First, Appellants argue that the PHONES Notes are subordinate in the right of any bankruptcy recovery to \"Senior Indebtedness.\" (D.I. 109 at 23.) Appellants assert that \"the bankruptcy court erroneously held that a claim asserted in connection with the Swap Agreement represented an 'other amount[ ] due ... in connection with' the LBO Lenders' Credit Agreement, and thus was entitled to recoveries turned over by the PHONES noteholders under the PHONES indenture.\" (D.I. 109-2 at A119 n.19); (D.I. 109 at 23.) Appellants assert that the ordinary meaning of \"other amounts due on or in connection with any Indebtedness[,]\" refers to ancillary fees and payments arising out of the LBO indebtedness itself-like closing costs, bank charges, or attorneys' fees. (D.I. 109 at 24); (D.I. 109-2 at A119-20 n.19.) The text, however, does not support this interpretation. The plain meaning of the phrase \"in connection with any Indebtedness\" includes obligations that the Credit Agreement compelled Tribune to incur. (D.I. 110 at 24.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \"Senior Indebtedness\" that benefits from subordination under \u00a7 14.01(2) of the PHONES Notes is defined, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   \"Senior Indebtedness\" means the principal of (and premium, if any) and interest on ... and\n   <em>\n    other amounts due on or in connection with\n   </em>\n   any Indebtedness of [Tribune] incurred, assumed or guaranteed and all renewals, extensions and refundings of any such Indebtedness of [Tribune] the Company ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   (D.I. 110 at 23); (D.I. 109 at 23); (D.I. 109-1 at A70.) Aiding the court's interpretation, the PHONES Indenture defined \"Indebtedness\" to include \"(i) all obligations represented by notes, bonds, debentures or similar evidences of indebtedness; [and]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   (ii) all indebtedness for borrowed money.\" (D.I. 109-1 at A70.) The Swap Claim qualified under both parts of this definition. First, the Swap Claim bore interest, gave rise to contractual rights of set off, was guaranteed by Tribune's subsidiaries, and, therefore, was \"similar evidence of indebtedness.\" Second, Tribune regularly reported the Swap Claim as \"Debt\" in its financial statements,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Credit Agreement treated swap liability as indebtedness for borrowed money. (D.I. 110-2 at SA28). The Swap Claim, thus, qualified as \"indebtedness for borrowed money.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Similarly, it is undisputed that Tribune's obligations under the Credit Agreement were \"Senior Indebtedness\" under the PHONES Indenture.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799288\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/426/114/#p148\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The swap claim is connected to the Credit Agreement because Tribune subsidiaries guaranteed Tribune's obligations in respect of both the Credit Agreement and the Swap Agreement, in the same document, and on the same terms. The Guarantee Agreement combined all obligations under the Swap Agreement and the Credit Agreement in the same defined term \"Guaranteed Obligations,\" treating them the same. (D.I. 110-1 at SA53). Thus, if the amounts due under the Swap Agreement were not \"in connection with\" the Credit Agreement, it is hard to determine what kind of obligation is covered by the phrase.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.

Thus, Tribune's obligations under the Swap Agreement were amounts due \"in connection with\" the Credit Agreement because the Credit Agreement required Tribune to hedge its variable-rate Credit Agreement debt with fixed rate obligations.

The Swap Claim is a Senior Obligation under the EGI Subordination Agreement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Next, Appellants assert that the EGI Notes are subordinate to \"Senior Obligations.\" (D.I. 109 at 26.) Paragraph 1 of the EGI Subordination Agreement defines a \"Senior Obligation\" to exclude \"trade payables and accrued expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=452%20N.E.2d%2055\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ; (D.I. 109-1 at A78); (D.I. 109-2 at A128.) Appellants take issue with a four line\n   footnote where the Bankruptcy Court rejected the Appellants' argument, holding that the definition of \"Senior Obligations\" under the EGI subordination agreement is \"even broader\" than the definition of Senior Indebtedness under the PHONES Indenture. (D.I. 109-2 at A119-20 n.19). According to Appellants, without further explanation or mention of the applicable exclusion from that definition, the Bankruptcy Court assumed that the Swap Claim must be a \"Senior Obligation.\" (D.I. 109-2 at A119 n.19.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under the EGI Subordination Agreement, \"Senior Obligations\" are defined in relevant part as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   [A]ll obligations, indebtedness and other liabilities of the Company other than ... trade payables and\n   <em>\n    accrued expenses incurred in the ordinary course of business\n   </em>\n   , in each case, whether incurred on or prior to the date hereof or hereafter incurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   (D.I. 109-2 at A78); (D.I. 110 at 26.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   While Appellants argue that the Swap Claim was an \"accrued expense incurred in the ordinary course of business[,]\" the court cannot agree. (D.I. 109 at 26.) First, as noted above, Tribune's financial statements accounted for the Swap Claim as either short-term or long-term debt and not as an \"accrued expense.\"(D.I. 110 at 26-27.) Second, the Swap Claim was not incurred in the \"ordinary course of business.\" The Swap Claim was incurred in connection with the Credit Agreement and the financing of the $12 billion LBO, which was anything but \"ordinary\" and the very transaction the Trustees asserted to be the basis for billions of dollars of fraudulent conveyance causes of action. (D.I. 109-2 at A176-77.) Finally, Appellants cite nothing to support the proposition that interest rate hedging agreements, particularly hedging agreements the size of the Swap Agreement, were an ordinary business practice of Tribune. (D.I. 110 at 27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The court therefore concludes that the Swap Claim is a senior obligation as defined by the EGI subordination agreement and believes the Bankruptcy Court properly concluded that the Plan did not unfairly discriminate against Senior Noteholders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the court will affirm the Bankruptcy Court's Confirmation Order and Memorandum Regarding Allocation of Disputes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   At Wilmington, this\n   <em>\n    30th\n   </em>\n   day of July, 2018,\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   IT IS HEREBY ORDERED THAT:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   1.
