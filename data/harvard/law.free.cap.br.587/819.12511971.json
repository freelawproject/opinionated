LANE, UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the Court is the Order to Show Cause, dated April 19, 2018 [ECF No. 21], issued to Raymond Ragues, Esq. as counsel for Vincent D'Arata, the debtor in the above-captioned Chapter 7 case (the \"Debtor\" or \"Mr. D'Arata\"). The Court issued the Order to Show Cause based on two letters from the Debtor that complained about the conduct of his counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter of Vincent D'Arata, dated April 2, 2018 [ECF No. 13]; Letter of Vincent D'Arata, dated April 4, 2018 [ECF No. 19]; Statement of United States Trustee in Support of Order to Show Cause re: Attorney Raymond Ragues \u00b6\u00b6 10, 18, 20 (\"UST Statement\") [ECF No. 25]; Chapter 7 Trustee's Statement in Connection with the Court's April 19, 2018 Order to Show Cause \u00b6 9 (\"Chapter 7 Trustee Statement\") [ECF. No. 26]. In his letters, Mr. D'Arata complained that, among other things, his counsel had filed incorrect documents on his behalf, notwithstanding Mr. D'Arata's repeated attempts to correct the errors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 13, 19. Based on the allegations in the letters, the Court issued the Order to Show Cause whether Mr. Ragues should be required to return the fee that he charged the Debtor for the filing of the bankruptcy case. As it turns out, the incorrect filings were only part of a much more pervasive problem that included the use of so-called appearance counsel that effectively left the Debtor without representation\n   at his meeting of creditors under Section 341 of the Bankruptcy Code. Given all the problems caused by Debtor's counsel here-as further set forth below-counsel must return the fee that he charged the Debtor. The Court writes this opinion to remind attorneys practicing in this jurisdiction of their ethical obligations to their debtor clients and to avoid the use of appearance counsel as a way of passing the buck on those obligations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   There is nothing about this Chapter 7 case that suggests it would be unusually difficult. In late February 2018, the Debtor filed a voluntary petition (the \"Petition\") for relief under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, along with, among other things, his initial set of Schedules of Assets and Liabilities (the \"Schedules\"), Statement of Financial Affairs and Creditor Matrix [ECF No. 1]. The purpose of the Schedules in a bankruptcy case is to list the types of assets that a debtor has in its possession or would like to claim as exempt. Consistent with the practice in Chapter 7 cases, a Chapter 7 trustee was appointed to administer the Debtor's case; the trustee appointed here was Albert Togut, Esq. (the \"Chapter 7 Trustee\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Raymond Ragues, Esq. of Raymond Ragues PLLC is the attorney who filed the case for the Debtor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petition at 7. Prior to the filing, Mr. D'Arata paid Mr. Ragues a fee of $900 for his legal services in the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Disclosure of Compensation of Attorney for Debtor [ECF No. 1]. The Debtor never met Mr. Ragues in his office, but instead communicated with him online and over the telephone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UST Statement \u00b6 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mr. D'Arata lives on a monthly income of $1,435.00, with his monthly expenses exceeding his income by $20.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Schedules I and J [ECF No. 1]. Mr. D'Arata spends 65% of his monthly income ($953) on rent, food, and basic supplies alone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given his financial circumstances, it took Mr. D'Arata a year to save the money to pay Mr. Ragues' fee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UST Statement \u00b6 16. Mr. D'Arata paid the $900 legal fee in installments over eight months, with the last installment paid in November 2017, some three months before the bankruptcy case was filed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter of Vincent D'Arata, dated April 2, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As is customary in Chapter 7 cases, the Debtor was scheduled to appear at a meeting of creditors and be questioned under oath by the Chapter 7 Trustee about his case, including with regard to the Debtor's assets and liabilities and the consequences of seeking a discharge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20341\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (providing for an oral examination of the debtor at a meeting of creditors). These so-called 341 meetings are not presided over-or even attended-by the Court, but rather are run by the Chapter 7 trustee appointed in the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20341\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 341\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) (noting that a court may not preside at or attend a 341 meeting).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As a Chapter 7 case is often administered without the need for the Debtor to appear before the Court, a 341 meeting may be the most significant event in such a case for an individual debtor, particularly in a no-asset case such as this one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chapter 7 Trustee's Report of No Distribution, docket entry dated June 7, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   No-asset cases are usually more streamlined because the liquidation of a debtor's estate produces no assets from which creditors can recover value, or there is such low value recovered that only administrative costs-generally attorneys' and trustees' fees-can be paid.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Report of the Commission on the Bankruptcy Laws of the United States, H.R. Rep. No. 137, pt.1, at 3-4 (July 1973),\n   <em>\n    reprinted in\n   </em>\n   B Collier on Bankruptcy App. Pt. 4(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   But notwithstanding the straightforward nature of Mr. D'Arata's case, difficulties arose almost immediately. The 341 meeting in this case was first convened on March 28, 2018 (the \"First Meeting\"), but Mr. Ragues did not appear to represent the Debtor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UST Statement \u00b6 14. Instead, an appearance was made on behalf of the Debtor by an attorney named Kenneth Zweig, Esq.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20341\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But Mr. Zweig was not hired by Mr. D'Arata. Rather, he came to the First Meeting as so-called \"appearance counsel\"-meaning that he appeared as counsel on behalf of Mr. Ragues and his firm even though Mr. Zweig was not employed at Mr. Ragues' firm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. of March 28, 2018 Meeting of Creditors at 1, attached as Exhibit A to the Chapter 7 Trustee Statement [ECF No. 26].\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   While the Debtor knew that an attorney would represent him at the First Meeting, he did not know that it would be Mr. Zweig.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20341\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20341\">\n    at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During this First Meeting, the Debtor testified that the information in the original\n   set of Schedules filed by Mr. Ragues with the Petition was incorrect in several significant ways: (1) the original Schedules included a bank account that the Debtor closed prior to the filing of the Petition; (2) the original Schedules reported that the Debtor had previously sought bankruptcy relief when he had not; and (3) the original Schedules improperly listed student loan obligations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20341\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20341\">\n    at 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Debtor testified that he had identified those errors and reported them to Mr. Ragues in November 2017-before the Petition and the original Schedules were filed-but that these errors had not been corrected.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20341\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20341\">\n    at 2-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . During the First Meeting, the Debtor also explained that the Petition contained a version of his signature that did not match the signature he affixed to the Petition and original Schedules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20341\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20341\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At no point during the First Meeting did appearance counsel Mr. Zweig assist the Debtor or the Chapter 7 Trustee in addressing any of these concerns. In fact, Mr. Zweig was not at all familiar with the Debtor's case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20341\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20341\">\n    at 2, 4-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the conclusion of the First Meeting, the Chapter 7 Trustee explained that he could not examine the Debtor without the correct schedules so he adjourned the examination to April 18, 2018, so that the Mr. Ragues could file corrected schedules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20341\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20341\">\n    at 3, 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Chapter 7 Trustee also told Mr. Zweig to have Mr. Ragues meet with the Debtor to correct the schedules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20341\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20341\">\n    at 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Of course, all this meant a second trip downtown for Mr. D'Arata, a particular hardship for this disabled Debtor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter of Vincent D'Arata, dated April 2, 2018 (Debtor noting that he is disabled).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Things continued to go downhill after the First Meeting. On April 2, 2018 and April 4, 2018, the Debtor sent letters to the Court, which explained that he had been unable to contact Mr. Ragues, that Mr. Ragues failed to correctly amend his Schedules, and that incorrect information had been provided to the Chapter 7 Trustee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF Nos. 13, 19. Mr. Ragues did not respond to those letters, or at least no response was ever filed by Mr. Ragues with the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chapter 7 Trustee Statement \u00b6 9. It was not until April 17, 2018-only one day prior to when the 341 meeting was scheduled to resume-that Mr. Ragues finally filed an amended voluntary petition, amended Schedules, and amended Summary of Assets and Liabilities and creditor matrix [ECF Nos. 15-18].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On the morning of April 18, 2018, the Debtor once again appeared and testified under oath at the adjourned 341 Meeting (the \"Second Meeting\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   UST Statement \u00b6 22. Mr. Ragues again chose not to appear.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20341\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Instead, Mr. Ragues sent another appearance counsel to represent the Debtor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20341\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20341\">\n    at \u00b6 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

By the nature of such assignment, Appearance Counsel is unfamiliar with the case and the pleadings filed in support of the case. Thus, any problems that may arise as a result of the trustee's review of debtor's schedules and SOFA or debtor's testimony cannot be resolved at the initial 341 Meeting. As appears to be the case regarding the above-referenced Debtor, the trustee's directions to Appearance Counsel often go unresolved either because they are not communicated to the retained counsel or a lack of communication between Appearance Counsel and debtor's retained counsel.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Letter of Alan Nisselson, Esq., dated May 7, 2018. As further noted by another Chapter 7 trustee in this jurisdiction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   Per diem attorneys appear-purportedly on behalf of a debtor/client-not even knowing who the person is. They appear not knowing, not having, and having never even seen the file. They appear with no authority to act on behalf of the debtor in even the simplest situations as, for example, agreeing to an extension of time to object to discharge in situations where, for example, the trustee has not been sent the petition and schedules, tax returns, pay stubs, and/or Consumer Credit Counseling Certificate, or received documents requested by the trustee upon his or her thorough review of the schedules prior to the 341 meeting.\n   <em>\n    Such inappropriate activity disserves debtors who might, consequently, be compelled to return to an adjourned 341 meeting which they would not otherwise have to do.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Letter of Robert L. Geltzer, Esq., dated May 10, 2018 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   All these significant concerns are only heightened by the apparently widespread (and increasing) use of appearance counsel in Chapter 7 cases. While the Court is not in a position to assess such trends directly-because the Court does not participate in 341 meetings-members of the bar who serve as trustees in Chapter 7 cases have helpfully provided information about current trends. They paint a disturbing picture. Indeed, one Chapter 7 trustee in this jurisdiction stated that use of appearance counsel at 341 meetings \"has substantially increased in frequency in recent years and has become, unfortunately, a common practice in the Southern District.\" Letter of Kenneth Silverman, Esq., dated May 17, 2018;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Letter of Alan Nisselson, dated May 7, 2018 (\"[I]t is often the case that over 50% of represented debtors on any 341 meeting calendar day are covered by Appearance Counsel.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Chapter 7 Trustee here urges that the Court bar the use of appearance counsel in its entirety for 341 meetings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Chapter 7 Trustee Statement \u00b6 26 (\"The Trustee respectfully submits that the Court should ban the use of appearance counsel altogether at 341 meetings in the Southern District of New York.\"). The Chapter 7 Trustee cites to a number of jurisdictions that have promulgated such local rules as to appearance counsel.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , E.D.N.Y. LBR 2090-2(a) (an attorney of record for a debtor who is knowledgeable in all aspects of a debtor's case shall appear on behalf of such a debtor in\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   aspect of the case, including but not limited to appearances at a 341 meeting, any adjournments of such meetings, and defending contested matters, motions, or adversary proceedings); N.D.N.Y. LBR 2016-3(b) (lists required duties of an attorney representing a Chapter 7 debtor, including appearing personally and representing the debtor at any scheduled 341 meeting). But rather than ban appearance counsel in cases before only one judge in this jurisdiction, the Court believes that the entire Court should first consider the wisdom of enacting a local rule to address these issues. In the meantime, the Court will be exceedingly vigilant on this issue and encourages the reporting of any instance where a counsel is failing to meet his or her obligations to a debtor, including, but not limited to, failing to personally appear with the debtor at a 341 meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Of course, the Court's ruling today is not an indictment of attorneys who satisfy the requirements for serving as appearance counsel. The Court has seen many such instances of appearance counsel in Chapter 13 cases, often involving solo practitioners or small firms who ably and honorably serve as a support system for one another and who appear in Court well prepared to represent a debtor. But sadly, it appears that the requirements for appearance counsel are often \"[m]ore honour'd in the breach than the observance.\" William Shakespeare, Hamlet, act 1, sc. 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, the Court concludes that the compensation provided by the Debtor to Mr. Ragues exceeds the value of the services provided by Mr. Ragues due to Mr. Ragues' failure to provide adequate representation at the Debtor's 341 meetings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    The Court previously issued a bench ruling requiring the turnover of the fee charged to the Debtor.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Hr'g Tr. 32:7-9, May 1, 2018 [ECF No. 31].

The lack of a ruling on that issue does not in any way suggest that this allegation is not an exceedingly serious one. Filing documents with the debtor's electronic signature, without first obtaining his actual signatures or consent to such filings, would run afoul of New York's Rules of Professional Conduct. N.Y. Rule of Professional Conduct 8.4(c) provides that \"[a] lawyer or law firm shall not ... (c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\" N.Y. R. Prof. Conduct 8.4(c). The electronic filing of a document that purports to have the debtor's signature but, that is not, in fact, signed by the debtor, \"is no different than physically forging the debtor's signature on a paper document.\"\n    <em>\n     In re Stomberg\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5901655\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/487/775/#p808\">\n     487 B.R. 775\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 808 (Bankr. S.D. Tex. 2013) (\"[M]ultiple bankruptcy courts have found that 'electronically filing a document bearing an electronic signature that was not actually or validly signed' constitutes a forgery amounting to a Rule 9011 violation.\");\n    <em>\n     In re Obasi\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%206336153\">\n     2011 WL 6336153\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *3 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. Dec. 19, 2011) (\"While the parties have debated whether the conduct at issue violates the rules regarding the electronic filing of documents, the Court believes the real issue concerns an attorney's obligations when submitting documents to the Court. Those obligations are governed by Bankruptcy Rule 9011.\");\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States Bankruptcy Court Southern District of New York Procedures for the Filing, Signing, and Verification of Documents by Electronic Means\n    </em>\n    (June 17, 2013), http://www.nysb.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/5005-2-procedures.pdf (providing, among other things, that petitions, lists, schedules, statements, amendments, pleadings, affidavits, stipulations and other documents must contain original signatures). But there appears to be a factual dispute as to whether such an unauthorized filing took place, and such a dispute could not be resolved without an evidentiary hearing. As the Court has ample basis to require that the fees here be returned without reaching that issue, the Court concludes that it would be unjust and inappropriate to subject Mr. D'Arata to further proceedings in Court if that can be avoided.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    It is the Court's understanding that the filing fee has already been returned by Mr. Ragues to the Debtor, in accordance with an order issued by the Court on June 27, 2018 [ECF No. 32].\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
