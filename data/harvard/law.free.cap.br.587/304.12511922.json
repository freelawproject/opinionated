(\"TRU\"), one of the Debtors in these jointly administered chapter 11 cases, currently rents space in a retail shopping center from Brea Union Plaza I (\"Brea I\"). TRU, in connection with a court-approved auction of certain real property and unexpired leases, is seeking final approval of the assumption and assignment of its lease with Brea I to Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse Corporation (\"Burlington\"). Brea I objects to the proposed assignment, asserting that TRU has not satisfied the adequate assurance of future performance requirements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20365\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3) because the assignment to Burlington would violate the exclusivity provision of another lease in the shopping center and would disrupt the shopping center's tenant mix and balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   An evidentiary hearing was conducted on May 10, 2018. At the Court's direction, each party thereafter submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. The Court has carefully considered the evidence\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and submissions of the parties. For the following reasons, Brea I's objections are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Facts\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Brea I, successor in interest to Brea Union Partners, as landlord, and TRU, as tenant, are parties to a ground lease (the \"Lease\") entered into on December 20, 1996, for a parcel (the \"Premises\") in Brea Union Plaza, a retail shopping center lying on a 42-acre contiguous tract of land in Brea, California. TRU operated a Babies \"R\" Us retail store at the Premises, which is referred to by the Debtors as Store No. 5672.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On March 23, 2018, the Court entered the Order (I) Establishing Bidding Procedures and (II) Granting Related Relief [Dkt. No. 2351] (the \"Bidding Procedures Order\"), approving the Debtors' sale, and assumption and assignment, of certain real property and unexpired leases and auction\n   and bidding procedures for soliciting and selecting the best offers for those assets. The Lease was one of the assets included in the Bidding Procedures Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At an auction conducted on March 29, 2018, pursuant to the Bidding Procedures Order, the Debtors received multiple qualified bids and designated Festival Development Corporation as the successful bidder for the Lease, with Burlington as the backup bidder. On April 9, 2018, Brea I filed an objection to the proposed assumption and assignment of the Lease. Festival subsequently withdrew its bid and, on April 13, 2018, the Debtors filed a notice proposing to assume and assign the Lease to Burlington, with no backup bidder. Burlington bid $1,150,000 for the Lease and intends to use the Premises to operate a Burlington Coat Factory department store for the \"off-price\" sale of apparel and other merchandise. On April 24, 2018, Brea I filed a supplemental objection opposing the Debtors' proposed assumption and assignment of the Lease to Burlington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Currently, there are approximately 43 tenants or subtenants at Brea Union Plaza, operating primarily retail stores. The major tenants or subtenants of the Plaza operate the following stores: Walmart, Home Depot, PetSmart, Sears Outlet, Nordstrom Rack, Ross Dress for Less (\"Ross\"), Staples, Michaels, Tilly's, Party City, and Pier 1 Imports. Nordstrom Rack and Ross are off-price retailers of apparel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Brea I executed its lease with Ross on October 1, 2009 (the \"Ross Lease\"). The Ross Lease contains an exclusive use clause that prohibits Brea I from leasing any space in Brea Union Plaza to a party that would use its premises for off-price sales.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ross is located adjacent to the Premises and has not consented to Burlington's intended use, which would compete with Ross and Nordstrom Rack.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Aside from provisions unrelated to the issues before the Court, the language of the Lease does not restrict the use of the Premises by TRU or its assignee. One provision of the Stipulation submitted by the parties is that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   In some cases, the provisions regarding a tenant's use of leased premises in a later-entered lease within a multi-tenant commercial property include language that provides that the tenant's use of such premises is subject to or limited by the exclusive-use or prohibited-use clauses contained in already-existing leases within the same property. And in some cases, the provisions regarding a tenant's ability to assign a lease include language that prohibit[sic] an assignment to an assignee whose use of the assigned leased premises would conflict with or violate the exclusive-use or prohibited-use clauses contained in then-existing leases within the same property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Stipulation, \u00b6 1(y). The Lease does not include language similar to that contained in other leases as described in the portion of the Stipulation set forth above. More specifically, there is no anti-assignment provision referencing exclusive or prohibited use clauses contained in leases with other tenants of Brea Union Plaza.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jurisdiction\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) and 1334(b) and the general order of reference for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia dated August 15, 1984, this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over the Debtors' bankruptcy cases and this contested matter relating to the Debtors' proposed assumption and assignment of the Lease.

S.D.N.Y. 1990) ). This provision is \"intended to protect the landlord's economic expectations rather than those of the other tenants.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Martin Paint Stores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6458471\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/199/258/#p262\">\n    199 B.R. 258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 262 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1996). Its intent is not to bestow upon landlords new\n   contractual rights but rather to preserve contract provisions at risk of being stricken as\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   anti-assignment clauses under the provisions of 11 U.S.C \u00a7 365(f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Lease was executed in 1996, long before the Ross Lease came into existence, and it contains no provision that requires compliance with the Ross Lease use restrictions.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heilig-Myers\n   </em>\n   at 662 (\"the Heilig lease provides that debtors will not '... assign or sublet the premises to any business that would violate any non[-]compete agreements in which [l]andlord has with other [t]enants in the Shopping Center.'\n   <em>\n    Because of this lease provision\n   </em>\n   , Mitchell's lease with Fabric must be considered ....\") (emphasis added). Brea I's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Heilig-Myers\n   </em>\n   to support its \"plain language\" argument that the proposed assignment must not breach a restriction in any other lease, \"regardless of whether that other lease is referred to in the lease sought to be assigned\" is misplaced. That is not the ruling in\n   <em>\n    Heilig-Myers\n   </em>\n   , nor is it the ruling in any other case cited by Brea I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Alternatively, the Court finds that assumption and assignment of the Lease to Burlington will not breach the exclusivity provision contained in the Ross Lease. The provision prohibiting Brea I from allowing a tenant to use the Premises to sell off-price apparel applies only if Brea I \"has the capacity to do so.\" As the court observed in\n   <em>\n    Martin Paint Stores\n   </em>\n   , a court order approving the assumption and assignment of a lease is a judicial action that may render the landlord unable to comply with a restriction contained in another lease. \"The law excuses performance that has been rendered legally impossible.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6458471\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/199/258/#p262\">\n    199 B.R. at 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, approval of the assumption and assignment of the Lease to Burlington pursuant to \u00a7 365 renders Brea I without the capacity to prevent Burlington's intended use, an occurrence that may have been contemplated when the terms of the Ross Lease were negotiated. Accordingly, there has been no showing that the adequate protection requirement of \u00a7 365(b)(3)(C) is unmet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Section 365(b)(3)(D)\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Brea I's contention that the Debtors are unable to provide adequate assurance under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20365\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3)(D) fails in light of the record and legal precedent. The court in\n   <em>\n    In re Ames Department Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6099819\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/121/160/\">\n    121 B.R. 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. 1990), stated that \u00a7 365(b)(3)(D)\"must be interpreted to refer to contractual protections and not undefined notions of tenant mix.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6099819\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/121/160/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6099819\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/121/160/\">\n    at 165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Finding no contractual provisions requiring the assignee to comply with the requirements of any master agreement or to preserve tenant mix and location, the court found that the assignment sought in\n   <em>\n    Ames\n   </em>\n   did not violate \u00a7 365(b)(3)(D).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6099819\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/121/160/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, Brea I has pointed to no provisions in the Lease or any applicable master agreement relating to tenant mix and balance that would prohibit the assignment of the Lease to Burlington.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Moreover, there is insufficient evidence to support a finding that assignment of the Lease to Burlington will disrupt the existing tenant mix and balance in Brea Union Plaza. The Stipulations include a brief description of the nature of the other tenants' businesses, but these brief descriptions fall short of establishing that there\n   was an intended tenant mix. In a shopping center with 43 tenants, only two primarily sell \"off-price\" apparel. Brea I has not demonstrated that a third \"off-price\" retailer will disrupt the tenant mix and balance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In light of Brea I's failure to show that its contractual rights will be violated by the assignment of the Lease to Burlington, the Court will not prohibit the proposed assumption and assignment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtors have met their burden under \u00a7 365(b)(1) and (3) of providing adequate assurance of future performance. The Court finds that the assumption and assignment of the Lease to Burlington is in the best interests of the Debtors' estates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Brea I's objections to the proposed assumption and assignment of the Lease are overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The parties have stipulated to most of the facts.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    \"Stipulation for Limited Purpose of Hearing Regarding Undisputed Facts and Issues and Admitted Evidence in Connection with Contested Matter Relating To (1) the Debtors' Proposed Assumption and Assignment of Unexpired Lease Relating to Store No. 5672 and (2) the Debtors' Proposed Form of Adequate Assurance of Future Performance of Such Lease by the Designated Backup Bidder\" (the \"Stipulation\") [Dkt.
