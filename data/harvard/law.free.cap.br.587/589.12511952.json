Zapotocky also challenges\n   a foreclosure judgment entered against him in Connecticut state court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   CIT now moves pursuant to Rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to dismiss this action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and for failure to state a claim. CIT argues that Zapotocky lacks standing to bring this claim because he forfeited it during a personal bankruptcy and that the Court lacks jurisdiction under the so-called\n   <em>\n    Rooker\n   </em>\n   -\n   <em>\n    Feldman\n   </em>\n   Doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Exxon Mobil Corp. v.

CIT also argues that Zapotocky's claims are barred by the doctrine of res judicata and that he fails to state any claim for relief. For the reasons explained below, CIT's Rule 12(b)(1) motion is\n   <strong>\n    granted\n   </strong>\n   , and Zapotocky's claims are\n   <strong>\n    dismissed without prejudice.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When presented with both a motion under 12(b)(1) to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, the first issue is whether the Court has the subject matter jurisdiction necessary to consider the merits of the action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rhulen Agency, Inc. v.

The amended complaint therefore does not state that CIT breached any portion of the reverse mortgage agreement, fraudulently induced Zapotocky into signing the agreement, or committed any tort related to the flood insurance requirement.

As explained above, the reverse mortgage agreement plainly disclosed to Zapotocky that he may be required to purchase flood insurance. Accordingly, Zapotocky does not state a claim under the Truth in Lending Act's credit disclosure provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Accordingly, if there were subject matter jurisdiction, Zapotocky's claims should also be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court has considered all of the arguments raised by the parties.
