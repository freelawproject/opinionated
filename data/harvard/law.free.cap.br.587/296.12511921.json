The Educational Credit Management Corp. (\"ECMC\")-a seasoned veteran of this line of litigation-says this should stop her at the summary-judgment stage. It argues Reagan has not pled sufficient facts to show she cannot maintain a minimal standard of living while making her payments. Reagan argues she is currently unable to maintain such a standard. The Court holds that there is a genuine question of material fact as to whether the financial circumstances required to qualify for a monthly IBR Plan payment of $0, together with Reagan's income and expenses (as represented on her bankruptcy schedules), demonstrate that she cannot currently maintain a minimal standard of living while repaying her student loans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Reagan petitioned for relief under chapter 7 of title 11 of the U.S. Code on May 15, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nearly three months later, she commenced an adversary proceeding seeking to discharge her student loans under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20523\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(8), alleging that she would suffer undue hardship if she were forced to continue repaying them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECMC filed an answer requesting that Reagan's loans remain excepted from discharge,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   followed by a motion for summary judgment (\n   <em>\n    \"Motion\"\n   </em>\n   ) arguing that she cannot demonstrate that $0 payments deny her a minimal standard of living.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reagan filed a response in opposition,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and ECMC filed a reply.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties agree that this matter is a core proceeding under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(1), the Court has jurisdiction to hear it under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and venue is proper under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201409\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In her\n   <em>\n    Complaint,\n   </em>\n   Reagan alleges that she incurred her student loans while pursuing a bachelor's degree in the administration of justice from Westmoreland County Community College and the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg between 1988-92, as well as a master's degree in criminology at Indiana University of Pennsylvania from 2001-03.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties agree that ECMC later acquired the loans and is the proper defendant in this matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reagan further alleges she cannot maintain a minimal standard of living while repaying her loans and that her current economic situation will persist through \"a significant portion of the repayment period\" because of her age and physical limitations stemming from multiple surgeries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, she alleges she made a good-faith effort to repay her loans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The parties largely agree on the material facts.

New York State Higher Education Services Corp.\n   </em>\n   :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (1) that the debtor cannot maintain, based on current income and expenses, a 'minimal', standard of living for herself and her dependents if forced to repay the loans; (2) that additional circumstances exist indicating that this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period for student loans; and (3) that the debtor has made good faith efforts to repay the loans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Reagan must satisfy all three prongs of the test by a preponderance of the evidence\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   to obtain a discharge of her student loans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the\n   <em>\n    Faish\n   </em>\n   court explained, \"[e]quitable concerns or other extraneous factors not contemplated by the\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   framework may not be imported into the court's analysis to support a finding of dischargeability.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECMC challenges only Reagan's ability to meet the first prong of the test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the relevant inquiry is whether Reagan has pled sufficient facts to establish a genuine dispute over whether she can maintain a minimal standard of living while making monthly payments of $0 to ECMC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Reagan may establish her inability to maintain a minimal standard of living by showing she has \"extremely low income, compared with the cost of basic necessities.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   Some courts have adopted a framework to assess whether a minimal standard of living exists by examining the debtor's ability to satisfy the following expenses:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (1) shelter that is furnished, clean, free of pests and climate - regulated with heating and cooling;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (2) basic utilities such as electricity, water, gas, and telephone;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (3) food and personal hygiene products;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (4) transportation or vehicles (and the ability to service and insure those vehicles);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (5) life insurance and health insurance (or the ability to pay for medical and dental expenses); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (5) modest recreation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   However, even a debtor whose standard of living falls below this level may stumble at the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   test. Although \"[a]n evaluation of the debtor's present income and expenses is required under this prong[,] ... income and expenses should not be regarded as unalterable.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court's analysis is not restricted to Reagan's actual financial situation because it \"may [also] consider whether it would be unconscionable to require the Debtor to take any steps to earn more income or to reduce her expenses.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   ECMC relies on\n   <em>\n    In re Greene\n   </em>\n   to argue that Reagan \"will be unable to establish her burden under the first prong [of the\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   test] due to [her] actual participation in the [IBR Plan] with a payment amount of zero.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   <em>\n    Greene\n   </em>\n   court acknowledged that a $0 IBR Plan does not \"\n   <em>\n    ipso facto\n   </em>\n   \" prevent a debtor from demonstrating she cannot maintain a minimal standard of living,\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n   but it went on to hold that \"it is illogical to conclude that a payment of zero could be an undue hardship.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECMC similarly concedes that there is no \"\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   to this effect but then asks the Court to \"acknowledge that logically a payment of zero, even for a debtor at a minimal standard of living, could not force a debtor to live below a minimal standard.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   The difference between a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule and logical reasoning that precludes the possibility of meeting the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   test for a debtor enrolled in a $0 IBR Plan is not apparent. To the contrary, \"[t]hose debtors whose incomes are low enough to qualify for income-based repayments of $0.00 likely are the very individuals the undue hardship exception for student loans is meant to assist.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   ECMC cites a host of cases showing that the availability of an IBR Plan is relevant to whether a debtor can meet the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   test. The Court notes that these cases all concern debtors who have not yet enrolled in IBR Plans, and they were adjudicated by courts outside\n   the Third Circuit. One court held that \"the relevant inquiry for purposes of evaluating 'undue hardship' is whether Plaintiff could make the monthly payment as required by an income-based repayment plan\"-even though the debtor was not enrolled in one-and excepted her student loan from discharge because an IBR Plan \"would have fixed\" her payments at an affordable $267/mo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   Another similarly held that a debtor's mere eligibility for an IBR Plan \"where the amount of her monthly payment ... could be as low as $0.00 per month\" meant she could not meet the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   test,\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n   while a third held that a debtor's eligibility for an IBR Plan where payments would range from $0-47 meant he could not meet it either.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, a Florida bankruptcy court held that any analysis under the first prong \"should also consider any available restructuring of student loan debt that would ease the debtor's payment obligations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   ECMC also cites a case that reversed a student-loan discharge under both the first and third prongs of the\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   test because the debtor refused to enroll in an IBR Plan that would have made his payments $10/mo.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Cases within the Third Circuit tell a different story. In a 2002 case, ECMC conceded that a debtor could meet the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   test even though she was eligible for a zero-payment IBR Plan, arguing only that she could not pass the good-faith prong because she had declined to enroll in it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judge Fox observed that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   while consideration of the debtor's repayment options is one factor that a court may consider in determining 'undue hardship' under the totality of the circumstances, I am unaware of any decision which holds that the availability of the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program to a debtor-including its 'income contingent repayment plan' option-by itself requires a finding that it\n   would not be an 'undue hardship' to repay the student loan obligation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In another chapter 7 case before Chief Judge Deller in this Court, ECMC also conceded that a debtor with no income at all who may have been eligible for $0 payments under an IBR Plan could not maintain a minimal standard of living, again challenging her good faith in failing to pursue one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   At the hearing on the\n   <em>\n    Motion,\n   </em>\n   ECMC questioned how $0 payments under Reagan's IBR Plan could have pushed her below a minimal standard of living.\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   But courts within the Third Circuit have not framed the issue this way.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   If a debtor establishes that she cannot maintain a minimal standard of living at any payment amount, the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   test is satisfied. For example, Judge Frank found that a debtor's monthly income could not maintain a minimum standard of living \"even if no portion of the income [were] directed toward repayment of a student loan.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   He explained that a present inability to maintain a minimal standard of living \"renders the [IBR Plan] irrelevant under the first prong\" of the\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   test and that \"[t]o hold otherwise would make eligibility in the [IBR Plan] outcome determinative in undue hardship determinations under \u00a7 523(a)(8) and would result in the delegation to an administrative agency, the Department of Education, the authority to determine the dischargeability of certain student loans.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Court finds this logic compelling. The issue is not necessarily whether Reagan's payments of $0 have placed her below a minimal standard of living, but whether she can make her student loan payments\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   still maintain a minimal standard of living. Under these circumstances, Reagan is not required to show that her payments to ECMC are the reason why her living standard is less than minimal. If she finds herself financially underwater, the question of which obligation pushed her beneath the surface matters little. To a camel whose back is already broken, any straw in his pack is unwelcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Reagan argues her current income and expenses do place her below that threshold.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n   She points to her bankruptcy\n   schedules as evidence of her financial situation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   and she argues that the potential tax consequences of having her remaining loan balance forgiven (at the end of her IBR Plan) as well as the impact of her loans on her credit score as interest continues to accrue are reasons why her enrollment in such a plan should not stand in the way of a hardship discharge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   But even if the tax and credit implications of denying Reagan a discharge could be known with certainty and were not merely speculative, neither has any bearing on her present ability to maintain a minimal standard of living.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   This leaves the Court with two sources of evidence to assess whether she can maintain this standard while repaying her loans: her schedules and the fact that she is enrolled in a $0 IBR Plan. Although the Court does not consider ECMC's affidavit with respect to the IBR Plan, the creditor points to the U.S. Department of Education's regulations to show that Reagan must earn less than 150% of the poverty level to qualify for $0 payments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court takes judicial notice of Reagan's bankruptcy schedules, which show that her monthly expenses of $ 1,405\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   exceed her monthly income of $1,286\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n   by $ 119. The expenses include a modest allocation of $190 for home ownership expenses-presumably to rent the lot on which her mobile home sits-and only $20 for entertainment, with the rest divided among those basic necessities the\n   <em>\n    Ivory\n   </em>\n   framework contemplates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    61\n   </footnotemark>\n   Yet Reagan's income is seemingly insufficient to cover even these costs, nor can the Court readily identify any areas that could be trimmed to address the $119 deficiency, even assuming that this budget provides a minimal standard of living. Neither has ECMC suggested that Reagan is capable of increasing her income to improve her situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Although many of Reagan's arguments do not pertain to the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Brunner\n   </em>\n   test, her financial circumstances as represented to the Court by her schedules and enrollment in an IBR Plan in which her payments are $0 present a genuine question of material fact as to whether she is currently unable to maintain a minimal standard of living while repaying her student loans.
