Mr. Aslan Bears the Burden to Demonstrate that Mr. Cortez failed to preserve books or records from which Mr. Cortez's financial condition might be ascertained.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Mr. Aslan asserts that the court should deny Mr. Cortez a discharge because he failed to keep records of the type and quantity of work he performed as part of Pete's Workshop. The court is unpersuaded that these records were necessary for Mr. Aslan to ascertain Mr. Cortez's financial condition. Even though Mr. Cortez states he has a side business, Pete's Workshop, functionally the work performed as part of that business is simply an extension of Mr. Cortez's work for Quality Gem.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Cortez testified that he does not create, sell, or repair any jewelry for anyone besides Quality Gem. AP-ECF No. 50, P. 80, L. 17-25. Further Mr. Cortez testified, when he performed work as part of Pete's Workshop it was irrelevant how many hours he worked or how many pieces he worked on, he received a fixed salary from Quality Gem. AP-ECF No. 50, P. 90, L. 9-25; P. 91, L. 1-3. Thus, every two weeks, Mr. Cortez received from Quality Gem approximately $1,265.00 for his work performed during regular business hours and $1,600.00 for his work performed as part of Pete's Workshop. Mr. Aslan failed to introduce any testimony or evidence suggesting that Mr. Cortez's payment arrangement with Quality Gem was different than described or depended on the quantity of hours worked or type of work performed. Thus, in light of Mr. Cortez's arrangement with Quality Gem,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court is unpersuaded that for Mr. Aslan to determine Mr. Cortez's financial condition Mr. Cortez was required to keep records for the type or quantity of work performed as part of Pete's Workshop.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Supporting his income, Mr. Cortez introduced into evidence his federal income tax returns for the two years preceding the Petition Date, a six-month earnings report from Quality Gem, and the Handwritten P &amp; L.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Exh. 501, 502, 504. The court notes that Mr. Cortez produced at least one 1099 from Quality Gem.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's Exh. 101, 2004 Examination Transcript, P. 7, L. 7-9. And while 1099s and W-2s were not introduced into evidence during trial and are not being substantively considered, the court notes that Mr. Aslan was in possession of them and that they exist for the years 2010 through 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 41, Plaintiff's Proposed Exhibit List, H and I, P. 2;\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   AP-ECF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   No. 50, P. 24, L. 1-6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   No testimony or evidence was provided suggesting that Mr. Cortez received more income than what could be ascertained from these records. From this record, the court concludes that Mr. Cortez kept sufficient records to ascertain his income.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   However, even if there are sufficient records to ascertain Mr. Cortez's income, Mr. Aslan also asserts that the court should deny Mr. Cortez a discharge for failing to preserve and produce records relating to his expenses. Specifically, Mr. Aslan argues that Mr. Cortez failed to maintain records supporting the expenses listed on his Handwritten P &amp; L and deductions taken in his tax returns, including the costs of goods sold and other related business expenses. Mr. Cortez acknowledged that he failed to keep receipts for his expenses and that the figures stated in his Handwritten P &amp; L were estimates. Mr. Cortez failed to produce any records substantiating these estimates. AP-ECF No. 50, P. 39, L. 12-17; P. 69, L. 22-24, P. 70, L. 6-8. The court notes that Mr. Cortez admitted having a bank account and writing checks for expenses, but neither party produced evidence that Mr. Cortez maintained copies of his bank account statements or that he produced any account statements in the course of this litigation. AP-ECF No. 50, P. 77, L. 6-7, P. 78, L. 8-12, P. 85, L. 13-19. Without the underlying financial records, it is impossible to determine whether the Handwritten P &amp; L and tax returns that Mr. Cortez produced are accurate. Accordingly, the court concludes that Mr. Aslan has sustained his burden to show Mr. Cortez failed to keep and preserve any books or records from which his financial condition might be ascertained since no evidence substantiating expenses was introduced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    b. In the Absence of Records, Mr. Cortez Bears the Burden to Demonstrate that his Failure to Preserve Records was Justified.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   At this point, the burden shifts to Mr. Cortez to justify the deficiencies in his record keeping. Mr. Cortez asserted that he was justified in failing to keep adequate records of his expenses due to his lack of education, mental inability to keep organized, and lack of business sophistication. AP-ECF No. 58. As noted above, the court must consider a variety of factors when evaluating the reasonableness of a debtor's justification, including: the education, experience, and sophistication of the debtor; the volume of the debtor's business; the complexity of the debtor's business; the amount of credit extended to debtor in his business; and any other circumstances that should be considered in the interest of justice.\n   <em>\n    In re Cacioli\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3716612,3723324\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/463/229/\">\n    463 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   237 (ci\n   <em>\n    ting\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Meridian Bank v. Alten\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6512525,10522887\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/958/1226/\">\n    958 F.2d 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1231 (3d Cir. 1992) ). After consideration of the\n   <em>\n    Cacioli\n   </em>\n   factors, the court concludes that several factors weigh in favor of Mr. Cortez.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   First, the court notes that none of the evidence provided at trial suggests that Mr. Cortez possesses the education or experience to qualify him as a sophisticated debtor. \"A sophisticated debtor is generally held to a higher level of accountability in record keeping, and the more complex the debtor's financial situation, the more numerous and detailed the debtor's financial records should be.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Sethi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11250784\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/250/831/#p839\">\n    250 B.R. 831\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 839 (Bankr. E.D.N.Y. 2000). Despite the lack of evidence suggesting sophistication, Mr. Aslan claims\n   that it would be simple for Mr. Cortez to keep records of the work done for Quality Gem.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AP-ECF No. 57, P. 3. However, the court finds Mr. Aslan's assumption misplaced. It very may seem \"simple\" for Mr. Aslan, who has worked as an attorney in a business affairs department for over forty years, to keep records. But Mr. Aslan is not Mr. Cortez. Mr. Cortez dropped out of high school, has no higher education, and has made a living working with his hands. While in school, Mr. Cortez was placed in special education classes. AP-ECF No. 50, P. 74, L. 16-25, P. 75, L. 1-6. Mr. Cortez acknowledged that he has difficulty keeping organized. Additionally, Mr. Cortez noted that he relies on others including lawyers, accountants, and his wife to help manage his affairs. He is uncomfortable using a computer and created a profit and loss statement by hand. Thus, these factors: education, experience, and sophistication weigh in favor of a finding that Mr. Cortez was justified in his inability to maintain records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Additionally, the complexity of Mr. Cortez's business, Pete's Workshop - if the court even considers it a separate business compared to an extension of his employment with Quality Gem- is not complex. The business consists of Mr. Cortez creating or repairing jewelry for Quality Gem when there is insufficient time to finish the work during his regular full-time hours. His arrangement with Quality Gem - Pete's Workshop's only customer - involves Mr. Cortez being paid a fixed amount every two weeks regardless of the number of hours, the number of pieces worked on, the cost of materials, or the value of the work performed. No testimony or evidence was introduced from Quality Gem to contradict Mr. Cortez's testimony regarding his payment arrangement. Such an arrangement suggests a simplicity not requiring the creation or maintenance of records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is not for the court to decide whether this arrangement represents a wise business practice, but rather whether Mr. Cortez was justified under these circumstances for failing to maintain his expense receipts. Here, the expense receipts' lack of importance is highlighted by the payment arrangement whereby Mr. Cortez earns the same pay regardless of the expenses incurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Mr. Aslan contends that Mr. Cortez is the consummate actor, AP-ECF No. 57, and that this court should find Mr. Cortez's justification unreasonable because, among other things, Mr. Cortez has been divorced twice, hired professionals, and raised children. The court disagrees. The court is unpersuaded that being divorced or raising children equates to an ability to keep more complex financial records. And while Mr. Cortez was able to hire professionals to assist him in lawsuits and in competing tax returns, the court is not willing to make the conclusion that Mr. Aslan seeks - that an ability to hire professionals equates to Mr. Cortez having the ability to effectively maintain financial records. Rather, the court credits Mr. Cortez's testimony that he relied upon professionals, that he trusted his accountant, and that he did not fully comprehend why certain\n   figures were used in his tax returns but that he had no reason to doubt them. AP-ECF No. 50, P. 59, L. 1-13, P. 65, L. 9-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Additionally, the court observed Mr. Cortez's demeanor and testimony and found it credible. The court further notes that \"[ \u00a7 727 ] must be construed strictly against those who object to the debtor's discharge and 'liberally in favor of the bankrupt.' \"\n   <em>\n    In re Chalasani\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7637611,6475182\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/92/1300/\">\n    92 F.3d at 1310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying that standard in this case, the court finds Mr. Cortez's testimony, regarding his lack of education and inability to be financially organized, credible. Accordingly, because Mr. Cortez lacked business sophistication, his work was simple in nature, and there was no evidence that the failure to maintain records was a purposeful attempt to obscure his financial condition, the court concludes that, for purposes of \u00a7 727(a)(3), Mr. Cortez was justified to keep records of his financial matters as he did. As none of the evidence or arguments presented by Mr. Aslan rebut that conclusion, the court overrules Mr. Aslan's objection to Mr. Cortez's discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <strong>\n    VII.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In conclusion, after consideration of the pleadings, testimony, evidence admitted during trial, the court's own docket and arguments of the parties, the court concludes for the reasons stated herein, that Mr. Aslan did not meet his burden under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20727\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) to show that Mr. Cortez failed to keep records and that his failure was unjustified.
