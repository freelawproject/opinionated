For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants, in part, the Defendants Motion to Dismiss. Specifically the Court holds the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   1. The Court grants the Motion to Dismiss the preferential transfer claims in Count XIV because the Trustee has failed to identify sufficiently the specific Debtor who is making the transfer in violation of the\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   pleading standards as interpreted by the Court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   2. The Court grants the Motion to Dismiss the fiduciary breach claims in Count XV because the Trustee has failed to allege sufficiently Defendants owed fiduciary duties to the Debtors or breached said duties if they did owe them.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   3. The Court dismisses with prejudice the breach of fiduciary duty claim in Count XVI because it is a futile claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   4. The Court grants the Motion to Dismiss the accounting claims in Count XVII because before the Court grants a request for an accounting, the Trustee must establish that there was a breach of fiduciary duty, which he has not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   5. The Court grants the Motion to Dismiss the claim for a disallowance of claims in Count XVIII because the Trustee has failed to attain a judicial determination on the Complaint which is a prerequisite to a claim for disallowance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Conversely, the Court denies, in part, the Defendants' Motion to Dismiss the constructive fraudulent transfer claims and actual fraudulent transfer claims in Counts X-XII because the Trustee has met the\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   pleading standards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the \"Court\") has subject matter jurisdiction over this adversary proceeding pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).

Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On May 9, 2015 (the \"Petition Date\"), Pennysaver USA Publishing, LLC filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court subsequently entered an order providing for the joint administration of the Debtors' cases consolidating PennySaver USA, LLC, PennySaver USA Publishing, LLC, PennySaver USA Printing, LLC, Orbiter Properties, LLC, and Monthly Mailer, LLC (collectively the \"Debtors\") for procedural purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Office of the United States Trustee appointed Don A. Beskrone as the interim Chapter 7 Trustee of the Debtors' cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Beskrone now serves as the trustee (the \"Trustee\") in these cases according to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20702\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Debtors are Delaware limited liability companies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The other three non-Debtor Delaware LLCs at issue are PennySaver Investors, LLC (\"Investors\"), OpenGate Capital Group, LLC (\"Capital\"), and OpenGate Capital Management, LLC, (\"Management\" together with Investors and\n   Capital \"OpenGate\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Throughout the Complaint, the Trustee uses the term \"OpenGate\" to refer to a single entity and fails to distinguish between Capital, Management, and Investors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Trustee alleges the following relationship between the LLCs at issue. Management and Capital directly managed Investors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Capital owned 98% of Investors' equity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Investors owned, directly or indirectly, the Debtors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, Investors was the sole member and manager of Debtor PennySaver USA, LLC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Management, Capital, and Investors are indistinct as a matter of day-to-day control.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The OpenGate group acquired the Debtors on September 27, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Defendants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Trustee alleges the positions that the Defendants held as employees in one or more of the OpenGate entities, although he fails to specify which of the OpenGate entities: Capital, Management, or Investors, actually employed the Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, the Trustee alleges that all instructions as to the operations of the Debtors came from persons publicly identified as having been employed by Capital. Yet, the Trustee fails to identify whether the Defendants are publicly identified as Capital employees. Lastly, the Trustee alleges that OpenGate together with \"Nikou, Yook and OpenGate's other\n   <em>\n    senior managers\n   </em>\n   \" orchestrated a coordinated effort to drain the Debtors of their cash.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    2. Fiduciary Duty\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In the Complaint, the Trustee alleges that Defendants caused the Debtors to make a series of fraudulent transfers from the Debtors to OpenGate, OpenGate's affiliates and employees, or persons to whom OpenGate owed money.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, the Trustee alleges that each of the Defendants exercised control over the Debtors' management from time to time. However, aside from Defendant Thornton, the Defendants are never identified by name in allegations governing the direction or authorization of allegedly fraudulent transfers except as recipients of salary payments. Even when the Defendants, including Thornton, are identified by name, there are no allegations that they personally authorized any of the allegedly fraudulent transfers, including their salaries.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Instead, the term \"OpenGate\" is used to describe the entity that is causing the majority of the transfers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The only transfer the Trustee does not entirely contribute to the OpenGate entities is attributed to both non-Defendant Joy Yook\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   OpenGate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustee alleges that Defendant\n   Thornton, specifically, was aware of all of the money transferred from the Debtors to OpenGate and kept a record it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The Complaint alleges that the Defendants owed fiduciary duties to the Debtors and breached those duties by facilitating all of the allegedly fraudulent transfers. The Complaint does not detail Defendants' positions within the Debtors' LLCs nor does it detail how Defendants facilitated the transfers. The Trustee fails to allege that Defendants are members or managers of the Debtors under any of the Debtors' LLC agreements. The Trustee has also failed to allege that the Defendants owe fiduciary duties to the Debtors as outlined in any of the Debtors LLC agreements. The Defendants and the Trustee have stated that there are LLC agreements, but neither side has produced them for the review of the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Trustee alleges that for each of the allegedly fraudulent transfers listed below, Debtors were insolvent or rendered insolvent by the transfer and received no value or consideration therefrom.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   The seven alleged fraudulent transfers are alleged below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    a. The Closing Expenses and the Distribution\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Trustee alleges that OpenGate forced the Debtors to pay approximately $868,000 in closing expenses and that this payment constitutes a fraudulent transfer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustee also alleges that the Debtors made these transfers for the sole benefit of OpenGate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustee alleges that OpenGate shortly after acquiring the Debtors caused the Debtors to pay out a distribution of $2,000,000 to Capital.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    b. The Tax Payment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Trustee alleges that approximately seven months after the acquisition OpenGate caused the Debtors to distribute $1,803,516.00 to itself for alleged tax obligations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustee further alleges that the tax payment was a distribution or transfer of an interest in the Debtors property, made to or for the benefit of OpenGate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <em>\n    c. The Monthly Management Fee\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Shortly acquiring the Debtors, OpenGate caused one or more of the Debtors to enter into a management agreement with OpenGate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, OpenGate did not provide the Debtors with any management services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustee includes an exhibit detailing the date the Debtors made each monthly payment for a total of $1,249,999.95 payments were made.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <em>\n    d. The Salary Payments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In addition to the breach of fiduciary duty claims, the fraudulent and preferential transfer claims rely on the facts set out\n   in the Salary Payments section herein. The Trustee alleges that the Debtors designated the Defendants as \"OpenGate Employee[s]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   And that the Debtors paid the Defendants generous salaries commencing until the month before the bankruptcy filings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustee also alleges that the Debtors were forced to pay bonuses to the Defendants when they had insufficient funds to give their own staff bonuses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustee alleges that not one of the Defendants performed any amount of material services nor provided any material value to the Debtors in exchange for the salaries they received.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustee breaks these payments down in detail showing the dates and amounts the Debtors transferred funds to the Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   These payments occurred within two years of the Petition Date.\n   <footnotemark>\n    36\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    e. The Fusion Fee and Cover-up\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   OpenGate directed the Debtors to provide a thirty-day loan to an OpenGate portfolio company under the guise of a \"business agreement\" even though a loan would violate the Debtors' debt covenants-a fact that OpenGate's counsel pointed out.\n   <footnotemark>\n    37\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Jay Yook, a partner of one of the OpenGate entities, was the one who instructed the Debtors to make the loan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   OpenGate created a new history to rebrand the business agreement as a \"sublease.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thornton gave the Debtors' VP of Finance detailed instructions to invent this new history.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    f. The IT Payment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Trustee alleges that OpenGate told the Debtors to pay a $7500/month IT consulting fee to an OpenGate employee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   The payments were made directly to OpenGate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustee alleges that the OpenGate employee performed little or no IT services for the Debtors, but did perform them for OpenGate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    43\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    g. Insolvency\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Trustee alleges that the Defendants were insolvent or rendered insolvent because\n   of or before the occurrence of each of the allegedly fraudulent transfers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    44\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the Trustee alleges that the Debtors were insolvent from the day OpenGate acquired them, and became increasingly insolvent until they declared bankruptcy eighteen months later and that the Defendants were fully aware of that fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    45\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustee describes the Debtors' declining financial performance and even alleges that the valuation mechanism OpenGate used to value the Debtors' LLCs overestimated the value of the insolvent company.\n   <footnotemark>\n    46\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, the Trustee alleges that the book value of the Debtors' working capital and equipment was excessively high resulting in a liquidation value for the Debtors' LLCs that was less than the amount of their debt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    47\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Defendants do not dispute that the Debtors were insolvent from day one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Trustee alleges that the Debtors' entered into a loan agreement with Capital One Business Credit Corp. secured with substantially all of their assets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    48\n   </footnotemark>\n   And that Investors guaranteed the loan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    49\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustee fails to allege whether Capital One Business Credit Corp. or any other creditors are assignees or members of the Debtors' LLCs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Legal Standard for Motion to Dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 12(b)(6)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss all claims in Counts X-XII and XIV-XVIII of the Complaint under Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 12(b)(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    50\n   </footnotemark>\n   Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 12(b)(6) requires the Trustee to state a plausible claim for relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    51\n   </footnotemark>\n   A plausible claim exists when the plaintiff pleads sufficient facts allowing the court to reasonably infer that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    52\n   </footnotemark>\n   Recitations of elements of a cause of action, legal conclusions, and bare assertions of wrongdoing will not alone suffice to state a plausible claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    53\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plausibility determination requires a context-specific analysis where the court must draw on its judicial experience and common sense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    54\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Third Circuit instructs courts to follow a two-step analysis. First, they must separate factual and legal elements of a claim, accepting all of the complaint's well-pleaded facts as true while disregarding any legal conclusions. Second, they must determine whether the facts alleged in the complaint are sufficient to show a plaintiff has a plausible claim for relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   The relevant record for this analysis includes the complaint and any document integral or explicitly relied upon in the complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

The Trustee casts a wide net in making these claims arguing that they are fraudulent transfer claims under \u00a7 548, including actual fraudulent transfers, constructive fraudulent transfers as well as Delaware and California state law claims against the Defendants. California and Delaware have both adopted the UFTA, rendering the elements for the State and Federal law claims essentially the same, with the main difference that under the state law claims the lookback period extends to four years.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n   For all other purposes, the state and federal law claims are identical.\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Defendants dispute that the Trustee has adequately pleaded all elements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20548\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A), \u00a7 548(a)(1)(B), Delaware Code Section \u00a7 1304(a)(2)(a), and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%203439.04\">\n    Cal.

R. Civ. Pro. 9(b)'s particularity requirements and that the facts alleged do not sufficiently support a plausible inference that the Debtors received less than reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the allegedly fraudulent transfers. Furthermore, the Defendants argue that the Trustee must defeat a presumption of reasonable equivalent value when it comes to the payment of salaries, that the Trustee has no standing to sue under 544(b), and that the Trustee has failed to meet the pleading standard required by\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   because the Trustee has failed to identify which of the Debtors was the entity to actually transfer funds to the Defendants. Instead, the Defendants argue that the Trustee has simply used the term \"Debtors\" as if that term satisfies Fed. R. Civ. P. 9(b)'s pleading standard. The Court first examines which pleading standard is appropriate here, and then the elements that constitute constructive and actual fraudulent transfers as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    1. Legal Standard for Pleading Constructive Fraud\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   This Court evaluates claims of constructive fraud under the notice pleading\n   standard of Fed. R. Civ.

However, it is not clear which of the \"Debtors\" made the transfer, though it is clear that \"the Debtors\" made each of the allegedly fraudulent transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The Defendants argue that unless the source is made clear, the constructive fraudulent transfer claim is invalid. But by naming each transferee and the exact amount they received per transfer, the Trustee has given each Defendant fair notice. And he has explicitly alleged that the Debtors received less than reasonably equivalent value in exchange for the assets transferred to each Defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    76\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants argue that the Trustee must overcome the presumption that salary payments are \"reasonably equivalent value.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    77\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Defendants cite to three cases to support this claim, but not one of these cases applies the necessary pleading standard for a motion to dismiss. This distinction is essential because disputes over reasonably equivalent value are not appropriate for determination on a motion to dismiss.\n   <footnotemark>\n    78\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, they are issues to be addressed in the discovery process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Defendants also argue that the Court should reject the conclusory allegations that the Debtors received nothing in return for the Defendants' salary payments as violations of the pleading standard.

These badges can include, but are not limited to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   (i) The relationship between the debtor and the transferee;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   (ii) Consideration for the conveyance;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (iii) Insolvency or indebtedness of the debtors;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   (iv) How much of the debtor's estate was transferred;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   (v) Reservation of benefits, control or dominion by the debtor over the property transferred; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   (vi) Secrecy or concealment of the transaction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    93\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   The presence or absence of any single badge of fraud is not conclusive.

Additionally, a court may consider other factors relevant to the transaction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    94\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Trustee must allege that the timing of the transfers occurred within two years before the petition date, that the Debtors were indebted, and voluntarily or involuntarily made the alleged transfer with the actual intent to deceive those to whom they were indebted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The transfers in question are the salary payment transfers. The allowable date range to bring this claim extends from May 29, 2013, to May 29, 2015. The salary payments all fall within this range. The Defendants do not argue this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The meat of the analysis concerns whether the Debtors voluntarily or involuntarily conducted these Salary Payments with the intent to defraud an entity to whom they were indebted.

The Defendants and the Trustee disagree as to whether the Trustee has sufficiently pled \"actual intent\" under Fed. R. Civ.

The Trustee alleges that the transferees controlled the Debtors management from time to time. This is a conclusory statement and needs to be backed by factual allegations. The Trustee supports this statement with allegations that Defendant Thornton allegedly directed the Debtors' VP of Finance to rewrite the history of a loan from the Debtors' to an affiliate of OpenGate to make it seem like it was not, in fact, a loan and knew of all the transfers the Debtors made to OpenGate and its affiliates. As to Defendant Thornton, this badge of fraud may have been sufficiently alleged. But as to the remaining Defendants, this badge of fraud has not been sufficiently alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The second badge of fraud is consideration in exchange for the conveyance. The Trustee has alleged sufficiently that there was no consideration given in exchange for the Defendants' salaries. The third badge of fraud is the insolvency of the Debtors. The Trustee has alleged sufficiently the Debtors' insolvency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The fourth badge of fraud is how much of the Debtors' estate was transferred. The Trustee alleges the specific dollar amount and that the amount was more than the Debtor could bear. The Trustee alleges that the Debtors were unable to give their own staff bonuses but were still required to pay the Defendants bonuses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    96\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Trustee has pled this badge of fraud. Though the Trustee does not allege what percentage of the Debtors' estate was transferred, he alleges sufficiently that the amount was most likely more than the Debtors could afford.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The fifth badge of fraud is that the Debtor reserved control of the property after it was transferred. This did not occur here. The sixth badge of fraud is secrecy or concealment of the transfer. There was no alleged secrecy involved in the Salary Payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The Trustee alleged sufficiently three out of the six badges of fraud. \"The confluence of several [badges of fraud] in one transaction generally provides conclusive evidence of an actual intent to defraud.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    97\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Trustee has alleged sufficiently both state and federal actual transfer claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <strong>\n    5.

Defendants next argue that even if they did owe a fiduciary duty to the Debtors' LLCs, the Complaint does not allege facts indicating that the Defendants caused the management of the Debtors' LLC to breach that duty because it fails to allege the specific relationship between the individual Defendants and the Debtors' management.\n   <footnotemark>\n    107\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, Defendants argue that the Complaint's assertion of a breach of fiduciary duties owed to the Debtors' creditors is improper because creditors are not owed fiduciary duties, and consequently, do not have standing to assert those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The Trustee contends that the Defendants did owe fiduciary duties to the Debtors and the Debtors' creditors because they collectively and individually facilitated the numerous allegedly fraudulent transfers to the detriment of both the Debtors and the Debtors' creditors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    108\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court considers the Defendants' fiduciary duties owed to the Debtors and Debtors' creditors in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <em>\n    1.

The Defendants are more similar to the shared employees in\n   <em>\n    Cargill\n   </em>\n   than they are to the managing member of an LLC or the director of a Limited Partnership because the Defendants are not alleged to be the managers of any LLC that owns any of the Debtors' LLCs but are instead employees that are shared between Debtors' LLCs and one of the OpenGate LLCs. The Trustee has failed to allege a comparable amount of control shared between the Defendants in this case and the defendants in the above cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    124\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Even if the Trustee had established that the Defendants exercised control over the Debtor LLCs, the Complaint has failed to provide sufficient facts for the plausible inference that the Defendants caused the Fraudulent Transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   According to case law, the well-pled facts that a Trustee must set forth to show that the Defendants caused the Fraudulent Transfers include (1) the \"specific facts as to which transactions a particular defendant authorized... (2) what authority a particular defendant had to approve such transactions\" and (3) the Trustee must not lump defendants together \"without supplying specific facts as to each defendant's\n   wrongdoings.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    125\n   </footnotemark>\n   The failure to plead any one of these elements will result in the dismissal of the claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Yet the Trustee in the case at hand has failed to allege any of these things. The statements that do allege that Defendants controlled the Debtors fail because (1) the Trustee does not adequately distinguish the Defendants from one another and instead lumps them together as \"OpenGate Employees\" (2) the Trustee alleges positions held by the Defendants in OpenGate's organization but fails to identify which positions the Defendants held in the Debtors' organizations, (3) the Trustee does not specify which transfer any particular defendant authorized and (4) the Trustee does not specify under what authority within the Debtors' LLCs the Defendant acted to authorize the allegedly fraudulent transfers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Because the Trustee fails to allege sufficiently that the Defendants exercised actual domination and control over the Debtors', the Trustee has failed to plead adequately that the Defendants owed a fiduciary duty to the Debtors, and there is no need to examine whether that, nonexistent, duty was breached.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The Trustee does allege specific facts that identify Defendant Thornton as the one who directed the Debtors' VP of finance to cover-up a loan from the Debtors' to Fusion and also as someone who knew and kept track of the total amount of the transfers that the Debtors were making to OpenGate and its affiliates. This allegation, however, is insufficient to show that Thornton exercised the necessary control over the Debtors to establish that she owed them a fiduciary duty. This is, in part, because the Trustee alleges specifically that it was non-Defendant Jay Yook who directed the Debtors to pay the Fusion Fee. The Trustee does not allege facts to show that Thornton, specifically, authorized the transfer, nor does the Trustee allege the specific position in the Debtors' organization that Thornton held which would have allowed her to control the Debtors' management. Because she did not owe a duty to the Debtors, she could not have breached a duty to the Debtors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In conclusion, the Trustee has failed to adequately plead facts sufficient to show that the Defendants held positions within the Debtors' organization as fiduciaries. Even if there had been a fiduciary relationship established, the Trustee fails to allege sufficiently that the Defendants caused the Debtors to make the Fraudulent Transfers. If there is no fiduciary duty pled adequately, there can be no breach of that duty. The Motion to Dismiss Count XV is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <em>\n    2. Fiduciary Duties Owed to the Creditors\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The Trustee alleges that because the Defendants forced the Debtors to make the fraudulent transfers, they caused the creditors to sustain significant damages. And because the Debtors were insolvent at the time of the fraudulent transfers, the fiduciary duties the Defendants owed to the Debtors were expanded to the Debtors' creditors, and the Defendants breached those duties. The Defendants argue that creditors have no standing to assert a derivative breach of fiduciary duty claims against an LLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The Complaint fails to discuss whether the claim sought by the Trustee on behalf of the creditors is direct or derivative. Creditors cannot seek direct claims for breach of fiduciary duty against\n   LLCs and their officers or directors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    126\n   </footnotemark>\n   The claim must be derivative in nature. If the claim is derivative, it fails because derivative claims can only be brought by members or assignees of LLCs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    127\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Any confusion in the law is likely attributable to the fact that Delaware law treats corporations and LLCs differently. Delaware law, according to\n   <em>\n    Gheewalla\n   </em>\n   , permits creditors to bring derivative actions against corporations because when the Debtor is insolvent, the fiduciary duty owed to the shareholders is transferred to the creditors.\n   <footnotemark>\n    128\n   </footnotemark>\n   The creditors then have standing to sue\n   <em>\n    the directors\n   </em>\n   of the corporation for breaches of fiduciary duties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    129\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Creditors of an LLC have no standing to bring a derivative breach of fiduciary duty claim against an LLC even if it is insolvent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    130\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is primarily due to the language of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act which states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   In a derivative action, the plaintiff must be a member or an assignee of a limited liability company interest at the time of bringing the action and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   (1)At the time of the transaction of which the plaintiff complains; or (2)The plaintiff's status as a member or an assignee of a limited liability company interest had devolved upon the plaintiff by operation of law or pursuant to the terms of a limited liability company agreement from a person who was a member or an assignee of a limited liability company interest at the time of the transaction.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    131\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The Trustee must allege that the creditors are members or assignees of the Debtors' LLCs to have standing to bring derivative claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The claim for breach of fiduciary duties owed to the creditors fails because the Trustee does not allege that the creditors are assignees or members of the Debtors' LLCs. The creditors of the Debtors' LLC thus lack standing to sue the LLC or its members and directors for breaches of fiduciary duties. The Trustee does not have standing to sue on behalf of the creditors who themselves have no standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   The Court grants the motion to dismiss, in part, for all breach of fiduciary duty claims owed to debtors in Counts XV-XVI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    7. Claim XVII for an Accounting.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Under Delaware law, a claim for accounting is an equitable remedy tied to fiduciary duties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    132\n   </footnotemark>\n   As it is a remedy, the Trustee must first plead plausibly a claim for breach of fiduciary duty before the Court can address the Trustee's arguments for granting an accounting. Because the Trustee has not pled plausibly a claim for fiduciary duty, Count XVII is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    8. Claim XVIII for Failure to State a Claim for Disallowance under\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20502\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 502\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The Trustee objects to the allowance of any claims filed by, or on behalf of, OpenGate or any of the Defendants, generally.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-140\">\n   Disallowing a claim under Section 502(d) requires a judicial determination that a claimant is liable.

Therefore, The Trustee fails to adequately plead a claim under Section 502(d). Consequently, Claim Nineteen is dismissed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    135\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The Trustee has failed to obtain a judicial determination on either the preference or the fraudulent transfer claims.

Request to Dismiss Counts with Prejudice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The Defendants ask that the Court grant their Motion to Dismiss and deny the Plaintiff's claims against the Defendants with prejudice. If \"[t]he record does not suggest that the Trustee acted in bad faith or with improper motive... the only potential grounds to deny leave to amend are undue delay, futility, and the unfair burden on the opposing party.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    136\n   </footnotemark>\n   This is the Trustee's first Complaint. The Trustee can amend the Complaint to meet the pleading requirements for at least some of the claims. The request for dismissal with prejudice is denied except for the claims in Count XVI which are futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   For the reasons set forth herein, the Motion to Dismiss is granted, in part, and denied, in part. The Court denies the motion to dismiss the fraudulent transfer claims in Counts X-XII. The Court grants the motion to dismiss the preferential transfer claims in Count XIV, the fiduciary breach claims in Counts XV, the accounting claims in Count XVII and the claim for a disallowance in Count XVIII. The Court grants the Motion to Dismiss the fiduciary breach claims in Count XVI with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-149\">\n    The Defendants have explicitly not consented to entries of final orders or judgments by this Court.
