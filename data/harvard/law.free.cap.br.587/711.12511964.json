Fischer, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On February 17, 2018, the United States Bankruptcy Court filed a Report and Recommendation (R &amp; R) and proposed findings recommending that this Court grant Chapter 7 Trustee-Plaintiff Jason Rund's motion for summary adjudication on his claim that Defendants made fraudulent transfers with actual intent. Defendants John Kirkland and Poshow Ann Kirkland (as trustee of the Bright Conscience Trust) object to the R &amp; R, and submit additional evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pursuant to Rule 9033(d) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, the Court has reviewed the additional evidence and the portions of the Bankruptcy Court's findings of fact to which written objections have been filed. For the reasons stated below, the Court rejects the recommendation and findings of the Bankruptcy Court and denies the motion for summary adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Facts and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This is one of several bankruptcy proceedings involving EPD Investment Co., LLC (EPD).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 4. In December 2010, creditors commenced the involuntary petition at issue here. Appendix Record (REC), Dkts. 15-17, at 11982.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pressman is the sole proprietor of EPD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff alleges EPD has not been profitable since before 2003.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Between 2003 and 2009, EPD allegedly lost money every year.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff also alleges that EPD has operated as a Ponzi scheme since 2003, specifically alleging that EPD used investments it received to pay existing creditors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   By 2009, EPD had allegedly stopped making payments to its creditors because it lacked cash infusions from new investors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   John Kirkland served as Pressman's lawyer for his various ventures and allegedly invested money in EPD.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Trustee's basic allegation is that John Kirkland took various steps to hide EPD's financial condition. Therefore, the Trustee filed this suit against John Kirkland and Bright Conscience Trust, which is operated by Poshow Kirkland, seeking relief on claims for subordination and avoidance of fraudulent transfers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   The Trustee moved for summary adjudication on the issue of whether Defendants made fraudulent transfers with actual intent.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11996.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Finding no dispute of material fact, the Bankruptcy Court concluded that EPD operated as a Ponzi scheme.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11991-92. In reaching this decision, the Bankruptcy Court excluded the Declaration of Jerrold Pressman and the declaration and report of Defendant's expert, J. Michael Issa (Issa Report).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11985-92. Because it deemed EPD a Ponzi scheme, the Bankruptcy Court applied the \"Ponzi presumption\" that Defendants are liable for fraudulent transfers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11992-93. The Bankruptcy Court also concluded that Defendants engaged in fraudulent conduct based on the \"badges of fraud\" test.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11993. Defendants timely objected to the R &amp; R, arguing that the Bankruptcy Court improperly excluded the Pressman Declaration and the Issa Report-which, if admitted, would have raised a genuine dispute of material fact precluding summary adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Defendants contend that this Court reviews the Bankruptcy Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   , citing Rule 9033(d). Written Objections at 1, Dkt. 9-1. Plaintiff concedes\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review is appropriate for the findings of fact and conclusions of law as they relate to John Kirkland. Response to Written Objections at 6, Dkt. 7. But Plaintiff contends the Court reviews both findings of fact and conclusions of law for clear error as they relate to Poshow Kirkland, as trustee to Bright Conscience Trust, because Ms. Kirkland previously consented to the Bankruptcy Court's jurisdiction to hear and determine claims relating to her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    In re EPD Inv.

First,\n   <em>\n    In re EPD Inv. Co.\n   </em>\n   does not support Plaintiff's contention that Ms. Kirkland consented to the Bankruptcy Court's jurisdiction. The footnote citation that Plaintiff relies on is ambiguous and does not show that Ms. Kirkland consented to the Bankruptcy Court's jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    In re EPD Inv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4257203,4281715\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/1146/\">\n    821 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1151 n.2. Second, Plaintiff has not pointed to any evidence that Ms. Kirkland filed multiple proofs of claim in the debtors' bankruptcy case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response to Written Objection (Response) at 6, Dkt. 7. Nor could the Court find any evidence in the record supporting this argument. Plaintiff cites to the R &amp; R to support its contention,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4257203,4281715\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/1146/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 7 n.24; but that portion of the R &amp; R merely summarizes Plaintiff's allegations in his complaint.

The Pressman Declaration is Admissible\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Bankruptcy Court first found the Pressman Declaration inadmissible under the sham affidavit rule.

But the sham affidavit rule should be applied with caution because it is in tension with the principle that the court is not to make credibility determinations when granting or denying summary judgment. In order to trigger the sham affidavit rule, the district court must make a factual determination that the contradiction is a sham, and the inconsistency between a party's [earlier statement] and subsequent affidavit must be clear and unambiguous to justify striking the affidavit.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3518832\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/693/1076/#p1080\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).

The Bankruptcy Court concluded that this statement conflicted with his 2010 tax return, in which Pressman attested that EPD had $70 million in liabilities and no realized assets that year. REC at 11992. The Bankruptcy Court also found (1) that Pressman could not opine on whether EPD operated as a Ponzi scheme because he is not an accountant, and (2) his statements should be excluded as vague and self-serving.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11991-92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Excluding the Pressman Declaration was error. First, the Pressman Declaration does not necessarily conflict with EPD's 2010 tax return. Plaintiff alleged that EPD's illegal conduct took place between 2003 and 2009. REC at 11982. But EPD could have been sustainable during some of those years, as Pressman declares. Likewise, EPD could have financially collapsed in 2010, as EPD's 2010 tax returns reflect. Indeed, Defendants suggest that\n   the \"Great Recession\" was the root of EPD's financial collapse. Written Objections at 1-2. Certainly, the Court is skeptical that EPD had $70 million in liabilities in 2010, yet was a sustainable business for the prior seven years-even in light of the recession. However, the alleged inconsistency is not so \"clear and unambiguous\" that it justifies striking the affidavit.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Yeager\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3518832\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/693/1076/#p1080\">\n    693 F.3d at 1080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Nor does Pressman need to be an accountant to testify that EPD did not operate as a Ponzi scheme.

According to the Bankruptcy Court, Issa's Report conflicts with his deposition. REC 11987-98. In his Report, Issa attested that Jonavic's\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   testimony should be given considerable weight because there is no reason for Jonavic to lie. REC 11987-88.

Issa acknowledges that he gave Jonavic's deposition a cursory review before preparing his Report.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11987. This does not clearly and unambiguously conflict with the statement that Jonavic's deposition testimony should be given considerable weight because he has no reason to lie.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9593. Issa's deposition and Report are reconcilable: even though Issa gave a cursory review of Jonavic's deposition, he gave a lot of weight to this cursory review in his Report. Issa's methodology affects the weight of his Report, not its admissibility.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hemmings v.

According to the Bankruptcy Court, between 2003 and 2010, EPD had approximately $10.85 million in negative cash flows while it raised $64.52 million from investors. REC at 11990-91.

By accepting Jermiassen's numbers and analysis when Defendants presented contrary evidence, the Bankruptcy Court improperly resolved a disputed issue of fact.
