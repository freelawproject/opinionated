The court held a hearing on confirmation of the plan on April 24, 2018. The relevant facts are not in dispute. After hearing the legal arguments of counsel, the court held this matter under advisement. After due deliberation and consideration of the facts and the legal arguments, the court is prepared to rule on this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The debtor's plan seeks to cure the arrearages on the mortgage indebtedness secured by his residence.

Before this case was filed, the Debtor defaulted on his loan and MidFirst commenced foreclosure proceedings against the Property in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland (the \"Circuit Court\"). The substitute trustees under the deed of trust conducted a public auction foreclosure sale of the Property on July 20, 2017, at which MidFirst was the high bidder and purchased the Property for $57,760.00. Approximately 30 minutes later, the Debtor filed a voluntary petition in this court seeking relief under Chapter 7 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the \"Bankruptcy Code\"). As a result, further foreclosure proceedings in the Circuit Court were stayed automatically under \u00a7 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On September 12, 2017, MidFirst filed a motion for relief from the automatic stay in order to obtain ratification of the sale by the Circuit Court and conclude the foreclosure proceeding. The Debtor thereafter filed a motion to convert this case to one under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, which motion was granted on September 28, 2017. This court conducted a hearing on MidFirst's motion on October 16, 2017. Earlier that same day, the Debtor filed a proposed Chapter 13 plan under the terms of which the anticipated pre-petition arrears due MidFirst of $20,000.00 would be paid over 60 months and the Debtor would maintain post-petition payments directly (that is, outside the plan) in accordance with \u00a7 1322(b)(5) of the Bankruptcy Code. At the October 16, 2017 hearing, the Debtor asserted that\n   <em>\n    Kameni\n   </em>\n   was the \"governing law\" in this district and dictated that the Debtor be afforded an opportunity to obtain confirmation of a plan proposing to cure pre-petition arrearages despite completion of the foreclosure auction of the Property prior to the filing of his bankruptcy petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This court declined to adopt the Debtor's interpretation of\n   <em>\n    Kameni\n   </em>\n   and granted MidFirst's request to terminate the automatic stay, thereby permitting MidFirst to seek ratification of the sale of the Property. The Debtor filed a timely appeal from that order. His request for a stay pending\n   appeal from this court was denied.\n   <em>\n    In re Schweiger\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12269207\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/578/734/#p737\">\n    578 B.R. 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 737 (Bankr.

The Debtor did not argue at the hearing that the foreclosure was not conducted according to Maryland law or that he has any basis to take exception to ratification of the sale. The Chapter 13 trustee argued that in light of the district court's recent ruling on the Debtor's appeal,\n   <em>\n    Kameni\n   </em>\n   was not applicable and the Debtor's proposed cure and reinstatement of the MidFirst mortgage was not permitted under \u00a7 1322(c)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code for the reasons stated in\n   <em>\n    May\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Denny\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    De Souza\n   </em>\n   . The Debtor argued that (i) the Chapter 13 trustee lacked standing to object to confirmation of the Chapter 13 Plan because MidFirst had not objected to the plan, and (ii) this court's ruling on MidFirst's motion for relief from the automatic stay was not dispositive and the Debtor should be permitted\n   to cure arrearages and reinstate the mortgage on the Property under\n   <em>\n    Kameni\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusions of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   For the reasons that follow, this court declines to adopt either of the arguments advanced by the Debtor as a basis for confirmation of the Chapter 13 Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Standing of the Chapter 13 Trustee.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The language of the Bankruptcy Code makes clear that a Chapter 13 trustee has standing to object to confirmation of a Chapter 13 plan. Section 1302 provides in pertinent part as follows: \"The [Chapter 13] trustee shall ... appear and be heard at any hearing that concerns ... confirmation of a plan.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201302\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1302\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(B).

D. Md. 2008). As another court in the Fourth Circuit has observed, this statutory language \"expressly grants [the Chapter 13 trustee] standing to appear and be heard at any hearing regarding the confirmation of [the] Debtor's Plan. ... Therefore, [the Chapter 13 trustee] may oppose confirmation on any grounds allowed by Title 11, regardless of whether [the Chapter 13 trustee] is adversely affected by particular provisions of the Plan.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Ballard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%207340479\">\n    2007 WL 7340479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *2 (Bankr.

D. Colo. 1981) (\"[T]he clear language requiring the trustee to be 'heard' concerning confirmation leads to the inescapable conclusion that the trustee is a 'party in interest' with standing to object to confirmation.\") ). In any event, regardless of whether the Chapter 13 trustee has standing, the court may raise an objection to the plan\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   as the ultimate arbiter regarding whether the plan is confirmable. See\n   <em>\n    In re Fox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11504826\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/249/140/#p144\">\n    249 B.R. 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 144 (Bankr. D.S.C. 2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Debtor argued at the hearing that the standing of the Chapter 13 trustee was negated by the combined effect of an absence of objection by MidFirst and the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    United Student Aid Funds v. Espinosa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581753,12447239\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/260/\">\n    559 U.S. 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799137\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/130/1367/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581753,12447239\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/260/\">\n    176 L.Ed.2d 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010). The court disagrees.\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   simply has no application here. In\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that a creditor that did not appeal confirmation of a Chapter 13 plan was bound by the terms of that plan even though it provided for the discharge of student loan debt without the commencement of a separate adversary proceeding as otherwise required under Bankruptcy Rule 7001(6).\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581753,12447239\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/260/\">\n    559 U.S. at 276\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799137\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/130/1367/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That ruling does not apply here because this court is presented with an objection prior to (not after) confirmation of the Chapter 13 Plan.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   More importantly, in\n   <em>\n    Espinosa\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court emphasized that bankruptcy courts are to confirm Chapter 13 plans (regardless of whether there is an objection)\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     only if\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   the plan meets the statutory requirements for confirmation. As the Supreme Court said, \"\u00a7 1325(a) instructs a bankruptcy court to confirm a plan only if the court finds,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the plan complies with the 'applicable provisions' of the [Bankruptcy] Code.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3581753,12447239\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/260/\">\n    559 U.S. at 277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799137\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/130/1367/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Thus, ... the [Bankruptcy] Code makes plain that bankruptcy courts have the authority-indeed, the obligation-to direct a debtor to conform his plan to the requirements of [the applicable provisions].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3799137\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sct/130/1367/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As explained below, the Debtor's Chapter 13 Plan does not comply with \u00a7 1322(c)(1), which limits the rights of a debtor to cure defaults under \u00a7 1322(b)(2) and \u00a7 1322(b)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

There is no reason for this court to deviate now from this well-established rule of law merely because the issue is raised anew in the context of confirmation of the Chapter 13 Plan. Thus, this court must deny confirmation of the Chapter 13 Plan, which provides for a cure of mortgage arrearages pursuant to \u00a7 1322(b)(5) when such cure is precluded by \u00a7 1322(c)(1) and Maryland law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Moreover, the court declines to re-evaluate whether a debtor can cure mortgage arrears on a property that was foreclosed upon pre-petition because it has been established as law of this case.

Bennette\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5869845\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/517/717/#p727\">\n    517 F.3d 717\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 727 (4th Cir. 2008) ). The Fourth Circuit has laid out three exceptions where a court may decline to follow the mandate rule: \"(1) a subsequent trial produces substantially different evidence, (2) controlling authority has since made a contrary decision of law applicable to the issue, or (3) the\n   prior decision was clearly erroneous and would work manifest injustice.\"\n   <em>\n    TFWS, Inc. v. Franchot\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3671415\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/572/186/#p191\">\n    572 F.3d 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 191 (4th Cir. 2009) (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Aramony\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1397347\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/166/655/#p661\">\n    166 F.3d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 661 (4th Cir. 1999) ). No such exceptions apply here. Thus, the mandate rule requires this court to apply the rule of law established for this case on appeal in\n   <em>\n    Schweiger II.\n   </em>\n   That rule of law is the one stated in\n   <em>\n    May\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Denny\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    De Souza\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Lastly, this court does not mean to suggest that there are not instances when a debtor might be able to cure mortgage defaults despite completion of the foreclosure auction prior to bankruptcy-such instances would arise (if at all) only when the sale is ultimately not ratified and is declared void by the state court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the instant case, the Debtor has never argued that the foreclosure was not conducted in accordance with Maryland law or that there is a basis on which the Circuit Court could set aside the sale. Instead, the Debtor insists here that his right to cure arises solely as a matter of law under\n   <em>\n    Kameni\n   </em>\n   and the Bankruptcy Code. That being the case, this court must deny confirmation of the Debtor's Chapter 13 Plan because (as explained above) the right asserted by the Debtor does not exist.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Debtor's Chapter 13 Plan proposes to cure mortgage arrears on his residence but such cure is not permitted under \u00a7 1322(c)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code because the Debtor's equity of redemption was foreclosed by completion of an auction sale before his bankruptcy petition was filed. The Chapter 13 Plan is therefore not confirmable under \u00a7 1325(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code. Accordingly, the court will sustain the Chapter 13 trustee's objection and deny confirmation of the Debtor's Chapter 13 Plan. The court will enter a separate order consistent with the terms of this memorandum opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Under Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, April 25, 2018 was the last day to timely file a notice of appeal to the Fourth Circuit with respect to the district court's order entered on March 26, 2018.
