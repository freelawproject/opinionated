Ludkowski (the \"\n   <em>\n    Debtor\n   </em>\n   \"), the debtor in the above-captioned bankruptcy case (the \"\n   <em>\n    Case\n   </em>\n   \").

No other or further damages are appropriate. As a result, the Motion will, therefore, be granted in part, denied in part and continued in part for a later hearing on additional actual damages consistent with this Memorandum Decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   JURISDICTION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The federal district courts have \"original and exclusive jurisdiction\" of all cases under title 11 of the United States Code,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   (the \"\n   <em>\n    Bankruptcy Code\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

On March 18, 2016 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Petition Date\n   </em>\n   \"), the Debtor commenced the Case. The Debtor was represented by Morgan in the filing of the Case, as well as a number of contested matters within the Case. On December 27, 2016, however, Morgan moved to withdraw from her representation of the Debtor, citing a breakdown of communication.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion to Withdraw as Attorney [Dkt. No. 42]. On January 10, 2017, that motion was granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On May 11, 2017, the Debtor, with the assistance of the counsel now representing him, moved to convert this Case from one under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code to one under chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Debtor George Ludkowski's Motion to Convert to Chapter 13 [Dkt. No. 47] (the \"\n   <em>\n    Motion to Convert\n   </em>\n   \"). The Motion to Convert drew an objection from the chapter 7 trustee and a creditor, and thus was not immediately resolved. The Motion to Convert was granted on November 15, 2017 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Conversion Date\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order to Convert to Chapter 13 [Dkt. No. 70].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On or about July 25, 2017, before the Motion to Convert was granted, Morgan filed a collection lawsuit against the Debtor in the Circuit Court of Cook County, Third Municipal Division (the \"\n   <em>\n    State Court\n   </em>\n   \") in Rolling Meadows, IL, Case No. 2017 M3 4535 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Collection Suit\n   </em>\n   \"), seeking $4,306.25 in allegedly unpaid legal fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supplemental Brief, Exh. A-1-A. The Collection Suit is clearly limited to services provided to the Debtor after the Petition Date. It is based on a postpetition retainer agreement for representation of the Debtor with respect to a motion for turnover in the Case and adversary proceedings, and the dated invoices attached thereto are clearly for postpetition services.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4188308\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/458/444/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Nothing in the Collection Suit gives any indication that the Collection Suit was anything other than an action\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   . Other than that, what transpired in the\n   Collection Suit is not entirely clear.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   What is clear is that on February 23, 2018, the State Court entered an order requiring Morgan to either submit to it authorization from this court allowing the Collection Suit to proceed or face involuntary dismissal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supplemental Brief, Exh. B-2 (the \"\n   <em>\n    State Court Order\n   </em>\n   \"). In response, on or about March 27, 2018, Morgan filed a motion to reconsider the State Court Order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supplemental Brief, Exh. B-3 (the \"\n   <em>\n    Motion to Reconsider\n   </em>\n   \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In between the entry of the State Court Order and the filing of the Motion to Reconsider, the Debtor brought the Motion here. The Motion is fully briefed and has been argued at the Hearings and is therefore ripe for determination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At issue in this matter are several questions that are independently straightforward. It is in their interaction in the Case at bar that causes concern. While brought under the guise of a motion for rule to show cause, the matter before the court is, at its essence, an action for stay violation damages under section 362(k).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Section 362(k) states that \"an individual injured by any willful violation of a stay provided by this section shall recover actual damages, including costs and attorneys' fees, and, in appropriate circumstances, may recover punitive damages.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (k)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In order for damages to be compensable, first and foremost, there must be a violation of the stay. If there was, the court must determine whether the violation was willful and whether the Debtor is entitled damages therefrom. Finally, if there is a willful violation of the stay for which the Debtor is entitled to collect damages, the court must determine what damages are appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Did a Stay Violation Occur?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The first question is quite simple: Is it a violation of the automatic stay for a chapter 7 debtor's attorney to sue that debtor in state court, during the pendency of the bankruptcy case, for unpaid postpetition fees?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In and of itself, the answer to that question is: No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Section 362(a) of the Bankruptcy Code sets forth the automatic stay's prohibitions, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [A] petition filed under section 301, 302, or 303 of this title ... operates as a stay, applicable to all entities, of-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (1) the commencement or continuation ... of a judicial ... action or proceeding against the debtor\n   <em>\n    that was or could have been commenced before the commencement of the case under this title\n   </em>\n   , or to recover a claim against the debtor\n   <em>\n    that arose before the commencement of the case\n   </em>\n   under this title;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (2) the enforcement, against the debtor or against property of the estate, of a judgment\n   <em>\n    obtained before the commencement of the case under this title\n   </em>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (3) any act to obtain possession of property of the estate or of property from the estate or to exercise control over property of the estate;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (4) any act to create, perfect, or enforce any lien against property of the estate;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (5) any act to create, perfect, or enforce against property of the debtor any lien to the extent that such lien secures\n   <em>\n    a claim that arose before the commencement of the case under this title\n   </em>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (6) any act to collect, assess, or recover\n   <em>\n    a claim against the debtor that arose before the commencement of the case under this title\n   </em>\n   ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (7) the setoff of any debt owing to the debtor\n   <em>\n    that arose before the commencement of the case under this title\n   </em>\n   against any claim against the debtor; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (8) the commencement or continuation of a proceeding before the United States Tax Court concerning ... the tax liability of a debtor who is an individual\n   <em>\n    for a taxable period ending before the date of the order for relief under this title\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20362\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)-(8) (emphasis added).

As in the case here, when postpetition services that are not prepaid are required, separate engagements are entered into postpetition. Those agreements are postpetition obligations of the debtors and may be enforced in the same way as other postpetition obligations, provided of course that no attempt to pursue assets protected by the automatic stay is made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Each of the foregoing is based on the presumption that the counsel is not representing the bankruptcy estate but the debtor personally. It is further predicated on the presumption that the collection activity does not violate other aspects of the bankruptcy canon, for example interfering with the administration of the bankruptcy estate or seeking recovery from assets of the bankruptcy estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   That gives rise to the last question, one which is implied in the Debtor's argument but never expressly stated: Does the conversion of the Case from one under chapter\n   7 to one under chapter 13 change the foregoing conclusions?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Here the answer is finally: Yes, but with some qualifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   There are two central changes relevant to this inquiry that take place when a case under chapter 7 is converted to a case under chapter 13. First, the scope of the automatic stay is broadened as what constitutes property of the estate; thus the protections afforded to property of the estate are concomitantly greater after the conversion. Second, the conversion date is an effective date for many protections afforded the debtor. Thus the Debtor here may believe that the conversion date may play a role in defeating the foregoing analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As to the first change, recall that earlier the court noted that the division between property of debtors and property of bankruptcy estates is normally made \"as of the commencement of the case.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20541\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Such is the case in chapter 7. If, however, a debtor converts his case under chapter 7 to one under chapter 13, this calculus changes. In chapter 13 cases, section 1306 states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (a) Property of the estate includes, in addition to the property specified in section 541 of this title-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (1) all property of the kind specified in such section that the debtor acquires\n   <em>\n    after the commencement of the case\n   </em>\n   but before the case is closed, dismissed, or converted to a case under chapter 7, 11, or 12 of this title, whichever occurs first; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   (2) earnings from services performed by the debtor after the commencement of the case but before the case is closed, dismissed, or converted to a case under chapter 7, 11, or 12 of this title, whichever occurs first.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201306\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Thus property of the estate in a chapter 13 case is no longer as constrained by the commencement of the case. Postpetition property, including income, is property of the estate.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201306\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Black v.

Merely bringing an\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   lawsuit does not offend the\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   protections of the automatic stay, even if the potential pool of assets for which a judgment can be satisfied is slight. True, once judgment has entered, the successful party might avail itself of\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   remedies such as a citation to discover assets,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 735 ILCS 5/2-1402 (2018), but that is not automatic. The automatic stay question will arise when and if it is pursued and will be informed by whether the assets pursued are protected by the stay. Until then or until some other offending act occurs, a debtor defending a postpetition\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   action does not bootstrap into the\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   protections of the automatic stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   So while the assets that the Collection Suit might validly pursue after judgment are diminished by the conversion of the Case, it is not this change that causes the continuation of the Collection Suit to be in violation of the stay. It is the answer to the second question that does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   As to the second change, the conversion date affects provisions of the Bankruptcy Code that are otherwise measured from the date of commencement of the case. In that regard, section 348 addresses when the conversion date is used instead of the date of the filing of the petition, the commencement of the case, or the order for relief, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   (a) Conversion of a case from a case under one chapter of this title to a case under another chapter of this title constitutes an order for relief under the chapter to which the case is converted, but, except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section, does not effect a change in the date of the filing of the petition, the commencement of the case, or the order for relief.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   (b) Unless the court for cause orders otherwise, in sections 701(a), 727(a)(10), 727(b), 1102(a), 1110(a)(1), 1121(b), 1121(c), 1141(d)(4), 1201(a), 1221, 1228(a), 1301(a), and 1305(a) of this title, \"the order for relief under this chapter\" in a chapter to which a case has been converted under section 706, 1112, 1208, or 1307 of this title means the conversion of such case to such chapter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (d) A claim against the estate or the debtor that arises after the order for relief but before conversion in a case that is converted under section 1112, 1208, or 1307 of this title, other than a claim specified in section 503(b) of this title, shall be treated for all purposes as if such claim had arisen immediately before the date of the filing of the petition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20348\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), (b), (d). Section 348 does not, however, address directly sections 362, 541 or 1306 -the automatic stay and the sections defining property of the estate for these purposes.

Given the application of section 348(d), however, such is not the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Section 348(d) does something particularly germane to the issue at bar therefore: It changes the postpetition nature of Morgan's claim to one that is prepetition.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Friedlander v.

Further, a portion of the fees and costs incurred after the Conversion Date were self-initiated and not in response to any action by Morgan, when Debtor sought to have the Collection Suit stayed or dismissed. These total $985.00 and $238.44 in costs (the \"\n   <em>\n    Postconversion Proactive Damages\n   </em>\n   \"). Last, the remainder of the fees and costs appear to have been incurred in light of opposition from Morgan to the Debtor's attempts to have the Conversion Suit stayed or dismissed, in the amount of $325.00 in fees and $65.38 in costs (the \"\n   <em>\n    Postconversion Reactive Damages\n   </em>\n   \").\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Debtor also makes clear that additional damages may arise in having to defend against the Motion to Reconsider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The Bankruptcy Code does not define what constitutes actual damages for the purposes mandatory recovery under section 362(k)(1).

On the other hand, the Postconversion Reactive Damages all appear to result from Morgan's failure to either stay the Collection Suit on her own request or accede to the Collection Suit being stayed or dismissed at the request of the Debtor. The proximate cause for such damages appears to be Morgan's violation of the automatic stay extant in the converted Case. As a result, such damages are actual damages and mandatory under section 362(k). So too would be any additional costs incurred by the Debtor in defending against the Motion to Reconsider.

Dismissal of a pending suit might prejudice the creditor.

Some of the steps during this period seemed unrelated to the issue of the stay, namely the Debtor's attempts to vacate a default that had occurred when the Collection Suit had not been stayed. The remainder, however, appear to be proximately caused by Morgan's failure to affirmatively request that the State Court stay the Collection Suit.

The latter, in turn, is excused in part by the State Court's insistence on dismissing the Collection Suit, rather than staying it. Prudence should have told Morgan to seek guidance from the bankruptcy court, but she did not. The resulting actions were imprudent, but not outrageous.
