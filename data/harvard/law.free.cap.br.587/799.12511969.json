The determination of the issue hinges entirely on the date Mr. Boudreau filed his tax returns for the Tax Years. While that date is disputed, the parties concur that under the unique circumstances presented, its resolution raises a purely legal issue: what is the evidentiary proof necessary to establish that filing date? Accordingly, the IRS and Mr. Boudreau agree this matter is ripe for adjudication by summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In support of their respective motions, Mr. Boudreau relies on an expansive application of the so-called prison mailbox rule, and the IRS relies on Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 7502. Alternatively, the IRS maintains that the prison mailbox rule is inapplicable to determine tax return filing dates, or at the very least, that case law requires a more circumscribed application of the rule. After careful consideration of the parties' arguments, the relevant statutes and regulations, and case law, the Court finds the IRS's motion meritorious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Boudreau filed a voluntary petition under chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on January 26, 2015, and received a discharge of his debts on April 21, 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The motions for summary judgment relate to Mr. Boudreau's surviving claims against the IRS as asserted in his second amended complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Amended Complaint (\"Complaint,\" Doc. # 98).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Relevant to these remaining claims, the Complaint alleges that \"no pre-petition assessment for unpaid taxes was assessed by the IRS for tax years 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011,\" and that Mr. Boudreau \"was incarcerated during 2012-2013, during which time [he] requested data from the IRS and filed his tax returns.\" Complaint at 2-3. The relief he seeks is: (i) \"a full or partial discharge\" of his federal income taxes for the Tax Years; (ii) a determination of when he filed his 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011 income tax returns; and (iii) a determination of \"whether any assessment for those tax years is time-barred.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Complaint at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The IRS counters that it has no record of the filing of tax returns for the Tax Years prior to January 2017, when it received returns from Mr. Boudreau, triggering the IRS's post-bankruptcy assessment of taxes due for the Tax Years. Mr. Boudreau maintains that the returns the IRS acknowledges receiving in early 2017 were actually duplicates of the returns he had previously filed that he re-created from records obtained from the IRS during this adversary proceeding. He asserts that he mailed them to the IRS only intending them to be \"copies\" of the returns allegedly filed in 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mr. Boudreau alleges that sometime in April 2012 he placed the returns for the Tax Years in a mailbox used by inmates at the Rhode Island Adult Correctional Institutions (\"ACI\"), where he was incarcerated, for mailing by prison officials through the United States postal system. He acknowledges that he did not send the returns by registered mail or certified mail, instead electing to use first class mail. He\n   also did not request that prison officials create a prisoner mail log for him as a record of the mailing of the returns. At the hearing he stated that he did not use registered mail or request a prisoner mail log to be created because he did not give it much thought and did not consider it might be necessary. Mr. Boudreau has no copies of the returns allegedly mailed in 2012 and no copy of the postmarked envelope in which he states he placed them. He explained that subsequent to his release from the ACI he was evicted from his rented apartment and the landlord disposed of all of his belongings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To rebut the IRS's summary judgment motion and in support of his own motion, Mr. Boudreau relies on his declaration attesting to the placement of the tax returns in the ACI mailbox in 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Jason Boudreau (\"Declaration,\" Doc. # 267, Exh. 1). All of this boils down then to one dispositive question: is Mr. Boudreau's Declaration legally sufficient to defeat the IRS's motion and to entitle him to a judgment declaring he has no tax debts for the Tax Years?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Mr. Boudreau concedes that if he cannot establish that he filed the returns in 2012, the IRS is correct and his tax liabilities are nondischargeable. On the other hand, if the Court determines the returns were filed in 2012, then Mr. Boudreau and the IRS agree that he would have no tax liability for those years because the IRS did not assess the taxes against him within three years of the filing of the returns.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%206501\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Positions of the Parties\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The IRS argues that: (a) it has produced documentary evidence sufficient to establish that the tax returns were not filed in 2012; (b) as a matter of law, the exclusive methods for Mr. Boudreau to rebut that evidence and show that he filed the returns in 2012 are to produce direct proof of actual delivery of the returns to the IRS or of mailing of the returns by registered or certified mail; and (c) he has failed to provide any evidence of delivery of the returns by any of these methods.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Mr. Boudreau argues that: (a) the IRS's documentary evidence does not show that the tax returns were not actually received by the IRS in 2012; (b) he may establish that he filed the returns on the date alleged by use of the prison mailbox rule; and (c) his Declaration is sufficient as a matter of law to satisfy that rule. Challenging his arguments, the IRS maintains that even if the Court applies a \"mailbox rule\" to determine whether the returns were filed in 2012, Mr. Boudreau has not satisfied the evidentiary requirements of the rule. Therefore, as a matter of law the Court must find that the returns were not filed in 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    V.

In support of its motion for summary judgment and its objection to Mr. Boudreau's motion, the IRS produced several IRS Forms 4340 detailing the status of tax return filings and other transactions with Mr. Boudreau.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. # 249-2. These forms show that the IRS has no record of receiving the returns for the Tax Years in 2012, but they do show receipt of the returns on January 4, 2017. Mr. Boudreau maintains that the Forms 4340 show only that the returns were not\n   <em>\n    processed\n   </em>\n   by the IRS in 2012, not that the IRS did not\n   <em>\n    receive\n   </em>\n   them that year. To the contrary, these forms constitute the official record of the IRS and are legally sufficient evidence that the IRS did not receive the tax returns in 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wheeler v.

The Court disagrees. Generally, this rule has been applied to court filings and provides that the date of a court filing by an incarcerated individual is deemed to be the date on which the inmate gives the document to prison officials for mailing, even if never received by the court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Price v.

But even under these rules, consistent with\n   <em>\n    Houston's\n   </em>\n   goal of \"a bright-line rule,\" more is required than the prisoner's self-serving declaration of mailing. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(c)(1) mandates that if the institution where an inmate is confined has a \"system designed for legal mail\" an inmate \"must use that system to receive the benefit\" of the rule. This same requirement is imposed by Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8002(c) for bankruptcy appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Mr. Boudreau is correct that the prison mailbox rule and the rationale of\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   have been applied by courts to situations beyond the filing of notices of appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the Court rejects his position that he has satisfied this mailbox rule and proven that in 2012 he filed his federal tax returns for the Tax Years through the mere submission of the Declaration. Consistent with the rationale of\n   <em>\n    Houston\n   </em>\n   , the Court concludes that it is simply not enough for him to aver in a declaration that while incarcerated at the ACI, in April 2012 he placed the returns in one envelope and deposited them in the prison outgoing mailbox for mailing to the IRS by first class mail, postage prepaid, using postage stamps purchased at the ACI's commissary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Declaration. The wholesale abandonment of the requirement of corroborating evidence to prove the filing of tax returns would severely undermine\n   <em>\n    Houston's\n   </em>\n   rationale and the goal of a straightforward \"bright-line rule.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The cases cited by Mr. Boudreau are distinguishable from the present circumstances as they dealt with court filings or other administrative appeals.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Edwards v.

He does not cite a case in which the prison mailbox rule has been applied to the filing of tax returns for which the taxing authority has no record of receipt. Instead, the Court finds more persuasive the Tenth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Crook v. C.I.R.\n   </em>\n   , 173 F. Appx. 653 (10th Cir. 2006), cited by the IRS. In reviewing the timeliness of the inmate-taxpayer's request for redetermination of the IRS's tax deficiency, the court concluded that even if the less stringent standard of the prison mailbox rule were applied instead of IRC \u00a7 7502, more was required to satisfy the rule for proof of filing of federal tax matters than the mere declaration of the inmate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 657. Noting that no evidence of a postmark date, use of registered mail, or a prison mail log had been proffered, the court emphasized that the taxpayer still bore the burden of proving compliance with the rule. \"Self-serving declarations of mailing, without more, are insufficient to invoke the presumption [of delivery].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sorrentino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9213405\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/383/1187/#p1194\">\n    383 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1191 ).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hatch v.

For a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   prisoner, requiring corroborating evidence such as registered mail or a prison log of the mailing is not overly burdensome. Here, Mr. Boudreau does not assert that any of these methods to corroborate the mailing of the returns in 2012 were unavailable to him; he simply did not use any of these mailing methods because he did not think they would be necessary. Under the facts of this case, there is little justification for not requiring corroborating evidence and applying a less stringent standard of proof than is contemplated under IRC \u00a7 7502, the common law mailbox rule, or the prison mailbox rule in the manner advocated by Mr. Boudreau.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Huizar v.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The Court finds that the IRS has met its burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that Mr. Boudreau did not file tax returns for the Tax Years in 2012. Based on the legal standards for review of summary judgment motions, under the circumstances and evidence presented, there is no genuine dispute of material fact. A rational factfinder could resolve the issue of whether Mr. Boudreau filed the tax returns in 2012 only in favor of the IRS, and accordingly, the IRS is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Conversely, Mr. Boudreau has not satisfied his burden to rebut the IRS's evidence, and he is not entitled to summary judgment in his favor. The IRS's motion for summary judgment is GRANTED, and Mr. Boudreau's motion for summary judgment is DENIED. The Court will enter a separate judgment in accord with this decision.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Mr. Boudreau filed his complaint initiating this adversary proceeding to determine the dischargeability of student loan and state and federal income tax debts, naming as defendants the IRS and two other defendants.

At most, the requested discovery would have shown that Mr. Boudreau and the IRS communicated with each other via U.S. mail, perhaps supporting only Mr. Boudreau's allegation that he sought information necessary to prepare his tax returns.
