Having\n   considered the pleadings,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   having heard argument of counsel and having considered the applicable case law, for the reasons set forth below, I find that (1) assumption of a lease under subsection 365(p) does not require, indeed does not even contemplate, court approval;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) the reaffirmation procedures of section 524 do not apply to a lease assumption under subsection 365(p); and (3) if a debtor rejects an assumed lease, whether any personal liability arising from the rejection of the assumed lease is discharged depends on when the rejection occurs. Accordingly, Toyota's Motion is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTS\n    </strong>\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The Debtor filed the instant case on May 31, 2017 (ECF # 1). The Debtor's Schedule A/B lists a 2016 Lexus IS350, Vin No.: JTHBE1D23G5025076 (the \"Vehicle\"), and the Statement of Intention reflects that the Debtor will retain the Vehicle and enter into a Reaffirmation Agreement. The Debtor leased the Vehicle pursuant to a Motor Vehicle Lease Agreement dated December 28, 2015, between the Debtor and, presumably, Toyota or its predecessor in interest (the \"Lease\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Debtor and Toyota entered into an assumption agreement on or about July 7, 2017, pursuant to which the Debtor assumed the Lease. The assumption agreement was not approved by the Court nor was it placed on the docket at the time of assumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At some point, the Debtor determined that he could not maintain his obligations under the Lease and he turned over the Vehicle to Toyota. Sometime after November 24, 2017, the Debtor, through counsel, received a document from Toyota titled Rights of Defaulting Parties-Lease (the \"Rights Letter\"), dated November 24, 2017. The Rights Letter indicated that the unpaid lease balance on the Vehicle was $36,518.64, with repossession costs of $225.00, and transportation expenses of $179.27, for a total of $36,922.91 (the \"\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   liability claim\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 27, 2017, the Debtor filed a Notice of Rescission of Lease Assumption (ECF # 47). The Debtor has indicated that he has no objection to an Order confirming that Toyota has\n   <em>\n    in rem\n   </em>\n   stay relief with regard to the Vehicle nor does the Debtor have any objection to the waiver of the 14-day stay, as Toyota is in possession of the Vehicle. However, the Debtor argues that the Debtor has no\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   liability under the Lease because the Debtor did not reaffirm his obligations under the Lease in accordance with subsection 524(c) and thus the\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   liability claim under the Lease will be discharged when the Debtor receives his discharge. Alternatively, the Debtor argues, because he \"rescinded assumption\" prior to discharge, the\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   liability will be discharged.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Toyota argues that assumption\n   included the Debtor's personal liability under the Lease and subsequent rejection or discharge does not alter that\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ANALYSIS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Subsection 365(p) was enacted as part of BAPCPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Prior to BAPCPA, a chapter 7 debtor could not assume a lease of personal property prior to discharge. In fact, the enacting title of subsection 365(p) is \"Giving Debtors the Ability to Keep Leased Personal Property by Assumption.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Almost immediately after the passage of BAPCPA, courts faced the issue of whether, in the absence of adherence to the reaffirmation provisions of subsection 524(c), assumption of a lease pursuant to subsection 365(p) creates\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   liability under the assumed lease which\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   liability survives discharge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   There are courts that hold that, in order to avoid discharge of\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   liability for an assumed lease, the lease assumption agreement must conform to the requirements of a reaffirmation agreement under subsection 524(c).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Thompson v.

The statutes are not ambiguous and they do not contradict one another. Moreover, when reviewing the other statutes relevant to an individual debtor's obligations, it is clear that Congress considered reaffirmation and assumption to be separate procedures.

To hold otherwise would render certain provisions of subsection 365(p) absurd. To accept that\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   liability under an assumed lease requires reaffirmation under subsection 524(c) would mean that, notwithstanding subsection 365(p)(2)(C), which clearly contemplates assumption post-discharge, assumption post-discharge would not be possible, or would be limited to non-recourse assumption, because reaffirmation must occur\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to discharge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The law has always been clear that assumption of a lease is\n   <em>\n    cum onere,\n   </em>\n   meaning that an assumed lease is assumed subject to all of its provisions, including the\n   <em>\n    in personam\n   </em>\n   liabilities flowing from assumption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Mortensen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3734988\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/444/225/#p226\">\n    444 B.R. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   226 ;\n   <em>\n    In re Bobka,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%207798098\">\n    2017 WL 7798098\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Bankr.

If the lease is rejected, the stay under section 362 and any stay under section 1301 is automatically terminated with respect to the property subject to the lease.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    Prior to the passage of BAPCPA, if a debtor wanted to continue under a car lease not assumed by the chapter 7 trustee, the debtor would have to voluntarily reach out to the car lessor to see if an agreement could be reached, a scenario similar to the procedure set forth in subsection 365(p)(2). The law has always provided that a debtor may voluntarily repay any debt that has been discharged.\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20524\">\n     11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (f). There is nothing in the Bankruptcy Code or pre-BAPCPA case law that suggests a previously discharged liability under a lease cannot be repaid. Subsection 365(p) appears to provide a statutory framework that does not alter this pre-BAPCPA practice, but rather, as the subsection's enacting title announced, provides debtors the opportunity to assume a lease prior to, as well as after, discharge with a set procedure.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Subsection 365(g) states:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n    Except as provided in subsections (h)(2) and (i)(2) of this section, the rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor constitutes a breach of such contract or lease-\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n    <strong>\n     (1)\n    </strong>\n    if such contract or lease has not been assumed under this section or under a plan confirmed under chapter 9, 11, 12, or 13 of this title, immediately before the date of the filing of the petition; or\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n    <strong>\n     (2)\n    </strong>\n    if such contract or lease has been assumed under this section or under a plan confirmed under chapter 9, 11, 12, or 13 of this title-\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n    (A) if before such rejection the case has not been converted under section 1112, 1208, or 1307 of this title, at the time of such rejection; or\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n    <strong>\n     (B)\n    </strong>\n    if before such rejection the case has been converted under section 1112, 1208, or 1307 of this title-\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n    <strong>\n     (i)\n    </strong>\n    immediately before the date of such conversion, if such contract or lease was assumed before such conversion; or\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n    <strong>\n     (ii)\n    </strong>\n    at the time of such rejection, if such contract or lease was assumed after such conversion.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    Although the Debtor \"rescinded\" the Lease rather than rejected the Lease, I will treat the rescission (a concept that does not apply to assumed leases but only to reaffirmed debts) as a rejection. Surrender of the Vehicle is also, practically, a rejection of the Lease. Surrender or \"rescission\"-the Debtor has rejected the Lease.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    This result is not different than what would occur if the debtor entered into a new auto lease post-petition. If the debtor breached a post-petition auto lease, the personal liability, if any, arising from that breach would not be subject to the debtor's bankruptcy discharge.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    I am not ruling today that a lessor is precluded from seeking reaffirmation of liabilities under a car lease, but I do not believe such relief is necessary for the reasons set forth in this opinion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
