JURISDICTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This proceeding relates to the Chapter 7 bankruptcy case of Dozier Financial, Inc. (\"Debtor\") pending in this Court.

Rule 83.IX.01 (D.S.C.), the district court has referred this proceeding to the bankruptcy court. This proceeding involves claims for damages under non-bankruptcy law and is not a \"core proceeding\" within\n   the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), this Court has the authority to hear, but not to determine, a non-core proceeding unless all of the parties consent to this Court's determination under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. TRUSTEE'S ALLEGATIONS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Trustee brings this action on behalf of the estate (\"Estate Claims\") and as a result of claims assigned to the estate that were personal to certain investors/creditors of Debtor (\"Investor Claims\"). All of the claims arise from actions relating to Defendants' involvement with the restructuring of Michael Dozier's business operations and selling of securities to third party investors to raise funds. Trustee seeks to recover the losses that resulted from the sale of such securities and alleges that all Defendants played a role in causing the losses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Michael Dozier was the sole shareholder, director, and officer of Debtor and operated used car dealerships in South Carolina. In April 2009, Michael Dozier employed WebsterRogers, LLP and WebsterRogers Financial Advisors, LLC (collectively, \"WebsterRogers\") and Sequence Financial Specialists, LLC (\"Sequence\") to facilitate in the restructuring of his business and to raise capital to support the dealerships' operations. Throughout their involvement, Sequence and WebsterRogers marketed themselves and operated as a single firm providing accounting and investment advice services to Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   WebsterRogers and Sequence provided Michael Dozier with advice to create a business model that involved the formation of several business entities, including Debtor. Debtor's business primarily involved servicing financing contracts for Michael Dozier's used car dealerships. WebsterRogers and Sequence also recommended Michael Dozier begin selling securities to investors to raise funds. Sequence agreed to act as the placement agent for any private offering of any securities, as an underwriter in any public offering of securities, and as a broker in soliciting investments in Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In July 2009, Michael Dozier engaged Willcox Buyck and Williams, P.A. (\"WBW\"), a law firm located in South Carolina, to provide legal services, including advice related to the restructuring of his business and the securities transactions. WBW assisted with the formation of the various entities that formed Michael Dozier's business model, including Debtor and the car dealerships. WBW also assisted with enabling Debtor to secure capital through security offerings, including the drafting of offerings for the solicitation of investments from third parties. Sequence and WebsterRogers were also engaged to seek additional financing necessary for implementing the business model it had previously developed and to consult with WBW regarding the issuance of a private placement memorandum to raise capital. WebsterRogers also specifically agreed to determine and evaluate the tax and generally accepted accounting principles and reporting options for the businesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Despite hiring professionals, Michael Dozier used the business' accounts to improperly pay for personal obligations and excessive compensation from the inception of Debtor and the other related entities. The Defendants were aware that Michael Dozier was improperly appropriating assets of the businesses for his personal benefit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Sequence, WebsterRogers, and WBW generated the financial reports for the Debtor, which included the company ledgers for the car dealerships and Debtor, profit and loss statements, balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow statements. These Defendants knew these financial reports would be used by Debtor in acquiring capital through the sale of securities. These financial reports were deficient, false, and misleading because they, through improper accounting methods: improperly allocated assets, liabilities, and costs; significantly overestimated the accounts receivable owed to the Debtor from the related entities; and significantly underestimated the amounts payable by the Debtor. As a result, the financial statements made it appear that Debtor had a positive net worth when the business was actually operating at or near a net loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   When confronted with numerous red flags concerning the accuracy of Debtor's financial statements, Sequence and WebsterRogers did not abide by the standards of due diligence governing the conduct of brokers, underwriters, and investment advisers. Sequence and its employees also assisted Michael Dozier in his concealment of Debtor's financial condition from Debtor and the investors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The financial statements were used to market the securities to be purchased by the investors. The investors were first solicited to invest in Debtor in September 2009 through a Private Placement Memorandum (\"2009 PPM\"), which was drafted by WBW. Prior to approval of these materials and their distribution to investors, Sequence and WebsterRogers did not conduct independent investigations into the capital requirements of Michael Dozier's business. Overall, in offering and selling these investments, Defendants\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   made false and misleading disclosures and omitted material facts relating to the risks of investing in the Debtor, the Debtor's financial performance, and how the Debtor would use the investment proceeds. The 2009 PPM also made a selling point to investors that independent underwriters, brokers, accountants, and attorneys had performed due diligence and, thus, acted as gatekeepers against possible misdeeds by Debtor or Michael Dozier. However, the investors' funds were improperly used for liabilities and operating costs of the car dealerships, personal obligations of Michael Dozier, and improper distributions to him. Defendants knew the 2009 PPM included these misrepresentations and omissions regarding Debtor's business and the investment risks associated therewith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In October 2009, Michael Dozier began selling securities to the public that he believed were exempt offerings under federal and state securities laws. Sequence and WebsterRogers did not conduct independent investigations to ensure that Michael Dozier did not sell stock to unaccredited investors, which would destroy any safe harbor registration exemption for the securities issued under the 2009 PPM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In December 2009, WBW was made aware that proceeds of the 2009 offering were not being used in accordance with the escrow terms provided in the 2009 PPM and that the offering was improperly handled by Michael Dozier, which could raise securities liability. WBW had a duty to advise the Debtor and investors to address this transactional risk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In March 2010, Sequence, WebsterRogers, and WBW compiled an addendum to the 2009 PPM to be sent to prior and new, prospective investors (\"2010 Executive Summary\"). The 2010 Executive Summary attached unaudited financial reports for the Debtor that were prepared by Sequence and WebsterRogers. These financial reports included the same material misrepresentations in the prior financial reports and 2009 PPM. Despite this, WBW, Sequence, and WebsterRogers approved the 2010 Executive Summary and enclosed information to be used by Michael Dozier in future solicitations from investors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Upon the recommendation of WebsterRogers and Sequence, SGC was retained by the Debtor in late 2010 or early 2011. SGC is an accounting firm located in Houston, Texas, with extensive experience with used car dealerships and their related finance companies. Debtor and SGC entered into an Engagement Agreement dated January 3, 2011, which includes the following forum selection clause (\"FSC\"):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   This engagement letter shall be governed by the laws of the State of Texas. Any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this engagement letter shall only be brought in the State of Texas and you agree to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Texas. This contract is performable in Harris County, Texas.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   SGC was engaged to conduct an audit of Debtor's 2010 financial statements. SGC also performed administrative and consolidation work in connection with Debtor's annual financials and performed other services for the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   SGC failed to comply with auditing standards by failing to obtain reasonable assurance that the financial statements it was auditing were free of material misstatements and failing to assess the risk that Debtor's financial statements could be materially misstated as a result of fraud. SGC, in violation of professional standards, either knowingly misrepresented the financial records of the Debtor or merely accepted management's representations without attempting to corroborate or collect support for those representations. SGC also failed to obtain sufficient competent evidence regarding the amounts recorded in Debtor's financial statements and failed to adequately evaluate the competence and sufficiency of information. There were significant accounting red flags within the SGC-prepared audit report of Debtor that SGC, Sequence, and WebsterRogers should have been aware of and resulted in a severely deficient audit report, which was subsequently used in the issuance of private placement memoranda and other marketing materials to raise capital for the Debtor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In 2011, Michael Dozier began a check kiting scheme between the accounts of the Debtor and the car dealerships. These fraudulent transfers gave rise to obligations of Michael Dozier, the Debtor, and the dealerships in excess of $3,000,000.00 to the banks with negative cash balances. Michael Dozier disclosed to WBW, Sequence, and WebsterRogers that liabilities were generated at banks where he and the Debtor held accounts as a result of a series of overdrafts. WBW also learned that several of the overdrafts were directly tied to proceeds from the prior offerings. To correct this significant shortfall, Michael Dozier,\n   Sequence, WebsterRogers, and WBW prepared another private offering memorandum and updated the marketing materials for the offering (\"2011 PPM\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The 2011 PPM did not explain the intended use of the proceeds to pay off these liabilities, even though these proceeds were immediately used for liabilities of Debtor and Michael Dozier and were wrongfully diverted for personal payments to Michael Dozier. Additionally, the 2011 PPM incorporated misstatements from the previous offerings and provided financial reports for Debtor, including those subject to SGC's audit, that included incorrect information. Like the 2009 PPM, the 2011 PPM made a selling point to investors that independent underwriters, brokers, and attorneys had performed due diligence and, thus, acted as gatekeepers against possible misdeeds by the Debtor and Michael Dozier-even though the Defendants were already aware of Michael Dozier's improper conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   When the investors' first notes became due in Fall 2012, additional information was sent to them regarding the ability to extend the terms of their notes as well as soliciting new investments (\"Rollover Letters\"). The Rollover Letters informed investors that they could renew their notes or liquidate them and receive their interest and principal in full, even though Debtor lacked the ability to repay the notes. The Rollover Letters stated Debtor was continuing its growth and success, when in actuality it was insolvent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In late 2013, Debtor began missing scheduled note payments and Michael Dozier informed the investors that the delay would be temporary. WBW should have advised the investors that the missed note payments signaled a material risk that the business was failing and, therefore, in order to protect themselves from harm, the investors should verify any representations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   From October 2009 through June 2013, Debtor raised approximately $3,621,116.14 from at least 36 investors in at least two states (North and South Carolina). These funds were raised through the sale of at least 73 nonnegotiable promissory notes to both accredited and unaccredited investors; however, many of the investors were unaccredited, unsophisticated, and elderly. Much of the money raised through the improper securities offerings was appropriated by Michael Dozier to pay the fees for the services rendered by Sequence, WebsterRogers, WBW, and SGC, or for Michael Dozier's own personal obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In Spring 2014, WBW began collecting the necessary information for filing a Form D with the Securities and Exchange Commission or the Attorney General, but ultimately failed to comply with this requirement. An involuntary Chapter 7 petition was filed against Debtor in this Court on July 29, 2014, and the order for relief was entered on August 28, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CAUSES OF ACTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Trustee asserts generally that SGC, in connection with the offer and sale of securities, disseminated or approved false statements that it knew or reasonably should have known were false or misleading in that they contained misrepresentations and failed to disclose material facts necessary in order to make the statements not misleading and the investors relied on such misrepresentations and omissions. As a result, SGC also breached its contractual and common law duties owed to the Debtor and the investors. Trustee asserts similar claims against the other Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The causes of action in the Complaint are divided into two categories: personal claims to the Debtor stemming from Trustee's role as bankruptcy trustee for the\n   Debtor (the Estate Claims); and claims assigned to the estate that were personal to investors of the Debtor (the Investor Claims). Some of the causes of action appear to seek relief on behalf of both the estate and the investors. The Estate Claims against SGC are as follows: (1) breach of contract accompanied by fraudulent act; (2) common law fraud; (3) negligence; (4) breach of fiduciary duty; (5) aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty; and (6) constructive fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   With regard to the Investor Claims, the Complaint alleges that between January 2, 2017, and October 6, 2017, numerous individuals who invested in Debtor assigned to Trustee all of their right, title, and interest in and to the claims set forth in the Complaint and the Trustee is now the true and lawful owner of the claims. The Investor Claims against SGC are: (1) violation of \u00a7 10 and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, which makes it unlawful to employ deceptive or manipulative devices \"in connection with the purchase or sale of any security[,]\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j ; (2) common law fraud; (3) negligence; (4) breach of fiduciary duty; and (5) constructive fraud.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   By filing the instant Motion seeking relief from this Court and not expressly objecting to this Court making a final determination on this Motion, the parties have consented to the Court's determination of this Motion under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20157\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 157\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Nor is it clear that there are significant differences in comparative congestion between the South Carolina and Texas courts. However, examining \"the local interest in having localized interests decided at home\" factor is somewhat helpful. Although SGC argues the audit work was performed in Texas, the investments and losses in question involved a South Carolina business, investors located in South Carolina, and resulted in a South Carolina bankruptcy proceeding. These facts weigh in favor of a South Carolina forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   While the Supreme Court gave a clear directive in\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   to give effect to a valid FSC in all but the most unusual of circumstances, the Court must be mindful of the differences here and seek guidance from other authorities cited above.\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   did not involve claims arising in or related to the liquidation of an insolvent's assets in a bankruptcy case pending in a venue differing from the one provided in the FSC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, as the recitation of the allegations above indicates, Trustee asserts each named Defendant had a role in the damages and claims asserted. Pursuing some or all of the claims set forth in this proceeding in a Texas court while maintaining the remaining pieces of the puzzle here would result in substantially duplicative discovery and court proceedings, resulting only in a waste of time and resources for not only the Debtor and SGC, but also for parties and witnesses that did not agree to litigation in Texas and, ultimately, the creditors of the estate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re LMI Legacy Holdings, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322057\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/553/235/#p241\">\n    553 B.R. 235\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 241-42 (Bankr.

The purpose or result of enforcing a FSC should not be to multiply litigation and increase the costs for parties that did not agree to be bound by it. Practical considerations exist here that could make the trial easy, expeditious, or inexpensive, thus tipping the scales in favor of the South Carolina forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   While\n   <em>\n    Atlantic Marine\n   </em>\n   involved the transfer of an entire case in which all claims were brought by a single plaintiff against a single defendant and all claims and parties were covered by a valid FSC, this case is different. Although there is no dispute as to whether this FSC itself is valid, it is contained in an Engagement Agreement executed only by the Debtor and SGC. This case involves claims based on a core set of facts against SGC and five other Defendants that are not parties to the Engagement Agreement. This case also involves some Investor Claims that are likely not governed by the FSC. The Supreme Court pointed out that \"courts should not unnecessarily disrupt the parties' settled expectations.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 583. However, those expectations have been disrupted here by the intervention of this bankruptcy case and the filing of this adversary proceeding involving parties not subject to and claims not covered by this FSC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   An FSC is intended to give parties greater predictability about where they would engage in future litigation and \"may have been a critical factor in their agreement to do business together in the first place.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 583. However, that purpose is not served and is actually counterproductive in a situation such as this where the Trustee is pursuing other substantial, overlapping claims to which the\n   FSC does not apply, and where duplicative discovery will clearly result for those that did not agree to the FSC. Reflecting on the practical considerations that could make the trial easy, expeditious, or inexpensive, the local interest in deciding local controversies at home, the pending gathering and distribution of assets in this forum, the interests of the other Defendants, and judicial economy, the Court finds the public interests are best served by retention of the Estate and Investor Claims against SGC together in this forum, and those interests present unusual circumstances that outweigh the deference due to the FSC.
