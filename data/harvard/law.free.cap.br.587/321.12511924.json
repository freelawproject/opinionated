First, on July 18, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered a Memorandum Opinion and Order sustaining the Chapter 13 Trustee's objections to confirmation of Appellants' proposed Chapter 13 plan, and instructing Appellants to submit an amended Chapter 13 plan within 14 days. Docket no. 9 at 14. Second, on August 1, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an Order Denying Confirmation of the Plan. Docket no. 9 at 15. Finally, on August 4, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an Order dismissing the Chapter 13 case after Appellants did not file an amended Chapter 13 plan proposal. Docket no. 9 at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Appellants filed their notice of appeal as to all three orders on August 18, 2017. Docket no. 9 at 15. Appellee filed a Motion to Dismiss Appeal (docket no. 2), which argues that this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the Bankruptcy Court's July 18 and August 1 orders since Appellants did not notice their appeal within 14 days of the entry of those orders. Docket no. 2 at 3 (citing Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8002(a)(1) ). The Court finds that the motion to dismiss should be DENIED and that the Bankruptcy Court's Orders should be AFFIRMED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Appellants, a husband and wife, filed a joint Voluntary Petition for relief under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code on April 4, 2017. On the same date, they filed a list of their assets, which included an asset described as \"Total Safety worker's compensation filed in 2014 - pending[.]\" The value of this entry was listed as \"Unknown.\" Docket no. 9 at 10. Their Schedule C also listed the lawsuit with a value of \"Unknown,\" and Appellants entered \"$0.00\" as the amount of the exemption they were claiming under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(5). Docket no. 9 at 10-11. Appellee, the Chapter 13 Trustee, objected to confirmation of Appellant's plan on May 30, 2017. Docket no. 10 at 9. On June 19, 2017, Appellants filed an Amended A/B Schedule and an Amended Schedule C, reflecting that the worker's compensation lawsuit had settled for $22,500, yielding a recovery of $8,632.85 (the settlement funds) after the payment of litigation costs. Docket no. 11 at 11-12. Appellants filed an Amended Chapter 13 Plan on June 19, 2017, which did not provide for payment of\n   the settlement funds into the Plan, and subsequently filed a motion seeking the Bankruptcy Court's approval of the settlement and the distribution of the settlement funds to the debtor as exempt and not property of the bankruptcy estate. Docket no. 9 at 14. On July 18, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court issued a Memorandum Opinion and Order which granted Appellee's objection to confirmation of Appellants' plan, finding that the settlement funds were \"disposable income\" within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) and therefore were required to be applied to make payments to Appellants' unsecured creditors under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(B). Docket nos. 9 at 14; 10 at 11. That determination forms the basis for the parties' arguments on appeal. The Bankruptcy Court granted Appellants fourteen days to propose a new plan, and denied confirmation of the plan and dismissed the case when Appellants did not do so.

Appeals pursuant to this section are subject to the time limits established by Rule 8002 of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, which, pertinent to this case, require that \"a notice of appeal must be filed with the bankruptcy clerk within 14 days after entry of the judgment, order, or decree being appealed.\" Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8002(a)(1). The parties do not dispute that Appellants' appeal was noticed within 14 days of the August 4 Order Dismissing Case, but Appellee argues that, because Appellants' notice of appeal was filed more than 14 days after the Bankruptcy Court's July 18 Memorandum Opinion and Order and August 1 Order Denying Confirmation of the Plan, the appeal is untimely under Rule 8002(a)(1). Docket no. 2 at \u00b6\u00b6 12-13. The parties appear to be in agreement that the orders of July 18 and August 1 were interlocutory rather than final, and Appellee further argues that, since Appellants did not notice their appeal within 14 days of the interlocutory orders which they seek to have reviewed, and did not seek leave of the Bankruptcy Court to appeal these interlocutory orders under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) and Fed. R. Bankr. P. 8004(a), this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider their appeals.

The Supreme Court has noted that the policy against piecemeal appeals that\n   applies in most federal cases, which allows appeals of right only from final decisions, applies differently in bankruptcy proceedings, in which the rules authorize appeals of right not only from final judgments, but also from orders and decrees \"if they finally dispose of discrete disputes within the larger case.\"\n   <em>\n    Bullard v.

However, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Bullard\n   </em>\n   also made clear-as the parties in this case do not appear to dispute-that an order denying confirmation of a Chapter 13 plan is interlocutory, not a final appealable order or decree within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20158\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1).\n   <em>\n    Bullard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4114067\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/1686/#p1692\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 1692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

R. Bankr. P. 4003(b). Docket nos. 9 at 21-22, 24; 10 at 15-16.

However, those objections went not to the applicability of the Section 522 exemption to the settlement funds, but to whether \"the Debtors' Plan meets the Best Interests of Creditors Test set forth in Bankruptcy Code Section 1325(a)(4)\" for reasons not apparently related to the treatment of the settlement funds. Docket no. 4-2 at 86. During the confirmation hearing, Appellee took the position that the exemption of the settlement funds claimed in Appellant's Schedule C was \"all well and good\" and \"resolve[d] the best interest of creditors test\" but \"doesn't resolve ... the best efforts test\"-arguments that the bankruptcy court construed as supplements to her written objections timely raised at the hearing, which took place three days after Appellants' submitted their amended plan. Docket nos. 4-2 at 154-55 &amp; n.4; 4-3 at 7. The Bankruptcy Court, in its Memorandum Opinion and Order, noted that \"no objection has been filed to the claim of exemption and none is expected.\" Docket no. 4-2 at 155.

BAP 2012) (collecting cases). Indeed, some courts have reasoned that, with BAPCPA's amendment to Section 1325's definition of disposable income, \"the split of authority over whether or not exempt assets are to be included in the calculation of disposable income has been statutorily answered by Congress\"; that \"since current monthly income does not exclude exempt assets and it is the starting point for calculating disposable income, disposable income includes exempt assets.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Brah\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176433\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/562/922/#p924\">\n    562 B.R. 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 924 (Bankr.

D. Mass. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   This reading of Section 1325(b) does not conflict with Section 522(c)'s directive that exempt property \"is not liable\" for any prepetition debt for the reasons stated in\n   <em>\n    In re Koch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"869172,833982\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/1285/\">\n    109 F.3d 1285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1289 (8th Cir. 1997). As that court explained, Chapter 13 relief is at the option of the debtor, and the limit placed on disposable income in Section 1325(b) does not render property that is exempt under Section 522(c) liable for prepetition debts, but rather \"defines the terms upon which Congress has made the benefits of Chapter 13 available.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Koch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"869172,833982\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/1285/\">\n    109 F.3d at 1289\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court therefore finds that the Bankruptcy Court did not err in concluding that the exempt status of the settlement funds pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20522\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   did not exclude those funds from the calculation of disposable income under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201325\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Appellants next argue that, even aside from its Section 522 arguments, the settlement funds are not \"income\" under the post-BAPCPA Bankruptcy Code, and therefore are not required by Section 1325(b) to be applied to payments to unsecured creditors. BAPCPA added to the determination of \"amounts reasonably necessary to be expended\" a means test that is applied by comparing the debtors' \"current monthly income\" as defined at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10A) to their state's \"median family income,\" a term defined at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (39A). Appellants argue that, because the statutory definition of \"median family income\" incorporates calculations reported by the Bureau of the Census,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (39A), Congress must have intended income to be defined for purposes of Section 1325 subject to the same exclusions used by the Census Bureau in when it calculates median family income. Docket no. 9 at 30-38. Appellants further argue that adopting the Census Bureau's source-of-income approach is preferable because it avoids the anomalous result that pre-petition assets-the value of which Section 1324(a)(4) would not require the debtor to apply to unsecured claims-would, if sold, be considered income under\n   Section 1325(b) which the debtor would be required to apply to unsecured claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court is not persuaded by these arguments. BAPCPA's statutory definition of \"current monthly income\" makes no mention of the categories excluded from income by the Census Bureau, but includes the average monthly income \"from all sources that the debtor receives ... without regard to whether such income is taxable income[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (10A).

In the case of the BAPCPA definition of current monthly income, the statutory language is plain: \"Quite simply, the term 'all'\n   <em>\n    means\n   </em>\n   'all.' \";\n   <em>\n    In re Sjogren\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268822\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/570/1/#p3\">\n    570 B.R. at 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (collecting cases).
