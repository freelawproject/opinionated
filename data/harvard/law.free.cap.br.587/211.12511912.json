Katz, United States Bankruptcy Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before the Court is the \"Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment\" (the \"Summary Judgment Motion\") filed by CIT Bank, N.A. (\"CIT\"), the defendant in this adversary proceeding and a party in interest in the underlying Chapter 13 bankruptcy case filed by Stephen A. D'Alessio (the \"Debtor\"). In his complaint, the Debtor seeks,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , a declaratory judgment that CIT is not entitled to foreclose a reverse mortgage on real property owned by the Debtor's spouse at the time of the execution of the reverse mortgage, but currently owned by the Debtor. In order to resolve the Summary Judgment Motion, the Court must determine whether the Debtor is a \"Borrower\" with respect to the reverse mortgage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    FACTS AND POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 1988, the Debtor and his spouse (\"Patricia\") acquired title to property located at 164 East Street, Mount Washington, Massachusetts (the \"Property\") as joint tenants. In 1990, they conveyed title to Patricia only. 20 years later, the Property was mortgaged to secure a home equity conversion mortgage loan (a \"reverse mortgage\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   from CIT's predecessor, Financial Freedom Acquisition, LLC (\"Financial Freedom\"). In connection with the transaction, Patricia and the Debtor signed several documents. Most of the loan documents were signed solely by Patricia; however, both Patricia and the Debtor signed the actual mortgage (the \"Mortgage\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following Patricia's death in September 2015, CIT mailed to the Debtor a \"Home Equity Conversion Mortgage Repayment Notice\" informing him that, in light of Patricia's death, the loan was due and payable in full and, absent payment, the lender would initiate foreclosure proceedings. The loan was not repaid. On June 20, 2017, prior to any foreclosure sale of the Property, the Debtor filed a voluntary petition under Chapter 13 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the \"Bankruptcy\n   Code\" or the \"Code\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On his schedules filed with the bankruptcy petition, the Debtor disclosed an ownership interest in the Property (which he had inherited upon Patricia's death). The Debtor also filed a Chapter 13 plan (the \"Plan\"), through which he proposed to cure prepetition real estate tax arrears on the Property. In the main bankruptcy case, CIT objected to confirmation of the Debtor's Plan (the \"Plan Objection\") and moved for relief from the automatic stay imposed by \u00a7 362 of the Bankruptcy Code (the \"Motion for Relief from Stay\"). In the Plan Objection, CIT complains that the Plan does not provide for adequate treatment of its claim (i.e., a payoff of the entire outstanding loan amount). In the Motion for Relief from Stay, CIT maintains that it is entitled to proceed with its nonbankruptcy rights to collect the full, accelerated amount of its reverse mortgage loan (and to proceed with a foreclosure of the Property, if necessary).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Debtor opposed both of CIT's pleadings and also commenced this adversary proceeding raising three related claims for relief. In Count I, the Debtor seeks a declaratory judgment declaring him a \"Borrower\" under the Mortgage, which would negate CIT's claimed right to collect the entire mortgage loan balance through foreclosure at this time. In Count II, the Debtor alleges a breach of contract. Lastly, in Count III, the Debtor alleges a violation of the Massachusetts consumer protection law (\"Chapter 93A\") on grounds that CIT has attempted to foreclose the Property without a right to do so. Each of the pending controversies-the adversary complaint, the Plan Objection, and the Motion for Relief from Stay-require the resolution of one issue: with respect to the reverse mortgage transaction, is the Debtor a \"Borrower\"?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Under the Debtor's reasoning, the Mortgage, as a contract of adhesion, must be strictly construed against CIT. The Debtor argues that his signature on the Mortgage, followed by the designation \"Borrower,\" creates an ambiguity that must be construed in his favor-i.e., that he is indeed a \"Borrower\" with respect to the Mortgage. And because he is a surviving \"Borrower\" who currently resides in the Property, the Debtor contends, CIT has no right to foreclose under the loan documents. In further support of this argument, the Debtor relies on federal law that appears to prohibit the Department of Housing and Urban Development (\"HUD\") from insuring reverse mortgage loans that would allow foreclosure while a \"homeowner\" continues to occupy the property following the death of a borrowing spouse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   CIT maintains that any ambiguity created by the Debtor's signature on the Mortgage can only be resolved by reference to all the loan documents. CIT argues that such a comprehensive analysis results in only one logical conclusion-that only Patricia, and not the Debtor, was a \"Borrower\" for purposes of the reverse mortgage transaction. Accordingly, CIT says, it is entitled to repayment of the loan in full, including by way of foreclosing on the Property, if necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Summary judgment should be granted \"if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a), made applicable to these proceedings by\n   Fed. R. Bankr. P. 7056. The material facts relevant to the Summary Judgment Motion are not in dispute\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the matter is ready for resolution as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In the Debtor's strict construction of the Mortgage against CIT, the presence of his signature next to the word \"Borrower\" in the signature block of the Mortgage means that the Debtor is a \"Borrower\" under the loan documents. The Court agrees with the Debtor that the reverse mortgage is properly characterized as an adhesion contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    James B. Nutter &amp; Co. v.

The boxes for \"Co-Borrower\" information are empty. The Loan Application also indicates that title to the Property is held in Patricia's name only. The application specifically notes that the loan will be secured by a mortgage on the Property. Patricia signed in the signature block designated \"Borrower's Signature.\" The Debtor is listed as an \"Alternative Contact Person.\" The Debtor did not sign the application as a \"Co-Boreower.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (2) Closed-End Fixed Rate Home Equity Conversion Loan Agreement (the \"Loan Agreement\")\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Loan Agreement identifies Patricia as the \"Borrower,\" specifies the terms of the parties' agreement in connection with the reverse mortgage, and specifically references the promissory note and the Mortgage signed in connection with the transaction.

The Note further indicates that it is secured by a mortgage of the same date. The Note contains the following provision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    6.

Patricia signed above her pre-printed name preceded by the notation \"Borrower\" and the Debtor signed above his pre-printed name preceded by the notation \"Non-Borrower.\" It contains several statements, next to which both Patricia and the Debtor placed their initials. Among the statements, in bold and italicized language, is the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   We understand that should the Borrower predecease the non-borrowing spouse or if the Borrower fails to occupy the home as their primary residence and the non-borrowing spouse resides in the home, the home may need to be sold to repay the reverse mortgage loan and the non-borrowing spouse may be required to move from the home unless another means of repayment is obtained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The documents were all executed contemporaneously, concern a single transaction (the Loan Agreement outlines the terms governing the lending and the repayment of the loan, the Note evidences Patricia's promise to repay the loan, and the Mortgage provides security to ensure\n   that repayment), and expressly refer to each other and integrate each other's terms. Accordingly, any potential ambiguity must be resolved by reference to the loan documents as a whole.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gilmore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1154525\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/20/49/\">\n    20 Mass.

The Debtor had no interest in the Property to mortgage, and, with the exception of his signature on the Mortgage, was never represented to be a \"Borrower\" with regard to the transaction. In fact, the Debtor acknowledged-twice-his non-borrower status and the risks associated with the possibility of Patricia predeceasing him when he signed the Non-Borrower Acknowledgment and the Non-Borrower Certification.

Looking to 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715z-20(j), the\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   courts discerned a \"clear intent to protect from foreclosure a reverse mortgagor's surviving spouse who is maintaining the encumbered property as his or her principal residence.\"\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12180265,12180215\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/200/221/\">\n    200 So.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   227 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6817034\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-3d/187/895/\">\n    187 So.3d at 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201715\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 20(j) provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [t]he Secretary [of HUD] may not insure a home equity conversion mortgage under this section unless such mortgage provides that the homeowner's obligation to satisfy the loan obligation is deferred until the homeowner's death, the sale of the home, or the occurrence of other events specified in regulations of the Secretary.\n   <em>\n    For purposes of this subsection, the term 'homeowner' includes the spouse of a homeowner\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201715\">\n    12 U.S.C. \u00a7 1715\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 20(j) (emphasis supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   However, as other courts have noted, \u00a7 1715z-20(j) does not govern the enforceability of contractual terms between the Debtor and CIT. While \u00a7 1715z-20(j) speaks to the circumstances under which HUD should properly insure a reverse mortgage; \"nothing in the statute speaks to when a lender is allowed to foreclose.\"\n   <em>\n    Washington-Jarmon\n   </em>\n   , 513 S.W.3d at 112 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Jones v.

Conn. Feb. 17, 2015). Accordingly, the Court reads nothing in \u00a7 1715z-20(j) that would alter the enforceability or the terms of the loan documents or that would dissuade the Court from concluding that the Debtor is not a \"Borrower\" within the meaning of the Mortgage and the associated loan documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   For all the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that the Debtor is not a \"Borrower\" within the terms of the loan documents executed in connection with the reverse mortgage transaction. Accordingly, (1) the Plan Objection will be sustained, inasmuch as the Debtor's Chapter 13 plan fails to provide for adequate treatment of CIT's claim; (2) the Motion for Relief from Stay will be granted, inasmuch as CIT has established the requisite \"cause\" to proceed with its nonbankruptcy rights under the loan documents; and (3) the Summary Judgment Motion will be granted, inasmuch as the Debtor is not a \"Borrower\" under the relevant loan documents. Separate orders and a judgment in conformity with this Memorandum of Decision shall issue forthwith.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    As the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court explained, a home equity conversion mortgage loan:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n    is a unique kind of loan available to homeowners age sixty-two or older. These mortgages are commonly referred to as \"reverse mortgages\" because, instead of making payments\n    <em>\n     to\n    </em>\n    the lender, the borrower receives cash\n    <em>\n     from\n    </em>\n    the lender, either as a line of credit, in monthly payouts, or as a lump sum. As in a traditional mortgage, a reverse mortgage is secured by the borrower's home. Unlike a traditional mortgage, however, the loan does not become due until the borrower dies or no longer lives in the home; interest and fees are added to the loan balance over time and the entire balance is typically paid from the sale of the home.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-62\">\n    <em>\n     James B.
