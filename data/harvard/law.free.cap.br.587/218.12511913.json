The conversations involved loan transactions between Ms. Simon and the debtor. During a deposition, Ms. Simon answered general questions about the transactions and acknowledged that one or more conversations with her husband had occurred, but invoked\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mass.%20Gen.%20Laws%20ch.%20233%2C%20%C2%A7%2020\">\n    Mass.

The Simons maintain that the contract exemption from spousal disqualification applies only in litigation between spouses, clearly not the situation here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I conclude that the Simons' view of the scope of the spousal disqualification statute is correct, which means their conversations are protected and the plaintiff's motion to compel should be denied.

Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 601 (Chadbourn rev. ed. 1979) ). Even though many of these policy considerations seem quaintly outdated today, the Massachusetts spousal disqualification\n   statute retains all of its vitality.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=524%20N.E.2d%2053\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=524%20N.E.2d%2053\">\n    at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Were this strictly a common law rule, we would not hesitate to transform it from a rule of disqualification to one of privilege. However, given the existence of the statute, that decision is for the Legislature.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   While the Massachusetts spousal disqualification statute is broad, it is not limitless. The statute contains a number of exceptions which restrict the scope of spousal disqualification. The opening phrase of the statute exempts from spousal disqualification testimony in a suit \"arising out of or involving a contract\" between spouses. ch. 233, \u00a7 20, First.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The parties here disagree about what exactly constitutes \"a proceeding arising out of or involving a contract\" between a couple. The defendant supports a narrow interpretation, arguing that the contract exemption applies only in suits brought by one spouse against the other, meaning that the spousal disqualification doctrine would remain in full force in suits brought by third parties. The plaintiffs urge a broader interpretation, arguing for the exemption to apply in any suit involving a contract between spouses, irrespective of who are the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   There appear to be no reported decisions in Massachusetts dealing directly with the meaning of the statutory phrase \"a proceeding arising out of or involving a contract made by a married woman with her husband.\" All decisions that have examined the exemption involved suits between spouses so the courts did not have occasion to consider whether the contract exemption might apply more broadly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ansin v. Craven-Ansin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4268697\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/457/283/\">\n    457 Mass. 283\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=929%20N.E.2d%20955\">\n    929 N.E.2d 955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 965 n.14 (2010) (noting the lower court may have erred by applying spousal disqualification in a dispute between husband and wife because the contract exemption should apply);\n   <em>\n    Lima v.

While these decisions suggest a narrow interpretation of the contract exemption, none actually rejects the broader interpretation favored by the plaintiffs. Thus I must predict how the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court would rule on this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gordon v. Pappalardo (In re Gordon)\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4167985\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/487/600/#p602\">\n    487 B.R. 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 602 (1st Cir. BAP 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   I begin, as I must, with the statute itself. The statutory context strongly suggests that the contract exemption should apply only in suits between spouses. Every exception to the doctrine of spousal disqualification listed in chapter 233, section 20, First, save one, involves a dispute between spouses. These exceptions apply in cases where there is court ordered spousal support, a crime committed by one spouse against the other, or a violation of a vacate, restraining, or no contact order. Child abuse is the outlier, but child abuse is unique because of its victim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Villalta v. Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"651209\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/428/429/\">\n    428 Mass. 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=702%20N.E.2d%201148\">\n    702 N.E.2d 1148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1152 (1998) (expanding the exemption to cases where the victim is not related to the perpetrator because of society's interest in protecting children). So leaving aside child abuse, the structure of the statute suggests its purpose is to render spousal disqualification inapplicable only in disputes between the spouses themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The legislative history of the statute also supports its narrow interpretation. Massachusetts added the contract exemption in 1963 as part of an act authorizing contracts between married couples and suits between\n   married couples over those contracts. The 1963 amendment provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Chap. 765.\n   </strong>\n   AN ACT AUTHORIZING MARRIED WOMEN TO CONTRACT WITH THEIR HUSBANDS AND PERMITTING HUSBANDS AND WIVES TO SUE EACH OTHER IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH CONTRACTS .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Be it enacted, etc., as follows:\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   Section 1. Chapter 209 of the General Laws is hereby amended by striking out section 2, as appearing in the Tercentenary Edition, and inserting in place thereof the following section:-\n   <em>\n    Section 2.\n   </em>\n   A married woman may make contracts, oral and written, sealed and unsealed, in the same manner as if she were sole, and\n   <em>\n    may make such contracts with her husband\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   Section 2. Said chapter 209 is hereby further amended by striking out section 6, as so appearing, and inserting place thereof the following section:-\n   <em>\n    Section 6\n   </em>\n   . A married woman may sue and be sued in the same manner as if she were sole; but this section\n   <em>\n    shall not authorize suits between husband and wife except in connection with contracts entered into pursuant to the authority contained in section two\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Section 3. Section 20 of chapter 233 of the General Laws is hereby amended by striking out the second paragraph, as amended by section 3 of chapter 657 of the acts of 1951, and inserting in place thereof the following paragraph:-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    First, Except in a proceeding arising out of or involving a contract made by a married woman with her husband and except in a proceeding under chapter two hundred and seventy-three A and in prosecution begun under sections one to then, inclusive, of chapter two hundred and seventy-three, neither husband nor wife shall testify as to private conversations with the other.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1963%20Mass.%20Acts%20692\">\n    1963 Mass. Acts 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Reading Section 3 of the amendment in context with its companion sections strongly suggests that the legislature intended the spousal disqualification exemption to apply only to suits between spouses. Even the title of the act, which refers to suits between husbands and wives, supports this interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Finally, policy considerations support the narrow interpretation of the contract exemption to spousal disqualification. If the contract exemption is interpreted to apply in\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   suit arising out of or involving a contract between a married couple, the exemption would swallow the rule. Any time a married couple were involved in a contract and a third party brought suit \"arising out of or involving\" that contract, the spouses' conversations surrounding the contract would be discoverable. This broad interpretation appears counter to the goal of spousal disqualification, which is to insulate from inquisitive third parties the private conversations of married couples.\n   <em>\n    Gallagher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=524%20N.E.2d%2053\">\n    524 N.E.2d at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Based on the language and structure of the statute, its legislative history and the long-standing policy to protect confidential spousal communications, I conclude that the exception from spousal disqualification in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Mass.%20Gen.%20Laws%20ch.%20233%2C%20%C2%A7%2020\">\n    Mass.
