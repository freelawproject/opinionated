The State has brought this appeal as of right based on the dissent filed below. <em>See R. </em>2:2\u2014 1(a)(2). For the reasons expressed, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Division. Defendant, by his voluntary agreement, will never again seek future employment in this State or any other as a law enforcement officer. However, we hold that the State\u2019s demand for permanent disqualification was not supported on this record. The offense to which he pled does not compel his forfeiture of office and permanent disqualification under <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">Defendant was employed as a Hunterdon County sheriffs officer, and also worked part-time as a Frenchtown police officer, when he was indicted on January 9, 2007, for an incident that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>occurred a year earlier. The indictment involved a sexual encounter with a young female acquaintance of defendant. It is undisputed that at the time of the incident, defendant was neither on duty, nor in uniform. The following description of the alleged events is taken from the \u201cOffense Circumstances\u201d section of his presentenee report. Importantly, these allegations have never been admitted by defendant, nor have they been tested or proved at trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">On the night of January 13, 2006, the victim, K.W., had been drinking with [a female friend.] In the early morning hours of January 14, 2006, the defendant, Jeremiah Hupka, and his [male] friend ... arrived at K.W.\u2019s apartment. K.W. eventually fell asleep on her couch. Upon awaking the next morning, she woke up, felt ill and went to the bathroom where she was sick. While in the bathroom, she saw male ejaculate in her underwear and in the toilet and noticed soreness in her vaginal region. K.W. confronted both the defendant and [his male friend], however both denied having sex with her. K.W. later learned that she was pregnant. Upon terminating the pregnancy, DNA tests were conducted on the fetus and compared to that of the defendant, [his male friend] and the victim\u2019s boyfriend____It was determined by the State\u2019s DNA expert that there was a 99.9% possibility that the defendant had fathered the fetus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Those allegations led a Hunterdon County grand jury to return a two-count indictment, charging defendant with first-degree aggravated sexual assault in violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:14-2(a)(7), and second-degree sexual assault in violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:14-2(c)(l). Defendant negotiated a plea bargain, pursuant to which he pled guilty to a single count of fourth-degree criminal sexual contact, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-3(b), as a lesser-included offense of the second-degree sexual assault charge, and the first-degree charge was to be dismissed. However, there was more to the plea bargain. Although defendant had voluntarily resigned both of his law enforcement positions after the indictment issued, the State made the plea conditional on defendant\u2019s agreement never again to seek employment as a police officer in New Jersey or any other state, a condition to which defendant agreed. Further, the State raised statutory forfeiture and permanent disqualification from public employment pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2 (the forfeiture statute), due to defendant\u2019s status as a public employee when the offense was committed. Defendant would not agree to statutory forfei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>ture and permanent disqualification and it was not made a condition of the plea. Rather, the parties agreed to have the applicability of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2 resolved by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">In his plea allocution, defendant admitted that, on January 14, 2006, he was in Frenchtown with the victim, K.W., with whom he had had a prior relationship, and that he \u201ctouch[ed] her intimate parts, including her buttocks!,] ... without her freely-given consent!,] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [and] for purposes of [his] own sexual gratification.\u201d Satisfied that defendant\u2019s admissions created a sufficient factual basis to sustain the fourth-degree charge of criminal sexual contact, the court accepted the plea. The court then directed defense counsel and the State to brief whether defendant should be held to have statutorily forfeited his public employment and be permanently disqualified from any future public office or position as a result of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The court heard argument on the issue at the time of sentencing. The State urged the court to find that the conviction \u201ctouched on\u201d defendant\u2019s employment as a law enforcement officer because police officers are \u201con duty\u201d at all times and are obligated to uphold the law. In reliance on <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>383 <em>N.J.Super. </em>663, 893 A.2d 60 (App.Div.2006), the State argued that defendant\u2019s conviction not only bore directly on his police position, but also, by extension, on defendant\u2019s competency to perform any public job. Defendant disagreed with the sweeping argument advanced by the State. He argued that the proper inquiry as to the forfeiture statute\u2019s applicability was whether there existed a specific and direct nexus between the offense committed and the public office held. Urging the court to find that no such nexus was presented on the facts here, defendant argued against the entry of an order of forfeiture and disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">The trial court, relying on the two-pronged test enunciated in <em>Moore v. Youth Correctional Institute, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>256, 574 A.2d 983 (1990), concluded that defendant\u2019s conviction for fourth-degree criminal sexual contact was serious and was \u201cat direct odds with the duty to protect and serve the very community within which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>was the officer.\u201d Accordingly, the court ordered defendant\u2019s forfeiture of and permanent disqualification from public office pursuant to N.J.S.A 2C:51-2, and thereupon sentenced defendant, in accordance with the terms of the plea agreement, to a two-year term of probation, with the conditions noted previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Defendant appealed,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a divided Appellate Division panel reversed. <em>State v. Hupka, </em>407 <em>N.J.Super. </em>489, 493, 971 A.2d 1102 (App.Div.2009). The majority, pointing to the amendments to the forfeiture statute made in 2007 to incorporate this Court\u2019s holding in <em>McCann v. Clerk of Jersey City, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>311, 771 A.2d 1123 (2001), discerned a legislative preference for the \u201cinvolving and touching\u201d standard enunciated in <em>McCann, </em>over the <em>Moore </em>standard on which the trial court relied. <em>Hupka, supra, </em>407 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 505-06, 971 A.2d 1102. Applying the <em>McCann </em>standard to the facts presented, the majority found no nexus between the performance of defendant\u2019s public duties and the crime for which he pled and was convicted, <em>id. </em>at 509-510, 971 A.2d 1102; thus, the Appellate Division reversed the order of permanent disqualification, <em>id. </em>at 511-12, 971 A.2d 1102.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">The dissenting judge argued that the focus should be on \u201cwhether the offense is incompatible with the performance in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>specific public office held.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 513, 971 A.2d 1102 (Lihotz, J.A.D., dissenting). Convinced that the civil nature of the forfeiture statute allowed judges to consider collateral facts, the dissent looked beyond the plea allocution to the presentence report, and concluded that defendant\u2019s conduct was much more serious than his plea suggested, and was related directly to his role as a law enforcement officer. <em>Id. </em>at 515-17, 971 A.2d 1102. Because defendant broke the law and thereby deviated from his public duties, the dissent concluded that permanent disqualification from public office or employment was proper. <em>Id. </em>at 517, 971 A.2d 1102.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">Based on the dissent below, the State appealed as of right pursuant to <em>Rule </em>2:2-l(a)(2). We granted the subsequent requests by the Attorney General of New Jersey and the Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers of New Jersey to appear as amici curiae.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">The forfeiture statute in New Jersey\u2019s Criminal Code is implicated when \u201c[a] person holding any public office, position, or employment, elective or appointive, under the government of this State or any agency or political subdivision thereof ... is convicted of an offense----\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(a).

Because the trial court\u2019s determination to subject defendant to the forfeiture and disqualification provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2 based on his conviction represents that court\u2019s \u201cinterpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts,\u201d its conclusion is \u201cnot entitled to any special deference.\u201d <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm., </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995) (citation omitted). As such, our review is de novo. <em>See ibid. </em>Moreover, the standards governing the performance of our de novo interpretative task are equally well known. When we examine a statute, \u201cour goal is to discern and effectuate the Legislature\u2019s intent. [Thus, t]he plain language of the statute is our starting point.\u201d <em>Patel v. N.J. Motor Vehicle Comm\u2019n, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>413, 418, 982 A.2d 445 (2009) (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">We begin by \u201cread[ing] and examining] the text of the act and drawing] inferences concerning the meaning from its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>composition and structure.\u201d 2A Norman J. Singer &amp; J.D. Shambie Singer, <em>Sutherland Statutory Construction </em>\u00a7 47:1 (7th ed. 2007). That common sense canon of statutory construction is reflected also in the legislative directive codified at <em>N.J.S.A </em>1:1-1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\">In the construction of the laws and statutes of this state, both civil and criminal, words and phrases shall be read and construed with their context, and shall, unless inconsistent with the manifest intent of the legislature or unless another or different meaning is expressly indicated, be given their generally accepted meaning, according to the approved usage of the language.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">If a plain-language reading of the statute \u201cleads to a clear and unambiguous result, then our interpretive process is over. Only if there is ambiguity in the statutory language will we turn to extrinsic evidence. When such evidence is needed, we look to a variety of sources. Central among them is a statute\u2019s legislative history.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Bd. of Trs., Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Ret. Sys., </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>189, 195-96, 927 A.2d 543 (2007) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">In this matter, defendant\u2019s conviction does not implicate one of the more straightforward provisions of the forfeiture statute. Defendant\u2019s conviction was not for a crime involving dishonesty or a crime of the third degree or above, for which forfeiture is rather mechanically applied. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2(a)(l). Rather, the order of forfeiture and disqualification entered against defendant was based on <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2(a)(2), and thus requires determination whether defendant was \u201cconvicted of an offense involving or touching\u201d his public employment as a law enforcement officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">In the forfeiture statute itself, the Legislature included a definitional statement summarizing the intent behind the precondition that an offense must involve or touch the particular office held before the permanent disqualification statute is implicated. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(d) provides: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>That language signals strongly that the disqualification provision was intended to be contingent on a conclusion that the conviction was related, directly and specifically, to the position held. Based on that legislative emphasis, trial courts contemplating entry of an order of forfeiture and disqualification for an offense involving or touching public office pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(a) and (d) must examine the relationship between the exact offense committed and the particular position held by the individual convicted in order to reach a conclusion that the commission of the offense had some direct connection to the office held. Those explicit requirements stand in contrast to the Appellate Division dissent\u2019s suggested reading of the statute as allowing for the imposition of disqualification based on generalized descriptions of implied expectations for the performance of certain duties.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>As used in this subsection, \u201cinvolving or touching on his public office, position or employment\u201d means that the offense was related directly to the person\u2019s performance in, or circumstances flowing from, the specific public office, position or employment held by the person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Despite the legislative effort to clarify its intention as to what \u201cinvolving and touching\u201d means, one cannot dismiss altogether a contention that some flexibility\u2014indeed, ambiguity\u2014remains in respect of the statute\u2019s reach. Thus, in performing the interpretative task required in this matter, we find it to be necessary and, ultimately, particularly helpful to reach into the trove of guidance that legislative history offers in respect of the forfeiture statute. Fortunately, to the extent any degree of ambiguity lingers, the legislative history underlying the evolution of the forfeiture and disqualification statute clarifies the legislative intent and eviscerates any possible uncertainty.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">Prior case law has ably detailed the passage and development of the forfeiture statute. <em>See, e.g., State v. Musto, </em>187 <em>N.J.Super. </em>264, 308-10, 454 A.2d 449 (Law Div.1982) (examining history of disqualification provision). For purposes of resolving the present case, however, our focus need be drawn to the more recent, and relevant, revisions to the statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Although forfeiture and disqualification provisions existed in New Jersey law going back to 1898, <em>see L. </em>1898, c. 235, \u00a7\u00a7 21, 25, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>&amp; 28 (disqualifying certain public officials convicted of accepting bribes from holding any future public office), <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2 sprung into being as part of the comprehensive overhaul of New Jersey\u2019s criminal laws that occurred with the passage of the Code of Criminal Justice in 1978, see <em>L. </em>1978, c. 95, \u00a7 2C:51-2. As enacted at that time, the forfeiture provision would become operational when a public official or employee was convicted of, among other things, \u201can offense involving or touching such office, position or employment[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2C:51-2(a)(2). Like the modern statute, the disqualification provision authorized a permanent bar on public office and employment following any such conviction. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 2C:51-2(c). However, neither the forfeiture provision nor the disqualification provision attempted to define which convictions could be said to \u201cinvolve or touch\u201d a particular public role. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 2C:51-2(a), (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">The language of those provisions remained unchanged during the thirty-year period between 1978 and 2007. In 2007, the Legislature added the definitional provision clarifying that, as applied to disqualification, \u2018\u201cinvolving or touching such office, position or employment\u2019 means that the offense was related directly to the person\u2019s performance in, or circumstances flowing from, the specific public office, position or employment held by the person.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2(a). Not content with the insertion of that additional definitional language alone, the Legislature also included a detailed description of its intent in revising the statute, explaining that the language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Those legislative modifications to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2(a) and (d) were approved on March 15, 2007, and the statement describing the incorporation of this Court\u2019s holding in <em>McCann </em>was included in the printing of the final text of the bill. <em>See L. </em>2007, c. 49, \u00a7 5 and statement following \u00a7 10.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>amends current law concerning forfeiture of public office to include a definition of the phrase concerning crimes and offenses \u201cinvolving or touching\u201d public office or employment, in accordance with the definition set forth by the New Jersey Supreme Court in <em>McCann </em>[, supra,] 167 <em>N.J. </em>311 [771 A.2d 1123] (2001). It provides that a crime or offense \u201cinvolving or touching\u201d public office or employment means that the crime or offense was related directly to the person\u2019s performance in, or circumstances flowing from, a specific public office or position held by the person. As the Supreme Court stated in <em>McCann: </em>\u201cWhen an individual commits a crime wholly unrelated to his or her public office, the crime ordinarily cannot be characterized as involving or touching on the public office.\u201d [S. 14 (Sponsor\u2019s Statement), 212th Leg. (N.J.2007); <em>Assemb. </em>20 (Sponsor\u2019s Statement), 212th Leg.

That fact, coupled with the Legislature\u2019s apparent preference for the analytical framework that we adopted in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number><em>McCann, </em>catapults our analysis in this matter down the path set by the principles enunciated in that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Gerald McCann served as mayor of Jersey City between 1982-86 and 1990-92; during the latter term, he was indicted on fifteen counts including mail, wire, and income tax fraud for conduct that had occurred in the interim between his terms in office. <em>McCann, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 316-17, 771 A.2d 1123. He was convicted in federal court, and forfeited the balance of his 1990-94 term pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(a)(l), which requires forfeiture of public office upon conviction of a crime of dishonesty or any crime of the third degree or above. <em>Ibid. </em>Following service of his sentence, McCann again sought to become a candidate for mayor, but his election petition was rejected by the Clerk of Jersey City, on the grounds that his convictions disqualified him permanently from office pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2(d). <em>Id. </em>at 317, 771 A.2d 1123. The trial court ordered the petition to be processed, but the Appellate Division reversed and, relying on our earlier ruling in <em>Moore v. Youth Correctional Institute, </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>256, 574 A.2d 983 (1990), upheld the Clerk\u2019s determination not to process the petition, finding that McCann was disqualified from public position. <em>Id. </em>at 318-19, 322, 771 A.2d 1123.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">On appeal, we reversed the Appellate Division judgment in respect of its application of <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2(d) to defendant\u2019s conviction, observing that the language of the provision \u201cconsidered in the context of the entire statute, suggests that a conviction does not \u2018involve[ ]\u2019 or \u2018touch[] upon\u2019 a public office unless the facts underlying the conviction bear some direct relationship to an office held by the individual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 320, 771 A.2d 1123. We noted the different standards for forfeiture set forth in subsection (a) of the statute, but observed that only one\u2014where, a conviction <em>involves </em>or <em>touches </em>a public office\u2014could result in permanent disqualification from public office or position. <em>Id. </em>at 320-21, 771 A.2d 1123.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>The operative distinction between the \u201cinvolving dishonesty\u201d and \u201cinvolving or touching on\u201d standards can be found in the Legislature\u2019s decision to limit permanent disqualification from office only to those persons <em>\u201cconvicted of an offense involving or touching on his public office.\" N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(d) (emphasis added). That phrase implies, in our view, a determination on the part of the Legislature to limit the scope of the disqualification provision to crimes that are related directly to an individual\u2019s performance in, or circumstances flowing from, a specific public office or position held by that individual. When an individual commits a crime wholly unrelated to his or her public office, the crime ordinarily cannot be characterized as involving or touching on the public office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 321, 771 A.2d 1123.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">Toward the same end, two justices, in concurrence, observed that \u201c[t]he Legislature obviously intended to distinguish between two classes of felons, those who commit dishonest acts, and those who use their office to do so.

In <em>Moore, supra, </em>this Court had affirmed an order of forfeiture and disqualification entered against a corrections officer who had been convicted of harassment for off-duty behavior he directed at a supervisor in retaliation for a work-related disciplinary action. 119 <em>N.J. </em>at 260-62, 271, 574 A.2d 983. There, we said that the involving or touching analysis required an examination of the \u201cnexus between the crime and the employment to determine if there is a sufficient relationship between the two to warrant the harsh penalty of forfeiture.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266, 574 A.2d 983. To achieve that goal, we crafted a two-part test: \u201cFirst, there is a need to assess the gravity of the crime as revealed by its nature, its context, and the identity of the victim. Second, there is a need to assess the qualifications required of the employee\u2019s public employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 269, 574 A.2d 983. We also observed that, \u201c[w]hen the infraction casts such a shadow over the employee as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>make Ms or her continued service appear incompatible with the traits of trustworthiness, honesty, and obedience to law and order, then forfeiture is appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 270, 574 A.2d 983.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">In <em>McCann, swpra, </em>we cautioned against reading <em>Moore\u2019s </em>more expansive language in exclusion and untethered to the facts of that case. 167 <em>N.J. </em>at 322-23, 771 A.2d 1123.

Finding \u201cno indication in the record that any direct relationship exists between the offenses and [McCann\u2019s] mayoral responsibilities,\u201d we concluded that the disqualification provision of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(d) did not apply to McCann.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">With that clear direction from <em>McCann, </em>adopted by the Legislature in its operative provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2 and in its explication of purpose, we turn to apply that understanding of \u201ctouching and involving\u201d to the forfeiture and disqualification issue <em>concerning </em>defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Here, there is no serious question that the specific crime to which defendant pled guilty did not involve, in that it did not directly relate to, his performance in office.

The offense occurred while off-duty, in a private home involving someone defendant knew, as opposed to a member of the public, and had no nexus to his positions in law enforcement. Nor was defendant\u2019s offense \u201crelated directly to circumstances flowing from\u201d his positions. Defendant did not use or threaten the use of his offices in any way to commit the offense. He did not display or utilize any indicia of his offices at any time. The offense was not related to any circumstance that flowed from defendant being a sheriffs officer or a police officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"An-\"><em>[Hupka, supra, </em>407 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 509-510, 971 A.2d 1102.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">We readily agree. Even the dissent in the Appellate Division seemingly did not disagree.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The dissenting judge below, howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>er, felt it appropriate to examine beyond the four comers of defendant\u2019s plea to conclude that defendant\u2019s offense was worse than that to which he pled (calling it \u201ca flagrant offense\u201d) and, further, that having committed any sexual offense was incompatible with his duty as a law enforcement officer. <em>See id. </em>at 516-17, 971 A.2d 1102 (Lihotz, J.A.D., dissenting). We reject the latter interpretation of \u201ctouching on\u201d his position as inconsistent with <em>McCann, </em>and therefore, beyond the legislative intent behind the latest clarification of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(d)\u2019s reach. Although the issue does not influence our conclusion that defendant\u2019s actions did not touch or concern his employment as an officer of law enforcement, we now address the Appellate Division dissent\u2019s improper reliance on the unproven, disputed allegations of the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">The dissent below, supplemented by the submissions of the amici curiae, calls into question the proper role of presentence reports in forfeiture and disqualification proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-8\">In this ease, the \u201cOffense Circumstances\u201d section of the presentenee report alleges very different circumstances than those admitted by defendant at his guilty plea. Though the trial court imposed the order of forfeiture and disqualification based strictly on the fourth-degree offense of criminal sexual contact to which defendant pled and on the facts stated in his allocution, the dissenting judge of the Appellate Division looked beyond defendant\u2019s plea, to the allegations contained in the presentence report, and concluded that defendant\u2019s \u201cwas a flagrant offense, not a de minimis encounter.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Defendant has denied, consistently and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>vehemently, the \u201cOffense Circumstances\u201d described in the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">It is black letter law that where a material factual matter is contested, it cannot be relied on without a resolution of the disputed evidence. <em>See, e.g., Brill v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 540, 666 A.2d 146 (1995) (setting forth standard for determining whether material factual dispute precludes grant of summary judgment); <em>Central Paper Distrib. Servs. v. Int\u2019l Records Storage &amp; Retrieval Serv., Inc., </em>325 <em>N.J.Super. </em>225, 232, 738 A.2d 962 (App.Div.1999) (holding legal issue not amenable to summary judgment when dependent on disputed operative facts that require plenary hearing opportunity), <em>certif. denied, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>74, 747 A.2d 283 (2000); <em>State v. Green, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>547, 564, 303 A.2d 312 (1973) (discussing rule requiring disclosure of presentence reports so as to provide defendants \u201c Svith fair opportunity to be heard on any adverse matters relevant to the sentencing\u2019 \u201d (citing <em>State v. Kunz, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>128, 144, 259 A.2d 895 (1969))). Thus, as a general proposition, we agree that the State may produce evidence outside an allocution to establish whether a defendant\u2019s offense involved or touched on his office. And, if uncontroverted, that evidence can be considered by the trial judge. However, that is not the case here. Here, defendant denied the material in the presentence report. The dissenting judge therefore had two choices: omit consideration of it or order a hearing to resolve it. Procedurally, the disputed evidence could not be used \u201cas is.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">Our dissenting colleagues suggest that we are extending undue protection to convicted public office holders. In fact, what we are doing is narrowly disapproving of the dissenting Appellate Division judge\u2019s use of disputed facts in the presentence report. Most important is the following. We clearly recognize that at a disqualification hearing the facts to show that an offense is one that touches or involves a public position may have to come from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>outside the conviction. For example, the connection to one\u2019s public office or position may not be apparent from the evidence to support the verdict or plea. Nevertheless, it is fair for the State, on notice and opportunity to defendant to be heard, to seek to show that connection to the position or office.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">Finally, we note that, to some, it may appear that the plain language of the statute places a hurdle on the State\u2019s track toward resolution of charges via plea negotiations. However, what appears to be an impediment in the plea bargain process is but an additional and necessary step toward a transparency in purpose that will provide notice to a defendant that forfeiture and disqualification are possible consequences to a plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Prosecutors should include discussions of forfeiture and disqualification in plea negotiations with public employees. Where a defendant is charged with a crime of dishonesty or a crime of the third degree or above and the State is considering accepting a plea to a lesser-ineluded offense, if forfeiture is desired the State should raise voluntary forfeiture as a condition of the plea. And, when a defendant is charged with a crime that might be regarded as involving or touching his or her public position, the State should, likewise, require an allocution that either establishes the connection between the crime and the position to enable the court to sustain a subsequent forfeiture and disqualification order, or, alternatively, should negotiate a voluntary disqualification from a future position.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">In the present case, the prosecutor acted with circumspection, negotiating a plea that was conditioned on defendant voluntarily and permanently relinquishing his right to present and future employment as a law enforcement officer. At the same time, no such agreement was reached requiring defendant\u2019s disqualification from all future public positions or offices. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2(d). Furthermore, defendant\u2019s factual circumstances do not support an \u201cinvolving or touching\u201d conclusion in respect of his offense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>Defendant did not use Ms office or its trappings in any way in the commission of his offense. We reject application of some ill-defined incompatiMlity-with-duties analysis that an expansive reading of <em>Moore, </em>when untethered to its specific facts, is said to support. To the extent that our courts, in the past, have applied the touching and involving language broadly to police officers, the reasoning of <em>McCann </em>as it has been applied to this matter should control going forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Division is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b251-10\"> The trial court also ordered defendant\u2019s forfeiture of his positions by operation of <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:5 l-2(a)(2), notwithstanding that defendant had resigned voluntarily.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b254-7\"> Defendant asserts that his main objection to the order of disqualification does not arise from his desire to obtain a position as a police officer. His counsel reiterated at oral argument that defendant has \"agreed that he\u2019s not going to seek employment as a law enforcement officer in the future.\" In fact, defendant\u2019s guilty plea was conditioned on that agreement. Thus, the result in this case will impact only the court-ordered forfeiture and disqualification; it has no impact on his promise not to reenter the field of law enforcement in New Jersey or any other state.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">Rather, defendant\u2019s purpose on appeal is to avoid the sweeping nature of the disqualification order, which, as his counsel also pointed out at oral argument, \"means he can't even seek employment as a sanitation worker for a municipality, a groundskeeper at a public golf course, or any of the myriad of other public employment opportunities that might await somebody apart from law enforcement.\u201d In addition, defendant hopes to avoid the operation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:52-2(b), which directs that a \"crime shall not be subject to expungement if the crime involved or touched [a public] office, position or employment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b256-10\"> Thus, disqualification results only if an offense involved or touched public office; it does not follow from a conviction involving dishonesty or one above the third-degree unless that offense is determined to have involved or touched the public position. That determination may be made at a hearing following the conviction. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(b)(l) (directing that order of forfeiture shall be entered \"[immediately upon a finding of guilt by the trier of fact or a plea of guilty entered in any court of this State unless the court, for good cause shown, orders a stay of such forfeiture pending a hearing on the merits at the time of sentencing.\") While orders of forfeiture may enter immediately following conviction above the third degree, forfeiture for a conviction \u201cinvolving or touching\u201d office often requires a more nuanced examination. Thus, the hearing authorized by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:52-2(b)(l) is particularly important and necessary where, as in this case, the conviction does not relate directly to the public office in an obvious fashion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b257-10\"> While we do not explore the parameters of this statutory provision in our opinion today, we mention the collateral consequence precluding convicted public officials from obtaining expungements because that provision provides significant impetus for defendant\u2019s appeal from the trial court\u2019s order. Defendant concedes in submissions to this Court that he has agreed, of his own accord and as a condition to the State's agreement to accept the plea bargain entered in this case, never to seek employment as a law enforcement officer in New Jersey or elsewhere. However, the trial court\u2019s order of forfeiture and permanent disqualification renders him unable to obtain an expungement of the conviction at any time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b261-7\"> Many of those rulings involved off-duty police officers. <em>See. State v. Rodriguez, </em>383 <em>N.J.Super. </em>663, 893 A.2d 60 (App.Div.2006) (concluding that officer leaving scene of drunken driving accident he caused involved or touched general officer duties to uphold law and assist public, and affirming disqualification due to bearing conviction had on his ability to perform any future job for state); <em>State v. Williams, </em>355 <em>N.J.Super. </em>579, 810 A.2d 1169 (App.Div.2002) (ordering forfeiture and disqualification for conduct involving or touching public employment where off-duty officer flashed badge and fired weapon during bout of road rage); <em>State v. Gismondi, </em>353 <em>N.J.Super. </em>178, 801 A.2d 1178 (App.Div.2002) (finding that officer's flashing of badge and firing of service revolver during period of off-duty drunkenness constituted abuse of authority that involved or touched employment); <em>see also Moore </em>v. <em>Youth Corr. Inst., </em>119 <em>N.J. </em>256, 574 A.2d 983 (1990) (affirming operation of forfeiture statute to disqualify corrections officer convicted of harassing supervisor).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b264-9\"> Our dissenting colleagues suggest that we fail to harmonize <em>Moore </em>and <em>McCann. </em>To the contrary, our holding today recognizes that <em>Moore, as qualified and limited by McCann, </em>has continuing viability. In light of our view of the 2007 amendments to the forfeiture act, it is rather the overly broadened application of <em>Moore </em>by the Appellate Division pre-2007 that we cannot, and do not attempt to, harmonize.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b264-10\"> The majority nevertheless barred McCann\u2019s candidacy on other grounds: the disqualification provision of the Faulkner Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:69A-166, since repealed. <em>McCann, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 332, 771 A.2d 1123; <em>L. </em>2003, c. 145, \u00a7 2 (eff. Aug. 8, 2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b265-8\"> However, our dissenting colleagues question how, after the admissions defendant made at his plea hearing, he could act in a law enforcement capacity in any sexual assault or domestic abuse matter. Post at 230-32, 1 A.3d at 645-46. Played to its conclusion, that logic amounts to a rewriting of the statute. It would compel automatic forfeiture and disqualification any time a law enforcement officer is convicted of violating the law: how could a police officer with a speeding conviction enforce speeding laws?</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">Moreover, that interpretation ignores the facts of McCann, supra, in which the defendant was convicted of fifteen counts including mail and wire fraud, and making false statements to the IRS and banks. 167 <em>N.J. </em>at 316, 771 A.2d 1123. Following those convictions for fraud and fiscal irresponsibility, we said: \u201cWe do not dispute that McCann's conduct reveals qualities that are relevant to his fitness for the office of Mayor. However, our inquiry under subsection (d) is limited to determining whether McCann's offenses touched upon either of his specific tenures as Mayor of Jersey City, and there is no indication in the record that any direct relationship exists between the offenses and his mayoral responsibilities.\u201d Id<em>. </em>at 322, 771 A.2d 1123.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">Likewise, on the facts of this case, \u201c[w]e do not dispute that [Hupka's] conduct reveals qualities that are relevant to his fitness for\u201d law enforcement. <em>See ibid. </em>However, we decline, in light of our precedent and the clear legislative intent, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>allow our individual views in that regard to color our interpretive responsibility to enforce the statute as designed by the Legislature. And, in the application of the statute to the instant matter, there is no fact\u2014disputed or otherwise\u2014that ties defendant\u2019s conviction to his public office or any of its trappings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b267-7\"> That procedural step is unnecessary in this matter because there is no fact, disputed or not, that ties defendant's conviction to his office.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b269-7\">Chief Justice RABNER,</author>\n<p id=\"Ad2\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">Defendant Jeremiah Hupka pleaded guilty to criminal sexual contact for conduct he engaged in while he was employed as a Hunterdon County Sheriffs officer and a part-time local police officer. To establish a factual basis for the plea, he admitted in open court that, m the community where he worked as a law enforcement officer, he victimized a nineteen-or twenty-year-old woman by having sexual contact with her without consent. He admitted touching her \u201cintimate parts, including her buttocks.\u201d He also conceded that he did so for his own sexual gratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-9\">The Presentence Report (PSR) revealed more: the victim had been drinking; defendant arrived at her apartment afterward with another man; the victim fell asleep on her couch; and she felt ill the following morning, and saw male ejaculate in her underwear and felt soreness in her vaginal area. When the victim confronted defendant and the third person, both denied having sex with her. After she later learned that she was pregnant, DNA tests established that there was a 99.9% probability that defendant was the father.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">I agree with the majority that trial courts may consider facts beyond those contained in a defendant\u2019s plea allocution to evaluate a collateral civil motion for forfeiture. A hearing should be held to resolve disputed material facts on which a court may wish to rely. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>The majority, however, offers little guidance as to what facts may be considered in this ease to test defendant\u2019s conduct against the standard for disqualification contained in the forfeiture statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(d). Instead, the majority concludes that no facts presented, whether in dispute or not, warrant disqualification from public office here.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">Because the offense defendant committed involved and touched on his public positions and directly relates to his performance as a law enforcement official, his conduct should subject him to disqualification. For those reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">The majority properly notes that facts outside of a plea allocution or conviction may be considered to determine whether an offense involved or touched on a defendant\u2019s public office or directly related to the person\u2019s performance in that particular office. <em>Ante </em>at 241\u201442, 1 A.3d at 652-53. Practices followed at sentencing proceedings offer some guidance as to the type of facts that may be evaluated at a forfeiture hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">Judges routinely consider facts beyond those admitted during a defendant\u2019s plea allocution to determine the proper sentence. They have wide discretion in assessing the details of the offense and the full background of the offender. <em>State v. Natale, </em>184 <em>N.J. </em>458, 472, 878 A.2d 724 (2005); <em>State v.

Even prior arrests that did not result in convictions may be relied on. <em>Green, supra, </em>62 <em>N.J. </em>at 563-72, 303 A.2d 312. In short, the sentencing process should entail an inquiry \u201c \u2018broad in scope, largely unlimited either as to the kind of information that may be considered, or the source from which it may come.\u2019 \u201d State <em>v.

That language, though, must be considered in the context of the Court\u2019s decision, which itself affirmed the use of facts beyond those admitted by the defendant in his guilty plea. <em>Id. </em>at 294, 526 A.2d 1015 (finding trial court properly considered larger quantity of drugs and other drug activity not admitted in factual basis). Any facts relied on at sentencing must be \u201cgrounded in competent, reasonably credible evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 363, 471 A.2d 370 (1984) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">The forfeiture statute, to be sure, is not a criminal law, nor is forfeiture of public office a penal sanction. Rather, the law imposes a civil remedy, which is a collateral consequence of a conviction. <em>Flagg v. Essex County Prosecutor, </em>171 <em>N.J. </em>561, 570, 575, 796 A.2d 182 (2002); <em>Old Bridge Pub. Workers &amp; Sanitation Union v. Twp. of Old Bridge, </em>231 <em>N.J.Super. </em>205, 209-10, 555 A.2d 639 (App.Div.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">That distinction is important. Collateral civil proceedings are not subject to the \u201cfull panoply of rights applicable to a criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>In re Registrant, C.A., </em>146 <em>N.J. </em>71, 94, 679 A.2d 1153 (1996) (citing <em>Doe v. Poritz, </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>1, 34, 662 A.2d 367 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>(1995)) (discussing nature of hearing to determine tier classification and manner of notification under Megan\u2019s Law). As at sentencing proceedings, the rules of evidence do not necessarily apply at hearings to determine collateral civil penalties. <em>Id. </em>at 94-96, 679 A.2d 1153. Reliable hearsay evidence may be accepted. <em>Id. </em>at 95-96, 679 A.2d 1153. In addition, civil remedies that are not based on convictions have been upheld. <em>Id. </em>at 91, 662 A.2d 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">In evaluating what type of information may be considered under the forfeiture law, the statute is the proper starting point. Its text, which does not explicitly answer the question, and its overall purpose inform the discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The applicable part of the forfeiture law provides that in addition to punishment for the offense, \u201cany person convicted of an offense involving or touching on his public office, position or employment shall be forever disqualified from holding\u201d a public position. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(d). The statute defines \u201c \u2018involving or touching on his public office, position or employment\u2019 \u201d to \u201cmean[ ] that the offense was related directly to the person\u2019s performance in, or circumstances flowing from, the specific public office, position or employment held by the person.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">Because the statute does not specify what evidence to consider, the law\u2019s purpose should be examined. <em>See </em>N.J.S.A 2C:l-2(e) (\u201c[W]hen the [statutory] language is susceptible of differing constructions it shall be interpreted to further ... the special purposes of the particular provision involved.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b272-8\">The aim behind the forfeiture statute is plain: to bar \u201cthose who have once violated the public trust from [having] a second opportunity.\u201d <em>Cedeno v. Montclair State Univ., </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>473, 477, 750 A.2d 73 (2000) (alteration in original, citations and internal quotation marks omitted). The statute is \u201cdesigned to protect the public, not the offender.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 477-78, 750 A.2d 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-9\">Consistent with that aim, the statute specifically limits the ability of courts to stay forfeiture orders. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(b) &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>(c). It directs that forfeiture take place \u201cimmediately\u201d upon a jury\u2019s finding of guilt or a plea of guilty unless a court, for good cause shown, orders a stay \u201cpending a hearing on the merits at the time of sentencing\u201d; otherwise, no advance notice or hearing is provided. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2(b)(l). The statute empowers successors in office to void official actions taken by a convicted person, which would go into effect -within sixty days of a forfeiture order, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:51-2(c). It tightly restricts waiver of forfeiture proceedings. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2(e). It also bars defendants from bidding for public work if they have been convicted of certain listed offenses. <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:51-2(f). Thus, the law\u2019s overarching approach is to protect the public\u2019s interest over the offender\u2019s. That principle should inform decisions about the breadth of facts that may be considered in applying the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">The statute and prior case law also provide guidance as to when an offense involves or touches upon a public office and requires forfeiture. In <em>Moore v. Youth Correctional Institute, </em>this Court affirmed the removal and forfeiture of office of an off-duty corrections officer convicted of harassing his supervisor. 119 <em>N.J. </em>256, 259, 574 A.2d 983 (1990). The Court outlined the following inquiry to determine \u201cwhether an offense involves and touches on employment\u201d: \u201cFirst, there is a need to assess the gravity of the crime as revealed by its nature, its context, and the identity of the victim. Second, there is a need to assess the qualifications required of the employee\u2019s public employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 269, 574 A.2d 983.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">In 2001, in <em>McCann v. Clerk of Jersey City, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>311, 771 A.2d 1123 (2001), the Court again addressed when a conviction involves or touches upon a public office. The Court concluded that a candidate for the office of mayor of Jersey City, who had previously served in that position, was not disqualified under the forfeiture statute as a result of certain federal offenses he committed when he was out of office. <em>Id. </em>at 316, 323-24, 771 A.2d 1123. The Court explained that section 2(d) of the forfeiture law \u201climit[ed] the scope of the disqualification provision to crimes that are related directly to an individual\u2019s performance in, or circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>flowing from, a specific public office or position held by that individual.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321, 771 A.2d 1123.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\"><em>McCann </em>did not reject or overturn <em>Moore. </em>It distinguished <em>Moore </em>on its facts. <em>Id. </em>at 322, 771 A.2d 1123. In 2007, the Legislature, without commenting on <em>Moore, </em>adopted the language in <em>McCann </em>quoted above and added it to section 2(d). <em>L. </em>2007, c. 49, \u00a7 5. On that record, the majority concludes that the Legislature apparently preferred the analytical framework adopted in <em>McCann, see ante </em>at 234-36, 1 A.3d at 648-49, despite the Legislature\u2019s silence on that point. The majority also does not demonstrate why the two cases, which are not inconsistent, cannot be harmonized.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The majority instead highlights a passage from <em>McCann </em>that sharpens the issue presented. The Court noted that McCann\u2019s behavior \u201creveal[ed] qualities that are relevant to his <em>fitness </em>for\u201d office but nonetheless did not disqualify him because they did not \u201ctouch on\u201d or disclose a \u201cdirect relationship\u201d with the office of Mayor. <em>McCann, supra, </em>167 <em>N.J. </em>at 322, 771 A.2d 1123 (emphasis added). That passage makes clear that it is not proper to confuse or blend the notion of \u201cgeneral fitness\u201d for office with a person\u2019s direct inability to perform the duties of a specific office. A public employee\u2019s misconduct should be considered with the latter concept in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">The Appellate Division\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>383 <em>N.J.Super. </em>663, 893 A.2d 60 (App.Div.2006), is both relevant and instructive on that very point. <em>Rodriguez </em>involved an off-duty police officer who drove through a red light and hit a pedestrian who later died. <em>Id. </em>at 665, 893 A.2d 60. Defendant did not stop; he turned off his lights and drove to a nearby garage close to his residence. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">Although <em>Rodriguez </em>preceded the 2007 amendment to the forfeiture statute, it applied this Court\u2019s decision in <em>McCann </em>and found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-9\">In light of the fact that reporting to accident scenes and attending to the safety of the public are important parts of any police officer\u2019s duties, we think it plain that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>defendant\u2019s off-duty behavior that resulted in his conviction of this offense sufficiently involved and touched upon his position that future disqualification was appropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 669, 893 A.2d 60.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">That backdrop invites the following related questions: Does defendant\u2019s behavior \u201cinvolve! ] or touch! ] on his public office\u201d or \u201crelate!] directly to this] performance\u201d as a sheriffs officer or police officer? That can be analyzed on a number of levels. Certainly, the limited, undisputed facts from defendant\u2019s plea allocution may be considered. Defendant admitted to criminal sexual contact. He acknowledged that he touched a woman\u2019s \u201cintimate parts, including her buttocks\u201d without her consent, for his own sexual gratification.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">In light of defendant\u2019s admissions, how could he, in his role as a sheriffs or police officer, officially respond to allegations of criminal sexual contact, domestic violence, sexual assault, or related accusations? How could he serve and enforce restraining orders in cases involving similar claims? Those acts fall squarely within the kinds of duties sheriffs officers and police officers are regularly called on to perform. Those responsibilities, in other words, relate directly and substantially to defendant\u2019s law enforcement posts.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In light of defendant\u2019s admissions, could anyone\u2014supervi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>sor, victim, or bystander\u2014have confidence in his ability to carry out those tasks?</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">The next analytical step would be to consider facts embraced by the plea which were not expressly part of the allocution. Here, defendant admitted to touching intimate <em>parts </em>of his victim, <em>including </em>her buttocks. The statute nowhere limits a judge\u2019s review to the sanitized phrases used by a defendant to describe his criminal offense of conviction. And there is no reason to bar a fact finder from considering facts like those and others which are embraced by a plea. In this case, that includes, at the very least, consideration of <em>which </em>other \u201cintimate part\u201d or \u201cparts\u201d defendant touched. To the extent there is a material dispute, the judge should conduct an appropriate review of the facts\u2014including the victim\u2019s account and the DNA evidence, as well as contrary evidence defendant may present\u2014and make relevant findings after a hearing. Once that is permitted, as it should be, the case for forfeiture here becomes even more compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">In light of the facts in this matter, it is not necessary to go to the next level and look beyond what is embraced by the plea, or even to decide precisely which of the remaining facts fall on either side of that line. To be sure, if all of the facts in the PSR were sustained, defendant\u2019s permanent disqualification from public employment would be even harder to avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">The trial court considered one disputed fact in deciding that defendant\u2019s offense warranted disqualification, namely, that the victim was incapacitated. Prior to doing so, the court should have conducted a hearing and made relevant findings. The proper remedy, then, should be a remand to the trial court for it to conduct such a hearing and then apply credible facts to the test in the forfeiture statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>The majority skips over that consideration and concludes that defendant\u2019s offense did not touch on his office. The majority, thus, in effect rules as a matter of law that no set of facts would warrant disqualification in this case\u2014neither the facts defendant admitted to, nor any other relevant but disputed facts in the PSR. Those findings do not square with the broad purpose underlying the forfeiture law or the statute\u2019s directive that conduct that touches on or directly relates to one\u2019s performance in public office should lead to debarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Police officers perform a valuable public service, and the vast majority of them do so honorably. To be effective, they must not only enforce but also obey the law. \u201cThat duty is essential to the preservation of a free society.\u201d <em>State v. Stevens, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>59, 65, 495 A.2d 910 (Law Div.1984). Because defendant\u2019s specific behavior in this case failed to live up to that responsibility, he relinquished both of his law enforcement posts. In light of the facts about his offense, the forfeiture statute disqualifies him from other public positions as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">For the reasons outlined above, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\"><em>For </em>affirmance\u2014Justices LONG, LaVECCHIA and WALLACE\u20143.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\"><em>For </em>reversal\u2014Chief Justice RABNER and Justice HOENS\u20142.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\"><em>Not </em>Participating\u2014Justices ALBIN and RIVERA-SOTO.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b271-9\"> A judge's exercise of discretion at sentencing must of course comport with the principles of <em>Blakely v. </em>Washington, 542 <em>U.S. </em>296, 124 <em>S.Ct. </em>2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), <em>Natale, </em>and their progeny.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b275-9\"> Under the statute, police and sheriffs officers would inevitably be disqualified in more situations than some other public employees <em>because </em>of the requirements of those offices. A public works employee who maintains public grounds, or an information technology officer at a sheriff's department, would likely not be disqualified if convicted of the same offense as defendant's. That said, disqualification would not be automatic for police officers in all cases, as the majority mistakenly predicts. <em>See ante </em>at 239 n. 8, 1 A.3d at 651 n. 8. Conviction of a federal offense unrelated to an officer's responsibilities to enforce state and local laws, for example, would not necessarily lead to disqualification. Nor would every speeding ticket automatically lead to disqualification. <em>See ibid. </em>An officer convicted of a single instance of exceeding the speed limit, with no proof that he or she intended to violate the law, should be looked at differently than someone with a dozen speeding convictions, accumulated in only a few <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>years, where there is ample proof of intent. In other words, misconduct has to be carefully measured, in each case, against the standard set forth in the forfeiture statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
