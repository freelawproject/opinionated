(c); count one); assault with a semiautomatic firearm (\u00a7 245, subd. (b); count two); shooting at an inhabited dwelling (\u00a7 246; count three); corporal injury to a cohabitant (\u00a7 273.5, subd. (a); count four); child abuse (\u00a7 273a, subd. (a); counts five and six); preventing or dissuading a witness from reporting a crime (\u00a7 136.1, subd. (b)(1); count seven); evading an officer (Veh. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number>Code, \u00a7 2800.2, subd. (a); count eight) and negligent discharge of a firearm (Pen. Code, \u00a7 246.3, subd. (a); count nine).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> With respect to counts one, two, and six, it was further alleged that appellant personally used and/or discharged a firearm within the meaning of sections 12022.5, and/or 12022.53, subdivisions (b) and (c), causing the offenses to become serious felonies under sections 667.5, subdivision (c), and 1192.7, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-4\">B. <em>Evidence at Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-5\">Appellant had been living with Liseth Acosta for 10 years. They had two children. The family moved to Palmdale in 2009, where they lived with Acosta\u2019s mother. After losing his job due to an injury some years earlier, appellant had been unable to find stable employment, which caused him to be depressed and led the couple to quarrel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1248-6\">On January 20, 2010, Acosta walked into the master bedroom, where appellant and the two children were lying on the bed watching television. Appellant had been drinking. Acosta went into the closet, appellant followed, and the two argued about some revealing underwear Acosta had purchased. Appellant \u201chead-butted\u201d Acosta, injuring the area around her eye.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1248-7\">Acosta told appellant to leave, but he refused. Using a cordless phone, Acosta called the sheriff s department. She told the operator that appellant had \u201cbutted [her] in the head\u201d and refused to leave.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The operator promised to send a deputy and told her to stay on the line. Appellant grabbed the phone from Acosta, took the battery out and put the phone in the closet. He then walked through the laundry room, into the garage, and out toward his car in the driveway. Acosta followed and told appellant to give her the house keys. Appellant ignored her, while appearing to look for something in his car. After a brief period, Acosta walked back into the house through the laundry room, closing and locking the door behind her. As she left the laundry room, she heard a gunshot and a bullet passed through the door she had just closed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>Acosta called the children and her mother into the kitchen and told them to get down on the floor, while she called 911 using her cell phone.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> She reminded the operator she had called earlier and stated \u201che has a gun now\u201d and was \u201cshooting something.\u201d She said, \u201c[PJlease hurry up, he\u2019s coming . . . I think he\u2019s trying to come through the back now. I think he\u2019s drinking. . . .\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s trying to come back inside the house.\u201d While she was on the line with the operator, appellant called and told her to call and tell the deputies that \u201ceverything is fine.\u201d She told him to turn himself in because she was not going to lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-5\">Shortly thereafter, Deputy Christopher Conley arrived and interviewed Acosta. Acosta said appellant \u201chead-butted\u201d her, indicating \u201cthat it was very intentional.\u201d The deputy observed redness and swelling near Acosta\u2019s right eye.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-6\">J.G., a teenager who lived across the street, heard a loud noise and looked out his bedroom window. He saw appellant standing in the driveway near the garage. As J.G. was watching, appellant shot into the garage. Appellant then walked back and forth nervously, going into and out of the garage and around the side of the house. J.G. saw a woman peer out of a window of the house. Appellant fired a shot toward the sky. After moving around nervously for a bit longer, getting into and out of his car and starting and turning off the engine, appellant drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-7\">Because Acosta had provided a description of appellant\u2019s car during the 911 call, deputies were able to locate and identify him driving on a nearby highway. Appellant ignored instructions to pull over and was arrested in Anaheim after a chase lasting more than an hour at speeds of up to 90 miles per hour.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1249-8\">Deputies found two expended cartridges in the driveway. The cartridges were from a .380 automatic handgun. When arrested, appellant had gunshot residue on his hands. Deputies found no gun in the car, but the passenger window, which had been intact when the chase started, was broken from the inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-9\">Appellant did not testify and presented no evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>C. <em>Verdict and Sentencing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1250-4\">The jury found appellant not guilty of attempted murder (count one). It found him guilty of assault with a semiautomatic firearm (count two), shooting at an inhabited dwelling (count three), witness intimidation (count seven), evading an officer (count eight), and negligent discharge of a firearm (count nine). With respect to counts four (corporal injury to a cohabitant), five and six (child endangerment), the jury found appellant guilty of the lesser included offenses of battery against a child\u2019s parent (\u00a7 243, subd. (e)(1)) and willful cruelty to a child (\u00a7 273a, subd. (b)). With respect to count two, the jury found true that appellant personally used a firearm within the meaning of section 12022.5, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-5\">The court sentenced appellant to a term of 21 years in state prison. The sentence consisted of 19 years on count two (the upper term of nine years, plus 10 years for the \u00a7 12022.5, subd. (a) firearm enhancement), a concurrent five-year term on count three, a concurrent one-year term on count four, concurrent six-month terms on counts five and six, a consecutive two-year term on count seven, and concurrent two-year terms on counts eight and nine. Appellant received 538 days of presentence custody credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-7\">A. <em>Assault: Sufficiency of the Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1250-8\">Appellant contends there was insufficient evidence to show he had the necessary mental state to commit assault because the prosecution presented no evidence that he had actual knowledge that a bullet shot at a door would penetrate it and threaten a person standing on the other side. Appellant misperceives the prosecution\u2019s burden, which was met when substantial evidence established that he knowingly committed acts which resulted in physical force being applied toward the victim which a reasonable person would know was likely to result in injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-9\">Section 240, enacted in 1872, defines assault as \u201can unlawful attempt, coupled with a present ability, to commit a violent injury on the person of another.\u201d The necessary mens rea to support assault was set forth in <em>People v. Williams </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 779, 787-788 [111 Cal.Rptr.2d 114, 29 P.3d 197]: \u201cBased on the 1872 definition of attempt, a defendant is only guilty of assault if he intends to commit an act \u2018which would be indictable [as a battery], if done, either from its own character or that of its natural and probable consequences.\u2019 [Citation.] Logically, a defendant cannot have such an intent unless he actually knows those facts sufficient to establish that his act by its nature will probably and directly result in physical force being applied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>another, i.e., a battery. [Citation.] In other words, a defendant guilty of assault must be aware of the facts that would lead a reasonable person to realize that a battery would directly, naturally and probably result from his conduct. He may not be convicted based on facts he did not know but should have known. He, however, need not be subjectively aware of the risk that a battery might occur.\u201d (Quoting 1 Bouvier\u2019s Law Dict. (1872) p. 166.) With respect to its final point, the court further stated: \u201c[A] defendant who honestly believes that his act was not likely to result in a battery is still guilty of assault if a reasonable person, viewing the facts known to defendant, would find that the act would directly, naturally and probably result in a battery.\u201d <em>(People v. Williams, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 788, fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">That appellant\u2019s knowingly undertaken acts meet the <em>Williams </em>standard is made clear by the holding in <em>People </em>v. <em>Wyatt </em>(2010) 48 Cal.4th 776 [108 Cal.Rptr.3d 259, 229 P.3d 156]. There, the defendant\u2019s 14-month-old son died of internal injuries after a bout of \u201cplay-fighting\u201d with the defendant, who claimed to have had no actual knowledge he was wrestling far too hard with his son. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 783, 785.) After being found guilty of assault on a child causing death under section 273ab, the defendant raised a contention similar to appellant\u2019s\u2014that the evidence was insufficient to prove the requisite mens rea for assault because he was unaware that the force he was using could seriously injure the victim. The court explained that under <em>Williams, </em>\u201ca defendant may be guilty of an assault... if he acts with awareness of facts that would lead a reasonable person to realize that great bodily injury would directly, naturally, and probably result from his act. [Citation.] The defendant, however, need not know or be subjectively aware that his act is capable of causing great bodily injury. [Citation.] This means the requisite mens rea may be found even when the defendant honestly believes his act is not likely to result in such injury.\u201d <em>(People v. Wyatt, supra, </em>48 Cal.4th at p. 781.) Because the defendant \u201cknew he was striking his young son with his fist, forearm, knee, and elbow, and that he used an amount of force a reasonable person would realize was likely to result in great bodily injury,\u201d the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 779.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">Here, substantial evidence established that after quarreling with Acosta and being told to leave, appellant went to his car, removed a loaded gun\u2014a .380 according to ballistics\u2014and fired a bullet at the door through which Acosta had just walked. This met the prosecution\u2019s burden to establish that appellant \u201cknew . . . that he used an amount of force a reasonable person would realize was likely to result in great bodily injury\u201d <em>(People v. Wyatt, supra, </em>48 Cal.4th at p. 779) or that he \u201cact[ed] with awareness of facts that would lead a reasonable person to realize that great bodily injury would directly, naturally, and probably result from his act\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 781). The jury was correctly instructed that in order to prove the assault, the evidence must establish, among other things, that \u201c[a] person willfully committed an act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>which by its nature would probably and directly result in the application of physical force on another person\u201d and that \u201c[t]he person committing the act was aware of facts that would lead a reasonable person to realize that as a direct, natural and probable result of this act that physical force would be applied to another person.\u201d (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Albritton </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 647, 658 [79 Cal.Rptr.2d 169] [whether force applied by defendant was objectively likely to result in great bodily injury was question of fact for jury].) The jury\u2019s conclusion that a reasonable person would understand that the closed laundry room door would pose no serious barrier to a bullet fired from a position just outside the garage was a reasonable one.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">Appellant contends that in the absence of a showing that he possessed some expertise in the use of firearms, the jury could not infer he had the requisite intent. We disagree. It requires neither special expertise nor even personal familiarity with firearms to know that guns propel bullets at great speed and force, often penetrating walls and other architectural barriers. There was no evidence defendant thought the gun was a toy or was otherwise incapable of expelling real bullets. Acosta\u2019s testimony that to her knowledge defendant had never shot a weapon was probative only of her own ignorance, as she admitted being unaware appellant even possessed a gun. Nor did appellant\u2019s own behavior suggest he was \u201csurprised\u201d to see the bullet penetrate the door. After shooting through the door, he fired off another round, this time into the air. In short, the prosecution was not required to demonstrate appellant\u2019s expertise with firearms to meet its burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">In his reply brief, appellant contends that allowing the jury to determine whether injury was likely to result from his actions was akin to permitting a conviction based on recklessness or negligence. Again, we disagree. The necessary criminal intent was established by the actions deliberately undertaken by appellant when he applied physical force directed at Acosta\u2014retrieving the gun, aiming it and firing it at the door, knowing Acosta had just gone through it. The crime of assault requires that a defendant commit an act the \u201c \u2018natural and probable consequence[]\u2019 \u201d of which would be a battery. <em>(People v. Williams, supra, </em>26 Cal.4th at p. 787, italics omitted.) It does not require proof that a battery has resulted or will inevitably result. (See <em>People v. Chance </em>(2008) 44 Cal.4th 1164, 1167-1168 [81 Cal.Rptr.3d 723, 189 P.3d 971] [\u201c \u2018present ability\u2019. \u201d element of assault is satisfied \u201cwhen \u2018a defendant has attained the means and location to strike immediately\u2019 ... an assault may be committed even if the defendant is several steps away from actually inflicting injury, or if the victim is in a protected position so that injury would not be \u2018immediate,\u2019 in the strictest sense of that term\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Aguilar </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 1023, 1028 [68 Cal.Rptr.2d 655, 945 P.2d 1204] [\u201cOne may commit an assault without making actual physical contact with the person of the victim . . . .\u201d].) It may be established even where the victim took effective steps to avoid or prevent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>injury. <em>(People v. Valdez </em>(1985) 175 Cal.App.3d 103, 112-113 [220 Cal.Rptr. 538] [assault conviction upheld where defendant fired at person protected by bulletproof glass].) As the Supreme Court explained in <em>Williams, </em>\u201cmere recklessness or criminal negligence is . . . not enough [to support an assault conviction],\u201d but \u201c \u2018recklessness\u2019 \u201d in this sense referred to \u201ccriminal negligence\u201d rather than \u201cappreciation of the risk of harm.\u201d <em>(People v. Williams, </em>at p. 788 &amp; fn. 4.) Thus, even if appellant subjectively failed to appreciate the risk of harm likely to occur from his conduct, his actions supported the intent element of the crime. In short, on the evidence before it, the jury was entitled to conclude that appellant, who retrieved a loaded semiautomatic weapon and shot it at the door through which Acosta had just passed, had all the facts necessary to lead a reasonable person to understand that a battery would \u201cdirectly, naturally and probably\u201d result from his conduct. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 788.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">B. <em>Constitutionality of Section 136.1, Subdivision (b)(1)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-6\">Section 136.1, subdivision (b)(1) targets prearrest efforts to prevent a crime from being reported to the authorities. <em>(People v. Fernandez </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 943, 950 [131 Cal.Rptr.2d 358].) It provides in relevant part: \u201c(b) Except as provided in subdivision (c) [targeting more serious efforts to prevent or dissuade], every person who attempts to prevent or dissuade another person who has been the victim of a crime or who is witness to a crime from doing any of the following is guilty of a public offense and shall be punished by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year or in the state prison: [(J[] (1) Making any report of that victimization to any peace officer or state or local law enforcement officer or probation or parole or correctional officer or prosecuting agency or to any judge.\u201d (\u00a7 136.1, subd. (b)(1).) To prove a violation of section 136.1, subdivision (b)(1), the prosecution must show \u201c(1) the defendant has attempted to prevent or dissuade a person (2) who is a victim or witness to a crime (3) from making [a] report ... to any peace officer or other designated officials.\u201d <em>(People v. Upsher </em>(2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1311, 1320 [66 Cal.Rptr.3d 481].) The prosecution must also establish that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s acts or statements [were] intended to affect or influence a potential witness\u2019s or victim\u2019s testimony or acts.\u201d <em>(People v. McDaniel </em>(1994) 22 Cal.App.4th 278, 284 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 306].) In other words, \u201csection 136.1 is a specific intent crime.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-7\">Appellant contends that section 136.1, subdivision (b)(1) violates the state and federal constitutions by impermissibly inhibiting free speech. He also suggests the statute is \u201cfatally uncertain\u201d or vague.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For the reasons discussed below, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>\u201cThe First Amendment, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that \u2018Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Virginia v. Black </em>(2003) 538 U.S. 343, 358 [155 L.Ed.2d 535, 123 S.Ct. 1536]; see <em>People v. Lowery </em>(2011) 52 Cal.4th 419, 423 [128 Cal.Rptr.3d 648, 257 P.3d 72].)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cThe protections afforded by the First Amendment, however, are not absolute,\u201d and the United States Supreme Court has \u201clong recognized that the government may regulate certain categories of expression consistent with the Constitution.\u201d <em>(Virginia v. Black, supra, </em>at p. 358.) \u201cThroughout its history [the] Court has consistently recognized at least two ways in which constitutionally protected freedom of speech is narrower than an unlimited license to talk. On the one hand, certain forms of speech, or speech in certain contexts, has been considered outside the scope of constitutional protection. [Citations.] On the other hand, general regulatory statutes, not intended to control the content of speech but incidentally limiting its unfettered exercise, have not been regarded as the type of law the First or Fourteenth Amendment forbade Congress or the States to pass, when they have been found justified by subordinating valid governmental interests, a prerequisite to constitutionality which has necessarily involved a weighing of the governmental interest involved.\u201d <em>(Konigsberg v. State Bar </em>(1961) 366 U.S. 36, 49-51 [6 L.Ed.2d 105, 81 S.Ct. 997], fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-5\">A defendant\u2019s constitutional challenge to a penal statute may be based on the contention that the law is unconstitutional as applied to him, or he may seek to have it found facially invalid. (See <em>People v. Rodriguez </em>(1998) 66 Cal.App.4th 157, 167 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 676] [if statute found unconstitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>\u201c \u2018 \u201cas applied,\u201d \u2019 \u201d future application in a similar context is precluded, whereas successful facial challenge renders it \u201c \u2018utterly inoperative\u2019 \u201d].)  To the extent appellant\u2019s conduct in the instant matter is at issue, there is no question that California has a strong governmental interest in supporting and protecting citizens who wish to report violations of its criminal laws.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u201cThis fundamental principle is embodied in Penal Code section 136.1, which declares that it is a misdemeanor to dissuade or attempt to dissuade any victim of crime from reporting the crime to the police.\u201d <em>(Barela v. Superior Court </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 244, 252 [178 Cal.Rptr. 618, 636 P.2d 582].) \u201c \u2018It is for the best interests of society that those who offend against the laws shall be promptly punished, and that any citizen who has good reason to believe that the law has been violated shall have the right to cause the arrest of the offender.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting <em>Ball </em>v. <em>Rawles </em>(1892) 93 Cal. 222, 228 [28 P. 937].) Section 136.1, subdivision (b) protects and supports persons seeking to report crimes, and appellant\u2019s conduct was clearly within the category of behavior legitimately proscribed by the statute. The evidence established that he grabbed the phone from Acosta\u2019s hand while she was talking to the sheriff\u2019s department, hung it up, removed the batteries, and separated the phone from the batteries. After firing a bullet through the laundry room door in the direction where he had last seen Acosta, he called her on her cell and told her to tell the police that \u201ceverything is fine.\u201d On these facts, there can be no doubt that appellant\u2019s intent was to do precisely what the law legitimately prohibits: prevent and dissuade Acosta from reporting appellant\u2019s crimes to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>\u201cThe concept of \u2018substantial overbreadth\u2019 is not readily reduced to an exact definition.\u201d <em>(City Council v. Taxpayers for Vincent, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 800.) \u201cWhere the statute in question is narrowly drawn to protect a legitimate state interest, and proscribes conduct and not purely speech,\u201d the overbreadth of the statute must be \u201c \u2018judged in relation to the statute\u2019s plainly legitimate sweep.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hernandez </em>(1991) 231 Cal.App.3d 1376, 1381 [283 Cal.Rptr. 81], quoting <em>Broadrick v. Oklahoma </em>(1973) 413 U.S. 601, 615 [37 L.Ed.2d 830, 93 S.Ct. 2908].) Thus, \u201c[t]he first step in overbreadth analysis is to construe the challenged statute; it is impossible to determine whether a statute reaches too far without first knowing what the statute covers.\u201d <em>(U.S. v. Williams, supra, </em>553 U.S. at p. 293.) Section 136.1, subdivision (b) does not single out or target speech, but proscribes any conduct geared toward impeding a person from reporting a crime. Hiding or disabling the phone, as appellant did here, or otherwise blocking the victim\u2019s or witness\u2019s access to a means of communication are validly criminalized by the statute and have no relation whatsoever to speech. Verbal dissuasion may also support a conviction, but only a specific type of dissuasion, viz., words spoken with the specific intent of preventing or impeding that person from contacting authorities to report a crime. Accordingly, the statute\u2019s \u201cplainly legitimate sweep\u201d is extensive. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hernandez, supra, </em>231 Cal.App.3d at p. 1381.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>We turn now to appellant\u2019s claim that the statute is facially over-broad.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court has warned that in considering a facial challenge to a statute, \u201cit is necessary to proceed with caution and restraint,\u201d as invalidation may result in improper interference with a state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>legitimate power to regulate conduct. <em>(Erznoznik v.

Accordingly, to support a facial challenge on overbreadth grounds, \u201cthere must be a realistic danger that the statute itself will significantly compromise recognized First Amendment protections of parties not before the Court...\u201d <em>(City Council v. Taxpayers for Vincent, supra, </em>466 U.S. at p. 801.) \u201c[T]he mere fact that one can conceive of some impermissible applications of a statute is not sufficient to render it susceptible to an overbreadth challenge.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 800; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Toledo (2001) 26 </em>Cal.4th 221, 234-235 [109 Cal.Rptr.2d 315, 26 P.3d 1051] [\u201cA statute may not be found constitutionally invalid on overbreadth grounds simply because it is possible to conceive of one or a few impermissible applications; such invalidity occurs only if the provision inhibits a substantial amount of protected speech.

As stated above, section 136.1, subdivision (b)(1), has been limited in its application to persons who intentionally \u201cprevent[] or dissuade[]\u201d a victim or witness from reporting a crime. (See <em>People v. McDaniel, supra, </em>22 Cal.App.4th at p. 284 [\u201cUnless the defendant\u2019s acts or statements are intended to affect or influence a potential witness\u2019s or victim\u2019s testimony or acts, no crime has been committed under this section.\u201d].) This focus on the mental state of the perpetrator and his or her intent to affect or influence a potential witness\u2019s or victim\u2019s report limits the statute\u2019s reach by distinguishing culpable conduct from innocent conversation and restrains use of its provisions to inhibit protected speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">Courts in other states have similarly construed comparable statutes. In <em>New Jersey v. Crescenzi </em>(App.Div. 1988) 224 NJ. Super. 142 [539 A.2d 1250], the court rejected a First Amendment overbreadth argument to a statute that prohibited \u201c \u2018knowingly attempting] to induce or otherwise cause a witness or informant to . . . [withhold any testimony, information, document or thing.\u2019 \u201d (539 A.2d at p. 1252, quoting N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2C:28-5(a).) The jury was expressly charged that before the defendant could be found guilty, the prosecution was required to prove he \u201c \u2018knowingly attempted to induce or otherwise cause a witness or informant to withhold any testimony, information[,] document or thing from the investigating body,\u2019 and also that the purpose of his comments ... at the time was to influence behavior of a witness or the withholding of information by an informant.\u201d (539 A.2d at p. 1252, italics omitted.) The court found the statute was not overbroad: \u201c[T]he statute furthers the important governmental interest of preventing intimidation of, and interference with, potential witnesses or informers in criminal matters and easily meets the test of weighing the importance of this exercise of speech against the gravity and probability of harm therefrom. [Citation.] When the public interest in discovering the truth in official proceedings is balanced against a party\u2019s right to speak to a particular witness with the intent of tampering, that party\u2019s right is \u2018miniscule.\u2019 \u201d <em>(New Jersey </em>v. <em>Crescenzi, supra, </em>539 A.2d at pp. 1252, 1253, italics omitted; see <em>Connecticut v.

He contends that the law would preclude an attorney from \u201cadvising a client to file a civil lawsuit for damages in response to a crime\u201d; prohibit a store manager from \u201cdirect[ing] employees to call the parents of first-time shoplifters under the age of 18 instead of reporting such incidents to the police\u201d; and prevent citizens from \u201cexpress [ing] their opinion about which crimes warrant government intervention, and which do not,\u201d \u201cattempting] to prevent a friend from reporting a small theft to the police by expressing the opinion that it will be more trouble and paperwork than it\u2019s worth,\u201d or \u201csuggesting that the problem [of criminal activity] be handled privately with an apology, with amends being made, or some other way.\u201d A party does not establish facial unconstitutionality by \u201csummoning] forth an endless stream of fanciful hypotheticals.\u201d <em>(United States v. Williams, supra, </em>553 U.S. at p. 301.) In <em>U.S. v. Chappell </em>(4th Cir. 2012) 691 F.3d 388, 393, the court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that a statute prohibiting the impersonation of officers was overbroad simply because it could conceivably be applied to \u201ccostumed party-goers, children, and actors\u201d: \u201cWe decline to facially invalidate [the statute] just because [the defendant] can conceive of far-fetched applications involving innocent behavior.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>There is no reason to believe persons engaged in conduct of the type appellant posits are in substantial danger of prosecution under the statute. The statute prohibits statements specifically intended to induce a witness or victim to withhold evidence of a crime from law enforcement officials. Ordinary citizens discussing the criminal justice system and the pros and cons of becoming involved in a police investigation would not run afoul of the law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>Appellant alternatively suggests that the provision is \u201cfatally uncertain\u201d and unconstitutionally vague. \u201cVague laws offend several important values. First, because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing fair warning. Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them. A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an <em>ad hoc </em>and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application. Third, but related, where a vague statute \u2018abut[s] upon sensitive areas of basic First Amendment freedoms,\u2019 it \u2018operates to inhibit the exercise of [those] freedoms.\u2019 Uncertain meanings inevitably lead citizens to \u2018 \u201csteer far wider of the unlawful zone\u201d . . . than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas were clearly marked.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Grayned v. City of Rockford </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 104, 108-109 [33 L.Ed.2d 222, 92 S.Ct. 2294], fns. omitted.) \u201cVagueness doctrine is an outgrowth ... of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. A conviction fails to comport with due process if the statute under which it is obtained fails to provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or is so standard-less that it authorizes or encourages seriously discriminatory enforcement.\u201d <em>(United States v. Williams, supra, </em>553 U.S. at p. 304.) \u201cAlthough ordinarily \u2018[a] plaintiff who engages in some conduct that is clearly proscribed cannot complain of the vagueness of the law as applied to the conduct of others,\u2019 \u201d the Supreme Court has \u201crelaxed that requirement in the First Amendment context, permitting [parties] to argue that a statute is overbroad because it is unclear whether it regulates a substantial amount of protected speech.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1259-5\">Although appellant cites a number of authorities for the general proposition that vague penal statutes are unconstitutional, he fails to specify in what way section 136.1, subdivision (b) is vague or uncertain. The words used in the statute are clear and give notice to members of the public that attempting to prevent or dissuade a person from contacting authorities to report a crime is itself a crime. On its face, section 136.1 appears geared toward situations similar to the present one, where a defendant abuses a spouse or other cohabitant and thereafter obstructs or otherwise attempts to prevent the victim from seeking help from authorities. We see no basis for a finding that the statute is \u201cfatally uncertain\u201d or unconstitutionally vague.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1260-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1354\">*1354</page-number>C.-F<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1260-4\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1260-5\">The judgment is modified to reflect 662 days of presentence custody credit, consisting of 576 days of actual credit and 86 days of good time/work time credit.

Here, the charge in count seven was based on two separate events\u2014appellant\u2019s taking the cordless phone from Acosta and removing the battery, and his later call to Acosta\u2014and the jury was instructed it could find appellant guilty if it found either to have occurred. The prosecutor stated in closing argument: \u201c[T]here are two ways in which [appellant] committed witness intimidation. The first is when he grabbed the phone from [Acosta] as she was on the phone with [the sheriff\u2019s department], and the second is when she\u2019s on the phone with 911, after he\u2019s already left, . . . and he tells her to call the officers and tell them that everything\u2019s okay.\u201d The former event involved physical actions, not words. Had the prosecutor been aware of a potential First Amendment objection, she could have altered her strategy and urged the jury to convict based on appellant\u2019s conduct alone and almost certainly would have obtained the same result. Notwithstanding this rule of forfeiture, courts generally consider constitutional challenges to penal statutes for the first time on appeal where, as here, the arguments are legal, based on undisputed evidence, and center on review of abstract and generalized legal concepts.
