Code, \u00a7 273.5, subd (a)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court violated his state and federal constitutional rights to due process, a fair trial, and effective assistance of counsel by excluding him from the courtroom without an \u201caudio or video feed\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> allowing him to hear a trial witness\u2019s testimony. In the published portion of this opinion, we hold that under the circumstances, the trial court did not err by excluding defendant without an audio or video feed from a portion of the trial. In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we hold that the trial court did not err in other mlings challenged by defendant. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-8\">BACKGROUND<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">A. <em>Denial of Defendant\u2019s Motion to Continue Trial*</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-11\">B. <em>Defendant\u2019s Removal from the Courtroom Without an Audio or Video Feed</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-12\">Defendant contends that the trial court violated his state and federal constitutional rights to a fair trial, due process, and effective assistance of counsel by not providing him with an audio or video feed to hear or observe the victim\u2019s testimony after the trial court excluded defendant from the courtroom. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-13\">Defendant was charged with striking Christian Cornejo (Cornejo), his former girlfriend and mother of his child. She reported this incident, but later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>recanted. Cornejo testified at the preliminary hearing that she was struck by others and had previously lied when she reported she was hit by defendant. Cornejo initially failed to appear at trial and could not be found to be served with a subpoena. After her preliminary hearing testimony was read to the jury, she appeared for the trial and testified as a witness. She reiterated that people other than defendant had assaulted her and that she had lied on prior occasions. Cornejo\u2019s telephone calls with defendant discussing the case had been recorded, and the prosecutor introduced into evidence a portion of the recording. Because the recordings of those jail conversations were provided to defense counsel shortly before trial, defendant sought a continuance of the trial so that the recordings could be transcribed. The trial court denied the continuance, and in the unpublished portion of this opinion, we determined that the denial did not constitute prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">1. <em>Standards of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">\u201cAn appellate court applies the independent or de novo standard of review to a trial court\u2019s exclusion of a criminal defendant from trial, either in whole or in part, insofar as the trial court\u2019s decision entails a measurement of the facts against the law.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Waidla </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 690, 741 [94 Cal.Rptr.2d 396, 996 P.2d 46].) \u201cWe review a ruling on a mistrial motion for an abuse of discretion\u201d <em>(People v. Lewis </em>(2008) 43 Cal.4th 415, 501 [75 Cal.Rptr.3d 588, 181 P.3d 947]), and we independently review orders denying a motion for new trial to determine if prejudicial trial error occurred <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ault </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 1250, 1261 [17 Cal.Rptr.3d 302, 95 P.3d 523]).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">2. <em>Applicable Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">\u201cA criminal defendant, broadly stated, has a right to be personally present at trial under various provisions of law, including the confrontation clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applied to the states through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment itself; section 15 of article I of the California Constitution; and sections 977 and 1043 of the Penal Code.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Waidla, supra, </em>22 Cal.4th at p. 741.) But a defendant may be removed from the courtroom during trial in \u201c[a]ny case in which the defendant, after he has been warned by the judge that he will be removed if he continues his disruptive behavior, nevertheless insists on conducting himself in a manner so disorderly, disruptive, and disrespectful of the court that the trial cannot be carried on with him in the courtroom.\u201d (\u00a7 1043, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>subd. (b)(1); see <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(1970) 397 U.S. 337, 343 [25 L.Ed.2d 353, 90 S.Ct. 1057]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Welch </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 701, 774 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 203, 976 P.2d 754].)</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">3. <em>Background Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">When Cornejo was called to testify at trial, defendant said in open court, \u201cThey arresting my wife because she won\u2019t lie against me.\u201d The trial court told defendant, \u201cSir, you need to let your lawyer do your talking for you.\u201d Defendant replied, \u201cI want the jurors to know what you all doing.\u201d The trial court then directed the jurors to go to the jury deliberation room, and the trial court admonished defendant not to speak out loud during the course of the proceedings unless he was testifying. The following exchange then occurred: \u201c[Defendant:] You all trying to f-k me over. There\u2019s nothing else to it. [f] [Trial court:] Your day is here today in court. This is your trial, sir. [f] [Defendant:] I have the right to speak. [][] [Trial court:] Speaking out in front of the jury is not going to help your cause, [f] [Defendant:] Nothing going to help me because y\u2019all going to f\u2014k me.\u201d The trial court ordered defendant to be removed from the courtroom. Defendant stated, \u201cI love you, Christian,\u201d and Cornejo replied, \u201cI love you. Calm down, man.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">The trial court granted defense counsel\u2019s request for time to calm defendant. After a recess, the trial court allowed defendant back in the courtroom, received assurances from defendant and his counsel that defendant would act appropriately and would not engage in any further outbursts, and instructed the jury to disregard defendant\u2019s outburst. Cornejo then resumed testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">Shortly thereafter, during a sidebar conference between counsel and the trial court, the court clerk told the trial court that defendant was talking to Cornejo, who was on the witness stand. The trial court directed the jurors to leave the courtroom and ordered defendant removed from the courtroom \u201cbased upon statements of misconduct by the deputy [sheriff] and the [court] clerk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">On the record, the bailiff, a sheriff\u2019s deputy, advised the trial court that defendant started to talk to Cornejo; he told defendant to stop talking; and Cornejo attempted to calm defendant. Defendant then commented to Cornejo about actor Mel Gibson and \u201cother movie stars\u2019 sentences. How they were treated in trial.\u201d The bailiff told defendant to stop talking and put his hand on defendant\u2019s shoulder. The bailiff felt defendant starting to \u201ctense up,\u201d so the bailiff handcuffed defendant because the bailiff was concerned defendant \u201cwas going to stand up or do something other than just be verbal with the witness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>Also on the record, a sergeant who was in the courtroom told the trial court that defendant looked at the jury and said, \u201cThey\u2019re trying to f\u2014k me.\u201d A law clerk who was in the courtroom said that defendant told the jury, \u201cThey\u2019re trying to put me away for 17 years.\u201d It was reported that a law clerk said that she had heard defendant say something to the effect of \u201cStay hostile, baby,\u201d to which Cornejo responded, \u201cI know what they\u2019re trying to do.\u201d The trial court made findings, pursuant to section 1043, subdivision (b)(1) that defendant was continually disruptive, had directly ignored the trial court\u2019s warnings, would continue to be disruptive, and there was no less drastic alternative to having defendant removed. The trial court stated, \u201cThe court orders [defendant\u2019s] removal, at least for this afternoon, at this point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">The jurors were brought back into the courtroom, and the trial court instructed the jury to disregard defendant\u2019s outburst. Defendant\u2019s counsel stated that because she was not able to transcribe the audio recordings of defendant\u2019s jail calls, she needed to rely on defendant to \u201cdo a proper presentation of the defense in this matter, and to properly cross-examine . . . Cornejo.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel stated that because defendant had been excluded from the courtroom, \u201cthe court is going to have to do either audio, or I would ask for video . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">The trial court stated that audio or video was not available, but added, \u201cI\u2019ll absolutely give you the opportunity to meet and confer with him as regularly as you need to.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel stated, \u201cI believe that the defendant has a right to at least listen or hear the proceedings and the testimony against him. H] And so I think that the court is required to, at the minimum, have the proceedings piped in . . . .\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel also stated, \u201cI would just only ask that the court permit audio or video for [defendant]. ... I understand [section] 1043 says if they\u2019re disruptive, they can be precluded from the courtroom.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel argued defendant had a due process right to \u201chelp [her] . . . present a defense.\u201d The trial court stated, \u201cIf I had the ability to pipe it in, I would. I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t have the ability to do it. This building was built in the 1960\u2019s. We don\u2019t have external jacks that you can just plug a speaker into a wall. [][] It\u2019s my understanding that we don\u2019t have the facilities available. I did call, and I left a message with . . . one of our managers down in our facilities division, [f] . . . [][] I just spoke to . . . our director of facilities. She\u2019s indicated that we do not have the resources to be able to do that. [][] She did offer to contact the internal services to determine whether they have the facilities to be able to do it. [f] However, their facilities are not available today, and they\u2019re closed tomorrow, and Monday is a holiday. So probably the earliest would be Tuesday, if they can do it. And I don\u2019t know that they can. But if they could, it would be Tuesday.\u201d Cornejo resumed her testimony that day without defendant being present in the courtroom. Cornejo was ordered to remain \u201con call\u201d to testify at the request of either defendant or the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"853\">*853</page-number>The next day, defendant was allowed back in the courtroom and moved for a mistrial because, inter alia, he had not been permitted to hear Cornejo\u2019s testimony. Defendant\u2019s counsel stated, \u201cI\u2019m not arguing that [defendant] shouldn\u2019t have been excluded from the courtroom. That\u2019s not my argument, [ft] My argument is that he needed to be present for the testimony, whether it be audio or visual, in some type of manner in which he could have listened to the trial.\u201d The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for mistrial, stating that Cornejo was still on call and that defendant could have her come back and testify further.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">At the conclusion of the trial testimony, defendant filed a motion for new trial contending that although there was no statute, \u201cLos Angeles County Court Rule[,] or Los Angeles Court directive regarding audio/video feeds being used when a defendant is removed from the courtroom,\u201d the trial court\u2019s denial of his request for an audio or video feed violated defendant\u2019s due process rights and his rights under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s motion for new trial was also based on the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s request for a one-day continuance so defendant\u2019s counsel and the trial court could \u201ctry to obtain the audio equipment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">The following exchange occurred at the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion for new trial: \u201c[Defendant\u2019s counsel:] The issue here really, Your Honor, is not whether the court could exclude [defendant]. [Section] 1043 basically indicates that [the] court does have a power to do that .... [ft] ... [ft] The question becomes once defendant is excluded, does the court\u2014is there any additional requirement that the court has to do under due process and fundamental fairness to make sure that the defendant at least gets to hear or be able to communicate with his attorney, and to be able to at least tell his attorney or advise as to the testimony that\u2019s being presented, [ft] I think the key here, Your Honor, is.whether or not the court had to pipe in either an audio or video of the proceedings, [ft] Now, there is no actual statute or court rule that actually applies to that, [ft] ... [ft] Basically, we\u2019re saying if you can pipe it in, pipe it in. And I think the question here is we didn\u2019t have the equipment here present in the courthouse, [ft] However, defense counsel asked for just a short continuance just for the afternoon session so we could acquire that equipment, [ft] ... I believe we got the equipment, or was available the next day. [ft] [Trial court:] It was installed the next day. But at the time that the court had made the request for the audio equipment, we did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>not have an ETA as to when it could have been provided. HQ We were told that it\u2019s not available within our building. A call went to I think County ISD, which is internal services department, to find out whether or not an electrician or sound man is going to be able to come out and install that. [Q[] [Defendant\u2019s counsel:] And I was also going to call our tech people to see if there was some type of equipment that we could provide to do that, HQ [Trial court:] Sure. HQ [Defendant\u2019s counsel:] Defense had asked for a short continuance just to the next morning so we could try to acquire that information, or get that equipment. And the court decided to proceed with the trial. HD \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 HQ \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Because we were placed at such a disadvantage, I think that fundamental fairness and due process requires ... a new trial. [][]\u2022\u2022\u2022 HQ [W]e made the objection, and it was a continuous objection. We had asked the court to get us the equipment or to allow us to try and get the equipment. HQ I had actually called our tech people at the public defender\u2019s office to see if we had the ability to get that equipment here. HQ And I think we . . . just asked for a short continuance. Just to the\u2014HQ [Trial court:] Well, wait a minute. HQ What did your tech people tell you? HQ [Defendant\u2019s counsel:] Our tech people said that they have done it downtown, and that they were going to call around to see if he could get the equipment. HQ [Trial court:] And what information did you relay to the court about your ability to get an alternative equipment set up in a short period of time? [f] [Defendant\u2019s counsel:] Well, I had done it\u2014I wasn\u2019t able, obviously, to make that call until after we had recessed for the afternoon and the witness [was] already on the stand, HQ But at the time I got back here in court, the situation was corrected, and that the court had learned we were able to get the equipment. HQ And the defendant stated that he could comport his behavior. So it wasn\u2019t necessary. I had just called them, and a late-night call when I got back to my office. HQ [Trial court:] Okay. What about other alternative equipment that may have been at your disposal? Tape recorder? Did you ask to bring in a tape recorder to tape-record the testimony of the witness? HQ [Defendant\u2019s counsel:] I did not, Your Honor, HQ [Trial court:] How about a request for a transcript from the court reporter of the testimony of the witness to be able to go over it with the defendant? HQ Those would have been other options that could have been made available. HD [Defendant\u2019s counsel:] That\u2019s true. HQ [Trial court:] Look, I think here\u2019s the bottom line. I don\u2019t think that . . . any of the . . . cases requires that the court have an audio hookup. HQ I understand that your argument is that as a matter of due process, defendant has a right to understand what the allegations are against him. HQ But I think that there are also certain practical limitations that are involved. Clearly, the defendant needed to be removed from the courtroom. HO ... I did give the defendant the opportunity to be able to return to the courtroom; not once, twice. HQ Shortly after the first time where he promised that he would be good, he came back and he was even more disruptive and more disrespectful, and candidly, more corrupt to the judicial process, [f] But here\u2019s the practical issue. You\u2019re <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"855\">*855</page-number>sitting in a building that was built in 1966, I believe. First opened in 1969. We don\u2019t have the luxury of speakers in our lockup. We don\u2019t have video feeds. [][]... Q] You also haven\u2019t addressed the issue as to whether or not the defendant was, in essence, prejudiced by it. You\u2019ve made this broad statement to the effect that because he wasn\u2019t here to watch the witness and ... get these nuances that presumably would go over your head or you wouldn\u2019t see, that he was prejudiced by it. [f] This same witness also testified at the preliminary hearing. Her trial testimony was not that much different than the preliminary hearing testimony in which she testified that it wasn\u2019t the defendant that struck her, it was also this woman who struck her with a cell phone in her hand causing the injury to her head, [f] So I\u2019m not sure how much different that actual testimony would be between the prelim and the trial and how the defendant\u2019s presence would have actually been able to help you. [f] But I would also note for the record that this same witness is somebody that had to have two body attachments issued for her; who physically had the investigating officers go out to her\u2014I think it was her place of business, or maybe it was the school that she was at, and drag her in here. [(H] So in essence, you\u2019re saying that I should have delayed the case another day. And the problem is that I may have lost the only opportunity for that witness to be presented to this jury, because she had a bad track record of coming back to court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">In denying defendant\u2019s motion for new trial, the trial court stated, \u201cI don\u2019t find that the law mandates a separate sound system to an excluded defendant. I certainly attempted to assist the defense. I even indicated in the transcript that you\u2019d be able to break as frequently as you need to in order to be able to discuss the examination with the defendant. [&lt;J[] You asked for a recess to try to calm him down. I granted all of those requests, [][] I gave him every opportunity to be able to come out here and participate. Unfortunately for him, whether he was incapable [of] controlling himself or he chose not to control himself, it didn\u2019t work out for him. [f] . . . [][] [Defendant was excluded due to disruptive behavior. The court admonished the jury not to permit the defendant\u2019s absence in the case to influence them, [f] . . . [f] I don\u2019t think defendant can reasonably insist that the system reacts immediately to accommodate him in this matter, because we don\u2019t have the ability to immediately respond to that, [f] I think we took appropriate steps to try and get a sound system installed for him. But I don\u2019t think that the court is required to delay the case indefinitely until that sound system actually occurs. [][]... [f] The motion for new trial is respectfully denied.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>4. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">a. <em>Forfeiture</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The Attorney General contends that defendant forfeited his claims that his state and federal constitutional rights to a fair trial and effective assistance of counsel have been violated because defendant did not object in the trial court on those grounds. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">A party may not raise an argument on appeal that he or she did not raise before the trial court. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 950, 988, fn. 13 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 689, 857 P.2d 1099], disapproved on other grounds as stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Doolin </em>(2009) 45 Cal.4th 390, 421, fn. 22 [87 Cal.Rptr.3d 209, 198 P.3d 11].) Defendant here raised his constitutional claims before the trial court. Defendant objected in the trial court that pursuant to his right to a fair trial, he needed to hear Cornejo\u2019s testimony and be able to consult with his attorney about the testimony that was being presented. Defendant\u2019s counsel stated that because she was not able to transcribe the audio recordings of defendant\u2019s jail calls, she needed to rely on defendant to \u201cdo a proper presentation of the defense in this matter, and to properly cross-examine . . . Cornejo.\u201d She asserted that defendant was necessary to \u201chelp\u201d her \u201cpresent a defense,\u201d and defendant had a due process right to be able to hear and advise his attorney about the testimony that is being presented. Defendant contended that the trial court\u2019s denial of his request for an audio or video \u201cfeed\u201d violated defendant\u2019s rights under the Sixth Amendment\u2014which includes the right to assistance of counsel. Defendant preserved his claim of a violation of his constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">b. <em>No Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">The trial court did not err by excluding defendant from the courtroom without an audio or video feed to hear or observe Cornejo\u2019s testimony. Defendant does not challenge the order excluding him from the courtroom; he challenges the trial court\u2019s failure to provide him with an audio or video feed in his absence from the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">As defendant concedes, there is no actual statute or court rule that requires a trial court to provide a defendant with an audio or video feed of the trial testimony when a defendant is removed from the courtroom. He relies, however, on Justice Brennan\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Allen, supra, </em>397 U.S. at page 351 (conc. opn. of Brennan, J.), stating that, \u201cOnce the court has removed the contumacious defendant, it is not weakness to mitigate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>disadvantages of his expulsion as far as technologically possible in the circumstances.\u201d Justice Brennan did not state there was a requirement that the trial court mitigate the disadvantages by any and all technological means. He merely suggested the use of technology that was \u201cpossible in the circumstances.\u201d Justice Brennan also stated in this connection that \u201cwhen a defendant is excluded from his trial, the court should make reasonable efforts to enable him to communicate with his attorney and, <em>if possible, </em>to keep apprised of the progress of his trial.\u201d <em>(Ibid. </em>(conc. opn. of Brennan, J.), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Other jurisdictions have determined that a defendant is not constitutionally entitled to an audio or video feed of the trial testimony when he or she has been excluded from the courtroom during trial. The court in <em>Bell v. Evatt </em>(4th Cir. 1995) 72 F.3d 421 stated, \u201cWe have never held . . . that a defendant who has been removed from the courtroom because of his disruptive behavior has a right to an audio hook-up. We see no reason to create such a right.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 432; see <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Poole </em>(S.D.N.Y., Aug. 9, 2005, No. 04 Civ. 0303 (SHS) (THK)) 2005 U.S.Dist. Lexis 46297, pp. *26-*27; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Solomon </em>(S.D.N.Y. May 8, 1997, No. 95 Cr. 154 (LAP)) 1997 U.S.Dist. Lexis 6246, p. *21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">There were practical limitations on complying with defendant\u2019s request to have an audio or video feed of the trial testimony when, during Cornejo\u2019s testimony, he was excluded from the courtroom for less than one day. Upon defendant being removed from the courtroom, the trial court stated that it did not have the ability to \u201cpipe in\u201d the audio of the trial for defendant and that after attempting to confer with the trial court\u2019s \u201cinternal services,\u201d the trial court would not know until the following Tuesday whether it was possible to provide defendant with the requested audio feed. There was a risk that if the trial court continued the trial, Cornejo would not complete her testimony. On a number of occasions, she had failed to appear, body attachments against her had been issued, and the prosecutor\u2019s investigator was required to locate her and physically bring her to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">In addition, although defendant contends that he may have been able to arrange to have audio equipment installed for him within a short period of time, his counsel did not advise the trial court of this possibility because counsel\u2019s \u201ctech people\u201d had not determined whether it was possible until after defendant had been allowed back into the courtroom and the issue of an audio feed to defendant of the trial testimony was moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">Also, defendant\u2019s counsel did not seek permission to tape-record the testimony of the witness or request a transcript from the court reporter of Cornejo\u2019s testimony to enable defense counsel to review the testimony with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>defendant. The trial court advised defendant\u2019s counsel, \u201cI\u2019ll absolutely give you the opportunity to meet and confer with him as regularly as you need to.\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel could have spoken to defendant before the conclusion of Cornejo\u2019s testimony; and because Cornejo was placed \u201con call\u201d upon the conclusion of Cornejo\u2019s testimony, defendant\u2019s counsel could have conferred with defendant and could have had Cornejo testify further.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">c. <em>Prejudice</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">The exclusion of defendant for a portion of the trial without an audio or video feed did not prejudice defendant. Defendant concedes that the denial of a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to be present at a critical stage of his criminal proceedings is generally subject to harmless error analysis. <em>(People v. Disandro </em>(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 593, 605, fn. 8 [111 Cal.Rptr.3d 857].) As the trial court observed, defendant was not prejudiced by the trial court excluding him from the courtroom without an audio or video feed because Cornejo\u2019s trial testimony was substantially the same as she had previously given during the preliminary hearing. As a result, Cornejo\u2019s trial testimony should not have come as a surprise to defendant\u2019s counsel, and an appropriate cross-examination of Cornejo could have been conducted without defendant having an audio or video feed of the trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">Defendant contends on appeal that he was prejudiced because defendant\u2019s cross-examination of Cornejo was \u201cmore damaging to [defendant] than her testimony in the preliminary hearing.\u201d He argues that because he was denied access to the audio of Cornejo\u2019s testimony, his counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Cornejo \u201cinadvertently elicited that [defendant] was previously in custody by asking why the pair broke up, when they had not in fact broken up, . . . [and] were merely separated because [defendant] went to jail.\u201d There is nothing in the record to suggest that had defendant been provided with an audio or video feed of Cornejo\u2019s testimony, he would have indicated to his counsel not to ask Cornejo why she and defendant had \u201cbroken up, or his counsel would not have asked that question.\u201d There is no indication that defendant\u2019s counsel was unable to confer with him prior to cross-examining Cornejo about the subject matter. The trial court\u2019s removal of defendant from a portion of the trial without audio or video access to the proceedings did not constitute prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">C. <em>Equal Protection Challenge to the October 2011 Amendment to Section 4019</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Armstrong, Acting P.
