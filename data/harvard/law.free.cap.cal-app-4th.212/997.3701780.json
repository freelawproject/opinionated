J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ahnx\">Gonzalo Rojas appeals from the court\u2019s judgment sustaining without leave to amend the first demurrers filed by defendants. We reverse as to defendants Platinum Auto Group, Inc., and Topaz Financial, Inc., affirm as to defendant State Farm Fire and Casualty Company, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-11\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b917-12\">On September 20, 2010, appellant Gonzalo Rojas bought a car from respondent Platinum Auto Group, Inc., doing business as Platinum Motors (Platinum), a car dealership in Marina Del Rey. Appellant put no cash down the day he bought the car. Instead, he made a deferred downpayment over the next three months consisting of four payments totaling $2,000: $1,000 on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1000\">*1000</page-number>October 11, 2010; $500 on October 27, 2010; $250 on November 20, 2010; and $250 on December 23, 2010.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">When appellant bought the car, Platinum filled out a retail installment sales contract, a form required by the Rees-Levering Motor Vehicle Sales and Finance Act (Rees-Levering) (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 2981 et seq., 2981.9).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The sales contract contained a section for Platinum to enter information about the downpayment. Platinum should have entered appellant\u2019s $2,000 downpayment on line 6D of that section, labeled \u201cDeferred Down Payment.\u201d Instead, Platinum deliberately entered \u201c$2,000\u201d on line 6G, labeled \u201cRemaining Cash Down Payment,\u201d to indicate a $2,000 cash payment by appellant at the time of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">Six months later in April 2011, appellant filed his complaint at issue here. He alleged Platinum\u2019s mischaracterization of his downpayment violated Rees-Levering, which requires a detailed and truthful itemization of appellant\u2019s downpayment. (\u00a7 2982, subd. (a)(6).) Appellant\u2019s complaint named as defendants respondents Platinum and Topaz Financial, Inc. (Topaz), the lender to whom Platinum had assigned the sales contract.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition to alleging a cause of action for violation of Rees-Levering, appellant alleged Platinum\u2019s deliberate mischaracterization of appellant\u2019s downpayment violated the Consumers Legal Remedies Act (\u00a7 1750 et seq.), and constituted an unfair business practice in violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>Platinum demurred to appellant\u2019s complaint. Platinum noted that appellant did not allege that Platinum had misstated essential terms of the sale, such as the car\u2019s purchase price or the terms of appellant\u2019s auto loan from Topaz. Platinum asserted that its entering the $2,000 figure on the wrong line of the sales contract was merely a technical violation which did not support a cause of action. Moreover, according to Platinum, appellant benefitted from drawing out his downpayment into four deferred payments because it eased any cashflow crunch he might have suffered if he had been forced to pay the entire $2,000 downpayment at the time of sale. Topaz joined Platinum\u2019s demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">The trial court sustained the demurrers without leave to amend. The court concluded Platinum\u2019s mischaracterization of appellant\u2019s downpayment was not actionable. The court\u2019s order sustaining the demurrers stated the \u201cCourt finds that PLATINUM\u2019S sole fault was in failing to list [appellant\u2019s down] payment as \u2018deferred\u2019 three lines above in Item 6(d) instead of 6(g), a defect which, under these circumstances, may properly be characterized as \u2018trivial\u2019.\u201d Additionally, the court concluded appellant suffered no actual loss from the mischaracterization. The court found, \u201cThere is no allegation that PLATINUM\u2019S alleged mischaracterization of the down payment. . . resulted in any damage or monetary loss to [appellant].\u201d The court reasoned that \u201ceven if the parties\u2019 agreement had properly listed the $2,000 as a \u2018Deferred Down Payment,\u2019 [appellant] would be in the exact same position as he is now. There is nothing to show how listing the $2,000 as a \u2018Remaining Cash Down Payment\u2019 versus a \u2018Deferred Down Payment\u2019 altered the parties\u2019 deal to [appellant\u2019s] detriment.\u201d This appeal followed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">\u201cA demurrer must assume the truth of a complaint\u2019s properly pleaded allegations.\u201d <em>(Century-National Ins. Co. v. Garcia </em>(2011) 51 Cal.4th 564, 566, fn. 1 [120 Cal.Rptr.3d 541, 246 P.3d 621].) \u201c \u2018We treat [a] demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but not contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law.

Kirwan </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 [216 Cal.Rptr. 718, 703 P.2d 58].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b920-5\">A. <em>Complaint Stated a Cause of Action for Violation of Rees-Levering</em></p>\n<p id=\"b920-6\">The Automobile Sales Finance Act, and its modem incarnation as Rees-Levering are codified at section 2981 et seq. Broadly speaking, ReesLevering is a consumer protection law governing the sale of cars in which the buyer finances some, or all, of the car\u2019s purchase price. (See, e.g., <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>Western Surety Co. </em>(2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 83, 91 [143 Cal.Rptr.3d 152]; <em>Salenga </em>v. <em>Mitsubishi Motors Credit of America, Inc. </em>(2010) 183 Cal.App.4th 986, 998 [107 Cal.Rptr.3d 836].) Rees-Levering requires a car dealer to disclose in a single document, which the parties here call a retail sales installment contract, all the terms and conditions of sale. (\u00a7 2981.9.) In disclosing those terms, the sales contract must itemize the purchaser\u2019s downpayment. That itemization must state the following (the statutory analogues for the mislabeling by Platinum at issue in this appeal are italicized): \u201c(A) The agreed value of the property being traded in. [f] (B) The prior credit or lease balance, if any, owing on the property being traded in. [][] (C) The net agreed value of the property being traded in .... [f] (D) <em>The amount of any portion of the downpayment to be deferred </em>until not later than the due date of the second regularly scheduled installment under the contract....[][] (E) The amount of any manufacturer\u2019s rebate ....[][] (F) <em>The remaining amount paid or to be paid by the buyer as a downpayment. </em>[][] (G) The total downpayment. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 2982, subd. (a)(6), italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">Platinum\u2019s violation of Rees-Levering involving appellant\u2019s down-payment was twofold. First, Platinum misstated the downpayment\u2019s nature by labeling it as a \u201cRemaining Cash Down Payment\u201d tendered at the time of sale (\u00a7 2982, subd. (a)(6)(F)) instead of a \u201cDeferred Down Payment\u201d <em>(id., </em>subd. (a)(6)(D)). As a consumer protection and disclosure statute, ReesLevering provides that unless \u201cdealers disclose correct information the disclosure itself is meaningless and the informational purpose of the [statute] is not served.\u201d <em>(Nelson </em>v. <em>Pearson Ford Co. </em>(2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 983, 1005 [112 Cal.Rptr.3d 607].) In enacting Rees-Levering, the Legislature created separate categories for cash put down at the time of sale and for a deferred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>downpayment. Because the Legislature drew the distinction, we cannot conflate the two types of downpayments as if they were one and the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">Second, in addition to misstating the downpayment\u2019s nature, Platinum misstated the downpayment\u2019s amount. Rees-Levering defines a downpayment as money paid before the buyer\u2019s second scheduled loan payment. Section 2981, subdivision (f) states a \u201c \u2018[d]ownpayment\u2019 means a payment that the buyer pays or agrees to pay to the seller ... at or prior to delivery by the seller to the buyer of the motor vehicle .... The term shall also include the amount of any portion of the downpayment the payment of which is deferred until not later than the <em>due date of the second otherwise scheduled payment </em>[under the buyer\u2019s car loan] . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) Appellant\u2019s second scheduled loan payment was December 4, 2010. Appellant made the first three of his four deferred payments before December 4: $1,000 on October 11, 2010; $500 on October 27, 2010; and $250 on November 20, 2010. Those three payments totaled $1,750. He made his final payment of $250 after December 4 on December 23, 2010. This last payment did not satisfy the statute\u2019s definition of a downpayment. (\u00a7 2981, subd. (f), see \u00a7 2982, subd. (a)(6)(D) [not a downpayment if after second scheduled loan payment].) Thus, regardless of whether appellant\u2019s downpayment was cash up-front at the time of sale or deferred, his total downpayment under the statute\u2019s definition was $1,750, not $2,000 as Platinum stated in the sales contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">If an auto dealer misstates or conceals terms, of a car sale, the sales contract is unenforceable and the buyer may recover the total amount paid to the seller. (\u00a7 2983.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nevertheless, the trial court sustained respondents\u2019 demurrers because it concluded Platinum\u2019s mischaracterization of appellant\u2019s downpayment did not injure appellant in that the sales contract accurately stated essential terms of the contract, such as the car\u2019s purchase price and the interest rate on appellant\u2019s car loan. In finding no injury, the trial court relied on the substantial compliance doctrine applied by our Supreme Court in <em>Stasher </em>v. <em>Harger-Haldeman </em>(1962) 58 Cal.2d 23 [22 Cal.Rptr. 657, 372 P.2d 649] (Stasher) to Rees-Levering\u2019s predecessor statute. The trial court\u2019s reliance on <em>Stasher </em>was misplaced because the Legislature has rejected its application to the type of nondisclosure at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-7\"><em>Stasher </em>involved an earlier statute less demanding of car dealers than Rees-Levering. The version of the Automobile Sales Financing Act in effect in the mid-1950\u2019s at the time of Stasher's car sale required only the following <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>minimal detail about the downpayment: \u201c \u20181. The cash price of the personal property described in the conditional sale contract. [][] 2. The. amount of the buyer\u2019s down payment, and whether made in cash or represented by the net agreed value of described property traded in, or both, together with a statement of the respective amounts credited for cash and for such property. . . . [f] 3. The amount unpaid on the cash price, which is the difference between Items 1 and 2.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Stasher, supra, </em>58 Cal.2d at p. 26, fn. 1.) As one may discern from our quotation of the downpayment provisions of current section 2982, subdivision (a)(6), <em>ante, </em>Rees-Levering\u2019s disclosure requirements about the downpayment are much more exacting in their detail.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\"><em>Stasher </em>explained that \u201c[substantial compliance . . . means actual compliance in respect to the substance essential to every reasonable objective of the statute. . . . [Wjhen there is such actual compliance as to all matters of substance then mere technical imperfections of form or variations in mode of expression by the seller, or such minima as obvious typographical errors, should not be given the stature of noncompliance . . . .\u201d <em>(Stasher, supra, </em>58 Cal.2d at p. 29, italics omitted.) Here, the trial court found no actionable violation of Rees-Levering because Platinum\u2019s mischaracterization of the downpayment was, in the court\u2019s view, a \u201ctrivial\u201d technicality. In the trial court\u2019s view, Platinum had substantially complied with Rees-Levering\u2019s disclosure requirement regarding appellant\u2019s downpayment notwithstanding Platinum\u2019s mislabeling and misstating of the downpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">A recent amendment of Rees-Levering reveals the Legislature\u2019s rejection of Stasher\u2019s substantial compliance defense except for the narrowest circumstances. Rees-Levering requires an auto seller to disclose in the sales contract certain governmental fees, including licensing, transfer, registration, and new tire fees. (\u00a7 2982, subd. (a)(2).) Before the recent amendment took effect in 2012, many car buyers had begun suing dealers who lumped those fees into one entry in the sales contract. (Sen. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 238 (2011-2012 Reg. Sess.) as amended Sept. 2, 2011, pp. 1-2.) To prevent such lawsuits, the Legislature narrowed Rees-Levering\u2019s remedial statute, which ordinarily made sales contracts that do not comply with Rees-Levering\u2019s disclosure requirements unenforceable. The Legislature added subdivision (b) to section 2983 to carve out an exception for improper disclosure of the foregoing governmental fees. The amendment stated: \u201cA conditional sale contract executed or entered into on or after January 1, 2012, shall not be made unenforceable solely because of a violation by the seller of paragraph (2) or (5) [(amounts paid to public entities for licensing, registration, and other fees)] of subdivision (a) of [Civil Code] Section 2982. . . .\u201d (\u00a7 2983, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>A bill analysis by the Assembly explained the amendment\u2019s purpose. \u201cThe requirement that government fees be shown on the contract has been a feature of [Automobile Sales Financing Act/Rees-Levering] since its enactment 50 years ago. Initially the Act provided no right of rescission if these fees were lumped together on the contract because dealers could defend on the ground of substantial compliance. (Stasher v. Harger-Haldeman, 58 Cal.2d 23 [22 Cal.Rptr. 657, 372 P.2d 649] (1962).) However, the Act was subsequently revised to require the current specific itemization. [Without the proposed amendment, the] remedy of rescission therefore appears to be available as a remedy\u2014and apparently the only remedy\u2014specified in the statute for unlawfully aggregating these fees.\u201d (Assem. Com. on Judiciary, Analysis of Assem. Bill No. 238 (2011-2012 Reg. Sess.) as amended Sept. 2, 2011, p. 4.)</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">The 2012 amendment thus eliminated the right of rescission for mislabeling government fees. Under the long-standing statutory interpretation principle <em>\u201cexpressio unius exclusius alterius est\u201d </em>(to express one thing is to exclude others), the Legislature\u2019s declaration that a sales contract remains enforceable if its only erroneous nondisclosure involves certain governmental fees (\u00a7 2983, subd. (b)), means that rescission remains available for the contract\u2019s noncompliance with other disclosure requirements\u2014for example, truthful and accurate disclosure of the downpayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">The Legislature\u2019s statement of intent in enacting the amendment underscores that a car buyer need not suffer economic damage to rescind a sales contract that does not comply with Rees-Levering. \u201cThe Legislature finds and declares as follows: [f] (a) The Rees-Levering . . . Act . . . sets forth a statutory scheme to regulate the retail sale and financing of motor vehicles. The act contains detailed disclosure requirements intended to protect the consuming public and includes provisions that render a conditional sale contract unenforceable if any of those disclosure requirements are violated, regardless of the nature of the disclosure violation <em>or any consumer harm.\u201d </em>(Assem. Bill No. 238 (2011-2012 Reg. Sess.) \u00a7 1, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b923-7\">In short, the purpose and history of Rees-Levering establish that appellant need not have suffered actual damage from Platinum\u2019s violation of the statute\u2019s disclosure requirements, and that Stasher\u2019s substantial compliance rule has been statutorily removed. Appellant could state a claim for relief under the act based on Platinum\u2019s misstatements about appellant\u2019s downpayment even if the trial court deemed the misstatements \u201ctrivial.\u201d The trial court therefore erred in sustaining respondents\u2019 demurrers to appellant\u2019s cause of action for violation of Rees-Levering.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-8\">B., C.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b924-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1006\">*1006</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">The judgments following the orders and sustaining the demurrers of respondents Topaz Financial, Inc., and Platinum Auto Group, Inc., doing business as Platinum Motors are reversed, and the court is directed to enter a new and different order overruling their demurrers to appellant\u2019s cause of action for violation of Rees-Levering, and sustaining with leave to amend the demurrers to appellant\u2019s causes of action for violation of the Consumers Legal Remedies Act and unfair business practices. The judgment following the order and sustaining the demurrer of State Farm Fire and Casualty Company is affirmed. Appellant to recover his costs on appeal against Topaz and Platinum, only.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">Grimes, J., and Sortino, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b918-7\"> The receipt for the fourth payment is in the amount of $340. The parties on appeal state without comment that the fourth payment was $250. Because this appeal is from a demurrer before any evidence has been received, we accept what seems to be the parties\u2019 agreement that the fourth payment was $250, but, in the interest of faithfulness to the record, we note the discrepancy in the fourth payment\u2019s size.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b918-8\"> All undesignated statute references are to the Civil Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b918-9\"> Appellant also named as a defendant respondent State Farm Fire and Casualty Company (State Farm), which had issued a surety bond to Platinum, alleging a single cause of action against State Farm for violation of Vehicle Code section 11710. The trial court sustained State Farm\u2019s demurrer after the court found appellant stated no valid cause of action against Platinum. Appellant served his notice of appeal from the judgment on all three respondents, including State Farm, but appellant has not included State Farm\u2019s demurrer in the record on appeal, and State Farm has not filed a respondent\u2019s brief. Appellant\u2019s sole contention in support of reversing the court\u2019s judgment for State Farm is his conclusory statement that appellant \u201chas properly demonstrated that there are valid causes of action against Platinum. Accordingly, State Farm\u2019s demurrer should be overruled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">We disagree. Appellant bears the obligation of demonstrating the trial court erred. To do so, appellant must provide a sufficient record and legal argument, supported by citation to legal authorities. Appellant\u2019s conclusory statement about State Farm\u2019s demurrer fails that obligation <em>(Walker v. Sonora Regional Medical Center </em>(2012) 202 Cal.App.4th 948, 952, fn. 2 [135 Cal.Rptr.3d 876]), and we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling as to State Farm.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b919-8\"> On appeal, Topaz requests attorney fees and costs. The record is not clear whether Topaz requested them below, as the court issued no ruling regarding fees and costs. Furthermore, assuming the court denied them, Topaz did not file a cross-appeal, thus waiving any error. And finally, because we reverse as to Topaz, it is not a prevailing party, making a cost and fee award, at best, premature.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b920-8\"> Respondent Topaz asserts in its brief that equitable concepts barred any relief sought by appellant. Topaz cites no legal authority that its assertion (which relies on considerations outside the four comers of the complaint and matters of which we may not take judicial notice) is properly a subject of demurrer. We thus disregard the assertion as unsupported by citation to legal authority and cogent argument. <em>(Landry v.
