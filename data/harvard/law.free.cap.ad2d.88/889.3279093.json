Defendant-respondent admitted that the advance of money to him as a loan would have been paid by him at any time prior to the expiration of one year. Thus, the transaction is removed from the proscription of the statute, and the projected defense would be fruitless. (See Siegel, Practice Commentaries, McKinney\u2019s Cons Laws of NY, Book 7B, CPLR 3025, subd [b].) In any event, the loan transaction\u2019s terms are not evident from the record, and payment could have been demanded by plaintiff at any time. Concur \u2014 Sullivan, Markewich and Milonas, JJ.; Kupferman, J. P., concurs in the result only.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>",
