Upon the decedent\u2019s admission to the facility, the decedent\u2019s spouse, the plaintiff, Louis Casale, signed an \u201cAdmission Agreement\u201d (hereinafter the agreement) that contained a forum selection clause reciting, in relevant part, that \u201c[a]ny and all actions arising out of or related to this Agreement . . . shall be brought in . . . the New York State Supreme Court, located in Nassau, New York.\u201d The agreement also provided that it \u201cshall be binding on the parties, their heirs, administrators, distributees, successors and assignees.\u201d Following the decedent\u2019s death, the plaintiff, individually and as the administrator of the decedent\u2019s estate, commenced this action against the defendant in the Supreme Court, Kings County, alleging, inter alia, causes of action to recover damages for wrongful death, negligence, and violation of the Public Health Law. Subsequently, the defendant moved pursuant to CPLR 501, 510, and 511 to change the venue of the action from Kings County to Nassau County, based on the forum selection clause contained in the agreement. In the order appealed from, the Supreme Court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">\u201c \u2018A contractual forum selection clause is prima facie valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>and enforceable unless it is shown by the challenging party to be unreasonable, unjust, in contravention of public policy, invalid due to fraud or overreaching, or it is shown that a trial in the selected forum would be so gravely difficult that the challenging party would, for all practical purposes, be deprived of its day in court\u2019 \u201d <em>(Stravalle v Land Cargo, Inc., </em>39 AD3d 735, 736 [2007], quoting <em>LSPA Enter., Inc. v Jani-King of N.Y., Inc., </em>31 AD3d 394, 395 [2006]; <em>see U.S. Mdse., Inc. v L&amp;R Distribs., Inc., </em>122 AD3d 613, 614 [2014]; <em>Best Cheese Corp. v All-Ways Forwarding Int\u2019l. Inc., </em>24 AD3d 580, 581 [2005]). Here, the plaintiff failed to show that enforcement of the forum selection clause would be unreasonable, unjust, or in contravention public policy, or that the inclusion of the forum selection clause in the agreement was the result of fraud or overreaching <em>(see Couvertier v Concourse Rehabilitation &amp; Nursing, Inc., </em>117 AD3d 772, 773 [2014]; <em>Pratik Apparels, Ltd. v Shintex Apparel Group, Inc., </em>96 AD3d 922, 923 [2012]). Moreover, the plaintiff did not demonstrate that a trial in Nassau County would be so gravely difficult that, for all practical purposes, he would be deprived of his day in court <em>(see Couvertier v Concourse Rehabilitation &amp; Nursing, Inc., </em>117 AD3d at 773).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-3\">Contrary to the plaintiff\u2019s contention, the agreement, including the forum selection clause, is binding on the parties to this litigation <em>(see Buhler v French Woods Festival of Performing Arts, </em>154 AD2d 303, 305 [1989]; <em>Ellman v S&amp;L Birchwood, LLC, </em>2010 NY Slip Op 32946[U] [Sup Ct, NY County 2010]).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Accordingly, the Supreme Court should have granted the defendant\u2019s motion pursuant to CPLR 501, 510, and 511 to change the venue of the action from Kings County to Nassau County.</p>\n<judges id=\"A1s\">Rivera, J.P., Leventhal, Roman and Hinds-Radix, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
