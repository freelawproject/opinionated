Body v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Alabama, Inc., </em>156 F.3d 1098 (11th Cir.1998), we held that an insurance company occupying the role of \u201cfiscal intermediary\u201d in processing Medicare Part A claims is immune from liability, under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395h(i)(3), in a <em>qui tam </em>suit brought under the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a), for knowingly approving false or fraudulent Part A claims for payment by the United States government. The interlocutory appeal in this <em>qui tam </em>action presents the question of whether such immunity bars a claim that the fiscal intermediary breached its obligation to audit the records of a Medicare service provider.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-8\">Medicare is a federal health insurance program for the aged and disabled. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1395 <em>et seq. </em>Administered by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a division of the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cHHS\u201d), Part A provides benefits for \u201chospital, related post-hospital, home health services, and hospice care.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1395c. To participate in the Medicare program, a health care provider must enter into an agreement (\u201cProvider Agreement\u201d) with the Secretary of HHS (\u201cSecretary\u201d). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1395cc. After entering into such an agreement, the provider is reimbursed directly for the reasonable cost of services provided to Medicare patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-13\">CMS fulfills its administrative duties under Part A by contracting with third parties \u2014 typically large private insurance companies \u2014 to serve as fiscal intermediaries. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 1395h. The fiscal intermediaries have one central function: reimburse providers for the reasonable cost of health care services on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1395h, 1395u. In carrying out this function, the fiscal intermediaries are obligated to audit the records of health care providers \u201cas necessary\u201d to ensure that proper payments are made. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 421.100(c); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395h(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1321-14\">To understand how the auditing function fits within a fiscal intermediary\u2019s duties, it is necessary to understand how the reimbursement scheme operates.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After providing health care services to a Medicare beneficiary, the provider files a claim for reimbursement with the fiscal intermediary. The intermediary, in turn, reimburses the provider \u201cas often as possible,\u201d 42 \u00a7 C.F.R. 413.60(c), and on a \u201cmost expeditious schedule,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 413.64(a). Accordingly, fiscal intermediaries make pre-audit payments known as periodic interim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1294\">*1294</page-number>payments (\u201cPIPs\u201d) at least monthly. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395g(e); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 413.60. The PIP amount is an estimate derived from projections of the services the provider is likely to render in the current fiscal year (\u201cFY\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> These PIPs are necessary to enable the providers to continue day-today operations and avoid the cash-flow shortage that would stem from a prolonged delay between the time a service is provided to a beneficiary and the time the provider is reimbursed for the service. <em>See River Garden Hebrew Home for the Aged v. Califano, </em>507 F.Supp. 221, 223 (M.D.Fla.1980). PIPs usually account for the bulk of the providers\u2019 receipts in any given fiscal year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-4\">A reconciliation process begins at the end of a provider\u2019s fiscal year to determine whether the provider was overpaid or underpaid for its <em>actual </em>costs as a result of the <em>estimated </em>PIPs. To begin, the provider is required to submit a fiscal year-end cost report that details the costs incurred for Medicare beneficiaries. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 413.20, 413.24(f). Absent obvious errors, the fiscal intermediary assumes the cost report to be correct and makes \u201can initial retroactive adjustment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 413.64(f)(2). The adjustment \u201cbring[s] the interim payments made to the provider during the ... [previous year] into agreement with the reimbursable amount payable to the provider for the services furnished to program beneficiaries.... \u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 413.64(f)(1). If the provider was underpaid during the year, the fiscal intermediary remits the appropriate amount to the provider. On the other hand, if the provider was overpaid, the provider either returns the overpayment amount or the fiscal intermediary adjusts downward the provider\u2019s current-year PIP payments to recoup the overpayment. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 405.1803(c). The fiscal intermediary thereafter conducts an audit of the provider\u2019s year-end cost report and issues a notice setting forth the total amount of reimbursement due under the program. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 405.1803(a). A final retroactive adjustment is made to account for any outstanding overpayment or underpayment. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 413.64(f)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-8\">Because the reimbursement scheme calls for estimated payments based on a provider\u2019s representations, the auditing function is a critical part of the overall scheme to administer Part A of Medicare. The Medicare statute requires the Secretary to develop standards, criteria, and procedures for evaluating the overall performance of fiscal intermediaries. As part of this performance evaluation, fiscal intermediaries are judged in part for their ability to make \u201c[c]orreet coverage and payment determinations.\u201d 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 421.120(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1322-9\">In carrying out its functions, a fiscal intermediary is shielded in part from lawsuits by a grant of statutory immunity. The immunity section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1322-10\">(1) No individual designated pursuant to an agreement under this section as a certifying officer shall, in the absence of gross negligence or intent to defraud the United States, be liable with respect to any payments certified by him under this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1322-11\">(2) No disbursing officer shall, in the absence of gross negligence or intent to defraud the United States, be liable with respect to any payment by him under this section if it was based upon a voucher signed by a certifying officer designated as provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1323-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1295\">*1295</page-number>\n<em>(3) No such agency or organization shall be liable to the United States for any payments referred to in paragraph (1) or (2).</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1323-5\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395h(i) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-7\">Until its dissolution in 1995, St. Johns Home Health Agency, Inc. (\u201cSt-Johns\u201d), a Florida not-for-profit corporation, operated as a home health agency under a Florida license. Arnold Friedman was its chief executive officer. In 1976, St. Johns entered into a Provider Agreement with CMS <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to act as a provider of home health services to homebound patients under Part A of the Medicare Program. The home health services rendered by St. Johns included skilled nursing care, physical therapy, occupational and speech therapy, medical social services, and home health aides\u2019 services.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-8\">In July 1982, Aetna Life Insurance Company (\u201cAetna\u201d) entered into a contract with CMS to serve as the fiscal intermediary for the State of Florida. As such, Aetna was responsible for fulfilling the supervisory and administrative responsibilities set forth in the Medicare Act and accompanying federal regulations. Thus, Aetna was responsible for processing and disbursing payments to St. Johns for services rendered in the form of the bi-weekly PIPs, and also for conducting necessary audits and making appropriate adjustments for overpayment or underpayment to St. Johns.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-12\">c.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-13\">Before turning to the <em>qui tarn </em>case before us, it is necessary to understand the history of the relationship between St. Johns, Aetna, and CMS. During 1992 and 1993, Aetna and St. Johns were in substantial disagreement over the dollar amount of the Medicare reimbursements St. Johns was entitled to receive during FYs 1990 through 1993.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In 1992, Aetna issued a notice, indicating that St. Johns had been overpaid nearly $2.8 million for FYs 1990 and 1991, which St. Johns contested. Because of overpayment, Aetna altered the formula by which it calculated St. Johns\u2019s PIPs for FY 1993. After St. Johns complained about the new formula, Aetna made a lump-sum payment in January 1993 to compensate for the lower PIPs St. Johns received during the first half of FY 1993. In July 1993, Aetna advised St. Johns that it was \u201cskeptical\u201d that St. Johns had, in fact, made all of the home health care visits that it had claimed during FY 1993 and, furthermore, would not recognize certain \u201ctranscription\u201d charges as reasonable, and thus reimbursable, under the Medicare program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1323-14\">On September 15, 1993, St. Johns brought suit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida against Aetna and the Secretary of HHS, seeking a writ of mandamus, injunctive relief, and damages.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The gist of St. Johns\u2019s complaint, which was framed in three counts, was that Aetna, in collabora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1296\">*1296</page-number>tion with the Secretary, had been arbitrarily withholding PIPs over a substantial period of time,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that Aetna had been unduly late in completing its adjustments to St. Johns\u2019s cost reports for FYs 1990 and 1991 and in issuing its NPR for FY 1992, thereby violating the Medicare statutes and regulations as well as the substantive and procedural components of the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-4\">St. Johns asked the court, in Count I, to issue a preliminary and permanent injunction restraining the defendants from withholding from its PIPs reimbursements costs it had incurred in rendering covered services to program beneficiaries, and to award it damages and other appropriate relief. In Count II, St. Johns asked the court to issue a writ of mandamus directing the defendants to \u201ccomply with the Medicare statutes and regulations and to reimburse ... $3.9 million for costs that [they are] wrongfully withholding....\u201d In Count III, St. Johns asked for the same coercive relief sought in Counts I and II and damages for the defendants\u2019 infringement of St. Johns\u2019s substantive and procedural due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-5\">On August 23, 1993, while its suit was pending, St. Johns sought Chapter 11 relief in the bankruptcy court for the Southern District of Florida. Immediately after filing its Chapter 11 petition, St. Johns, as debtor in possession, filed an emergency motion for authority to assume, as an exec-utory contract, its Provider Agreement with the Secretary pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365. The Secretary opposed the motion on the grounds that St. Johns \u201cha[d] not adequately proposed a means of curing existing defaults or providing adequate assurance of future performance under ... \u00a7 365,\u201d and that the court did not have \u201cjurisdiction over [CMS]\u2019s calculation of amounts owed under the Medicare program or recovery of overpayments made pursuant thereto until a provider has exhausted its administrative remedies, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(h).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1324-9\">The court denied St. Johns\u2019s motion in a written order dated September 23, 1994.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It agreed with the Secretary that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the motion because St. Johns had not exhausted its administrative remedies. Assuming that it had jurisdiction, the court added, it could not \u201cgrant effective relief ... under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 365 without fundamentally and impermissibly altering the contractual relationship between St. Johns and the Secretary which incorporates the statutory and administrative scheme imposed by the Medicare Program.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1297\">*1297</page-number>The court\u2019s decision was St. Johns\u2019s death knell. On November 10, 1994, the court entered an order approving the sale of St. Johns\u2019s assets (except the above-mentioned lawsuit pending against the Secretary and CMS) to Amitan Health Services, Inc.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On August 21, 1995, St. Johns moved the court to convert its Chapter 11 case to a Chapter 7 liquidation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The court granted its motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-6\">With the necessary background in place, we turn to the <em>qui tam </em>action before us and its somewhat complicated history. Relators Mario Cardoso and Valentine Sarasola worked for St. Johns during the early to mid 1990s. Cardoso was the company\u2019s auditor. Sarasola was the night shift supervisor.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On March 8, 1994, while St. Johns\u2019s Chapter 11 case was pending, Relators went to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and reported what they had observed while working for St. Johns \u2014 that St. Johns, as directed by its chief executive officer, Arnold Friedman, was defrauding the United States by seeking Medicare reimbursement from Aetna for home health care services that it had not provided. Some fifteen months later, on June 14, 1995, they brought a <em>qui tam </em>action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against St. Johns, Friedman,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and Aetna.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Their complaint alleged that St. Johns, at Friedman\u2019s direction, violated the provisions of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729 by presenting to Aetna for subsequent presentation to CMS \u201cfalse or fraudulent claims for Medicare reimbursement payment or approval,\u201d which were supported by \u201cfalse records or statements.\u201d Some of these claims were for services provided to \u201cfictitious, deceased, or otherwise ineligible persons,\u201d for services that were not \u201cmedically justified,\u201d and for services \u201cnever provided.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1325-11\">The complaint alleged that Aetna, \u201cin its capacity as the fiscal intermediary,\u201d \u201caided and abetted\u201d this fraudulent conduct by approving St. Johns\u2019s claims \u201cfor payment\u201d and by presenting them to CMS for \u201cMedicare reimbursement.\u201d The 1995 complaint described Aetna\u2019s aiding and abetting activity as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-12\">24. Aetna knew when it presented the claims or with the exercise of the slightest care before presenting the claims, Aetna should and would have known of the falsity of the claims it was presenting.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1325-13\">25. Aetna had actual knowledge of the falsity of the claims it submitted, acted in deliberate ignorance of the falsity of the claims, or acted in reckless disregard of the falsity of the information in that Aetna maintained a \u201cBenefit Integrity Unit\u201d and other administrative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1298\">*1298</page-number>checks which resulted in actual disclosure to Aetna of the .... false claims. Alternatively, the fraud on the part of St. Johns and Friedman was so pervasive, open and obvious that the most cursory of spot checks would and should have disclosed its existence had Aetna exercised even slight care in the fulfillment of its responsibilities as fiscal intermediary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1326-4\">As relief, the complaint demanded judgment against the defendants as follows: a civil penalty of not less that $5,000 and not more than $10,000 for each statutory violation; treble the amount of damages the Government sustained as a result of the defendants\u2019 fraud; and costs and attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3730(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-5\">On August 22, 1995, the United States filed an unopposed motion to stay Rela-tors\u2019 action until a criminal investigation and any resulting prosecutions involving the fraudulent activity alleged in Relators\u2019 complaint were concluded. The district court granted the motion the next day, with the proviso that the Government report the status of the criminal proceedings every ninety days.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-6\">On August 30, 1995, while the court\u2019s stay order was in effect, the court dismissed St. Johns as a party defendant in response to a notice of dismissal previously filed by the Relators. On October 2, 1995, the court granted Aetna\u2019s motion to dismiss Relators\u2019 complaint for failure to plead fraud with particularity, as required by Rule 9(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Relators filed an amended complaint on November 2, 1995. The amended complaint essentially replicated Relators\u2019 initial complaint, in particular the allegations that Aetna aided and abetted the St. Johns/Friedman fraud as described and quoted above. The amended complaint also alleged that Aetna\u2019s presentation of St. Johns\u2019s claims to CMS for reimbursement was \u201cpart of a scheme by St. Johns, Friedman and Aetna to defraud the United States.\u201d Aetna moved to dismiss the amended complaint; the court, however, never ruled on its motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-10\">Meanwhile, the Government filed the required status reports every ninety days. The final such report, filed on March 12, 1999, indicated that on December 17, 1998 a Southern District of Florida grand jury returned an indictment charging twenty-six defendants with racketeering offenses, submission of false claims to Medicare, and money laundering. Sixteen of the defendants pled guilty to one or more of these offenses, and nine were to be tried in September 1999. Other individuals were still under investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-11\">On June 14, 2000, the district court entered an order dismissing Relators\u2019 <em>qui tam </em>suit against Aetna, and directing the clerk to close the case. The order (1) recited that the United States had elected not to pursue Relators\u2019 allegations against Aetna, and (2) instructed Relators to file a new complaint by July 14 if they wished to proceed against Aetna. Relators filed a new complaint on July 14;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> it was practically verbatim the amended complaint they had filed on November 2,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b1326-12\">The new complaint replicated Relators\u2019 initial complaint (filed on June 14,1995), in particular the \u201caiding and abetting\u201d allegations, that described Aetna\u2019s conduct.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>Aetna moved the court to dismiss the complaint, contending that it is immune from liability under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395h(i)(3) for payments its officers certify and disburse to Medicare providers and under our decision in <em>United States ex rel. Body v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Alabama, Inc., </em>156 F.3d 1098 (11th Cir.1998), which interpreted and applied section 1395(i)(3) in a similar context. Conceding, in their response to Aetna\u2019s motion, that \u201c[t]he holding in <em>Body </em>applies squarely to the claim as presently stated against Aetna,\u201d Relators sought leave to amend their complaint. The court granted them leave, and they filed an amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b1327-5\">The amended complaint repeats the allegations of the dismissed complaint which <em>Body </em>foreclosed \u2014 that is, the allegations that Aetna aided and abetted St. Johns\u2019s fraud, as described above \u2014 while introducing new allegations about Aetna\u2019s failure to audit in accord with its obligations to CMS. After citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395h(a)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 421.100(c)<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> for the proposition that Aetna, as a fiscal intermediary, had the responsibility to audit St. Johns\u2019s records to ensure that the services for which St. Johns was seeking reimbursement had actually been provided and were covered by Medicare, the amended complaint alleged the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1327-6\">43.Aetna willfully failed and refused to fulfill its ... audit responsibilities as fiscal intermediary yet continued to misrepresent that it had done so, falsely claiming entitlement to ... payments [under its contract with CMS] and accepting such payments without rendering the services for which the payments were being made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1327-9\">44. By charging the United States for \u201cphantom services\u201d and accepting payment for services never rendered, Aetna ... caused damage to the United States in the amount of such payments in addition to costing the United States money it would have recovered had the services been rendered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1327-10\">45. By its conduct set forth herein, Aetna has denied [CMS] the meaningful opportunity to evaluate both Aetna\u2019s performance and the performance of those health care services providers whom Aetna was charged with monitoring and as warranted, to hire a more qualified fiscal intermediary who would have prevented the loss of substantial amounts of Medicare funds. Upon information and belief, had Aetna not actively concealed the deficiencies in its performance as fiscal intermediary from [CMS], another intermediary would have been hired.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1327-11\">47. By its conduct herein, Aetna has misrepresented its capacity and its intention to perform its duties under the [CMS] contract and has used false pretenses to obtain payments of government funds to which Aetna was not entitled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1327-12\">48. Defendant Aetna has knowingly submitted false or fraudulent claims for payment, or caused false or fraudulent claims for payment for its services to be submitted, to officials of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>States government, in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(1).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1328-4\">49. Defendant Aetna has knowingly made or used, or caused to be made or used, false records or statements to get false or fraudulent claims paid or approved by the officials of the United States government, in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1328-5\">50. Defendant Aetna has knowingly made or used, or caused to be made or used, false records or statements to conceal, avoid, or decrease an obligation to pay or transmit money or property to the United States government, in violation of 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729(a)(7).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1328-6\">51. Because of [Aetna\u2019s] conduct set forth above, the United States has suffered actual damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1328-7\">As relief, the amended complaint demanded \u201ctreble the amount of the United States\u2019 damages, plus civil penalties of not less than $5,000 and not more than $10,000 for each false claim,\u201d costs, attorneys\u2019 fees, Relators\u2019 expenses in prosecuting the ease, and such other relief as may be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-8\">Aetna moved the district court to dismiss the amended complaint on the grounds (1) that the <em>Body </em>decision foreclosed Relators\u2019 allegations relating to Aet-na\u2019s involvement in the approval and payment of St. Johns\u2019s fraudulent claims for Medicare reimbursement, and (2) that the remaining allegations \u2014 those contained in paragraphs 43 through 51 \u2014 constituted an attempt to \u201csubstitute an entirely new claim for the previously asserted claims that are concededly precluded by <em>Body.\u201d </em>The new claim, Aetna contended, did not relate back to the allegations of the initial and amended complaints Relators filed in 1995 and \u25a0 was therefore time-barred. Moreover, \u201c[t]hese new allegations broadly assert that Aetna .\u2018falsely claim[ed] entitlement to contract payments and accepted] such payments without rendering the services for which the payments were being made\u2019 ... [but] fail to identify a single false claim submitted by Aetna or a single service billed for [something] not provided.\u201d For this reason, the amended complaint was subject to dismissal because Relators\u2019 new claim had not been pled with particularity, as required by Rule 9(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-11\">On June 26, 2001, the district court denied Aetna\u2019s motion. Aetna now appeals the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-13\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1328-14\">In denying Aetna\u2019s motion to dismiss, the district court made three rulings. First, Aetna is not entitled to immunity under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395h(i)(3). Second, the Relators\u2019 claim that Aetna was paid for auditing services it either did not perform or performed inadequately is cognizable under the False Claims Act. Third, the Relators\u2019 allegations of fraud are sufficient to satisfy the \u201cparticularity\u201d requirement of Rule 9(b).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Because Aetna is appealing an interlocutory order, which the district court did not certify for immediate appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), our jurisdiction must he under the collateral order doctrine. While 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 gives this court jurisdiction only over \u201cfinal decisions\u201d of the district courts, the collateral order doctrine provides a narrow exception to this rule. The Supreme Court explained that a nonfinal order is appealable when it (1) \u201cconclusively determinefs] the disputed question\u201d; (2) \u201cresolve[s] an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action\u201d; and is (3) \u201ceffectively unreviewable on appeal from a final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>judgment.\u201d <em>Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Livesay, </em>437 U.S. 463, 468, 98 S.Ct. 2454, 2458, 57 L.Ed.2d 351 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-5\">We conclude that the collateral order doctrine provides us with jurisdiction to review the question whether Aetna has immunity with respect to any of the amended complaint's allegations. The doctrine does not, however, give us jurisdiction to review the district court's second and third rulings. Nonetheless, we believe that what we say about the immunity issue should inform the district court's task in dealing with what will remain of Relators' case at this juncture-that is, Relators' claim that Aetna breached its contract obligation to audit St. Johns's records \"as necessary to assure proper payments.\" <footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We intimate no view as to whether Rela-tors' allegations of such breach suffice to state a claim under the False Claims Act and, if so, whether their allegations pass Rule 9(b) muster. See, e.g., United States ex rel. Clausen v. Laboratory Corp. of America, 290 F.3d 1301 (11th Cir.2002) (holding that claims arising under the False Claims Act must satis~r the dictates of Rule 9(b)'s particularity requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-7\">We need not tarry long in holding that, under our decision in <em>United States ex rel. Body v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Alabama, Inc., </em>156 F.3d 1098 (11th Cir.1998), Aetna enjoys absolute immunity under section 1395h(i)(3) for approving for payment the allegedly fraudulent claims that St. Johns presented for reimbursement. Relators recognized this when, in responding to Aetna\u2019s motion to dismiss, they acknowledged that <em>Body </em>foreclosed their claim as pled. In amending their complaint, however, they apparently decided to give it another go. Instead of abandoning the allegations that were con-cededly foreclosed by <em>Body, </em>they instead repeated them in toto and then tacked on paragraphs 43 through 45 and 47 through 51, quoted <em>supra. </em>Relators\u2019 prayer for relief then asks for \u201ctreble the amount of the United States\u2019 damages.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-11\">We assume, and we believe the district court did likewise, that Relators believe that their previous allegations of fraud are part and parcel of their new cause of action; otherwise, they would not have included them in their amended complaint. Given the prayer for damages quoted above, Relators evidently believe that they can, even in the face of Body, recover-from Aetna-the value of the funds St. Johns fraudulently received from the Medicare program (or, indeed, treble that amount). It is obvious, of course, that to allow such a recovery would render section 1395h(i)(3) immunity and the Body decision virtual nullities.</p>\n<p id=\"b1329-12\">Relators' amended complaint, in effect, seeks recovery for the very conduct deemed immune in Body-payment of fraudulent claims by a fiscal intermediary-simply by recasting the theory of recovery from \"aiding and abetting\" to some sort of contractual `res ipsa loqul-twr-something akhi to \"Aetna was being paid by the government to conduct audits, fraudulent claims were paid, therefore Aetna must have not properly performed audits.\" If Relators' view were the law, all that a q'ai tam relator would have to do to circumvent Body and state a cause of action under the False Claims Act against a fiscal intermediary would be to allege that the fiscal intermediary approved a provider's fraudulent claims for reimbursement and that the intermediary approved the claims because it failed properly to audit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>the provider\u2019s books. Thus, \u201cbut for\u201d the intermediary\u2019s failure to do its job, the false claims would not have been paid and the United States would have suffered no loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-4\">We held in Body that \u201cfiscal intermediaries themselves will not be liable to the Government for <em>any </em>of the payments ... certified by [its] certifying officers and disbursed by disbursing officers.\u201d 156 F.3d at 1111. This absolute immunity was, we held, a recognition of the unique administrative function that fiscal intermediaries play in the operation of the Medicare system and Congress\u2019s unwillingness to impose liability for the vast amounts of federal money they disburse. <em>Id. </em>at 1112. Relators may not circumvent this immunity and recover for fraudulently disbursed payments by simply alleging a failure to audit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-5\">In our <em>Body </em>decision, we noted that the statutory immunity is not so broad as to foreclose all claims against fiscal intermediaries. <em>See </em>156 F.3d at 1112, n. 26. Our decision today is not to the contrary. If Aetna, in fact, failed to fulfill its contractual obligation to properly audit St. Johns\u2019s records, then it might be liable to the United States, or a <em>qui tarn </em>relator, under the False Claims Act for submitting a claim for payment for auditing services never rendered. The legal or factual feasibility of such a claim is not before us, however, in this interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-6\">In sum, Relators\u2019 allegations that St. Johns presented false claims to Aetna\u2014 pursuant to a scheme fashioned by St. Johns, Friedman, and Aetna to defraud the United States \u2014 and that Aetna knowingly, recklessly, or negligently approved such claims for payment are not actionable due to Aetna\u2019s statutory immunity, and we instruet the district court to strike them from the amended complaint.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Relators\u2019 <em>qui tam </em>claim, if they indeed have one under the False Claims Act, is limited to the false claims, if any, Aetna presented to the Secretary (within the statute of limitations time period) for auditing St. Johns\u2019s records.</p>\n<p id=\"b1330-12\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1321-9\">.

The complaint alleged that, on July 22, 1993, Aetna informed St. Johns that it was withholding the PIPs because, among other things, it was \u201cskeptical that St. Johns had in fact made [the] 1,150,000 Medicare home health visits in FY 1993\u201c it claimed to have made.

In its order, the court characterized St. Johns\u2019s request as one for a bankruptcy court determination of, \"at least on a 'provisional' basis, the amount of existing defaults under the Provider Agreement ...

By an order dated August 14, 1995, the court authorized the debtor to distribute approximately $738,633 (which was not included in the sale to Amitan Health Services, Inc.) to the holders of the Chapter 11 administrative claims.

Like the November 2, 1995 amended complaint, the new complaint alleged that Aetna's conduct in approving St. Johns\u2019s claims and presenting them to CMS for Medicare reimbursement was \"part of the scheme by St. Johns, Friedman and Aetna to defraud the United States.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1327-7\">.
