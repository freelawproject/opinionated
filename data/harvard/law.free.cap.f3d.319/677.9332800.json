He argues that the district court erred in going beyond the statute of conviction and the charging instrument to determine that a 16-level increase in his offense level was warranted under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii). He contends that the reasoning from our decisions interpreting the \u201ccareer offender\u201d guidelines, U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4B1.1 and 4B1.2, should be applied, which limit consideration to the conduct charged in the indictment, rather than the underlying conduct of the offense. <em>See, United States v. Gaitan, </em>954 F.2d 1005, 1009-11 (5th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Fitzhugh, </em>954 F.2d 253, 254-55 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">Our holdings in <em>Gaitan </em>and <em>Fitzhugh </em>were based on specific language contained in the commentary to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, limiting the sentencing court\u2019s inquiry to the conduct alleged in the indictment in determining whether the enhancement applies. Neither U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 nor its commentary contains such limiting language. -Furthermore, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 instructs that when determining the defendant\u2019s \u201cspecific offense characteristics\u201d under Chapter Two of the Guidelines, \u201c[c]onduct that is not formally charged or is not an element of the offense of conviction may enter into the determination of the applicable guideline sentencing range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment, (backg\u2019d). We conclude, therefore, that the district court did not misapply U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(vii).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-14\">Sanchez also contends that the sentence-enhancing provisions contained in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are facially unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Sanchez acknowledges that his argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but seeks to preserve the issue for further review. The judgment of the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"b706-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
