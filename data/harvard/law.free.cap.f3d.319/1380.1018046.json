Co. v. United States, </em>303 F.3d 1373 (Fed.Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b973-15\">Travelers argues that we should remand this case because, even under our original decision, issues remain to be resolved by the Court of Federal Claims concerning the foreign tax credit issue. The court invited the United States to respond. In its response, the government initially urged that no issues remained to be resolved. (Appellant\u2019s Resp. to Pet. for Panel Reh\u2019g.) However, by letter dated January 21, 2003, the government advised us that, on further reflection, it agreed that one issue remains to be resolved, namely whether \u201cthe IRS made a computational error with respect to the 1975 and 1978 taxable years.\u201d Under these circumstances we agree that a remand is appropriate for this limited purpose. However, we reject the taxpayer\u2019s contention that a remand is required to address other issues concerning the foreign tax credit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1381\">*1381</page-number>The taxpayer also seeks reconsideration of our decision with respect to the foreign currency translation issue.
