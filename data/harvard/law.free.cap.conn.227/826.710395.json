We conclude that in this instance, the taxpayer is so precluded, and we therefore affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-11\">The facts are not in dispute. The plaintiff, IBM Credit Corporation (IBM), leases computer equipment throughout the United States, including the city of Hartford. Hartford requires lessors, such as IBM, to pay personal property tax on all personal property located in Hartford.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-12\">Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-43,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> nonresident owners of personal property are required to file inven<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>tories of their personal property with the assessor\u2019s office of the town in which the property is located. Accordingly, IBM filed an inventory of personal property it owned in 1989 and 1990 with the Hartford assessor\u2019s office, using a form provided by the Hartford assessor. That form contains a standard depreciation schedule for personal property that IBM used when listing its property. Relying exclusively on the information provided by IBM, the Hartford assessor determined the value of IBM\u2019s personal property located in Hartford for the 1989 and 1990 tax years to be that which had been specified by IBM in its filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Subsequently, IBM appealed the assessments of its personal property to the Hartford board of tax review pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-111.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> IBM claimed that the assessments of two computer systems (here<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>after, the \u201c83B\u201d and \u201c84Q\u201d) in 1989 and 1990 were excessive. The board of tax review denied IBM\u2019s appeal with respect to the valuation of the 83B and 84Q.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> IBM appealed the decision of the board of tax review to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-117a.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">Following an evidentiary hearing, the Superior Court dismissed IBM\u2019s appeal and rendered judgment for the board of tax review. IBM appealed from the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">IBM claims that the assessor\u2019s form (specifically the printed depreciation schedule therein) did not accurately reflect the depreciation of the 83B and 84Q. The trial court did not reach the merits of that claim. The trial court noted that IBM had not been prevented from presenting additional evidence of the fair market value of the 83B and 84Q to the assessor simply because the assessor\u2019s office had provided a standard form for that purpose. IBM was not prevented from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>providing a rider or other addendum to the assessor\u2019s form to contest or otherwise suggest an alternative depreciation schedule for the 83B and 84Q.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">It is well settled that it is the responsibility of the taxpayer to provide the assessor with sufficient facts to value personal property for tax purposes. <em>Northeast Datacom, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wallingford, </em>212 Conn. 639, 649, 563 A.2d 688 (1989); <em>Cooley Chevrolet Co. </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>146 Conn. 165, 169, 148 A.2d 327 (1959); <em>Pitt </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>117 Conn. 388, 393, 167 A. 913 (1933). \u201cIf [the taxpayer] fails to do so, the assessors are only required to act upon the best information they can obtain . . . and the taxpayer cannot justly complain if the assessors, acting in good faith, make an error in judgment in listing and valuing [its] property.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Northeast Datacom, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wallingford, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The trial court reasonably concluded that the action of the board of tax review upholding the disputed assessments was appropriate. We have no grounds for overturning that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b848-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 12-43 provides in relevant part: \u201cproperty of nonresidents.
