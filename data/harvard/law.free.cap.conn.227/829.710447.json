Whitney, be suspended from the practice of law for one year after he refused on several occasions to attend a pretrial conference in a criminal matter. In this appeal from the judgment of the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>court imposing suspension, the defendant claims that: (1) the practice of scheduling mandatory pretrial conferences in criminal matters is unconstitutional under the state and federal constitutions; (2) General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-172 and 53a-173<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are unconstitutional under the state and federal constitutions; and (3) mandatory criminal pretrial conferences are used by Connecticut courts to demoralize defendants and impair their constitutional rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We reject these claims as bases for overturning the suspension and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The essential facts are undisputed. In January, 1990, the defendant, a member of the Connecticut bar, filed an appearance on behalf of Francisco Ramos in the Hartford judicial district of the Superior Court. Ramos <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>had been charged by the state with the crimes of arson in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-lll, risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21, and threatening in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-62.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Prior to the scheduling of a pretrial conference, Ramos had been arraigned, had pleaded not guilty to all three charges and had elected a jury trial on all three counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">On January 18,1990, the defendant appeared in court at a bond hearing for Ramos. The court, <em>Norko, J., </em>continued the case to February 2,1990, for a pretrial conference, and ordered that the defendant, Ramos and the assistant state\u2019s attorney handling the case be present.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">On January 23,1990, the defendant sent a letter to Judge Norko requesting that the court \u201chave the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>set down for a firm jury\u201d because a pretrial conference would be \u201cabsolutely senseless, time-consuming and unfairly expense-producing\u201d and would be \u201ca breach of [Ramos\u2019] . . . rights under both the constitution of Connecticut and that of the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant did not appear in court on February 2,1990. The court continued the case to February 16, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">On February 14, 1990, the defendant sent another letter to Judge Norko, claiming that a pretrial conference would be \u201csenseless\u201d and a \u201csham performance,\u201d and would deny Ramos \u201cconstitutional treatment.\u201d When the defendant did not appear in court on February 16, Judge Norko questioned Ramos about his attorney\u2019s absence. Ramos stated that the defendant had told him that the defendant did not plan to attend the pretrial conference because he was unprepared. Ramos also indicated that the defendant had failed to communicate a plea offer to him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The trial court, <em>Norko, J., </em>fined the defendant $100 pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-84<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for the failure to appear and set the case down for another pretrial conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">On four more occasions from February 16 to April 12, 1990, the defendant failed to appear in court for pretrial conferences as ordered. The court imposed another $100 fine pursuant to \u00a7 51-84 for failing to appear and continued the case on the firm trial list.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>The defendant did not appear in court until August, 1990, when the case was called for trial. At that time, the defendant conferred with Ramos, the prosecutor and the trial judge, <em>Mia\u00f1o, J., </em>and the state offered to reduce Ramos\u2019 charges. Ramos agreed to a disposition of his case on the reduced charges and to serve a short jail sentence followed by probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">On April 19,1990, a week after the defendant\u2019s final failure to appear for the pretrial conference, Judge Norko sent a letter to the plaintiff, the statewide grievance committee, that summarized the defendant\u2019s conduct in connection with Ramos\u2019 case. The statewide grievance committee referred Judge Norko\u2019s letter to a grievance panel that considered the letter, the transcripts from three of the days on which the defendant had failed to appear, and copies of the letters that the defendant had sent to Judge Norko.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Thereafter, the panel filed a formal complaint against the defendant with the statewide grievance committee<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>that was forwarded to the grievance panel for the Hartford-New Britain judicial district. On August 9, 1990, that grievance panel found probable cause to believe that the defendant had violated rules 1.3,3.4 (c), 3.5 (c) and 8.4 (d) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The reviewing subcommittee of the statewide grievance committee held a hearing on the complaint against the defendant,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and thereafter issued its proposed deei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>sion finding that the defendant had violated rules 1.3, 3.4 (c), 3.5 (c) and 8.4 (d), and recommending that he be presented to the Superior Court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">The grievance committee adopted the reviewing subcommittee\u2019s proposed decision and recommendation, and filed an amended presentment of the defendant to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-90h (b) and Practice Book \u00a7 31.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The presentment alleged that the defendant had violated rules 1.3, 3.4 (c), 3.5 (c) and 8.4 (d) of the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>On August 18,1992, the trial court, <em>Maloney, J., </em>concluded that the defendant\u2019s repeated refusals to obey court orders to appear for pretrial conferences had violated rules 3.4 (c) and 8.4 (d). The trial court reprimanded the defendant and ordered him to pay the two $100 fines that had been imposed by Judge Norko. The court also ordered that the defendant be suspended from the practice of law for a one year period beginning September 5, 1992, if he did not pay the fines by September 4, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">The defendant did not pay either of the two fines and was therefore suspended effective September 5,1992.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>He appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4023 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Before turning to the defendant\u2019s specific claims, it is appropriate to discuss attorney disciplinary proceedings and the exact nature of the claims asserted by the defendant in this appeal. We have held that \u201c[\u00a1judges of the Superior Court possess the inherent authority to regulate attorney conduct and to discipline the members of the bar. . . . It is their unique position as officers and commissioners of the court . . . which casts attorneys in a special relationship with the judiciary and subjects them to its discipline. . . . [Tjhe judges have empowered the statewide grievance committee to file presentments in Superior Court seeking judicial sanctions against those claimed to be guilty of misconduct. ... In carrying out these responsibilities . . . the [statewide grievance committee] is an arm of the court . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Sobocinski </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>215 Conn. 517, 525-26, 576 A.2d 532 (1990). In presentment proceedings, the statewide grievance committee must prove by clear and convincing evidence that the attorney misconduct it alleges has occurred. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Friedland, </em>222 Conn. 131, 135, 609 A.2d 645 (1992); <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Presnick, </em>215 Conn. 162, 171-72, 575 A.2d 210 (1990) <em>(Presnick </em>1); <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Presnick, </em>216 Conn. 127, 134, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>577 A.2d 1054 (1990) <em>(Presnick II). </em>If the trial court finds that misconduct has occurred, however, an attorney\u2019s \u201crelation to the tribunal, and the character and purpose of the inquiry, are such, that unless it clearly appears that [the attorney\u2019s] rights have in some substantial way been denied him, the action of the court will not be set aside upon review.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Rozbicki, </em>219 Conn. 473, 487, 595 A.2d 819 (1991), cert. denied, U.S. , 112 S. Ct. 1170, 117 L. Ed. 2d 416 (1992); <em>Presnick II, </em>supra, 132; <em>In re Durant, </em>80 Conn. 140, 150, 67 A. 497 (1907). In presentment proceedings, the court conducts a trial de novo. <em>Presnick I, </em>supra, 167.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The trial court held that the defendant had violated rules 3.4 (c) and 8.4 (d) by openly disobeying Judge Norko\u2019s repeated orders to appear in court for pretrial conferences. The defendant does not claim that the trial court abused its discretion in making those findings.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> His claims, rather, resemble affirmative defenses, i.e., that because criminal pretrial conferences are unconstitutional or unjust, his conduct should be excused.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>We therefore need not review the propriety of the trial court\u2019s findings that the defendant violated rules 3.4 (c) and 8.4 (d).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">The defendant first claims that the practice of scheduling mandatory pretrial conferences in criminal matters is unconstitutional under the state and federal constitutions. He specifically challenges Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 700 through 706, which permit trial courts to schedule disposition conferences for criminal cases assigned for jury trials, and to compel the attendance of the parties and their attorneys.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The defendant claims that pretrial conferences ordered pursuant to these Practice Book provisions violate a criminal defendant\u2019s right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>against self-incrimination under the fifth amendment to the United States constitution,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the right to a speedy trial under the sixth amendment to the United States constitution,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and the right to a jury trial guaranteed by article first, \u00a7 19, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>As a preliminary matter, we note that pretrial negotiations play a critical role in the criminal justice system. In <em>Szarwak </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>167 Conn. 10, 17, 355 A.2d 49 (1974), we recognized \u201cthe importance of plea bargaining in the administration of criminal justice.\u201d Specifically, \u201c \u2018[disposition of charges after plea discussions is not only an essential part of the process but a highly desirable part for many reasons. It leads to prompt and largely final disposition of most criminal cases; it avoids much of the corrosive impact of enforced idleness during pretrial confinement for those who are denied release pending trial; it protects the public from those accused persons who are prone to continue criminal conduct even while on pretrial release; and, by shortening the time between charge and disposition, it enhances whatever may be the rehabilitative prospects of the guilty when they are ultimately imprisoned. See <em>Brady </em>v. <em>United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 751-752 [90 S. Ct. 1463, 25 L. Ed. 2d 747] (1970).\u2019 <em>Santobello </em>v. <em>New York, </em>[404 U.S. 257, 261, 92 S. Ct. 495, 30 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1971)].\u201d <em>Szarwak </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra; see also <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>29 Conn. App. 773, 777, 617 A.2d 933 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Nelson, </em>23 Conn. App. 215, 218, 579 A.2d 1104, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 826, 582 A.2d 205 (1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 922, 111 S. Ct. 1315, 113 L. Ed. 2d 248 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">In <em>Santobello, </em>the United States Supreme Court stated that plea bargaining \u201cis an essential component of the administration of justice. Properly administered, it is to be encouraged. If every criminal charge were subjected to a full-scale trial, the States and the Federal Government would need to multiply by many times the number of judges and court facilities.\u201d <em>Santobello </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, 260;<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> see also <em>Bordenkircher </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number><em>Hayes, </em>434 U.S. 357, 361-62, 98 S. Ct. 663, 54 L. Ed. 2d 604, reh. denied, 435 U.S. 918, 98 S. Ct. 1477, 55 L. Ed. 2d 511 (1978) (plea bargaining is an important part of the criminal justice system); D. Wright, \u201cPlea Bargaining\u2014A Necessary Tool,\u201d 16 Conn. L. Rev. 1015 (1984) .</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">The defendant concedes that pretrial negotiations are an important and necessary part of the criminal justice system, and acknowledges that they often benefit criminal defendants. Indeed, in this case, once discussions were finally held among the defendant, Ramos and the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office, the case was disposed of favorably to Ramos. Despite the conceded benefits of pretrial negotiations, the defendant nevertheless claims that it is unconstitutional for a judge to compel a criminal defendant and his or her attorney to attend a pretrial conference.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The defendant has not, however, established any facts to support this claim. It does not appear that Ramos objected to having a pretrial conference, and there is nothing in the record to suggest that he was in any way prejudiced by the court\u2019s scheduling of a conference. Nor is there anything in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>this record to support the defendant\u2019s claim that criminal defendants are compelled to incriminate themselves at pretrial conferences. Similarly, there is nothing in this record to support the defendant\u2019s claim that court ordered pretrial conferences prejudice a criminal defendant\u2019s right to a jury trial or to a speedy trial.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> It is entirely possible that, had the defendant attended the February 2, 1990 pretrial conference as ordered by the court, the parties would have negotiated a disposition of the case, or Judge Norko would have set a firm jury trial date. This could have been accomplished without prejudicing Ramos\u2019 right to a speedy trial before a jury or in any way compelling him to incriminate himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">\u201cThis court has frequently noted the imprudence of adjudicating constitutional questions in a \u2018factual <em>vacuum.\u2019Lehrer v.Davis, </em>214 Conn. 232, 234, 571 A.2d 691 (1990); <em>Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Assn. of the United States, Inc. </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>203 Conn. 63, 75, 523 A.2d 486 (1987).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Floyd, </em>217 Conn. 73, 78, 584 A.2d 1157 (1991). \u201c[Constitutional issues do not exist in a vacuum. . . . \u2018 \u201cThe best teaching of this Court\u2019s experience admonishes us not to entertain constitutional questions in advance of the strictest necessity.\u201d <em>Parker </em>v. <em>Los Angeles, </em>338 U.S. 327, 333, 70 S.

Attempting to overturn the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>contempt findings, the defendant challenged the constitutionality of the Practice Book provisions governing the appointment of rent receivers. This court would not consider his claim, however, because the record did not contain any information on what transpired at the receivership proceedings. Id., 378. We stated that \u201c[i]n challenging the constitutionality of any enactment a party <em>must demonstrate its adverse impact upon his own constitutionally protected rights. Kellems </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>163 Conn. 478, 483, 313 A.2d 53 (1972), appeal dismissed, 409 U.S. 1099, 93 S. Ct. 911, 34 L. Ed. 2d 678 (1973). Without a proper record we are unable to consider these claims of the defendant concerning the constitutionality of our procedure . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Burritt Mutual Savings Bank of New Britain </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>supra, 379. In this case, because the defendant has not provided a factual record to substantiate his claim that court-ordered criminal pretrial conferences are unconstitutional, we are unable to consider the merits of his claim.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-172 and 53a-173<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> as applied to criminal defendants are unconstitutional under the state and federal constitutions. We note, first, that this issue was never raised before the trial court. \u201cOnly in the most exceptional circumstances will this court consider a claim that was not raised in the trial court.\u201d <em>Adolphson </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>205 Conn. 703, 716, 535 A.2d 799 (1988); see also Practice Book \u00a7 4185 (this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"846\">*846</page-number>court \u201cshall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial\u201d); <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. <em>Friedland, </em>supra, 147; <em>Knight </em>v. <em>Bourbeau, </em>194 Conn. 702, 704, 485 A.2d 919 (1984). This general rule against considering claims not raised at trial also applies to constitutional issues. <em>Berry </em>v. <em>Loiseau, </em>223 Conn. 786, 828, 614 A.2d 414 (1992); <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>186 Conn. 490, 505, 442 A.2d 911 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Even if exceptional circumstances were present in this case, we would not consider this claim because the defendant does not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-172 and 53a-173. \u201c \u2018According to well-established principles, a [party] who challenges the constitutionality of a statute must prove that the statute has adversely affected a constitutionally protected right \u201cunder the facts of his particular case and not merely under some possible or hypothetical set of facts not proven to exist.\u201d <em>Hardware Mutual Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Premo, </em>153 Conn. 465, 471, 217 A.2d 698 (1966) . . . .\u2019 <em>Weil </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>185 Conn. 495, 501, 441 A.2d 142 (1981). \u2018 \u201c[judicial power is to be exercised to strike down legislation, whether state or federal, only at the instance of one who is himself immediately harmed, or immediately threatened with harm, by the challenged action.\u201d <em>Poe </em>v. <em>Ullman, </em>[367 U.S. 497, 504, 81 S.

Therefore, only criminal defendants, not their attorneys, may be penalized under the statute. Even if an attorney could somehow achieve standing to challenge the validity of these statutes based on the rights of his or her client, it is not possible in this case. Because Ramos was incarcerated on the days when the pretrial conferences were ordered to be held, \u00a7\u00a7 53a-172 and 53a-173 could not have been applied to him. He was therefore never harmed or threatened with harm by these statutes and consequently would have no standing to challenge their constitutionality. The defendant therefore may not challenge the statutes based on his status as Ramos\u2019 attorney. Accordingly, we do not consider the defendant\u2019s second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">The defendant\u2019s third claim is that mandatory criminal pretrial conferences are used by Connecticut courts to demoralize defendants and impair their constitutional rights. Once again, a review of the record reveals that this issue was never raised in the trial court. Furthermore, there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that pretrial conferences were used to demoralize or otherwise prejudice Ramos in any way. We therefore will not consider this claim further.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b853-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-172 provides: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of failure to appear in the first degree when, while charged with the commission of a felony and while out on bail or released under other procedure of law, he wilfully fails to appear when legally called according to the terms of his bail bond or promise to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">\u201c(b) Failure to appear in the first degree is a class D felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b853-8\">General Statutes \u00a7 53a-173 provides: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of failure to appear in the second degree when, while charged with the commission of a misdemeanor or a motor vehicle violation for which a sentence to a term of imprisonment may be imposed and while out on bail or released under other procedure of law, he wilfully fails to appear when legally called according to the terms of Ms bail bond or promise to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">\u201c(b) Failure to appear in the second degree is a class A misdemeanor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b853-10\"> The issues on appeal, as framed by the parties in their briefs, are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">\u201c1.

He did not dispute, however, the allegations that he had violated Rules 3.4 (c) and 8.4 (d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b861-7\"> The defendant asks this court to reverse the trial court and \u201cfind that the Appellant acted within the purview of the law in refusing to attend coerced criminal pretrials because to have so done would have compelled him to violate his attorney\u2019s oath and been against the Constitutions of the United States of America and Connecticut.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">Both the defendant and the plaintiff have framed the issues in this appeal in terms of whether there is \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that the claims asserted by the defendant are true. It is not clear, however, that the defendant in a presentment proceeding must meet this high burden of proof when he or she asserts claims resembling affirmative defenses. Because our disposition of the defendant\u2019s claims does not require us to reach their merits, we leave this issue for another day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b862-7\"> More specifically, the defendant does not claim that the letters that he sent to Judge Norko in February, 1990, constitute the \u201copen refusal based on an assertion that no valid obligation exists\u201d needed to excuse a refusal to comply with a court\u2019s order under rule 3.4 (c) of the Rules of Professional Conduct. See footnote 9. The trial court held that the defendant\u2019s assertion that no valid obligation existed \u201cwas without the slightest legal foundation\u201d and did not excuse the disobedience. Because the defendant does not ask us to review this holding, we need not consider whether the defendant\u2019s letters to Judge Norko, containing a bare assertion of unconstitutionality, constitute the kind of open refusal that the rule contemplates. Similarly, the defendant does not challenge the holding of the trial court that his conduct was \u201cprejudicial to the administration of justice\u201d under rule 8.4 (d).
