Klein<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (Polymer), for a temporary injunction restraining the defendant, Timothy R.E. Keeney, the commissioner of environmental protection (commissioner), from requiring Polymer to conduct certain emission control testing at its manufacturing facility in Farmington. The trial court concluded that it had jurisdiction over Polymer\u2019s application for injunctive relief and, after a hearing, granted that application in part. The commissioner sought and received permission to file an immediate expedited appeal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from that portion of the trial court\u2019s order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>granting Polymer injunctive relief. The commissioner claims that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain Polymer\u2019s application for a temporary injunction because Polymer had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. We agree with the commissioner and therefore reverse the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Polymer processes plastic pellets at its thermoplastics manufacturing facility in Farmington. On April 9, 1992, after investigation of the gaseous emissions resulting from Polymer\u2019s manufacturing processes, the commissioner issued an ex parte cease and desist order (order) against Polymer pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-7.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In that order, the commissioner found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>the manufacturing process employed by Polymer had resulted in the emission of certain substances<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> into the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>ambient air<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that \u201ccan cause and are causing or are likely to cause damage to the health of persons in the vicinity of the site, including headaches, throat inflammation, nose irritation, exacerbations of chronic respiratory conditions including asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other respiratory or pulmonary diseases and symptoms,\u201d and that those emissions were \u201clikely to result in imminent and substantial damage to the public health.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The order directed Polymer to cease any manufacturing process that resulted in the emission of the specified substances, and prohibited Polymer from resuming such processing until it had: (1) installed pollution control equipment that adequately controlled emissions from its manufacturing processes; (2) conducted stack testing of its emissions in a manner and for a length of time approved by the commissioner; and (3) submitted a detailed written report for the commissioner\u2019s approval certifying that air emissions from the site would not result in imminent and substantial damage to the public health. The order also expressly authorized the commissioner to approve or disapprove any \u201cdocument, report or other action\u201d concerning the control of emissions into the air at the site, or to approve any such document, report or action \u201cwith such conditions or modifications as the commissioner deems necessary to carry out the purposes\u201d of the order. The order further required Polymer, upon notification by the commissioner that any document, report or action was deficient, to correct that deficiency to the satisfaction of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">Polymer ceased its plastic processing operations upon receipt of the order. On April 16, 1992, the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>sioner commenced a hearing pursuant to \u00a7 22a-7 (c) concerning the issuance of the ex parte order. On April 27, 1992, however, after several days of testimony before the department of environmental protection (DEP) hearing officer, Polymer notified the commissioner that it would no longer contest the order and, although not conceding the underlying findings of the commissioner, would agree to be bound by the terms of the order. The commissioner agreed that Polymer\u2019s acceptance of the terms of the order obviated the need for any further testimony before the hearing officer. On May 1, 1992, the hearing officer, therefore, filed a final administrative decision and order (final order), which specifically incorporated the provisions of the April 9,1992 order.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The final order also contained the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>hearing officer\u2019s finding that the \u201crecord lacks sufficient technical evidence to support imposition of an additional requirement for [precontrol]led stack testing.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">By letter dated May 14, 1992, the commissioner approved, with modifications, Polymer\u2019s proposed two phase stack testing plan. The plan provided that upon completion of the first phase of testing, which was to last a total of forty days, Polymer was to cease its manufacturing operations and to submit a plan for second phase testing. Upon approval by the commissioner of a second phase plan, Polymer would be authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>to resume its manufacturing operations. The May 14, 1992 letter also directed Polymer to cease its manufacturing operations if any one of several events occurred, including the detection by DEP personnel of any odor emanating from the stack of Polymer\u2019s plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">On May 18,1992, Polymer resumed its manufacturing operations in a manner consistent with the terms of the first phase testing plan<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and thereafter submitted reports to the commissioner as required by the final order.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> By letter dated June 25, 1992, however, the commissioner ordered Polymer immediately to cease its manufacturing operations because on that date DEP personnel had detected an odor at the stack of Polymer\u2019s plant. The commissioner explained that the \u201cpresence of an odor is an indication that the control systems at the facility were not functioning properly, and were allowing substances which are likely to damage public health to escape into the air.\u201d In his June 25, 1992 letter, the commissioner invited Polymer to submit a report explaining the reason for the odor and a proposal to rectify the problem, \u201ctaking into consideration the apparent premature failure of the control systems, [and] consistent health complaints during the course of testing.\u201d The commissioner prohibited Polymer, however, from resuming its manufacturing operations and stack testing procedures until he had expressly authorized Polymer to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Polymer ceased its manufacturing operations as directed and submitted a report to the commissioner, dated June 29, 1992, that sought to allay the commissioner\u2019s concerns about the odor detected at Polymer\u2019s stack. This report suggested a modification of the stack testing plan that had been previously approved by the commissioner and implemented by Polymer. By letter dated July 2, 1992, the commissioner agreed that <em>\u201ca </em>modified testing program is necessary,\u201d but rejected Polymer\u2019s proposed revised testing plan. The commissioner explained that \u201c[t]he odor detected at the stack on June 25, 1992, and the consistent presence in the test results of an unknown and unexpected hydrocarbon, dictate a modification of the testing approach. . . . [Ujnless different data are collected, no person will be able to identify these unknown substances. It is presently impossible to conclude that the unknown hydrocarbon does not pose a health threat. Because of the unexpected presence of the unique odor at the stack on June 25,1992 . . . it is similarly impossible to conclude that non-odorous, harmful chemicals are being controlled by the pollution control equipment. . . . We are not confident that [Polymer\u2019s revised] plan will adequately protect the health of the public given these unexpected and presently inexplicable circumstances.\u201d The commissioner\u2019s revised testing program required the testing of emissions before they entered the pollution control system in the stack in order \u201cto identify all of the compounds that could potentially be released during the processing of polymers ... in order to know what to test for at the outlet of the system.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">Several days after it had received the commissioner\u2019s letter of July 2, 1992, Polymer submitted additional reports to the commissioner. Polymer contended that precontrol stack testing was unnecessary and unreasonably costly, that resumption of the manufacturing process would not pose any risk to the public health, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>and that any odor from Polymer\u2019s stack emissions would be imperceptible to anyone off-site. In an effort to reach a compromise acceptable to the parties, DEP personnel and representatives of Polymer met to discuss the reports and Polymer\u2019s objections to the requirements of the July 2, 1992 letter.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> On July 13, 1992, however, before the completion of these discussions, Polymer sought and obtained an ex parte temporary restraining order from the trial court, <em>Dean, J., </em>prohibiting the commissioner from (1) interfering with Polymer\u2019s operations as permitted prior to the issuance of the July 2,1992 letter, and (2) requiring Polymer to perform precontrol stack testing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Subsequently, a hearing was held on Polymer\u2019s application for a temporary injunction, which had been filed by Polymer with its application for a temporary restraining order. After thirty-three days of testimony, the trial court, <em>Nigro, J., </em>denied the commissioner\u2019s renewed motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust available administrative remedies, and granted Polymer\u2019s application in part. Although it acknowledged that the testimony produced \u201ca conflict among distinguished experts who have each presented impressive credentials,\u201d the court found that the commissioner\u2019s require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>ment of precontrol testing was \u201cunnecessary and unreasonable,\u201d that compliance with that requirement would cause Polymer \u201cirreparable loss,\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that Polymer had no adequate remedy at law.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court therefore enjoined the commissioner from requiring Polymer to conduct precontrol stack testing. The court also enjoined the commissioner from requiring Polymer to cease its manufacturing operations during any period of time needed by the commissioner to approve a phase two testing plan upon completion of the first phase of testing. The court denied Polymer\u2019s application for injunctive relief with respect to two other testing methods required by the commissioner,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but placed certain technical limitations on the commissioner as to the precise manner in which those testing methods were to be conducted.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">In this court, the commissioner claims that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain Polymer\u2019s application for injunctive relief because Polymer had improperly failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. The commissioner claims specifically that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Polymer failed to exhaust its administrative remedies because it had not sought a declaratory ruling by the commissioner pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-176 (a)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> on the issue of precontrol stack testing.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Polymer maintains that: (1) a declaratory ruling under \u00a7 4-176 (a) was not available to it; (2) the commissioner\u2019s imposition of precontrol stack testing constituted a modification of the final order and required the commissioner to issue a second cease and desist order pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-181a (b);<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and (3) even if Polymer would otherwise have been required to seek a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>declaratory ruling by the commissioner on the issue of precontrol stack testing, it need not have done so because it had satisfied several exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine. We agree with the commissioner.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">\u201c \u2018It is a settled principle of administrative law that, if an adequate administrative remedy exists, it must be exhausted before the Superior Court will obtain jurisdiction to act in the matter.\u2019 \u201d <em>LaCroix </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>199 Conn. 70, 83-84, 505 A.2d 1233 (1986), quoting <em>Connecticut Mobile Home Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Jensen\u2019s, Inc., </em>178 Conn. 586, 588, 424 A.2d 285 (1979). Furthermore, \u201c[bjecause the exhaustion doctrine implicates subject matter jurisdiction, we must decide as a threshold matter whether that doctrine requires dismissal of the plaintiffs\u2019claim. . . . [W]henever a court discovers that it has no jurisdiction, it is bound to dismiss the case, without regard to its previous rulings.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Concerned Citizens of Sterling </em>v. <em>Sterling, </em>204 Conn. 551, 556-57, 529 A.2d 666 (1987).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Polymer argues that it was not required to seek a declaratory ruling pursuant to \u00a7 4-176 (a) because the commissioner lacked statutory authority to direct Poly<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>mer to conduct precontrol stack testing. Specifically, Polymer claims that the authority granted to the commissioner under General Statutes \u00a7 22a-174 to adopt regulations to control and prohibit air pollution does not extend to the regulation of emissions before those emissions had been treated by Polymer\u2019s pollution control system. We have held, however, that \u201c[wjhere there is in place a mechanism for adequate judicial review, such as that contained in [General Statutes] \u00a7 4-183,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> it is the general rule that an administrative agency may and must determine whether it has jurisdiction in a particular situation. When a particular statute authorizes an administrative agency to act in a particular situation it necessarily confers upon such agency authority to determine whether the situation is such as to authorize the agency to act\u2014that is, to determine the coverage of the statute\u2014and this question need not, and in fact cannot, be initially decided by a court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Greater Bridgeport Transit District </em>v. <em>Local Union 1336, </em>211 Conn. 436, 439, 559 A.2d 1113 (1989); <em>Cannata </em>v. <em>Department of Environmental Protection, </em>215 Conn. 616, 623, 577 A.2d 1017 (1990). Because Polymer could have appealed to the Superior Court pursuant to \u00a7 4-183 from any adverse declaratory ruling by the commissioner concerning his authority to direct Polymer to conduct precontrol stack testing, Polymer was required to request such a declaratory ruling before seeking redress in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Polymer next claims that it need not have sought a declaratory ruling on the issue of precontrol stack test<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>ing because the commissioner\u2019s letter of July 2,1992, constituted a modification of the final order under \u00a7 4-18 la (b) for which the commissioner was required to issue a second cease and desist order. Polymer bases this argument on the assertion that the commissioner could not have construed the final order as authorizing him to require Polymer to conduct precontrol stack testing. We disagree with Polymer.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">The final order, cast in broad terms consistent with the commissioner\u2019s broad statutory mandate in matters of environmental protection,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> provided the commissioner with wide latitude to monitor and regulate Polymer\u2019s manufacturing processes. That order required Polymer, inter alia, to cease its plastics processing operations until it had: (1) installed adequate pollution control equipment; (2) submitted a plan to the commissioner for stack testing of its emissions; (3) ceased the emission of any substance likely to result in imminent and substantial damage to the public health; and (4) submitted a detailed report to the commissioner certifying that its emissions would not cause such damage. Moreover, all documents and reports submitted to the commissioner and all actions undertaken by Polymer relating to its gaseous emissions required approval by the commissioner prior to the resumption of its manufacturing processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>In addition, the precontrol emissions testing required by the commissioner\u2019s letter of July 2, 1992, was to have been conducted at the stack of Polymer\u2019s plant. Although such tests were to have been performed on the gaseous emissions before they had reached Polymer\u2019s pollution control system, the precontrol testing described in the commissioner\u2019s July 2,1992 letter was, therefore, a method of stack testing. The final order, moreover, places no limitations or conditions on the commissioner\u2019s discretion with respect to the manner in which Polymer was to have conducted such testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Indeed, the final order required Polymer to submit a written stack testing plan \u201cto conduct stack testing <em>in a manner and for a length of time approved by the commissioner. </em>The plan shall include stack testing of the processing of all substances which [Polymer] intends or desires to process at the site in the future.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This sweeping language, which Polymer chose not to contest, granted the commissioner broad authority to require stack testing of a method and duration that, in the commissioner\u2019s judgment, would have reduced the risk of any damage to the environment. We agree with the commissioner, therefore, that he reasonably could have interpreted the term \u201cstack testing\u201d in the final order to include the testing of emissions before those emissions had entered Polymer\u2019s pollution control system in the stack.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Polymer contends that a different conclusion is required because the hearing officer determined that the technical evidence presented at the hearing on the cease and desist order did not warrant the imposition of precontrol stack testing. The hearing was truncated, however, due to Polymer\u2019s decision, announced during the hearing and before the commissioner had concluded the presentation of his evidence, to abide by the broad terms of the commissioner\u2019s order. Polymer\u2019s decision not to contest the terms of the order rendered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>any further presentation of evidence by the commissioner unnecessary. In such circumstances, and in view of the expansive language of the final order, we are persuaded that the order can reasonably be interpreted to have authorized the imposition of precontrol stack testing by the commissioner. We conclude, therefore, that the commissioner was not obligated to issue a second cease and desist order directing Polymer to conduct precontrol stack testing, and that Polymer was required to have requested a declaratory ruling from the commissioner on the issue of such testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Polymer finally contends that it should be excused for failing to exhaust its administrative remedies because it has satisfied several exceptions to the exhaustion rule. \u201cThere are some exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine, \u2018although we have recognized such exceptions only infrequently and only for narrowly defined purposes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>207 Conn. 346, 353, 542 A.2d 672 (1988), quoting <em>LaCroix </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 79. We have recognized that a party aggrieved by a decision of an administrative agency may be excused from exhaustion of administrative remedies if: recourse to the administrative remedy would be futile or inadequate; <em>Greenwich </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>191 Conn. 528, 541-42, 469 A.2d 382 (1983); the procedures followed by the administrative agency are constitutionally infirm; <em>LaCroix </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra; or injunctive relief from an agency decision is necessary to prevent immediate and irreparable harm. <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>supra, 370. We do not agree that Polymer\u2019s failure to satisfy the exhaustion requirement falls into any of these recognized exceptions to that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Polymer first claims that it would have been futile for it to have sought a declaratory ruling by the commissioner on the issue of precontrol stack testing. See <em>Greenwich </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>supra. Polymer argues that the commissioner had already directed it to conduct precontrol testing and that there was no reason for Polymer to have believed that the commissioner would have reversed or modified his decision. We have held, however, that a mere conclusory assertion that an agency will not reconsider its decision does not excuse compliance with the exhaustion requirement. <em>Housing Authority </em>v. <em>Papandrea, </em>222 Conn. 414, 430-32, 610 A.2d 637 (1992); <em>Lacroix </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra, 84-85. Moreover, the record reflects the commissioner\u2019s willingness to consider proposals by Polymer to modify or eliminate certain testing requirements originally imposed by the commissioner.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Polymer\u2019s argument that it need not have sought a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>declaratory ruling because it would have been futile to have done so is, therefore, without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Polymer also contends that its claim of a constitutional violation by the commissioner exempted it from the exhaustion requirement. See <em>Lacroix </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>supra. However, \u201c[s]imply bringing a constitutional challenge to an agency\u2019s actions will not necessarily excuse a failure to follow an available statutory appeal process.\u201d Id., 79. Moreover, \u201c[d]irect adjudication even of constitutional claims is not warranted when the relief sought by a litigant might conceivably have been obtained through an alternative [statutory] procedure . . . which [the litigant] has chosen to ignore. . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>supra, 354. \u201c[W]e continue to limit any judicial bypass of even colorable constitutional claims to instances of demonstrable futility in pursuing an available administrative remedy.\u201d Id., 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Polymer alleges, without more, that the commissioner, \u201cacting under color of state law, has deprived Polymer of its rights, privileges, and immunities secured by the Constitution and the laws of the State of Connecticut, including Polymer\u2019s rights to due process and equal protection as afforded by the Constitution of the State of Connecticut.\u201d Although Polymer\u2019s complaint fails to explain more precisely the nature of the alleged constitutional violation, Polymer claims on appeal that the commissioner has violated its \u201cright to pursue a lawful business.\u201d We are not persuaded that Polymer\u2019s conclusory assertion of such a constitutional claim is sufficiently clear and specific to exempt it from the exhaustion requirement in this case. Moreover, because the commissioner would have been required to seek to enforce the terms of the final order in the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-180 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>(a),<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Polymer could have obtained relief from any undue interference with its business operations by seeking a stay of the enforcement of the precontrol stack testing requirement imposed by the commissioner. Because, therefore, Polymer would have had the opportunity to vindicate its rights \u201cthrough an alternative statutory procedure . . . which [Polymer] has chosen to ignore\u201d; <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>supra, 354; Polymer\u2019s allegation of a constitutional violation did not exempt it from the exhaustion requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Polymer also asserts that it would have suffered irreparable harm if required to seek a declaratory ruling from the commissioner and that therefore it was entitled to an exception from the exhaustion rule. See id., 370; <em>Harwinton Drilling &amp; Engineering Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Control Authority, </em>188 Conn. 90, 98, 448 A.2d 210 (1982). Specifically, Polymer argues that the declaratory ruling process might have taken as long as 180 days to complete,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> and that imposition of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>precontrol stack testing requirement during that period would have resulted in plant shutdowns, loss of business opportunities and goodwill, and excessive expense due to the cost of the necessary pollution control equipment and testing. As we have discussed, however, Polymer could have requested a stay of the precontrol stack testing requirement when the commissioner sought to enforce the terms of his letter of July 2,1992. Because Polymer had an adequate remedy at law,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> it would not have been entitled to injunctive relief; see <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>supra, 371; and was required, therefore, to have requested a declaratory ruling from the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">We conclude that Polymer failed to exhaust its administrative remedies and that its failure to do so was not excused by any exception to the exhaustion rule. The trial court, therefore, lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain Polymer\u2019s application for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded to the trial court with direction to render judgment dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b568-9\"> Leslie M.

Prior to April 9,1992, Polymer had conducted such operations twenty-four hours a day. The commissioner ordered Polymer to reduce its hours of operation so that DEP personnel could monitor the emission control testing at the plant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b574-7\"> Polymer also requested that the commissioner approve certain modifications to the emission control testing procedures required by the May 14, 1992 letter.

Upon dismissal of the complaint, Polymer immediately filed a second complaint, identical to the first, as well as a second application for a temporary restraining order. The court granted that application for a temporary restraining order on August 12,1992. The commissioner moved to dismiss the second complaint alleging, inter alia, a lack of subject matter jurisdiction because Polymer had failed to exhaust its administrative remedies. The court denied that motion on August 17, 1992.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b577-6\"> The court found that Polymer had incurred significant economic harm as a result of its reduction in operating hours: the loss of forty-two operating days due to shutdowns required by the commissioner; and the expense of consultants, experts and pollution control and testing equipment. The court found further that \u201c[c]ompliance with the [commissioner\u2019s requirements] might force [Polymer] out of business.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b577-7\"> The court concluded that \u201c[t]he suggestion of the Commissioner that for any loss of business [Polymer] would have relief at law\u2014to apply to the Connecticut Claims Commissioner for permission to sue the State for monetary damages is chimerical, or at least so unlikely as to be almost nonexistent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b577-8\"><em> </em>Polymer has not appealed the trial court\u2019s partial denial of its application for injunctive relief to enjoin the commissioner from requiring further stack testing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b577-9\"> The trial court\u2019s decision on Polymer\u2019s application for a temporary injunction also provided, however, that the commissioner may \u201cissue a cease and desist order . . . despite the partial injunction, whenever he reasonably deems there is an imminent and serious risk of injury to the public health because of processing or emissions at the plant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b578-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-176 (a) provides: \u201cAny person may petition an agency, or an agency may on its own motion initiate a proceeding, for a declaratory ruling as to the validity of any regulation, or the applicability to specified circumstances of a provision of the general statutes, a regulation, or a final decision on a matter within the jurisdiction of the agency.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b578-6\"> The commissioner also claims that Polymer failed to exhaust its administrative remedies by not contesting the cease and desist order pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 22a-7 (c); see footnote 3; and by failing to appeal the May 1,1992 final order to the Superior Court within forty-five days as authorized by General Statutes \u00a7 4-183. Polymer contends that it was not required either to contest the cease and desist order or to appeal the final order because neither order authorized the commissioner to require Polymer to conduct precontrol stack testing. Polymer further argues that it did not receive notice of the commissioner\u2019s decision purporting to require precontrol stack testing until July 2,1992, several weeks after the date by which Polymer would have been required to file any appeal of the final order. We do not address these arguments because we conclude that Polymer failed to exhaust the administrative remedy available to it pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-176 (a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b578-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-181a, entitled \u201cContested Cases.

We also note that, prior to the granting of the application for a temporary restraining order on July 7, 1992, the parties were discussing possible modifications to the precontrol stack testing requirement set forth in the commissioner\u2019s letter of July 2, 1992. See footnote 10. As a result of those discussions, and after a review of the reports submitted to him by Polymer, the commissioner notified Polymer by letter dated July 21,1992, that \u201c[a]s I was prepared to do when I was served with your court papers, I grant your request to postpone pre-control stack testing as set forth in my letter of July 2, 1992, with . . . [certain] conditions, in order to allow my staff and the Department of Health Services time to review recent reports submitted, and to consider modifications of my precontrol stack testing requirements.\u201d In a subsequent letter to Polymer, dated August 21,1992, the commissioner modified and explained his July 21, 1992 letter as follows: \u201cBased on lengthy discussions with . . . your representatives, the Department of Health Services, my staff, and others, I have concluded that a form of pre-control stack testing is still necessary to meet the objectives of [the Ojease and Desist Order . . . and to provide the information necessary to conduct a reliable health risk assessment. However, I believe that certain changes to the July 2,1992 pre-control testing program are acceptable, and will produce the required information. If and when I am no longer restrained or otherwise prevented from doing so, I intend to modify my July 2, 1992 letter.

Each violation shall be a separate and distinct offense and, in the case of a continuing violation, each day of continuance thereof shall be deemed to be a separate and distinct offense. The commissioner of environmental protection may request the attorney general to bring a civil action in the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford to have such assessment imposed by the court. In addition, the commissioner may request the attorney general to institute a civil action in the superior court for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain at Hartford for injunctive relief to restrain any further violation of any provision of this chapter, or any regulation, order or permit adopted or issued thereunder. The superior court shall grant such relief upon notice and hearing.
