Johnson, was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) (l),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and evasion of responsibility in operating a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-224 (b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>sentenced to a total effective term of imprisonment of eight months and was fined $1100 plus fees and costs. The defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>28 Conn. App. 708, 613 A.2d 1334 (1992). We granted certification to appeal limited to two issues: \u201c(1) Was the Appellate Court correct in refusing to review the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly denied his motion to dismiss which claimed that a peace officer does not have probable cause to effectuate a warrantless arrest for a misdemeanor committed outside the presence of that officer? [and] (2) In order to establish a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-224 (b), must the state prove that the defendant knew that the accident in which he was involved caused \u2018injury or damage to property?\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>224 Conn. 911, 617 A.2d 168 (1992). We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The facts in this case are adequately set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court. \u201cOn April 23, 1990, Catherine Mangels was driving her car on Route 1 in Westbrook when it was struck by a car driven by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>defendant. As a result of the collision, the cars became hooked together. Robert Pandora, who had been driving behind Mangels and had witnessed the collision, helped unhook the two cars. Pandora then drove Man-gels\u2019 car into the parking lot of a nearby restaurant.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">\u201cThe defendant drove his car to the back of the restaurant lot. Pandora got out of Mangels\u2019 car, went to where the defendant had driven, and told him that a bystander had called the police. The defendant responded that he would not wait for the police, and then tried to leave the restaurant lot. The defendant was having trouble getting his car into gear, so Pandora reached into the defendant\u2019s car, turned off the ignition and removed the keys. Pandora went into the restaurant with the keys, and the defendant followed him in an unsuccessful attempt to retrieve his keys. When the police arrived, Pandora was walking out of the front door of the restaurant with the defendant behind him. The defendant, upon seeing the police, retreated into the restaurant bathroom and locked himself in a bathroom stall.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\u201cPandora led Trooper Michael Polansky of the state police to the bathroom the defendant had just entered. Polansky identified himself and asked the defendant to come out of the stall. After refusing several times, the defendant finally staggered out. The defendant smelled of alcohol, had bloodshot eyes and was slurring his speech. Pandora identified the defendant as the operator of one of the cars involved in the collision. Polansky asked the defendant if he had been involved in the collision and the defendant replied that he had not. Polansky then asked the defendant to take a number of field sobriety tests. After the defendant refused to take the requested tests, Polansky arrested him without a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>\u201cOn the way out of the restaurant, the defendant acknowledged that he was the owner of one of the cars that had been involved in the collision. At the police station, Polansky asked the defendant to take a breathalyzer test. He refused. The jury subsequently convicted the defendant of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both, and of evading responsibility.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 28 Conn. App. 709-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Prior to trial, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the information against him on the ground that there was no probable cause for his arrest because the arresting officer had not been an eyewitness to the misdemeanor with which the defendant was charged. After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. The defendant later filed a motion for articulation of the trial court\u2019s decision. In its articulation, the trial court stated that there had been probable cause to arrest the defendant for driving under the influence and evading responsibility and rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that a police officer must be an eyewitness before he can arrest a misdemeanant.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">On appeal to the Appellate Court, the defendant claimed that the trial court had improperly denied his motion to dismiss. The defendant argued that General Statutes \u00a7 54-lf (a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which governs warrantless mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>demeanor arrests and permits a warrantless arrest to be made \u201con the speedy information of others,\u201d expands the common law rule that a peace officer cannot arrest a person for a misdemeanor committed outside of his presence. The defendant claimed that this expansion of the common law violated the fourth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a78 and 9, of the Connecticut constitution,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and therefore that the arrest was illegal and required dismissal of the charges against him. The Appellate Court concluded, however, that the defendant had failed to provide any analysis of either the federal or state constitutional claims, and the court, therefore, refused to address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The defendant argues that the Appellate Court improperly declined review of his constitutional claim on the basis of inadequate briefing. Even assuming, without deciding, that the Appellate Court improperly refused to review this claim, we conclude that the underlying law is so clear that there is no basis for the defendant to prevail on this argument. The defendant argued in the Appellate Court that, by virtue of the illegal arrest, the trial court should have granted his motion to dismiss. Under both federal and state constitutional law, however, an illegal arrest does not operate as a per se jurisdictional barrier to a defendant\u2019s subsequent prosecution. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>198 Conn. 255, 259-63, 502 A.2d 886, cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1143, 106 S. Ct. 1797, 90 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1986), and cases cited therein. In <em>Fleming, </em>we held that \u201c[wjhere the fairness of a subsequent prosecution has not been impaired by an illegal arrest, neither the federal nor the Connecticut constitution requires dismissal of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>charges or a voiding of the resulting conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Id., 263; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>McPhail, </em>213 Conn. 161, 169-70, 567 A.2d 812 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">In the present case, there is no indication that the allegedly illegal arrest tainted the defendant\u2019s trial. The defendant does not claim that evidence was seized as a result of the arrest and was later used to obtain a conviction. Indeed, the defendant maintains that his claim involves only his motion to dismiss, and acknowledges that he never moved for the suppression of evidence introduced at trial. On this record, there would be no basis for the defendant to prevail on his argument that the trial court improperly denied his motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The issue of whether the Appellate Court improperly declined to reach this claim is, therefore, academic.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">At trial, the trial court instructed the jury regarding the charge of evasion of responsibility in operating a motor vehicle as follows: \u201cThe state must prove both, that there was an accident that caused damage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>to another\u2019s property, and that the defendant knew of such accident. It is only necessary that the defendant knew that he was involved in an accident. Knowledge by the defendant that the collision caused damage to property of another is unnecessary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The defendant claimed in the Appellate Court that the trial court had improperly instructed the jury that it was not necessary that the defendant knew that the accident had caused damage to property. The defendant contended that, under the provisions of \u00a7 14-224 (b), the state must prove that the defendant had knowledge, not only of the accident, but also of any resulting property damage. The Appellate Court rejected this argument on the ground that the defendant\u2019s interpretation of the statute would thwart its purpose. It held that the \u201conly knowledge required is knowledge that there has been an accident.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 28 Conn. App. 717.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Section 14-224 (b) provides: \u201cEach person operating a motor vehicle who is knowingly involved in an accident which causes physical injury ... to any other person or injury or damage to property shall at once stop and render such assistance as may be needed . . . .\u2019\u2019In this court, the defendant reiterates his argument that \u00a7 14-224 (b) unambiguously requires an individual charged with evading responsibility to have knowledge of the accident <em>and </em>of the damage caused by the accident. Therefore, he argues, the Appellate Court improperly construed the statute to require only knowledge of the accident, and not knowledge of the damage as well. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">\u201cIt is fundamental that statutory construction requires us to ascertain the intent of the legislature and to construe the statute in a manner that effectuates that intent. <em>Green v. Ward, </em>178 Conn. 634, 637-38, 425 A.2d 128 (1979); <em>Sillman </em>v. <em>Sillman, </em>168 Conn. 144, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>147, 358 A.2d 150 (1975); 2A J. Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th Ed. Sands) \u00a7 45.05.\u201d <em>All Brand Importers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Liquor Control, </em>213 Conn. 184, 194, 567 A.2d 1156 (1989). Where the language of a statute is clear and unambiguous, reference to its history and purpose is unnecessary. <em>Winslow </em>v. <em>Lewis-Shepard, Inc., </em>216 Conn. 533, 538, 582 A.2d 1174 (1990). It is the duty of the court to \u201cinterpret statutes as they are written\u201d; <em>Muha </em>v. <em>United Oil Co., </em>180 Conn. 720, 730, 433 A.2d 1009 (1980); and not \u201c \u2018by construction read into statutes provisions which are not clearly stated.\u2019 \u201d <em>Glastonbury Co. </em>v. <em>Gillies, </em>209 Conn. 175, 179, 550 A.2d 8 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">If the statutory language is unclear, the intent of the legislature may be ascertained by looking to the legislative history and to the purpose that the statute was intended to serve. <em>Vaillancourt </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine/Litton, </em>224 Conn. 382, 391, 618 A.2d 1340 (1993). \u201c \u2018In construing a statute, common sense must be used, and courts will assume that the legislature intended to accomplish a reasonable and rational result.\u2019 \u201d <em>King </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>203 Conn. 324, 332-33, 524 A.2d 1131 (1987). A statute, of course, is not to be interpreted to thwart its purpose. <em>Mystic Marinelife Aquarium, Inc. </em>v. <em>Gill, </em>175 Conn. 483, 489, 400 A.2d 726 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">Although arguing that the plain language of the statute is clear and that no construction is therefore required, the defendant has himself pointed to an ambiguity in \u00a7 14-224 (b) by raising the issue of whether the statute requires knowledge of both an accident and resulting damage before an individual can be found guilty of evading responsibility. A review of the history and the purpose of this statute, however, supports the construction given to it by the Appellate Court and defeats the defendant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Prior to 1957, \u00a7 14-224 (b) read in pertinent part as follows: \u201cEach person operating a motor vehicle who knowingly causes . . . injury or damage to property shall at once stop\u201d and render assistance. General Statutes (1949 Rev.) \u00a7 2410. In 1957, our legislature changed that language to provide that \u201c[e]ach person operating a motor vehicle who is knowingly involved in an accident which causes . . . injury or damage to property shall at once stop\u201d and render assistance. General Statutes (1958 Rev.) \u00a7 14-224 (a). When the legislature amends the language of a statute, it is presumed that it intended to change the meaning of the statute and to accomplish some purpose. <em>Simko </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>206 Conn. 374, 377, 538 A.2d 202 (1988); <em>Heffernan </em>v. <em>Slapin, </em>182 Conn. 40, 49, 438 A.2d 1 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Although the legislative history behind this amendment is silent as to the impetus for the change, a commonsense reading of the amendment indicates an intent that a person may be found guilty of evading responsibility if that person is knowingly involved in an accident, regardless of that person\u2019s knowledge of injury or damage.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We are persuaded, therefore, that this change in statutory language captured the legislative intent that \u00a7 14-224 (b) be a mandatory \u201cstop, ascertain and assist\u201d statute, which provides criminal penalties for the failure to do so. We conclude, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>that the Appellate Court properly construed liability under \u00a7 14-224 (b) so as to require knowledge of the accident alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">This interpretation is consistent not only with its legislative history but also with the purposes of statutes on evading responsibility. The purpose of the statute on evading responsibility is to ensure that when the driver of a motor vehicle is involved in an accident, he or she will promptly stop, render any necessary assistance and identify himself or herself. The essence of the offense of evading responsibility is the failure of the driver to stop and render aid. See 15 D. Blashfield, Automobile Law and Practice (3d Ed.) \u00a7 490.92, p. 437. Knowledge of the precise nature of the injury or damage serves no useful function in the fulfillment of the principal purpose of the statute. We agree with the reasoning of the Illinois Supreme Court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Nunn, </em>77 Ill. 2d 243, 252, 396 N.E.2d 27 (1979), in which it stated, in interpreting its statute on evading responsibility, \u201c[w]e do not . . . hold that it is necessary for the prosecution to show also that the accused knew that injury or death resulted from the collision. To require this additional proof would impose a burden that would be unreasonably difficult to sustain and would tend to defeat the public interest which is served by requiring persons involved in vehicle collisions to stop and provide identification and other personal information and to be available to render assistance if required.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Our legislature, by its amendment of \u00a7 14-224 (b), has eliminated the requirement of knowledge of injury or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>property damage, and to construe the statute otherwise would read into the statute a provision that was not intended. See <em>Glastonbury Co. </em>v. <em>Gillies, </em>supra, 179. We conclude, therefore, that, to establish a violation of \u00a7 14-224 (b), the state is not required to prove that the defendant knew that the accident in which he was involved caused injury or damage to property. The Appellate Court correctly affirmed the trial court\u2019s instructions on the elements of this offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b557-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) provides: \u201coperation while under the influence.
