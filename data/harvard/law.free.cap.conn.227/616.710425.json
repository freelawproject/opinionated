Chapman, was convicted by a jury of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (l)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and sentenced to a term of fourteen years, execution suspended after seven years. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, claiming that the trial court had improperly instructed the jury that it could find him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>guilty of sexual assault in the first degree if it found that he had compelled sexual intercourse either by the use of force or by the threat of use of force. The state had not charged the defendant with having threatened to use force, nor did the state introduce evidence of the threat of use of force.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Appellate Court concluded that the trial court had \u201cimproperly instructed the jury on a statutory alternative for which there was no supporting evidence\u201d and ordered a new trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>28 Conn. App. 360, 366, 610 A.2d 1328 (1992). We granted the state\u2019s petition for certification limited to the following issues: \u201c(1) Did the Appellate Court correctly conclude that the statutory alternative analysis set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>202 Conn. 349, 363-64 [521 A.2d 150] (1987), applied to alternative language occurring within the same statutory subdivision] and that the trial court\u2019s instruction permitted the jury to consider a separate and distinct theory of criminal liability? (2) Was the Appellate Court correct in its failure to consider whether any error in the trial court\u2019s charge was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>223 Conn. 923, 614 A.2d 827 (1992). We conclude that the trial court improperly instructed the .jury on a statutory alternative for which the defendant was not charged and for which there was no supporting evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We also conclude that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>court\u2019s instruction violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights under the Connecticut constitution and that harmless error analysis is not required. We therefore affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">For the purposes of the issues raised in this appeal, we need to concern ourselves only with the following limited facts. The state charged only that the defendant had compelled sexual intercourse by the use of force and introduced evidence to that end.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The state concedes that it introduced <em>no evidence </em>that the defendant had committed the offense by <em>threatening </em>the use of force against the victim. Nevertheless, the trial court instructed the jury that \u201ca person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other person or <em>by the threat of the use of force </em>against such person which reasonably causes such person to fear physical injury.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Indeed, the trial court instructed on the use of a threat as an alternative means of committing the crime on three separate occasions. The defendant took an exception to the instruction on committing sexual assault by threatening the use of force, thereby appropriately preserving this claim for appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>review. See Practice Book \u00a7 852;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>219 Conn. 160, 592 A.2d 382 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hill, </em>201 Conn. 505, 512, 518 A.2d 388 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Statutory Alternative Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Sexual assault in the first degree may be committed by two methods under \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1): (1) by compelling another person to engage in sexual intercourse by \u201cthe use of force\u201d; or (2) by compelling another person to engage in sexual intercourse by \u201cthe threat of use of force.\u201d We have held on numerous occasions that \u201c \u2018[w]here a person may have been convicted under more than one statutory alternative, the judgment cannot be supported unless the evidence was sufficient to establish guilt under each statutory provision which the trier may have relied upon.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Marino, </em>190 Conn. 639, 650-51, 462 A.2d 1021 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>197 Conn. 67, 74, 495 A.2d 1054 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>193 Conn. 695, 730, 478 A.2d 227 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S. Ct. 1749, 84 L. Ed. 2d 814 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>193 Conn. 646, 666, 480 A.2d 463 (1984); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Silveira, </em>198 Conn. 454, 459, 503 A.2d 599 (1986). This rule is based on the principle that jurors are presumed to follow the instructions given by the judge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>173 Conn. 153, 156, 376 A.2d 1108 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>DellaCamera, </em>166 Conn. 557, 567, 353 A.2d 750 (1974).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra. By instructing the jury on a theory of criminality for which there is no supporting evidence, the trial court implies that there is a factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>dispute for the jury to resolve regarding that theory of criminality. The trial court\u2019s instruction authorizes the jury to consider and to resolve the implied factual dispute. Id., 364. \u201cThe trial court should submit no issue to the jury which is foreign to the facts in evidence, or upon which no evidence was offered, and it should not submit to the jury considerations which find no support in the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>225 Conn. 650, 659, 626 A.2d 287 (1993); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\">The state claims that the statutory alternative analysis employed in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, is not applicable in this case because the two methods of committing sexual assault in the first degree at issue here\u2014use of force and the threat of use of force\u2014are set forth in the same subdivision of the statutory definition. The state argues that the analysis in <em>Williams </em>should apply only when the statutory alternatives are framed in separately numbered statutory subdivisions. We disagree. Whether the legislature has distinguished between methods of achieving a result by placing them in separately labeled subdivisions or within a single subdivision is not determinative for deciding whether to apply the statutory alternative analysis set forth in <em>Williams. </em>We decline to adopt the distinction advanced by the state because it would elevate form over substance by analyzing a statute on the basis of its structure rather than its purpose. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>208 Conn. 125, 545 A.2d 1026, cert. denied, 488 U.S. 895, 109 S. Ct. 235, 102 L. Ed. 2d 225 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>206 Conn. 213, 219, 537 A.2d 460 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">Instead, we must focus on the underlying purpose of the statutory alternative analysis set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 364, which serves the essential function of ensuring that juries do not convict under a theory of criminality unless the evidence is sufficient to establish guilt under that theory. In view of this under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>lying purpose, we must turn to the substance of the statutory text to determine whether the use of force and the threat of the use of force are separate statutory alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">Section 53a-70 (a) provides that sexual assault may be committed by the \u201cuse of force against such other person . . . or by the threat of the use of force against such other person . . . which reasonably causes such person to fear physical injury to such person or a third person . . . .\u201d The text of the statute clearly separates \u201cforce\u201d from \u201cthreat of use of force\u201d by using the disjunctive \u201cor.\u201d The \u201cuse of the disjunctive \u2018or\u2019 between the two parts of the statute indicates a clear legislative intent of separability.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Dennis, </em>150 Conn. 245, 248, 188 A.2d 65 (1963). Thus, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Belton, </em>190 Conn. 496, 500-501, 461 A.2d 973 (1983), we held that the trial court had impermissibly enlarged the offense charged by incorporating the uncharged disjunctive phrase \u201cremains unlawfully\u201d when explaining the elements of burglary in the first degree. Under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-101 (a), \u201c[a] person is guilty of burglary in the first degree when he <em>enters or remains </em>unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein . . . .\u201d We noted that \u201ca burglary is committed when either type of \u2018entry\u2019 is established\u201d; id., 501; and concluded that the trial court had violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights under the state and federal constitutions by repeatedly using the disjunctive phrase \u201cremains unlawfully,\u201d when the state had not charged the defendant with that theory of liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Similarly, we have consistently held that the \u201cuse of force\u201d and the \u201cthreat of use of force\u201d are \u201ctwo methods of committing the same crime.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Secore, </em>194 Conn. 692, 698, 485 A.2d 1280 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Franko, </em>199 Conn. 481, 490, 508 A.2d 22 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>189 Conn. 611, 628-29, 458 A.2d 369 (1983); see also 5 Connecticut Practice, D. Borden &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>L. Orland, Criminal Jury Instructions (1986) (suggesting separate jury instructions for the use of force [\u00a7 10.2] and the threat of use of force [\u00a7 10.1]).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">The state argues that the use of force and the threat of force cannot be statutory alternatives, however, because they can occur together and because they cause an identical result\u2014namely, compelled sexual intercourse. We reject both of these arguments. Although an assailant may use force simultaneously with a threat to use force, each method may occur in isolation, as indicated by the plain language of the statute, which delineates the use of force separately from the threat of the use of force, and by the facts of this case. As previously noted, the state concedes that it neither charged nor introduced evidence to show that the defendant had threatened to use force, but limited its case to the actual use of force. As a result, the rationale behind the statutory alternative analysis of <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, which seeks to ensure that the jury is not charged on a theory of liability for which no evidence has been introduced, applies whether the statutory alternatives are set forth in separately numbered subdivisions or within the same subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Our conclusion that the Appellate Court properly applied the statutory alternative analysis of <em>Williams </em>to the present case gains further support from the legislative history. Section 53a-70 was substantially amended by No. 75-619 of the 1975 Public Acts, which substituted the term \u201cassault\u201d for \u201cmisconduct\u201d and provided that sexual assault could be committed by the threat of force as well as force. During the debate, Senator Betty Hudson stated: \u201cThe present statute requires that there be force, force enough ... to overcome earnest resistance, whatever that means. Well in most rape cases, there is no resistance. . . . In fact, in eighty-seven percent of rape cases, there is no resistance . . . because the rapist has a knife or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>a gun and threatens the woman\u2019s life or that of her child.\u201d 18 S. Proc., Pt. 7,1975 Sess., p. 3222. Senator Hudson\u2019s remarks indicate that the legislature intended to punish for sexual assault those individuals who compelled sexual intercourse by threatening to use force, in addition to those who used actual force. This legislative history indicates an intent not to merge force and the threat of force, but rather supports the conclusion that force and threat of force are two separate methods of committing the same crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">We conclude that the use of force and the threat of force, as used to define sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1), are distinct statutory alternatives. Accordingly, we affirm the Appellate Court\u2019s application of the analysis in <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Harmless Error Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">In its second claim, the state argues that the Appellate Court should have applied harmless error analysis in determining whether to order a new trial because the trial court\u2019s instruction authorized the jury to consider a separate and distinct theory of liability. The state\u2019s contention cannot properly be addressed without first considering whether a jury instruction that allows a jury to convict a defendant on the basis of a statutory alternative for which there was no evidence violates a defendant\u2019s right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">The underlying federal rule of due process was announced in <em>Yates </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U.S. 298, 77 S. Ct. 1064, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1356 (1957), overruled on other grounds, <em>Burks </em>v. <em>United States, </em>437 U.S. 1, 98 S. Ct. 2141, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1978). In that case, the government had charged the defendants with conspiring to (1) advocate and teach the duty and necessity of over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>throwing the government and (2) organize persons who so advocate and teach with the intent of overthrowing the government. The court noted that \u201cin order to convict, the jury was required, as the court charged, to find an overt act which was \u2018knowingly done in furtherance of an object or purpose of the conspiracy charged in the indictment,\u2019 and we have no way of knowing whether the overt act found by the jury was one which it believed to be in furtherance of the \u2018advocacy\u2019 rather than the \u2018organizing\u2019 objective of the alleged conspiracy. ... In these circumstances we think the proper rule to be applied is that which requires a verdict to be set aside in cases where the verdict is supportable on one ground, but not on another, and it is impossible to tell which ground the jury selected.\u201d Id., 311-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The state contends, however, that following the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>United States, </em>502 U.S. , 112 S. Ct. 466, 116 L. Ed. 2d 371 (1991), a general verdict is valid so long as the evidence is sufficient with respect to any <em>one </em>of the alternatives charged.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Griffin, </em>the court reaffirmed the rule, under federal law, set forth in <em>Turner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>396 U.S. 398, 420, 90 S. Ct. 642, 24 L. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Ed. 2d 610 (1970), as follows: \u201c \u2018[W]hen a jury returns a guilty verdict on an indictment charging several acts in the conjunctive . . . the verdict stands if the evidence is sufficient with respect to any one of the acts charged.\u2019 \u201d Id., 473. <em>Griffin </em>is therefore inapposite in this case because it is limited to statutory alternatives charged in the conjunctive.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the present case, the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury were predicated on an information that charged the defendant <em>disjunctively. </em>We need not speculate as to whether the United States Supreme Court would apply the tailored rule set forth in <em>Griffin </em>to statutory alternatives charged disjunctively because the defendant invokes the state constitution as well as the federal constitution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>\u201cIt is well established that federal constitutional and statutory law establishes a minimum national standard for the exercise of individual rights and does not inhibit state governments from affording higher levels of protection for such rights. . . . <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>192 Conn. 48, 57, 469 A.2d 1201 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>219 Conn. 529, 546, 594 A.2d 917 (1991).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 684, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992). We have held that, among other things, it is appropriate to focus on our state common law and state history in construing the contours of our state constitution. Id., 686. \u201cState courts . . . must be empowered to determine, in light of state interests and state history, what meaning to attribute to provisions contained in state constitutions.\u201d E. Peters, \u201cState Constitutional Law: Federalism in the Common Law Tradition,\u201d 84 Mich. L. Rev. 583, 588 (1986). Moreover, we may look to the historical record and due process tradition in Connecticut in determining whether article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution affords greater rights than its federal counterpart. <em>State </em>v. <em>Stoddard, </em>206 Conn. 157, 164-66, 537 A.2d 446 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">An instruction on a statutory alternative that is not supported by the evidence violates a defendant\u2019s fundamental right, protected by the due process clause of article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution, \u201cto be acquitted unless proven guilty of each element of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 363; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>223 Conn. 127, 147, 613 A.2d 211 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>216 Conn. 367, 388-89, 579 A.2d 1066 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number><em>John, </em>210 Conn. 652, 688, 557 A.2d 93, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 824, 110 S. Ct. 84, 107 L. Ed. 2d 50 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>201 Conn. 276, 281-82, 514 A.2d 330 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Reid, </em>193 Conn. 646, 666, 480 A.2d 463 (1984). A similar principle applies when the trial court instructs the jury that it may convict a defendant on the basis of a statutory alternative for which there is no evidence. Accordingly, it is firmly entrenched in the common law of this state that \u201c \u2018[t]he court has a duty to submit to the jury no issue upon which the evidence would not reasonably support a finding.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 364; <em>Batick </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>186 Conn. 632, 641, 443 A.2d 471 (1982). \u201c[I]f a claim is made against the evidence in the case, and wholly unsupported by proof, it is error to submit it to the jury as if the evidence justified the claim, and without comment, as there is great danger of its leading to an unjust verdict.\u201d <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Phoenix Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>44 Conn. 72, 88 (1876); see also <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Rundle, </em>50 Conn. 9, 33, 47 A. 599 (1882); <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Champion, </em>58 Conn. 268, 276, 20 A. 471 (1890); <em>McGarry </em>v. <em>Healey, </em>78 Conn. 365, 367, 62 A. 671 (1905); <em>Miles </em>v. <em>Sherman, </em>116 Conn. 678, 682, 166 A. 250 (1933) (\u201cinstruction which left the door open for the entrance of a finding by the jury of negligence on the defendant\u2019s part, or of due care upon the plaintiff\u2019s part, which did not arise out of the evidence in the case, was calculated to do the defendant harm\u201d); <em>Novak </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>178 Conn. 506, 508, 423 A.2d 147 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The principle of not submitting to the jury any issue for which there is insufficient evidence has roots in our early common law. Justice Swift, writing in 1822, shortly after the adoption of the state constitution in 1818, noted that the jury in its deliberations \u201cmust find expressly all the facts put in issue, or must negate them all.\u201d 2 Z. Swift, Digest of the Laws of the State of Connecticut (1823) p. 774. Similarly, Justice Swift recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>nized the court\u2019s power to \u201cdirect the jury to say, in their verdict, on which count they find the defendant guilty, and to find him not guilty on the rest, so that if he should be found guilty on an insufficient count, he might take advantage of it by motion in arrest.\u201d Id., p. 383. Also imbedded in our common law is the notion that the judge has the power \u201cto defend the innocent against an unjust verdict . . . .\u201d Id., p. 413. Implicit in the power to set aside a verdict that has no support in the evidence is the idea that the court should not submit to the jury, in the first instance, an issue that has no support in the evidence. By doing so, the court invites an unjust verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the due process clause of the Connecticut constitution prohibits the trial court from charging the jury on a statutory alternative for which there is no evidence and on which the jury could improperly predicate its verdict. \u201c[A] general verdict of guilty without specific findings as to the alternative on which it rested . . . must be set aside if the evidence as to either alternative submitted was insufficient.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Arnold, </em>supra, 282; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>supra, 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">The state argues that even if the Appellate Court properly concluded that the jury charge violated the defendant\u2019s right to due process by enlarging the offense charged, it should not have reversed his conviction without engaging in a harmless error analysis. We disagree. Ordinarily, we abide by the principle that \u201can otherwise valid conviction should not be set aside if the reviewing court may confidently say, on the whole record, that the constitutional error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 681, 106 S. Ct. 1431, 89 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1986).

The substitute information in this case charged the defendant with the crime of sexual assault in the first degree by compelling sexual intercourse by the use of force. The trial court in its instructions, however, expanded the charge in the information and advised the jury that if it found proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had used force <em>or the threat of use of force </em>to compel intercourse, it could convict him of the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>The state, however, presented no evidence during the defendant\u2019s trial of the use of threats by the defendant to compel the victim to engage in sexual intercourse. Despite the total lack of evidence of any threat of use of force and an abundance of evidence of the actual use of force by the defendant, the Appellate Court nonetheless determined that the jury may have convicted the defendant on the uncharged theory that he had employed threats to compel intercourse. It therefore concluded that he was entitled to a new trial because he had been afforded inadequate notice of the charges against him. The Appellate Court did not conduct a harmless error analysis. <em>State </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>28 Conn. App. 360, 363-66, 610 A.2d 1328 (1992). The majority agrees with the disposition of the case by the Appellate Court. The record in this case, however, does not reflect any reasonable possibility that the portion of the instruction to which the defendant objects misled the jury. <em>State </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>206 Conn. 621, 627, 539 A.2d 114 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>171 Conn. 264, 273, 368 A.2d 222 (1976). The instruction was therefore harmless. Moreover, there is no reason why the instruction, if improper, should not have been afforded harmless error analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">That portion of the trial court\u2019s instructions that explained the elements of sexual assault in the first degree reads as follows: \u201cNow, a person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other person or by the threat of the use of force against such person which reasonably causes such person to fear physical injury. In order to commit the crime of sexual assault in the first degree the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that, one, sexual intercourse had taken place. And two, the defendant compelled the victim to engage in sexual intercourse either by the use of force or by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>threat of the use of force which caused the victim to reasonably fear physical injury to herself. ... If you find the required sexual intercourse had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, you must next determine whether the defendant used or threatened the use of force. Use of force means either the use of a dangerous instrument, there is no claim of that here, or the use of actual physical force or violence or superior physical strength against the victim. Thus, if you find that the [state] has proved beyond a reasonable doubt each of the elements of this offense you will find the defendant guilty. If on the other hand, you conclude that the state had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt one or more of these elements you must find the defendant not guilty of the crime charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The majority has determined that there is a reasonable possibility that this portion of the court\u2019s instruction could have misled the jury to convict the defendant of a crime with which he was not charged and of which there was no evidence, and was therefore violative of the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights. It concludes that under the state constitution, the instruction was therefore per se harmful and requires reversal. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">The substitute information clearly put the defendant on notice that he was charged with compelled sexual intercourse. Whether the compulsion was due to force or threat of the use of force, his defense would not have changed. The theory of his defense was that the victim had initially consented to his sexual advances. When she subsequently requested that he stop, the defendant testified that he did so. According to the defendant, therefore, there was neither force nor the threat of use of force nor sexual intercourse. If the jury had believed the defendant, pursuant to the instructions given by the trial court, it would had to have found him not guilty. Because the court\u2019s instruction was not prejudicial to his defense, it was harmless. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rus</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number><em>coe, </em>212 Conn. 223, 253, 563 A.2d 267 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1084, 110 S.

To cut off harmless error analysis under these facts seems a departure from the very reason for the existence of the harmless error doctrine. See <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 22-23, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1967). The purpose of the harmless error doctrine is to preserve the primary aim of a criminal trial\u2014the factual determination of guilt or innocence\u2014from being subverted by the virtually inevitable presence of immaterial error. <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 308, 111 S. Ct. 1246, 113 L. Ed. 2d 302 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The enlargement of the charged offense in this instance was inconsequential. In order to convict the defendant, on the theory of the threat of use of force, the jury would have had to discount the extensive testimony of the victim concerning the defendant\u2019s use of actual force, manufacture its own evidence of the threat of the use of force and finally conclude that such nonexistent threats of force, not the actual force testified to by the victim, were proven beyond a reasonable doubt to have compelled sexual intercourse. Why that scenario requires that there be no harmless error analysis and per se reversal escapes me. There was no \u201cstructural defect\u201d in the trial mechanism that required such a drastic result. See id., 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">Moreover, as the majority points out, \u201c \u2018jurors are presumed to follow the instructions given by the judge.\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number><em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>202 Conn. 349, 364, 521 A.2d 150 (1987).\u201d The trial judge in this case instructed the jury that it could consider only the evidence introduced at trial and directed the attention of the jury to the substitute information that \u201cyou are going to have . . . with you. And you can, you are guided by that information. In other words, the state is alleging the facts as you find them in that substituted information as a basis for their claim that the defendant Donald Chapman did commit the crime of sexual assault in the first degree.\u201d The substitute information read in relevant part that \u201cthe defendant attempted to, and did compel, the victim to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against said victim, to wit: the said Donald L. Chapman restrained the victim, attempted to, and did forcibly penetrate her vagina with his penis . . . .\u201d It did not mention threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">If considered in context, no reasonable juror could have been misled by the challenged portion of the instruction to convict the defendant of sexual assault by the use of threats, of which there was no evidence, when there was direct testimony from the victim that the defendant had used actual force to overcome her resistance. <em>State </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>supra. In summary, if there was any impropriety in the trial court\u2019s instructions, there was no reasonable possibility that it misled the jury to convict the defendant on an uncharged theory of liability. Consequently, any impropriety was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. It strikes me, however, that it is cruel and unusual punishment to require the victim to be put through another trial and to have to again recount her traumatic experience in public when there is not even a remote possibility, let alone any reasonable possibility, that the instruction complained of affected the outcome of the jury\u2019s deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>I would reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and-reinstate the jury\u2019s verdict and the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b658-5\">Santaniello, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"An3\">dissenting.

Well in most rape cases, there is no resistance. In fact, in eighty-seven percent of rape cases, there is no resistance and there is no resistance because the rapist has a knife or a gun and threatens the woman\u2019s life or that of her child.\u201d 18 S.

The force that Senator Hudson is referring to is force that had been required by the victim, not the rapist.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Use of force and threat of use of force have never been considered statutory alternatives. Beginning with the definition of forcible compulsion, using force and threatening to use force have been considered two methods of compelling sexual assault. Contrary to Justice Berdon\u2019s assertion, the history of \u00a7 53a-70 supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>the contention that use of force and threat of use of force have always been considered together, and does not indicate an intent to separate them.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">We have previously held that the trial court did not unconstitutionally enlarge the offense when the court instructed the jury on either use of force or threat of use of force even though the information only stated use of force. <em>State </em>v. <em>Franko, </em>199 Conn. 481, 488-89, 508 A.2d 22 (1986). Recently, we held that the alternatives, use of force and threat of use of force, are not conceptually distinct and, therefore, that no unanimity instruction is required regarding which method was used to compel sexual intercourse. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>supra. \u201c \u2018[T]he element of compulsion, the utter subjugation of the victim\u2019s free will, is no different in character if it results from the raised fist or the first blow. . . . [W]e are convinced that the phrase \u201cuse or threat of force or violence\u201d is a sound and reasonable attempt to capture the essence of the proscribed conduct [sexual assault] . . . .\u2019\u201d Id., 648, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>101 Wis. 2d 441, 450-52, 304 N.W.2d 742 (1981); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Milardo, </em>224 Conn. 397, 413, 618 A.2d 1347 (1993) (although compelled sexual intercourse may be performed in several ways, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 [2] defines only one offense). Because we have already held that use of force and threat of use of force are not conceptually distinct, and because they have consistently been grouped together as constituting the element of compulsion required to commit sexual assault, the use of force and threat of use of force cannot be statutory alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">In addition, the trial court charged the jury on use of force and threat of use of force even though the information did not state that the defendant had threatened to use force. We disapprove of the practice of reading an entire statute in the charge to the jury where the pleadings or the evidence support only a portion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>statute. <em>State </em>v. <em>James, </em>211 Conn. 555, 583, 560 A.2d 426 (1989). Any error derived from the fact that the jury charge did not conform to the information, however, is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">\u201c \u2018 \u201cThe harmless error doctrine recognizes the principle that the central purpose of a criminal trial is to decide the factual question of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Nobles, </em>422 U.S. 225, 230 [95 S. Ct. 2160, 45 L. Ed. 2d 141] (1975), and promotes public respect for the criminal process by focusing on the underlying fairness of the trial rather than on the virtually inevitable presence of immaterial error.\u201d \u2019 <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>478 U.S. 570, 577, 106 S. Ct. 3101, 92 L. Ed. 2d 460 (1986), quoting <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Van Ardsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 681, 106 S. Ct. 1431, 89 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1986).\u201d <em>Bunkley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>222 Conn. 444, 460, 610 A.2d 598 (1992). The proper harmless error inquiry is whether the error affected the outcome of the case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Belle, </em>215 Conn. 257, 268, 576 A.2d 139 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">I am not persuaded that it is more probable than not that the jury\u2019s verdict was affected by the erroneous instruction. The information stated and all the evidence presented at trial demonstrated that the assault was accomplished by the use of force. No evidence suggested that the defendant threatened to use force. The court instructed the jury to consider only the evidence admitted at trial in reaching a verdict. The jury charge taken as a whole and this court\u2019s holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Tucker, </em>supra, that the use of force and the threat of the use of force are not conceptually distinct indicate that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b658-6\"> The court charged the jury under subdivisions (1) and (2) of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133, even though the state presented evidence to support the defendant\u2019s conviction under subdivision (1) only.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b658-7\"> <em>State </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>202 Conn. 349, 521 A.2d 150 (1987) (General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133 [1] and [2]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Silveira, </em>198 Conn. 454, 503 A.2d 599 (1986) (General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 [a] [1] and [3]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Asherman, </em>193 Conn. 695, 478 A.2d 227 (1984), cert. denied, 470 U.S. 1050, 105 S.
