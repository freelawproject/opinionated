The defendants, the freedom of information commission (commission) and the Journal Inquirer newspaper and its news editor, Robert H. Boone, appeal<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from the judgment of the trial court. That judgment sustained the appeal of the plaintiffs, William H. Gifford and John M. Bailey,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from the decision of the commission. The trial court concluded that the commission had improperly determined that such an arrest report must be disclosed to the public during the pendency of the criminal prosecution. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">The record reveals the following facts and procedural history. On September 12, 1989, a police officer from the Windsor Locks police department was dispatched to a restaurant in that town to investigate a report of a disturbance between the owner of the establishment and two young males. The owner of the restaurant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>informed the officer that two young males, one of whom was known to him, had threatened him with a knife and had given him anti-Semitic and racist literature.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Shortly thereafter, the two males described by the owner were found nearby and transported to the police station for questioning. A witness<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to the incident also went to the police station and confirmed the store owner\u2019s account of the events. The witness also stated that one of the males, William Landers,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> had accused the store owner of selling drugs and had warned the owner that he \u201cbetter watch this drug business.\u201d Both individuals were subsequently arrested on various charges. While being held for arraignment, Landers attempted to commit suicide. The investigating officer drafted an arrest report, dated September 12,1989, that records these events.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The following day, a reporter from the Journal Inquirer requested a copy of the arrest report that had been prepared in connection with these arrests. William Gifford, the chief of police of the town of Windsor Locks, on advice from the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office, denied the reporter\u2019s request for a copy of the report during the pendency of the criminal prosecution. Following the completion of the criminal prosecution that resulted from the arrest report, however, Gifford released a copy of the report to the Journal Inquirer.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">The Journal Inquirer and Boone lodged a complaint with the commission claiming that Gifford\u2019s refusal to release the arrest report during the pendency of the criminal case violated General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>response, the plaintiffs claimed that arrest reports are exempt from disclosure under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-19 (b) (3) (B), 1-19b (b), l-20b, 1-19 (b) (4), l-19c and article twenty-third of the amendments to the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Specifically, the plaintiffs con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>tended that disclosure was not required by statute, and that nondisclosure was necessary: (1) to protect witnesses; (2) to protect juveniles; (3) to facilitate additional police investigations if requested by the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office; (4) to minimize unfavorable pretrial publicity that would necessitate a change of venue; (5) to preclude any prejudice caused by publication of a defendant\u2019s confession or admission; (6) to avoid publication of inadmissible evidence; and (7) to avoid conflict with the rules of discovery set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 54-86b and Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 746, 752 and 753.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Several witnesses testified at the administrative hearings on the complaint. First, Gifford testified that he had a long-standing policy of refusing to release arrest reports until the prosecution related to such a report was no longer pending. He testified that this policy was necessary to protect the identity of witnesses to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>events culminating in the arrest, including the names of any police officers who were likely to be called to testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Then chief state\u2019s attorney John J. Kelly testified that the standard practice if an arrest is made is for the police department to prepare an arrest report that details the investigation that led to the arrest, and then to forward a copy of the document to the appropriate state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office. This document then serves as the basis upon which the prosecutor may make future decisions regarding the case, and, in particular, determine whether further investigation by the police is necessary. Kelly also explained that a typical arrest report contains the summary of events that resulted in the arrest, the names and addresses of witnesses and victims of the crime, information given by such witnesses, and any further police action corroborating the allegations of witnesses. In addition, Kelly testified that if police departments were obligated to disclose such reports during the pendency of a criminal case, witnesses could be located and intimidated, the identity of victims of sexual assault or of youthful offenders might become public, and the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial could be damaged by any resulting publicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Assistant state\u2019s attorney T.R. Paulding, who at that time was the supervising prosecutor for geographical area thirteen of the Hartford-New Britain judicial district, testified that a criminal case begins at the time of the arrest, and can be concluded only through a judicial resolution. He testified that the police report in this case had been used throughout the case for various pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>poses, including assessing the validity of the charges, determining the strategy to be employed in the case and establishing in court that there was probable cause to arrest the defendant. Paulding also testified that the release of the arrest report in this case, while the prosecution was pending, could have jeopardized the defendants\u2019 fair trial rights and could have resulted in witness or victim intimidation.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The commission concluded in its final decision on September 12,1990, that, during the pendency of a criminal prosecution, an arrest report must be disclosed upon request to the public pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 1-15<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and 1-19 (a) of the act. The commission stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>that, except for the names and addresses of witnesses, such arrest reports were not exempt from disclosure and ordered Gifford to \u201ccomply with the disclosure requirements of \u00a7 1-19 (a).\u201d The commission also \u201ccaution[ed] [Gifford] to take care to comply with the law in the future or [he] may risk further consequences for [his] continuing disregard of the law.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>The plaintiffs filed separate appeals in the trial court claiming that the commission had improperly concluded that the act required disclosure of an arrest report while the criminal prosecution is pending. The trial court sustained the plaintiffs\u2019 appeals concluding that: (1) pursuant to \u00a7 l-19c, the division of criminal justice (division) is not a public agency while engaged in the investigation and prosecution of a criminal case; (2) the jurisdiction of the division attaches at the time of arrest; (3) the arrest report, although compiled by police, is, upon its completion, a record of the division; (4) disclosure of an arrest report during the pendency of a criminal prosecution, without permission of the division, constitutes a violation of \u00a7 l-19b (b) and the specific statutory and Practice Book rules of discovery; (5) the premature release of an arrest report violates the rights of the division as a party to negotiations pursuant to \u00a7 1-19 (b) (4); (6) \u00a7 l-20b limits the disclosure obligation regarding arrest reports to the \u201cname and address of the person arrested, the date, time and place of the arrest and the offense for which the person was arrested\u201d; and (7) law enforcement records as contemplated in \u00a7 1-19 (b) (3) (A) and (B) pertain to ongoing investigations and contemplated or prospective law enforcement proceedings such as an arrest to be made at a later date, and do not include already compiled arrest reports. <em>Gifford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>42 Conn. Sup. 291, 300-301, 617 A.2d 479 (1992).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> These appeals followed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>The commission claims that the trial court improperly concluded that the act does not require disclosure of arrest reports while the criminal prosecution is pending. We disagree.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">At the outset, it is useful to note several principles that guide our resolution of the issue raised by these appeals. First, the facts of this case limit our discussion of the commission\u2019s claim solely to the issue of whether arrest reports must be disclosed during the pendency of the criminal prosecution. The facts of this case do not raise, nor do we need to decide, whether a police report of any kind must be released before an arrest is made, or whether an arrest report must be released after the criminal case to which the report relates has been fully adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Second, we recognize, as a general matter, that \u201cthere is an \u2018overarching policy\u2019 underlying the [act] favoring the disclosure of public records. <em>Chairman </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>217 Conn. 193, 196, 585 A.2d 96 (1991); <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>201 Conn. 421, 431, 518 A.2d 49 (1986); <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>192 Conn. 310, 315, 472 A.2d 321 (1984). Our construction of the [act] must be guided by the policy favoring disclosure and exceptions to disclosure must be narrowly construed. <em>Ottochian </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 393, 398, 604 A.2d 351 (1992); <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>217, 233, 602 A.2d 1019 (1992); <em>Lieberman </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>216 Conn. 253, 266, 579 A.2d 505 (1990); <em>Board of Police Commissioners </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>192 Conn. 183, 188, 470 A.2d 1209 (1984).\u201d <em>Superintendent of Police </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>222 Conn. 621, 626, 609 A.2d 998 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">This rule of construction, however, is not determinative. Indeed, although the act was intended as a general matter to promote openness in government; see, e.g., <em>Ottochian </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 398; the act itself recognizes competing interests, and the need for some governmental records to remain confidential, at least initially. See, e.g., <em>Chairman </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">Third, although the act\u2019s general policy favoring public access to public records has strong constitutional underpinnings, the fact that the act implicates first amendment concerns of access to information does not control the interpretation of the act itself. Id., 198-99. Thus, the question of whether the legislature intended to compel disclosure of arrest reports during the pendency of a criminal prosecution presents an issue of statutory interpretation and, therefore, is a question of law. <em>Connecticut Humane Society </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>218 Conn. 757, 761, 591 A.2d 395 (1991). The objective of statutory construction is to give effect to the intended purpose of the legislature. <em>State </em>v. <em>Delafose, </em>185 Conn. 517, 521, 441 A.2d 158 (1981). Moreover, \u201c[i]t is a well-settled principle of construction that specific terms covering the given subject matter will prevail over general language of the same or another statute which might otherwise prove controlling. <em>Charlton Press, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>153 Conn. 103, 110, 214 A.2d 354 [1965]. [If] there are two provisions in a statute, one of which is general and designed to apply to cases generally, and the other is particular and relates to only one case or subject within the scope <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>of a general provision, then the particular provision must prevail; and if both cannot apply, the particular provision will be treated as an exception to the general provision. <em>Kelly </em>v. <em>Dewey, </em>111 Conn. 281, 292, 149 A. 840 [1930]. <em>Budkofsky </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>177 Conn. 588, 592, 419 A.2d 333 (1979).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gaynor </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co., </em>216 Conn. 458, 476-77, 582 A.2d 190 (1990); <em>Galvin </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>201 Conn. 448, 456, 518 A.2d 64 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">With these principles in mind, we turn to the act in order to determine whether the legislature intended that criminal arrest reports must be disclosed while the criminal prosecution related to the report is pending. We conclude that \u00a7 l-20b governs such disclosure, and does not mandate disclosure of an arrest report in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">We begin our analysis by assuming, without deciding, that <em>but for </em>the language \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by any . . . state statute\u201d in \u00a7 1-19 (a), an arrest report is a record \u201cmaintained or kept on file by any public agency\u201d pursuant to that section.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We also assume, without deciding, that, <em>but for </em>the language \u201c[e]xcept as otherwise provided by any . . . state statute\u201d in \u00a7 1-19 (a) and <em>but for </em>\u00a7 l-20b, the plaintiffs have not demonstrated that this arrest report falls within any of the exemptions listed in \u00a7 1-19 (b). Nevertheless, we conclude that: (1) \u00a7 l-20b governs; (2) it provides for both a requirement of disclosure and a limit on the extent of that disclosure; and (3) it does not require the full disclosure of arrest reports during the pendency of a criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">We note, first, that \u00a7 l-20b is itself part of the Freedom of Information Act. Although \u00a7 l-20b was enacted six years after most of the act became law in 1977, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>section is found in title 1, chapter 3 of our General Statutes. See, e.g., <em>Elections Review Committee of the Eighth Utilities District </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>219 Conn. 685, 686-88, 595 A.2d 313 (1991); <em>Healy </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>18 Conn. App. 212, 213, 557 A.2d 561 (1989). Consequently, this provision is part of the statutory scheme that regulates the circumstances under which a public agency must make its records available to the public for inspection or copying.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">We turn now to the specific language of \u00a7 l-20b. That section states: <em>\u201cNotwithstanding any provision of the general statutes to the contrary, </em>any record of the arrest of any person, other than a juvenile, except a record erased pursuant to chapter 961a, shall be a public record from the time of such arrest and shall be disclosed in accordance with the provisions of section 1-15 and subsection (a) of section 1-19. For the purposes of this section, \u2018record of the arrest\u2019 means the name and address of the person arrested, the date, time and place of the arrest and the offense for which the person was arrested.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The language emphasized above indicates that a document falling within this section that would otherwise be governed by other portions of the act, or by any other provision of the General Statutes, is nonetheless governed, not by those other provisions,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> but by this provision.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>The first sentence of \u00a7 l-20b, by itself, establishes a broad disclosure requirement: <em>\u201c[A]ny </em>record of the arrest of <em>any </em>person, other than a juvenile, except a record erased pursuant to chapter 961a, shall be a public record from the time of such arrest and shall be disclosed . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) The plain language of this sentence, therefore, must be read to include an arrest report. Certainly, an arrest report constitutes \u201cany record of the arrest of any person.\u201d To hold otherwise would be to ignore the term \u201cany\u201d as it modifies the terms \u201crecord\u201d and \u201cperson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Our interpretation of \u201cany record\u201d to include an arrest report is buttressed by the inclusion of the language \u201cexcept a record erased pursuant to chapter 961a . ...\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 54-142a,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> which is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>part of chapter 961a of the General Statutes, requires that <em>all </em>police and court records and records of any-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>state\u2019s attorney pertaining to charges that have been dismissed must be erased, and the disclosure of such records by judicial or law enforcement personnel is pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>hibited by that statute. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Morowitz, </em>200 Conn. 440, 450, 512 A.2d 175 (1986). Consequently, if the language in \u00a7 1-20b, \u201cany record of the arrest of any person,\u201d does not include an arrest report, then the language referring to the exception for records erased pursuant to chapter 961a would have been unnecessary. See <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>217 Conn. 153, 160, 585 A.2d 82 (1991) (no part of a statute should be treated as insignificant or unnecessary).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Having established that the first sentence of \u00a7 1-20b includes an arrest report, we turn to the second sentence of that provision. The first sentence of \u00a7 1-20b cannot be read in isolation from the second sentence of that provision. See <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 68-73, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985). The second sentence limits the language of the first sentence by limiting the \u201crecord of the arrest of any person\u201d\u2014which we interpret to include an arrest report\u2014to the \u201cname and address of the person arrested, the date, time and place of the arrest and the offense for which the person was arrested.\u201d We conclude that this language must be read as a limitation on the broad disclosure requirement of the first sentence, because otherwise it would have been unnecessary for the legislature to have included such language. See <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra. Moreover, this reading is consistent with the rule of statutory construction known as expressio unius est exclusio alterius; see, e.g., <em>Chairman </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 200; which may be translated as \u201cthe expression of one thing is the exclusion of another.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (6th Ed. 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">In light of our linguistic analysis of both sentences, read together, we conclude that \u00a7 l-20b exclusively regulates the disclosure of arrest reports, and obligates a police department to disclose such a report only to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>the extent provided by the second sentence of that provision. This conclusion is buttressed by reference to the legislative history of that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The legislature enacted \u00a7 l-20b in response to a growing concern that certain police departments were refusing to disclose even the names of persons who had been arrested by officers of those departments. See 26 H.R. Proc., Pt. 8,1983 Sess., p. 2772, remarks of Representative Richard D. Tulisano (\u201cThe purpose of the bill before us [is] to make sure when somebody was booked there would be no way that that could be hidden from the public. That everyone should know who\u2019s, in fact, been booked and put under custody.\u201d). Section l-20b, as enacted, implements this purpose because it obligates the disclosure of the name of any person who has been arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">At the same time, however, we read this legislative history to support our interpretation that \u00a7 l-20b does not require disclosure of an arrest report beyond the limited information listed in the second sentence of that provision. When the bill was drafted and debated, the legislature specifically addressed the issues and policy concerns related to the disclosure of arrest reports. In this regard, the legislative history indicates that the legislature, although addressing the problem of so-called \u201csecret arrests,\u201d intended to limit the extent to which police were obligated to disclose an arrest report.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">First, as the provision was originally introduced in the House of Representatives, the bill provided in relevant part: \u201cNotwithstanding any provision of the general statutes to the contrary, any record of the arrest of any person, other than a juvenile, shall be a public record from the time of such arrest and shall be disclosed in accordance with the provisions of section 1-15 and subsection (a) of section 1-19 of the general statutes.\u201d 1983 Substitute House Bill No. 5111. This ver<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>sion of the bill, notably, did not contain any language limiting the provision to the \u201cname and address of the person arrested, the date, time and place of the arrest and the offense for which the person was arrested.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">The House then amended the bill to read in relevant part: \u201cNotwithstanding any provision of the general statutes to the contrary, <em>any police blotter entry recording </em>the arrest of any person, other than a juvenile, shall be a public record from the time of such <em>entry </em>and shall be disclosed in accordance with the provisions of section 1-15 and subsection (a) of section 1-19 of the general statutes.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 1983 Substitute House Bill No. 5111, \u00a7 1, as amended by House Amendment Schedule A. In favorably commenting on the amendment, Representative Francis X. O\u2019Neill, Jr., stated: \u201cMany years ago ... in my years in . . . law enforcement, a record of an arrest included the affidavit to support an arrest, the arrest warrant itself, and the blotter record entry. If the bill, as written, went through, it would completely destroy every single undercover activity that any police department in this state attempted to go into. It would destroy all informants; quite frankly, it could be called a murder bill. It would kill informants. I personally have taken informants off meat racks who were dead. I have personally taken informants out of automobiles who were dead. They were police officers. They were individuals whose names had been disclosed either intentionally or unintentionally. A police officer puts his life oh the line; this particular amendment would save their lives.\u201d 26 H.R. Proc., Pt. 8, 1983 Sess., pp. 2772-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">This history suggests that, when the legislature considered passage of this bill, it was particularly cognizant of the policy concerns that militate against disclosure of arrest reports. Although the Senate rejected House Amendment A, the Senate later added language to the provision that is the functional equivalent of the \u201cpolice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>blotter entry recording of the arrest\u201d language of House Amendment A, namely, the \u201cname and address of the person arrested, the date, time and place of the arrest and the offense for which the person was arrested.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We read this history, therefore, as strong evidence that the legislature intended by the enactment of \u00a7 l-20b to ensure that certain minimal information regarding arrests be disclosed by the police, but, at the same time, to ensure that the disclosure requirement did not include the entire arrest report.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">In sum, we read \u00a7 l-20b as a salient example of the maxim of statutory construction that specific language covering the given subject matter, namely, the disclosure requirements for arrest reports, will prevail over general language of the same or another statute that might otherwise prove controlling. See <em>Gaynor </em>v. <em>Union Trust Co., </em>supra, 476-77; <em>Galvin </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>supra, 456. That is what the legislature must have intended by stating: <em>\u201cNotwith</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number><em>standing any provision of the general statutes to the contrary, </em>any record of the arrest of any person . . . shall be a public record . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)

As a general matter, it is undisputed that, absent an open file policy maintained by a state\u2019s attorney, a criminal defendant does not have immediate access to an arrest report. Such a report ordinarily need not be disclosed by the state except to the extent ordered by the court pursuant to the rules of discovery. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 746, 752 and 753; footnote 7; see also Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 740 through 745, 747, 749 through 750, and 754 through 755.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>Public access to arrest reports while the prosecution is pending would affect the rights of litigants under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>laws of discovery because a defendant, as a member of the public, would have immediate access to docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>ments otherwise unavailable under our discovery rules. On the other hand, the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s rights would be adversely affected, because the defendant would have immediate access to documents upon which the prosecutor relies to make strategic decisions regarding the prosecution and to decide whether to request further investigation by the police.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Indeed, the commission itself has concluded that disclosure of arrest reports to criminal defendants while their prosecution is pending would conflict with the rules of discovery.

We are unpersuaded. The plain language of \u00a7 1-19b (b) simply states that <em>nothing </em>in the act shall be deemed to affect the rights of litigants under the discovery laws of this state. As we previously stated, the state\u2019s attorney and the defendant are both litigants, and the commission\u2019s proposed interpretation of the act would directly affect their rights under the discovery rules. We fail to divine the significance of the fact that the request for disclosure was made to the police department when the police department necessarily acts in conjunction with the state\u2019s attorney with regard to the contents of the arrest report.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b688-7\">Berdon, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ACs\">with whom</p>\n<author id=\"A8I\">Katz, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A7g\">joins, dissenting. The issue before this court is whether incident reports prepared by the police are public records that come within the purview of General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (a) of the Freedom of Information Act (act)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and are therefore open for inspection and copying by the public, including the press. Specifically at issue is the police incident report<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> prepared by a Windsor Locks police officer documenting the arrest of two teenagers involved in anti-Semitic and racist activities and the subsequent attempt by one of them to commit suicide. The majority, reading the act in a most restrictive manner, concludes that incident reports involving arrest are not required to be disclosed while the related criminal prosecution is pending. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">The majority travels a torturous path to reach its desired result. Today\u2019s holding violates fundamental principles to which we have long adhered. \u201c \u2018When the words of a statute are plain and unambiguous, we need look no further for interpretive guidance because we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>assume that the words themselves express the intention of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d <em>Southington </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>210 Conn. 549, 559, 556 A.2d 166 (1989). \u201cIt is axiomatic that the court itself cannot rewrite a statute to accomplish a particular result. That is the function of the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hanson, </em>210 Conn. 519, 529, 556 A.2d 1007 (1989). The legislature, not the majority of the court, determines the public policy of this state. See <em>International Business Machine Corporation </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>167 Conn. 123, 134-35, 355 A.2d 236 (1974). These principles are not merely tenets that govern our review of statutory enactments, but they have their roots in our state constitution, which mandates the separation of powers between the coordinate branches of government. Conn. Const., art. II;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Sassone </em>v. <em>Lepore, </em>226 Conn. 773, 790, 629 A.2d 357 (1993) (Ber<em>don, J., </em>dissenting.).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">General Statutes \u00a7 1-19 (a) of the act provides that \u201call records maintained or kept on file by any public agency . . . shall be public records and every person shall have the right to inspect such records promptly . . . .\u201d \u201cPublic agency\u201d is defined in part as \u201cany executive [or] administrative . . . office of . . . any city [or] town . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 l-18a (a). It is clear that a police incident report is a record maintained by an agency of the town, and the majority concedes this much, albeit only for this decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Nonetheless, the majority points to prefatory language in \u00a7 1-19 (a) that excepts from its provisions the disclosure of records as \u201cotherwise provided by any federal law or state statute\u201d and then leaps to \u00a7 l-20b of the General Statutes. Section l-20b requires, without condition, that records of arrest, other than juvenile records or criminal records that have been erased, must be disclosed. <em>For purposes of \u00a7 l-20b, </em>\u201crecord of the arrest\u201d means \u201cthe name and address of the person arrested, the date, time and place of the arrest and the offense for which the person was arrested.\u201d The majority therefore concludes that the required disclosure for an incident report involving an arrest is limited to the information set forth in \u00a7 l-20b.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">This conclusion ignores a key piece of legislation. The majority never refers in its analysis to \u00a7 1-19 (b), which provides the following: \u201cNothing in sections 1-15, l-18a, 1-19 to l-19b, inclusive, and 1-21 to l-21k, inclusive, shall be construed to require disclosure of . . . (3) records of law enforcement agencies not otherwise available to the public which records were compiled in connection with the detection or investigation of crime, if the disclosure of said records would not be in the public interest because it would result in the disclosure of (A) the identity of informants not otherwise known, (B) information to be used in a prospective law enforcement action if prejudicial to such action, (C) investigatory techniques not otherwise known to the general public, (D) arrest records of a juvenile, which shall also include any investigatory files, concerning the arrest of such juvenile, compiled for law enforcement pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>poses, (E) the name and address of the victim of a sexual assault ... or injury or risk of injury, or impairing of morals ... or of an attempt thereof or (F) uncorroborated allegations subject to destruction pursuant to section l-20c . . . Clearly, the Windsor Locks police department is a law enforcement agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">If \u00a7 1-20b were controlling as to the limits of disclosure for incident reports, as the majority contends, the exclusions in \u00a7 1-19 (b) (3) would be rendered superfluous. When a statute is all-inclusive, as in the case of \u00a7 1-19 (a), and then provides specific exceptions, as in the case of \u00a7 1-19 (b), \u201c[t]he careful delineation of the bounds of this exemption gives unusual force to the principle that the express mention in a statute of one exemption precludes reading others into it.\u201d <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>134 Conn. 295, 301, 57 A.2d 128 (1948); see also <em>Mad River Co. </em>v. <em>Wolcott, </em>137 Conn. 680, 687, 81 A.2d 119 (1951). Likewise, the specific delineation of certain exemptions means that the exemptions cannot be ignored.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Accordingly, the majority cannot sweep \u00a7 1-19 (b) under the rug, but must read it in conjunction with \u00a7 l-20b and \u00a7 1-19 (a). In doing so, it must be recognized that there is nothing in \u00a7 l-20b that <em>limits </em>disclosure to this information only, rather it sets a bare minimum of information that <em>must </em>be disclosed. \u201cWhen construing a statute, we do not interpret some clauses in a manner that nullifies others, but rather read the statute as a whole and so as to reconcile all parts as far as possible.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Iovieno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>222 Conn. 254, 258, 608 A.2d 1174 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Reading this body of law together, it is only logical to conclude from the plain language of the act that incident reports prepared and maintained by local police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>must be disclosed unless one or more of the exceptions set forth in \u00a7 1-19 (b) (3) have been met. Even if one or more of the exceptions are met, however, at the very least there must be disclosure of the \u201crecord of arrest\u201d (except for juvenile and erased records). As noted above, the record of the arrest includes \u201cthe name and address of the person arrested, the date, time and place of the arrest and the offense for which the person was arrested.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 l-20b.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Indeed, the legislative history of \u00a7 l-20b, which forms the basis for the majority\u2019s analysis, supports this conclusion. As Representative Richard D. Tulisano noted on the floor of the House of Representatives, \u201c[t]he purpose of the bill before us [is] to make sure when somebody was booked there would be no way that that could be hidden from the public. That everyone should know who\u2019s, in fact, been booked and put under custody.\u201d 26 H.R. Proc., Pt. 8,1983 Sess., p. 2772. Furthermore, the statutory language is consistent with the constitutional requirement of disclosure, as discussed, infra.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The majority also points to General Statutes \u00a7 l-19b (b), which provides that nothing in the act \u201cshall be deemed in any manner to . . . <em>affect </em>the rights of litigants . . . under the laws of discovery of this state . . . . \u201d (Emphasis added.) The majority claims that \u00a7 l-19b (b) makes it clear that criminal discovery shall not be affected by the act. They also conclude that disclosure of the incident report while the prosecution is pending would affect the rights of litigants under the laws of discovery because \u201ca defendant, as a member of the public, would have immediate access to documents otherwise unavailable under our discovery rules.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">The freedom of information commission (commission), however, never made a finding that disclosure of the incident report would affect the rights of anyone in this case. The commission has the exclusive juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>diction, in the first instance, to make such a finding. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-21j. In fact, the commission specifically found that \u201cunder the facts of this case \u00a7 1-19b (b) . . . does not prohibit disclosure of the requested record,\u201d and that conclusion is not challenged on appeal. See <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>205 Conn. 767, 535 A.2d 1297 (1988) (neither reviewing court nor trial court may retry case or substitute its judgment for that of the agency). There was no challenge to the commission\u2019s finding on the ground that it was not supported by substantial evidence. See <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>State Employees Retirement Commission, </em>210 Conn. 214, 217, 554 A.2d 292 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">In some cases, it may be that information in the arrest report should be withheld because the discovery rights of a litigant would be affected, but there must be a finding to that effect. On the other hand, in many cases the disclosure of a report may not affect the discovery rights of the litigants. The incident report may contain information known to both parties or the information may be readily available to anyone, in which case disclosure would have an inconsequential effect on the rules of discovery. For example, if the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office has an \u201copen door\u201d policy for discovery, the disclosure of the information will hardly affect the rights of the litigants. The point is that these are fact bound issues to be resolved by the commission in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Furthermore, the parties who sought the incident report in this case, the Journal Inquirer and its news editor, Robert H. Boone, are members of the public and the press. Their right to know cannot be controlled by some unknown future litigant whose rights may or may not be affected. See <em>In re Application of National Broadcasting Co., </em>635 F.2d 945, 953-54 (2d Cir. 1980) (television networks permitted to copy and televise videotapes introduced into evidence in previous crimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>nal trial even though tapes were still subject to challenge by defendants on appeal and could be introduced in future trials against additional defendants).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">Common sense dictates that the commission\u2019s order in this case must be upheld. This court is obligated to consider statutes \u201c \u2018as a whole, with a view toward reconciling their separate parts in order to render a reasonable overall interpretation; the application, moreover, of common sense to the statutory language is not to be excluded. ... We must avoid a consequence which fails to attain a rational and sensible result which bears most directly on the object which the legislature sought to obtain.\u2019 \u201d <em>Builders Service Corporation </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>208 Conn. 267, 276, 545 A.2d 530 (1988). In this case, the objective, simply stated, is public disclosure. <em>Superintendent of Police </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>222 Conn. 621, 626, 609 A.2d 998 (1992) (policy underlying the act favors disclosure of public records); <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>201 Conn. 421, 430, 518 A.2d 49 (1986) (the act makes disclosure of public records the statutory norm.)</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">The legislative scheme under the act does not require a blanket disclosure of information, but instead seeks to accommodate nondisclosure when the public interest demands. Accordingly, \u00a7 1-19 (b) (3) lists the particular situations in which the public interest requires nondisclosure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The exceptions, however, are limited to circumstances in which \u201cthe legislature has determined that [the] public interest overrides the public\u2019s right to know . . . .\u201d <em>Lieberman </em>v. <em>State Board of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number><em>Labor Relations, </em>216 Conn. 253, 266, 579 A.2d 505 (1990). Such exceptions must be narrowly construed. <em>Board of Police Commissioners </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>192 Conn. 183, 188, 470 A.2d 1209 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Other jurisdictions have made it clear that \u201cthere is a strong public-policy interest favoring the inspection of public records. This public interest is particularly significant where arrest records are concerned.\u201d <em>Newspapers, Inc. </em>v. <em>Breier, </em>89 Wis. 2d 417, 435-36, 279 N.W.2d 179 (1979). \u201cThe power to arrest is one of the most awesome weapons in the arsenal of the state. It is an awesome weapon for the protection of the people, but it is also a power that may be abused. . . . [C]urbing abuse of the arrest power is only possible if the public can learn how that power is exercised. The mere revelation that a person has been arrested does not make possible the public scrutiny of lawfulness or appropriateness of police conduct. . . .\u201d Id., 436-37; see also <em>Houston Chronicle Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Houston, </em>531 S.W.2d 177 (Tex. Civ. App. 1975) (public\u2019s right to know is particularly sensitive and important regarding police activity); <em>Caledonian-Record Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>154 Vt. 15, 21, 573 A.2d 296 (1990) (\u2018[p]ursuant to the First Amendment, it is generally recognized that the public and the media have a constitutional right of access to information relating to the activities of law enforcement officers and to information concerning crime in the community\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">The majority\u2019s restrictive interpretation limiting disclosure of incident reports thwarts the underlying pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>poses of the act. \u201cThe Freedom of Information Act expresses a strong legislative policy in favor of the open conduct of government and free public access to government records.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>181 Conn. 324, 328, 435 A.2d 353 (1980).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c[I]t is well established that the general rule under the Freedom of Information Act is disclosure, any exception to that rule will be narrowly construed in light of the general policy of openness expressed in the [act]. . . . The burden of proving the applicability of an exception to the [act] rests upon the party claiming it.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ottochian </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>221 Conn. 393, 398, 604 A.2d 351 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">In the present case, the public had a right to know the details of the arrest of the two teenagers by the Windsor Locks police department. The incident report described the arrest as follows: The teenagers harassed and threatened the owner of a grinder sandwich shop in his place of business. They also flashed a knife at the store owner and accused him of being a drug dealer. Shortly afterward, the teenagers were apprehended by the police while they were distributing racist and antiSemitic leaflets. One of them attempted to commit suicide while in police custody. The public\u2019s right to know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>this information was not satisfied until months after the incident, when the report was finally released.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Applying the majority\u2019s interpretation of the act to the facts of this case, the only information that would have been available to the public while the criminal charges were pending would have been the names and addresses of the teenagers, the date, time and place of the incident, and the fact that they were arrested for violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-64 (reckless endangerment in the second degree), \u00a7 53a-181 (breach of the peace), and \u00a7 53a-167a (interfering with a police officer). Nothing more would have been disclosed.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">To understand fully the ramifications of the majority\u2019s restrictions on the right to know, substitute for the teenagers the mayor of a city. Does the majority contend that the public would be entitled to know only the mayor\u2019s name and address, the date, time and place of the incident, and the statutory section of the offense that he allegedly committed? If we were to substitute a well known dissident for the teenagers or the mayor, would we tolerate that person\u2019s arrest without more information made available to the public? I hope not. Public disclosure of the incident report simply involves an aspect of government that distinguishes a democracy from a totalitarian state. For precisely this reason, the restrictive interpretation of the majority would violate first amendment protections. Justice T. Clark Hull, writing for a unanimous court, recently stated: \u201cWe note that the [act\u2019s] general policy favoring public access has strong federal constitutional underpinnings. As the United States Supreme Court has made clear, the first amendment to the federal constitution is not limited to protection of free expression but also embodies the right to receive and gain access to information and ideas.

I, \u00a7 2.\u201d <em>Lieberman </em>v. <em>State Board of Labor Relations, </em>supra, 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">I believe that the plain language of the act requires public disclosure of an incident report prepared by the police at the time it is made unless the police can demonstrate the need for nondisclosure under \u00a7 1-19 (b). Anything less would run afoul of our state and federal constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">In <em>United States Department of Justice </em>v. <em>Reporters Committee, </em>489 U.S. 749, 772, 109 S. Ct. 1468, 103 L. Ed. 2d 774 (1989), the United States Supreme Court noted the following: \u201cIn our leading case on the [federal Freedom of Information Act], we declared that the Act was designed to create a broad right of access to \u2018official information.\u2019 <em>EPA </em>v. <em>Mink, </em>410 U.S. 73, 80 [93 S. Ct. 827, 35 L. Ed. 2d 119] (1973).\u201d Dissenting in <em>Mink, </em>Justice Douglas characterized the philosophy of the statute by quoting Henry Steele Commager <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>as follows: \u201c \u2018The generation that made the nation thought secrecy in government one of the instruments of Old World tyranny and committed itself to the principle that a democracy cannot function unless the people are permitted to know <em>what their government is up to.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 105. The basic policy of requiring full agency disclosure unless information is exempted under clearly delineated statutory language indeed focuses on the citizens\u2019 right to know. We, in Connecticut, likewise have a right to know what our government is up to.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b688-9\"> See footnote 5 of the majority opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b688-10\"> The majority confuses the issues by referring to the document sought to be disclosed as an \u201carrest report.\u201d Of course, this is an attempt to dovetail the report to come within the purview of General Statutes \u00a7 1-20. The incident report is entitled \u201cWindsor Locks Police Incident Report\u201d and is simply a report of an incident investigated by police. It may or may not include an arrest. Indeed, the disposition section of the report includes blocks to be checked which include \u201cunfounded,\u201d \u201cpending,\u201d \u201csettled\u201d and \u201cjuvenile.\u201d Nevertheless, since this case involves an arrest, I discuss an incident report which would include an arrest resulting from the incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b689-5\"> The constitution of Connecticut, article second, as amended by article XVIII of the amendments to that constitution, provides: \u201cThe powers of government shall be divided into three distinct departments, and each of them confided to a separate magistracy, to wit, those which are legislative, to one; those which are executive, to another; and those which are judicial, to another. The legislative department may delegate regulatory authority to the executive department; except that any administrative regulation of any agency of the executive department may be disapproved by the general assembly or a committee thereof in such manner as shall by law be prescribed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b689-6\"> The majority assumes for purposes of this decision, but does not decide, that criminal arrest reports are records. If the majority is concerned about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>whether incident reports are records, they should state so and provide the reasons for their conclusion. We have an obligation to address the issues raised by the parties not only for the case before us, but in order to give appropriate guidance for future cases. The local police need to know, the state\u2019s attorney needs to know, the Freedom of Information Commission needs to know, the legislature needs to know and most important, the public needs to know.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b694-7\"> The trial court points out that there were 218,115 arrests in Connecticut in 1990, the year after the incident report at issue in this case was prepared. The trial court notes: \u201cAssuming that the prosecution would raise the issue of prejudice in each case of warrantless arrests, the sheer volume of required hearings would render impotent two strategic public agencies of our state.\u201d This argument presupposes that all incident reports are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>doaked in secrecy, which is exactly what the act was designed to eliminate\u2014 the withholding of information from the public. When an office, such as a police department, has the unbridled discretion to withhold information, one can rest assured that the general rule will be to withhold the information, even if there is no compelling state reason to do so. Such a philosophy interferes with the public\u2019s right to know.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b696-6\"> Senator Robert L. Julianelle, then cochairman of the Government Administration and Policy Committee, summed up the beneficial purposes of the act in his remarks before the Senate as follows: \u201cThe legislature finds and declares that . . . the people have a right to be fully informed of the actions taken by public agencies in order that they may retain control over the instruments they have created; that the people do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them; that the people in delegating authority do not give their public servants the right to decide what is good for them to know and that it is the intent of the law that actions taken by public agencies be taken openly and . . . that the record of all public agencies be open to the public except in those instances where a superior public interest requires confidentiality.\u201d 18 S. Proc., Pt. 5, 1975 Sess., pp. 2323-24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b698-7\"> Article first, \u00a7 4, of the Connecticut constitution provides: \u201cEvery citizen may freely speak, write and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Article first, \u00a7 5, of the Connecticut constitution provides: \u201cNo law shall ever be passed to curtail or restrain the liberty of speech or of the press.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
