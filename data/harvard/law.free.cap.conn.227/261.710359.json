The workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the fourth district (commissioner) denied the plaintiffs\u2019 claim to an award, and the compensation review division (review division) affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">On appeal,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the Appellate Court affirmed the decision of the review division.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>McCurdy </em>v. <em>State, </em>26 Conn. App. 466, 601 A.2d 560 (1992). We then granted certification to appeal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly determine that the claimant\u2019s estate was not entitled to permanent partial disability payments, under Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 31-308 (b), from the date that he reached maximum medical improvement?\u201d <em>McCurdy </em>v. <em>State, </em>221 Conn. 920, 608 A.2d 686 (1992). We conclude that the estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>was entitled to permanent partial disability benefits and therefore reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The essential facts are undisputed. On November 21, 1983, John Mollico, also known as John McCurdy (decedent), injured his back while employed by the defendant, the state of Connecticut. Until December 24,1987, when he died of causes unrelated to his injury, the decedent was paid temporary total disability benefits pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 31-307.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On October 1.5, 1987, his physician rated his injury as a 70 percent permanent partial disability of the lower back. On October 20,1987, the physician issued a supplemental report expressing his opinion that the dece<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>dent\u2019s lower back had reached maximum medical improvement. On December 15, 1987, the decedent sought an award of permanent partial disability benefits pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 31-308.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The workers\u2019 compensation commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>refused to award permanent partial disability benefits because the decedent remained totally disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Following the decedent\u2019s death from cancer, Jean McCurdy sought an award for the 70 percent permanent partial disability of her late husband. The estate of the decedent notified the state that it, too, claimed entitlement to a 70 percent permanent partial disability award in the event that Jean McCurdy were found not to be a dependent widow.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The commissioner found that Jean McCurdy was neither the decedent\u2019s presumptive widow nor a dependent in fact, and therefore was not entitled to an award.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The commissioner further found that the decedent\u2019s estate was not entitled to a permanent partial disability award. On appeal, the review division upheld the decision of the commissioner and the Appellate Court affirmed the decision of the review division.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">In its appeal to this court, the plaintiff estate claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that it was not entitled to an award of permanent partial disability benefits. The estate also claims that the Appellate Court incorrectly upheld the decision of the review division that the commissioner had not abused his discretion in denying the plaintiffs\u2019 motion to correct certain factual findings concerning the decedent. Although this claim concerning the commissioner\u2019s findings was not expressly certified, it falls within the scope of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>certified issue and has been briefed by both parties. Accordingly, we will consider this claim as well.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">As a preliminary matter, we must review the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion concerning the propriety of the commissioner\u2019s refusal to amend his findings and conclusions. After the commissioner had issued his decision denying the plaintiffs\u2019 claim, the plaintiffs submitted a motion to correct the commissioner\u2019s findings. The motion was granted in part and denied in part. The commissioner specifically refused to incorporate the following findings proposed by the plaintiffs:</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\u201c21. The decedent had a 70% permanent-partial disability of the low back.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">\u201c22. The decedent had reached maximum medical improvement with reference to his low back prior to the date of his death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">The plaintiffs challenged the commissioner\u2019s refusal to incorporate these two findings in their appeal to the review division. Although the review division\u2019s written decision did not specifically address this claim, it affirmed the commissioner\u2019s decision. On appeal, the Appellate Court held that the commissioner had properly refused to incorporate the two findings proposed by the plaintiffs. <em>McCurdy </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 26 Conn. App. 469. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">At the hearing on their claim, the plaintiffs submitted letters from the decedent\u2019s physician stating that the decedent had a permanent 70 percent disability of his back and had reached the point of maximum medi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>cal improvement. There is absolutely no evidence in the record to contradict these conclusions. Further, the state conceded at oral argument that no contradictory evidence had been offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">\u201c \u2018The conclusions drawn by [the commissioner] from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them.\u2019 <em>Adzima </em>v. <em>UAC/Norden </em>Division, 177 Conn. 107, 118, 411 A.2d 924 (1979). To the extent that the commissioner\u2019s finding discloses facts, his finding cannot be changed <em>unless the record discloses that the finding includes facts found without evidence or fails to include material facts which are admitted or undisputed. Wheat </em>v. <em>Red Star Express Lines, </em>156 Conn. 245, 248, 240 A.2d 859 (1968).\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Grady </em>v. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, </em>179 Conn. 662, 669, 427 A.2d 842 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Because the evidence concerning the decedent\u2019s degree of disability and attainment of maximum medical improvement was undisputed, the commissioner should have included this information in his factual findings. The state argues, to the contrary, that the commissioner had discretion to omit these facts because he concluded that the decedent was totally disabled.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree. A person may reach maximum medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>improvement, have a <em>permanent </em>partial impairment, and be <em>temporarily </em>totally disabled from working, all at the same time. <em>Osterlund </em>v. <em>State, </em>129 Conn. 591, 600, 30 A.2d 393 (1943). The commissioner\u2019s finding of total disability therefore did not preclude the additional findings proposed by the plaintiffs. Because these proposed findings were not precluded and were undisputed, we hold that the commissioner should have incorporated them in his findings. The Appellate Court was mistaken in ruling to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">We must next consider whether the Appellate Court should have recognized that the plaintiff estate was entitled to a permanent partial disability award, in view of the fact that the decedent had reached maximum medical improvement before his death. We conclude that the estate was entitled to an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">We have long held that an injured worker has a right to a permanent partial disability award once he or she reaches maximum medical improvement. In <em>Panico </em>v. <em>Sperry Engineering Co., </em>113 Conn. 707, 714, 156 A.2d 802 (1931), we explained that a permanent partial award \u201cbecame due\u201d when the worker reached maximum improvement. See also <em>Stapf v. Savin, </em>125 Conn. 563, 565, 7 A.2d 226 (1939). In <em>Osterlund </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 597-600, we overruled <em>Panico </em>and <em>Stapf </em>to the extent that they precluded a commissioner from exercising his or her discretion to continue total disability payments to a worker who had reached maximum medical improvement but was still totally disabled from working. In <em>Osterlund, </em>we explained that \u201cthere might be, in case of a partial loss of function, a great disproportion between the amount of specific compensation provided and the actual effect of the injury, either from the standpoint of the employee\u2019s earning capac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>ity or the physical impairment he suffered.\u201d Id., 600. In a case such as this, however, in which the worker has reached maximum medical improvement and his permanent partial disability award has thereby vested, we hold that the commissioner does not have discretion to deny such an award if the worker requests that award, as the decedent did in this case. We therefore conclude that the decedent became entitled to a permanent partial disability award on December 15,1987, when he requested such an award at the hearing before the commissioner.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Having concluded that the decedent became entitled to a permanent partial disability award prior to his death, we must consider whether the decedent\u2019s estate is entitled to payment of this award. We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">In <em>Forkas </em>v. <em>International Silver Co., </em>100 Conn. 417, 423, 123 A. 831 (1924), we held that the estate of a deceased worker was entitled to the balance of permanent partial disability benefits that were awarded to the decedent before his death but remained unpaid. We concluded that because a permanent partial disability award \u201chas all the earmarks of a statutory award of liquidated damages for the loss\u201d of a body part or its use, there was no reason why the award should not survive the death of the worker. Id., 421-22; see also <em>Cappellino </em>v. <em>Cheshire, </em>226 Conn. 569, 576, 628 A.2d 595 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">The state argues that <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Stratford Lumber Co., </em>105 Conn. 297, 135 A. 574 (1926), overruled <em>Forkas </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>to the extent that <em>Forkas </em>allowed the estate of a deceased worker to recover the portion of a permanent partial disability award that remained unpaid at the worker\u2019s death. <em>Bassett, </em>however, involved a situation where the estate was challenging an award of the balance of unpaid permanent partial disability benefits to the decedent\u2019s dependent widow. Where, as here, there are no dependents, we hold that a permanent partial disability award that became due to the decedent before his death is payable to the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed, and the case is remanded to that court with direction to remand the case to the compensation review division to correct the commissioner\u2019s findings and to issue the appropriate award to the decedent\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">In this opinion Peters, C. J., Norcott and Katz, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b284-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-301b provides: \u201cAny party aggrieved by the decision of the compensation review board upon any question or questions of law arising in the proceedings may appeal the decision of the compensation review board to the appellate court.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b284-8\"> Jean McCurdy, the widow of the decedent, and the estate of John Mollico, also known as John McCurdy, were plaintiffs before the review division. Jean McCurdy did not appeal the review division\u2019s affirmance of the commissioner\u2019s finding that she was not a dependent to the Appellate Court. Therefore, the estate is the only plaintiff before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b284-9\"> Practice Book \u00a7 4126 provides: \u201cAppeals maybe taken to the supreme court in causes determined in the appellate court where the supreme court, upon petition of an aggrieved party or request of the appellate panel which heard the case, certifies the case for review.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b285-6\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 31-307 provides in relevant part: \u201cIf any injury for which compensation is provided under the provisions of this chapter results in total incapacity to work, there shall be paid to the injured employee a weekly compensation equal to sixty-six and two-thirds per cent of his average weekly earnings at the time of the injury; but the compensation shall in no case be more than the maximum weekly benefit rate set forth in section 31-309 for the year in which the injury occurred ....
