The plaintiffs, Christine Arway et ah,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appealed to the Superior Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>from a decision of the defendant zoning commission of the town of Redding approving a site plan and special permit application filed by the defendants Richard Bloom and Walter S. Bloom.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Sustaining the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, the trial court concluded that the zoning decision had become procedurally indefensible after nullification of the wetlands decision. The Appellate Court granted the defendants\u2019 petition for certification to appeal and reversed the trial court\u2019s absolute linkage of the two statutes. <em>Arway </em>v. <em>Bloom, </em>29 Conn. App. 469, 482, 615 A.2d 1075 (1992). Because the trial court had not considered substantive issues raised by the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, the Appellate Court remanded the case for further proceedings to address those issues. Id., 481-82. We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 petition for certification to review the Appellate Court\u2019s disposition of this case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">After examining the record on appeal and after considering the briefs and the arguments of the parties, we have concluded that the appeal in this case should be dismissed on the ground that certification was improvidently granted. The issues have been fully and persuasively considered in the opinion of the Appellate Court; <em>Arway </em>v. <em>Bloom, </em>supra, 473-81; and it would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the discussion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>therein contained. See <em>Fleet Bank of Connecticut </em>v. <em>Dowling, </em>225 Conn. 447, 449, 623 A.2d 1005 (1993); <em>Hyatt </em>v. <em>Milford, </em>224 Conn. 441, 445, 619 A.2d 450 (1993). At oral argument before this court, the parties agreed that subsequent applications to the zoning commission have, for practical purposes, cured the procedural default upon which the trial court ruled and upon which the Appellate Court based its decision. There remain, however, the unresolved substantive issues with respect to which the Appellate Court properly-ordered further proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b822-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 8-3 provides in relevant part: \u201cestablishment and CHANGING OF ZONING REGULATIONS AND DISTRICTS.
