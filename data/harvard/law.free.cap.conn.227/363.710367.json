J.</author>\n<p id=\"APO\">The principal issue in this appeal is whether the state constitution prohibits a warrantless automobile search supported by probable cause but conducted while the automobile is impounded at a police station. The defendant, Jonathan L. Miller, was charged with criminal possession of a weapon in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-217.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number><em>Damiani, J., </em>rendered a judgment of conviction upon the defendant\u2019s plea of nolo contendere; see General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> which was conditional upon his right to appeal the denial by the trial court, <em>Miano, J., </em>of his motion to suppress evidence obtained during his arrest and the search and seizure of his automobile. On the defendant\u2019s appeal, the Appellate Court reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment on the ground that the search of the defendant\u2019s automobile had violated article first, \u00a7 7,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Connecticut constitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>29 Conn. App. 207, 614 A.2d 1229 (1992). The Appellate Court rejected, however, the defendant\u2019s claim that he was entitled to suppression of evidence that had allegedly been obtained through unconstitutionally extraterritorial conduct by the West Hartford police in Hartford. We subsequently granted the defendant\u2019s and the state\u2019s petitions for certification to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court, and we now affirm.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>The relevant facts are reported in the decision of the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 209-11. On March 17, 1990, three men allegedly robbed a supermarket in West Hartford. Id., 209. Witnesses observed two of the three alleged robbers flee the scene in a light gray Chrysler automobile with Connecticut license plate identification 428GFK. Id., 209-10. Shortly thereafter, the witnesses reported this information to the West Hartford police, who discovered that the automobile was registered to the defendant, whose address is 41 Arlington Street in Hartford. Id., 210. Police officers from West Hartford and Hartford then went to Arlington Street to apprehend the defendant, but neither he nor his automobile was present at that location. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Three West Hartford police officers, including detective Jay St. Jacques, remained at Arlington Street in unmarked police cars parked at both ends of the street. At the request of St. Jacques, all other police cars left the area. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">About forty minutes later, a light gray Chrysler drove down Arlington Street. St. Jacques followed the automobile until it stopped. When the driver, who was the defendant, exited the automobile, St. Jacques shone his high beam lights on him, drew a weapon and identified himself as a police officer. Id. As the defendant attempted to reenter the automobile and start it, addi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>tional West Hartford police officers arrived. They removed the defendant from the automobile and patted him down, but discovered no incriminating evidence. Id., 210-11. After the officers had handcuffed the defendant and placed him in the back seat of one of the West Hartford police cars, St. Jacques retrieved the keys to the Chrysler from the defendant\u2019s pocket. St. Jacques unlocked the defendant\u2019s automobile and searched the passenger compartment, but discovered no incriminating evidence. Id., 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The witnesses subsequently positively identified the defendant as one of the alleged robbers, and the police transported him to the West Hartford police station. The defendant\u2019s automobile was towed to the West Hartford police department garage, where the police secured it and conducted a warrantless search, which revealed a .357 Smith and Wesson revolver in the trunk. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The state charged the defendant with criminal possession of a weapon, in violation of \u00a7 53a-217.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant moved to suppress evidence, including the gun recovered from his automobile\u2019s trunk. In support of his motion, the defendant argued that the gun was the fruit of an illegal search and seizure of the automobile and of an illegal arrest. The trial court, <em>Miano, J., </em>denied the motion. The trial court, <em>Damiani, J., </em>subsequently rendered a judgment of conviction upon the defendant\u2019s conditional plea of nolo contendere.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Pursuant to \u00a7 54-94a, the defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction to the Appellate Court claiming that (1) the West Hartford police had acted outside their territorial jurisdiction by performing an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>investigation, stakeout, Terry<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> stop and warrantless seizure<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> of the defendant\u2019s automobile in Hartford, and (2) the warrantless search of the defendant\u2019s automobile at the West Hartford police garage was not justified by any exception to the warrant requirement and thereby violated the fourth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Although the Appellate Court rejected the defendant\u2019s first claim, it reversed the judgment of the trial court on the ground that article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution prohibits the warrantless search of an automobile that has been impounded at a police garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">In this certified appeal, both the defendant and the state take issue with the decision of the Appellate Court. The defendant contends that article tenth, \u00a7 1, article first, \u00a7 7, and article first, \u00a7 9, of the Connecticut constitution prohibit municipal police from conducting an extraterritorial investigation, stakeout, <em>Terry </em>stop or warrantless seizure. The defendant asserts, therefore, that the Appellate Court improperly affirmed the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress on that ground. The state argues that the warrantless search of the defendant\u2019s automobile, while it was impounded at the West Hartford police station, was valid under article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution. The state contends, therefore, that the Appellate Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>improperly reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress on that ground. We reject both of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">The defendant contends that the trial court should have suppressed the gun recovered by West Hartford police officers from his automobile because the officers acted in violation of article tenth, \u00a7 1, article first, \u00a7 7, and article first, \u00a7 9, when they conducted an investigation, stakeout, <em>Terry </em>stop and warrantless automobile seizure in Hartford. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">At the outset, we note that we need not decide whether the <em>Terry </em>stop of the defendant was invalid pursuant to the cited constitutional provisions. Even if the stop were unconstitutional, no evidence flowed from it<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and, therefore, the subsequent prosecution of the defendant was not tainted by it. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 216. Accordingly, any illegality in the stop would not require dismissal of the charges against the defendant or a reversal of his conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>198 Conn. 255, 262-63, 502 A.2d 886, cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1143, 106 S. Ct. 1797, 90 L. Ed. 2d 342 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">Because, however, the discovery by the West Hartford police of the gun that the defendant seeks to have suppressed flowed from the investigation, stakeout and warrantless seizure of his automobile in Hartford,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>must address the validity of those activities. The defendant contends that the extraterritorial conduct of the West Hartford police violated three provisions of the state constitution. We will address these three arguments seriatim.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">First, the defendant contends that the home rule provision of the state constitution, contained in article tenth, \u00a7 1, prohibits a municipality from exercising any authority that is not expressly permitted by statute. Specifically, the defendant asserts that, because the conduct of the West Hartford police in Hartford exceeded the legislature\u2019s delegation of municipal authority, that conduct also violated article tenth, \u00a7 1. The defendant relies on General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 7-148, 7-276, 7-277a, 7-281, 29-7, 29-169, 29-176 and 54-lf<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>as reflecting the relevant legislative limitations on municipal police officers\u2019 authority to engage in extraterritorial police activity. The defendant does not claim, however, that the alleged statutory violations themselves necessitate suppression of the gun. Rather, he relies solely on the alleged constitutional violations to support his claim that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">\u201cMunicipalities, because they are creations of the state, have no inherent legislative authority.\u201d <em>Simons </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>v. <em>Canty, </em>195 Conn. 524, 529, 488 A.2d 1267 (1985). Rather, the legislative authority of municipalities derives solely from express legislative grants. Article tenth, \u00a7 1, of the Connecticut constitution embodies this rule: \u201cThe general assembly shall by general law delegate such legislative authority as from time to time it deems appropriate to towns, cities and boroughs relative to the powers, organization, and form of government of such political subdivisions.\u201d Thus, \u201cthe sole font of municipal authority is legislative delegation in the form of a general statute or a special act adopted prior to the effective date of article tenth.\u201d Id., 530; see <em>City Council </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>180 Conn. 243, 248, 429 A.2d 481 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>The home rule provision, however, limits only the legislative powers of municipalities. Although we may have broadly described the home rule provision in prior cases as limiting a municipality\u2019s general authority to conduct its affairs, home rule is a constraint only on municipalities\u2019 legislative powers. The language of article tenth, \u00a7 1, clarifies this limited scope: \u201cThe general assembly shall . . . delegate such <em>legislative </em>authority .. . .\u2019\u2019(Emphasis added.) Moreover, the home rule provision\u2019s focus is evident from the dual purposes of that provision: \u201c[1] to relieve the General Assembly of the burdensome task of handling and enacting special <em>legislation </em>of local municipal concern and [2] to enable a municipality to draft and adopt a home rule <em>charter or ordinance </em>which shall constitute the organic law of the city . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Environmental Protection, </em>193 Conn. 506, 521, 479 A.2d 208 (1984). The home rule provision thus \u201cprohibits the legislature from encroaching on the local authority to <em>regulate </em>matters of purely local concern.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.; see also <em>Carofano </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>196 Conn. 623, 630, 495 A.2d 1011 (1985). Accordingly, it is beyond dispute that the home rule provision, contained in article tenth, \u00a7 1, of the Connecticut constitution, limits a municipality\u2019s legislative powers, and has no application to the scope of a municipality\u2019s other powers. Because the West Hartford police were not exercising legislative authority, the defendant\u2019s home rule argument is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The defendant contends, however, that even if the home rule provision by its terms concerns only the legislative authority of municipalities, we should invalidate the conduct of the West Hartford police in this case pursuant to the \u201cpenumbras\u201d of article tenth, \u00a7 1. Specifically, the defendant claims that, because the conduct of the West Hartford police violated statutory constraints on municipal police officers\u2019 authority to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>conduct extraterritorial investigatory activities, the \u201cpenumbras\u201d of the home rule provision were violated. Lacking further explanation by the defendant of the nature of these alleged \u201cpenumbras,\u201d however, and in light of home rule\u2019s origin in the status of municipalities as statutory creations with no inherent legislative power, we reject the defendant\u2019s proposed extension of article tenth, \u00a7 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Second, the defendant argues that the West Hartford police, by conducting the investigation, stakeout and warrantless automobile seizure in Hartford, violated article first, \u00a7 7, which, inter alia, proscribes unreasonable seizures.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The defendant contends that, because the West Hartford police officers\u2019 conduct violated statutory constraints on their territorial authority, that conduct was per se unreasonable under article first, \u00a7 7. The state argues, to the contrary, that a seizure may be constitutionally reasonable even if it is not specifically authorized by statute. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Although statutes may, in some circumstances, help to define the contours of constitutional rights; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>216 Conn. 172, 180-81, 579 A.2d 484 (1990); cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyner, </em>225 Conn. 450, 468, 625 A.2d 791 (1993); we are not persuaded that the prohibition in article first, \u00a7 7, of unreasonable seizures encompasses the legislature\u2019s territorial restrictions on police conduct. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 7-148, 7-276, 7-277a, 7-281, 29-7, 29-169, 29-176 and 54-lf set out in footnote 12. Legislative enactments are expressions of this state\u2019s public policy and do not necessarily define the outer boundaries of constitutional protections. Indeed, the legislature has the power to prohibit, as a matter of policy, that which we have held to be constitutional. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Compare <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFusco, </em>224 Conn. 627, 620 A.2d 746 (1993) (holding that warrantless police searches of curbside garbage containers are permissible under article first, \u00a7 7), with 1993 House Bill No. 7237, \u00a7 2 (seeking to prohibit such searches; no action was taken on the House floor regarding this bill). The defendant has pointed to nothing in the text, purpose or legislative history of the relevant statutes, however, to indicate that the legislature intended to equate the prohibited conduct with that which is constitutionally unreasonable pursuant to article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution. Accordingly, we reject the defendant\u2019s argument. .</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Finally, the defendant argues that article first, \u00a7 9, which provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be arrested, detained or punished, except in cases clearly warranted by law,\u201d prohibits the extraterritorial investigation, stakeout, <em>Terry </em>stop and warrantless automobile seizure in which the West Hartford police engaged in Hartford. Because we need not resolve the validity of the West Hartford police officers\u2019 detention of the defendant; <em>State </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>supra; this claim requires us to decide only whether the investigation, stakeout and warrantless automobile seizure violated article first, \u00a7 9. We conclude that they did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Although article first, \u00a7 9, constitutes \u201cone of our state constitutional provisions guaranteeing due process of law\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>supra, 177; our cases applying that provision have generally involved personal liberty. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>223 Conn. 635, 646-53, 613 A.2d 1300 (1992) (determining whether a seizure of the defendant had occurred); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>supra, 180 (validity of detention that is not based on probable cause); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carroll, </em>131 Conn. 224, 227-29, 38 A.2d 798 (1944) (validity of warrantless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>arrest). The defendant provides no argument that the prohibition in article first, \u00a7 9, of restraints on personal liberty, such as arrests, detentions and punishment, that are not \u201cclearly warranted by law\u201d also includes a prohibition on illegal investigations, stakeouts and warrantless automobile seizures. Indeed, the crux of the defendant\u2019s argument is that, because the West Hartford police officers\u2019 conduct violated statutory constraints on extraterritorial police activities, it <em>thereby </em>violated article first, \u00a7 9. Accordingly, we hold that the West Hartford police officers\u2019 investigation, stakeout and warrantless automobile seizure did not violate article first, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">We thus conclude that the investigatory conduct in Hartford by the West Hartford police did not violate article tenth, \u00a7 1, article first, \u00a7 7, or article first, \u00a7 9, of the state constitution. The Appellate Court properly affirmed the trial court\u2019s refusal to suppress the gun on those grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">The state contends that the West Hartford police officers\u2019 warrantless search of the defendant\u2019s automobile at the West Hartford police station was permissible under article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution and, therefore, that the Appellate Court improperly reversed the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress on that ground. The state\u2019s claim directly raises the question whether the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Maroney, </em>399 U.S. 42, 51-52, 90 S. Ct. 1975, 26 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1970), which interpreted the fourth amendment to permit a warrantless automobile search supported by probable cause and conducted while the automobile was impounded at a police station, is valid as a matter of state constitutional law. We are persuaded that it is not valid.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>We begin our analysis of this state constitutional question of first impression with a summary of the origin of the automobile exception to the warrant requirement and the United States Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent expansion of that exception in <em>Chambers. </em>In <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>United States, </em>267 U.S. 132, 153, 45 S. Ct. 280, 69 L. Ed. 543 (1925), the United States Supreme Court held that the fourth amendment is not violated by a roadside warrantless search of an automobile if the police have probable cause to search the automobile and if obtaining a warrant would be impracticable because of the possibility that the automobile will be moved out of the jurisdiction. The rule announced in <em>Carroll </em>has come to be called the automobile exception to the warrant requirement. Connecticut recognizes this exception as a matter of state constitutional law. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>209 Conn. 98, 126, 547 A.2d 10 (1988).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>In <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Maroney, </em>supra, the United States Supreme Court extended the automobile exception to validate a warrantless search of an automobile that had been impounded at a police station. In support of its decision, the court stated that \u201c[flor constitutional purposes, we see no difference between on the one hand seizing and holding a car before presenting the probable cause issue to a magistrate and on the other hand carrying out an immediate search without a warrant. Given probable cause to search, either course is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d Id., 52. The present case requires that we determine whether article first, \u00a7 7, permits this expansion of the automobile exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">We note, as a preliminary matter, that we are not bound in our state constitutional inquiry by the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Chambers. </em>\u201c[W]e may find greater protection of individual rights under our state constitution than that provided by the federal constitution. \u2018It is well established that federal constitutional . . . law establishes a minimum national standard for the exercise of individual rights and does not inhibit state governments from affording higher levels of protection for such rights. . . .\u2019(Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>[supra, 649]. Moreover, we have held that \u2018[i]n the area of fundamental civil liberties\u2014which includes all protections of the declaration of rights contained in article first of the Connecticut constitution\u2014we sit as a court of last resort. ... In such constitutional adjudication, our first referent is Connecticut law and the full panoply of rights Connecticut citizens have come to expect as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>their due. Accordingly, decisions of the United States Supreme Court defining fundamental rights are persuasive authority to be afforded respectful consideration, but they are to be followed by Connecticut courts only when they provide no less individual protection than is guaranteed by Connecticut law.\u2019. . . <em>State v. Marsala, </em>216 Conn. 150, 160, 579 A.2d 58 (1990). Recognizing that our state constitution \u2018is an instrument of progress . . . is intended to stand for a great length of time and should not be interpreted too narrowly or too literally\u2019 . . . <em>State v. Oquendo, </em>supra, 649; we have concluded in several cases that the state constitution provides broader protection of individual rights than does the federal constitution. See, e.g., id., 652; <em>State v. Marsala, </em>supra, 171; <em>State v. Dukes, </em>[supra, 112], and cases cited therein.\u201d <em>State v. DeFusco, </em>supra, 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">In our independent determination of whether to follow the <em>Chambers </em>rule as a matter of state constitutional law, several factors may be useful: \u201c(1) the <em>textual approach; </em>see, e.g., <em>Stolberg v. Caldwell, </em>175 Conn. 586, 597-98, 402 A.2d 763 (1978), appeal dismissed sub nom. <em>Stolberg v. Davidson, </em>454 U.S. 958, 102 S. Ct. 496, 70 L. Ed. 2d 374 (1981) (\u2018Unless there is some clear reason for not doing so, effect must be given to every part of and each word in the constitution.\u2019); (2) <em>holdings and dicta of this court, and the Appellate Court; </em>see, e.g., <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Maher, </em>40 Conn. Sup. 394, 448-49, 515 A.2d 134 (1986) (trial court used strict scrutiny to analyze sex discrimination claim based on the equal protection clause of the state constitution, relying, in part, on dicta from the Connecticut Supreme Court regarding what standard would be used once Connecticut\u2019s equal rights amendment was adopted); (3) <em>federal </em>precedent; see, e.g., <em>State v. Lamme, </em>[supra, 184] (\u2018The adoption of federal constitutional precedents that appropriately illuminate open textured provisions in our own organic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>document in no way compromises our obligation independently to construe the provisions of our state constitution.\u2019); (4) <em>sister state decisions </em>or sibling approach; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Gethers, </em>197 Conn. 369, 386-87, 497 A.2d 408 (1985); <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>[192 Conn. 48, 58-59,469 A.2d 1201 (1984)]; (5) the <em>historical approach, </em>including the historical constitutional setting and the debates of the framers; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Lamme, </em>supra, 178-80; <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>supra, 60-62; <em>Palka </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>124 Conn. 121, 126, 198 A. 265 (1938); and (6) <em>economic/sociological considerations. </em>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>[219 Conn. 529, 546, 594 A.2d 917 (1991)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>supra, 115; see generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Jewett, </em>146 Vt. 221, 500 A.2d 233 (1985); M.

Rev. 583 (1986) (book review).\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 685-86, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">Applying these analytical tools, we note that neither the text nor the history of article first, \u00a7 7, provides any reason to depart from the United States Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the federal constitution in this case.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As we have previously held, the text of article first, \u00a7 7, is similar to the text of the fourth amendment. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>supra, 159. Additionally, the history of article first, \u00a7 7, does not illuminate the appropriate scope of the automobile exception because the modern nature and function of the automobile, on which that exception is predicated, were unknown in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>1818. Cf. id., 167 n.12 (fourth amendment and article first, \u00a7 7, were both enacted to prohibit general warrants and writs of assistance). We turn, therefore, to the other analytical tools suggested in <em>Geisler.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">This court\u2019s precedents involving the state constitution\u2019s warrant requirement express a strong policy in favor of warrants that supports the Appellate Court\u2019s conclusion that article first, \u00a7 7, provides broader protection than does the fourth amendment against warrantless searches of automobiles that have been impounded at police stations, even though probable cause exists. For example, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>226 Conn. 514, 544-47, 628 A.2d 567 (1993), we rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that article first, \u00a7 7, requires de novo review of the probable cause determination made by a judge issuing a warrant, in part because of our concern that such review would discourage the police from seeking warrants. Additionally, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>supra, 695-96, we held that, despite the validity of the emergency exception to the state constitution\u2019s warrant requirement, the police must retreat from a house that they have entered pursuant to that exception as soon as the emergency ceases to exist. See also <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFusco, </em>supra, 642; <em>State </em>v. <em>Duntz, </em>223 Conn. 207, 216, 613 A.2d 224 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>supra, 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">Our constitutional preference for warrants reflects a goal of protecting citizens from unjustified police intrusions by interposing a neutral decisionmaker between the police and the object of the proposed search. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>supra; cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>162 Conn. 440, 444, 294 A.2d 517, cert. denied, 409 U.S. 870, 93 S. Ct. 198, 34 L. Ed. 2d 121 (1972) (purpose of fourth amendment is to require neutral and detached magistrate to make probable cause determination). Accordingly, a search is invalid if the police, without a justification rooted in a valid exception to the warrant requirement, have relied upon only their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>own probable cause evaluation, even if later found to be correct, before searching. We thus read the two clauses of article first, \u00a7 7, in conjunction\u2014a warrant-less search is per se unreasonable, justified only by limited exceptions\u2014rather than in disjunction\u2014a search is valid if it is reasonable, and the presence of a warrant is just one factor in the determination of reasonableness. Cf., e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>200 Conn. 412, 423, 512 A.2d 160, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, 107 S. Ct. 423, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986) (construing fourth amendment to bar warrantless searches as per se unreasonable); see generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Larocco, </em>794 P.2d 460, 467-69 (Utah 1990) (extensive discussion of the consequences of reading the two clauses of the fourth amendment in conjunction and in disjunction); R. Bloom, \u201cWarrant Requirement\u2014The Burger Court Approach,\u201d 53 U. Colo. L. Rev. 691 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">Our constitutional preference for warrants is overcome only in specific and limited circumstances. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>supra, 691 (recognizing emergency exception as matter of state constitutional law); <em>State </em>v. <em>Delossantos, </em>211 Conn. 258, 266-67, 559 A.2d 164, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 866, 110 S. Ct. 188, 107 L. Ed. 2d 142 (1989) (recognizing exception for search incident to arrest as matter of state constitutional law); <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>supra, 126 (recognizing automobile exception on the highway as a matter of state constitutional law). These recognized exceptions derive primarily from acknowledged interests in protecting the safety of the police and the public and in preserving evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">In this case, the state offers two principal justifications for expanding the automobile exception to permit a warrantless automobile search that is conducted after the automobile has been impounded at a police station. First, the state asserts that it may be necessary, under certain circumstances, to delay a warrant-less automobile search until such time as the automobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>is located in a safe, convenient place. This proffered justification primarily expresses a concern for the safety of the police while they are at the scene of an automobile seizure. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">The state\u2019s argument fails because it relies upon the fiction that the legitimate safety concern that may necessitate towing an automobile from the site of its seizure to the police station also provides justification for the warrantless search of that automobile at the station. We refused to accept a similar fiction in <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>supra, 695-96, in which we held that the police must obtain a search warrant upon expiration of the emergency that initially justified the warrant-less entry into a suspect\u2019s home. Moreover, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>supra, 427, we refused to extend the fiction that the passenger compartment of an automobile is <em>always </em>within reach of the arrestee to circumstances in which the arrestee is no longer at the scene when the warrantless search is undertaken. These fictions are inconsistent with our constitutionally mandated preference for warrants. We therefore reject the state\u2019s suggestion that the risks that lead police to tow an automobile to the police station also justify a warrantless search of the automobile after it has been impounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Second, the state contends that a person\u2019s privacy interest in his or her automobile is invaded to the same extent whether a warrantless search of that automobile is conducted at the scene of its seizure or at the police station. The state argues, therefore, that a warrantless automobile search at the police station is constitutionally permissible whenever a warrantless on-the-scene search would be permissible. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">We tolerate the warrantless on-the-scene automobile search <em>only </em>because obtaining a warrant would be impracticable in light of the inherent mobility of automobiles and the latent exigency that that mobil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>ity creates.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> See <em>Carroll </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 153. The balance between law enforcement interests and individuals\u2019 privacy interests thus tips in favor of law enforcement in the context of an on-the-scene automobile search. If the impracticability of obtaining a warrant no longer exists, however, our state constitutional preference for warrants regains its dominant place in that balance, and a warrant is required.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">Our conclusion is supported by decisions of other courts that have limited the applicability of the automobile exception pursuant to their state constitutions. For example, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Kock, </em>302 Or. 29, 33, 725 P.2d 1285 (1986), the Oregon Supreme Court held, pursuant to the Oregon constitution, that, although \u201c[s]earehes of automobiles that <em>have just been lawfully stopped by police </em>may be searched without a warrant and without a demonstration of exigent circumstances when police have probable cause to believe that the automobile contains contraband or crime evidence . . . any search of an automobile that was parked, immobile and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>unoccupied at the time the police first encountered it . . . must be authorized by a warrant ... or, alternatively, the prosecutor must demonstrate that exigent circumstances other than the potential mobility of the automobile exist.\" (Emphasis added.) See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Larocco, </em>supra, 469-70 (warrantless automobile searches are permissible under the state constitution only if supported by probable cause and if necessary to protect the police or the public or to prevent the destruction of evidence).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Finally, we note that our holding will require suppression of unconstitutionally obtained evidence only if the state fails to establish that the evidence would subsequently have been obtained pursuant to the inevitable discovery doctrine. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Badgett, </em>supra, 432-34. In this case, the Appellate Court has ordered the trial court to determine whether the inevitable discovery rule would justify the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the gun, despite the unconstitutionality of the search in which the gun was recovered. <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 236.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">In light of our demonstrated constitutional preference for warrants and our concomitant obligation narrowly to circumscribe exceptions to the state constitutional warrant requirement, we conclude that a warrantless automobile search supported by probable cause, but conducted after the automobile has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>impounded at the police station, violates article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution. Accordingly, the Appellate Court properly upheld the defendant\u2019s claim that the gun should have been suppressed on that ground.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">In this opinion Borden, Berdon and Katz, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-8\"> Initially, the state filed a long form amended information charging the defendant with robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4), and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) and 53a-48 (a).

See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Redfeam, 441 </em>So. 2d 200, 202 (La. 1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moses, </em>408 Mass. 136, 145-46, 557 N.E.2d 14 (1990); State v. <em>Gallant, </em>133 N.H. 138, 146-47, 574 A.2d 385 (1990); <em>People </em>v. <em>Blasich, </em>73 N.Y.2d 673, 681, 541 N.E.2d 40, 543 N.Y.S.2d 40 (1989). We are not persuaded by these decisions, however, because they rely primarily on the proposition that any justification for conducting a warrantless on-the-scene automobile search is sufficient justification for a search conducted after the automobile has been towed to the police station. As previously discussed, we reject that proposition as incompatible with our constitutional preference for warrants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b409-8\"> We decline the defendant\u2019s invitation to reject the automobile exception entirely and instead to create an exception that requires exigency to justify warrantless searches of vehicles and possessions. We have recognized the automobile exception as a matter of state constitutional law; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>209 Conn. 98,126, 547 A.2d 10 (1988); and, in light of the particular circumstances of this case, see no reason to question those decisions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b409-7\">Callahan, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A9c\">concurring in part and dissenting in part. I agree with part I of the majority opinion. As to part II, however, I believe that the majority is reaching to expand the scope of the state constitution when such an expansion has scant support and serves no useful purpose. The majority concedes that neither textually nor historically is there any justification for the application of the state warrant requirement to this set of facts. It, nonetheless, discovers that Connecticut citizens are entitled to greater protection from searches and seizures, when there is probable cause to believe that their motor vehicles are the repositories of weapons or contraband, than that provided by the federal constitution. The majority concludes, consequently, contrary to a long line of cases commencing with <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Maroney, </em>399 U.S. 42, 90 S. Ct. 1975, 26 L. Ed. 2d 419 (1970), that the police in this instance were required by the state constitution to obtain a warrant to search the defendant\u2019s automobile, even though the search and resultant seizure of the holdup weapon, a .357 caliber revolver, would have been constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>without a warrant under federal law, which we have followed up until this point. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>183 Conn. 148, 153, 438 A.2d 851 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Schoenbneelt, </em>171 Conn. 119, 123, 368 A.2d 117 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">The state constitution, like its federal counterpart, proscribes only unreasonable searches and seizures. <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>209 Conn. 98, 121, 547 A.2d 10 (1988). It seems to me that if it is reasonable, and a proper exception to the warrant requirement, for the police to search a motor vehicle on the street without a warrant if they have probable cause to do so, and the majority does not dispute that it is, then a search of that same vehicle with the same probable cause does not become unreasonable if the vehicle is moved to a location where the search can be conducted with greater care and safety. The majority opinion will force the police to conduct motor vehicle searches in dangerous places and before hostile crowds or risk having valuable evidence suppressed at trial, if they determine that it is imperative that they pursue their investigation with dispatch rather than wait for a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The police may be spared such dilemmas, however, because of the inventory exception to the warrant requirement which, at least for the moment, remains viable. That \u201cwell-defined exception to the warrant requirement\u201d; (internal quotation marks omitted) <em>State </em>v. <em>Gasparro, </em>194 Conn. 96, 107, 480 A.2d 509 (1984), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 828, 106 S. Ct. 90, 88 L. Ed. 2d 74 (1985); allows the police, if their department has an established inventory policy, to comb the interior of a motor vehicle in their possession in order to inventory the vehicle and its contents. Id., 108. The obvious justification is to guard the police and others against the possible presence of dangerous articles in the vehicle, and to protect against potential claims of theft, loss or damage. See <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Lafayette, </em>462 U.S. 640, 646, 103 S. Ct. 2605, 77 L. Ed. 2d 65 (1983). An inventory may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>be done as a reasonable exception to the warrant requirement, without a warrant and without probable cause to believe that the vehicle contains anything even remotely connected to a crime. The majority opinion may result in a dramatic rise in the number of such searches.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">That last comment is made not to encourage subterfuge or disrespect for the law, but to point out the illogic of constitutionally allowing the police to conduct inventories at police headquarters without a warrant and without probable cause, but not allowing them constitutionally to search, without a warrant, a vehicle they have probable cause to believe contains weapons or evidence of criminal activity that is properly in their possession at that same police headquarters. I do not, incidentally, have a problem with the reasonableness of inventory searches. My point is that the majority opinion seems to create an irrational distinction between what constitutes a proper exception to the warrant requirement when the criteria for inventory searches and what the police did in this case are laid side by side. I think <em>Chambers </em>had it right, relocating a motor vehicle to be searched by the police, who have probable cause to conduct a search of the vehicle, to a more secure site does not convert a reasonable warrantless search into an unreasonable one. The majority opinion appears to be simply a flexing of state constitutional muscle for its own sake.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
