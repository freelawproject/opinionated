The defendant appealed to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b) (3).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">The defendant claims that the denial of his motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant was improper because: (1) the trial court refused the defendant\u2019s request to require the testimony of Judge Anne C. Dranginis, who had issued the search warrant, and Judge Charles D. Gill, who the defendant claims abandoned his judicial role by providing the police with a Federal Bureau of Investigation pamphlet concerning the preparation of warrants in child molestation cases; (2) the search warrant was issued by a judge who was not neutral and detached; (3) the issuance of the warrant and the seizures that were conducted pursuant to it violated the first amendment to the United States constitution as applied to the states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment; (4) the warrant was issued without probable cause; (5) the warrant was sufficiently vague to render it general and overbroad; (6) seizures were made by the police that were not authorized by the warrant; (7) development of film seized by the police constituted an additional search that required securing a second warrant to authorize that search under the United States and Connecticut constitutions; and (8) the acquisition by the Massachusetts police of 194 photographs constituted an illegal seizure of those photographs, thus tainting the subsequent issuance of the warrant. The defendant also claims that he was convicted of multiple crimes arising out of a single offense, which constituted a violation of the fifth amendment to the United States constitution as applied to the states by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment and the separation of powers provisions of article second of the Connecticut constitution. We now affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">The trial court found the following facts in connection with the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. On or about August 19, 1987, Robin Zarick, the wife of the defendant, left several rolls of film at a Shop Rite supermarket in Bristol to be developed. The film was forwarded to Guardian Photo (Guardian), a commercial developing laboratory in Auburn, Massachusetts. Guardian had a company policy to bring to the attention of the police questionable photographs sent to it for development.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">On August 21, 1987, Guardian\u2019s plant manager brought the Zarick photographs to the attention of the Auburn police department. On the basis of Robin Zarick\u2019s return address on the film developing envelopes, the Auburn police referred the matter to the police in Plymouth, Connecticut, and delivered the photographs to the Plymouth police department. These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>photographs (hereafter, the Massachusetts photographs) consisted of 194 photographs, some of which depicted breasts and genitalia of children, as well as naked boys and girls in sexually explicit positions and poses. In addition, some of the Massachusetts photographs depicted costumed children wearing heavy makeup in sexually suggestive poses.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">After viewing these photographs, officers of the Plymouth police department prepared a search warrant application for the Zarick estate in Plymouth. One of the officers responsible for preparing the search warrant application consulted Superior Court Judge Charles D. Gill for advice in connection therewith.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Judge Gill was known by the officer to be an expert in the area of abused and neglected children. Judge Gill provided the officers with a Federal Bureau of Investigation pamphlet and an investigative manual from the Center for Missing and Exploited Children.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Subsequently, on the evening of August 22,1987, the Plymouth police took the completed warrant application to Judge Anne C. Dranginis for her review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition to the warrant application, the officers brought with them the Massachusetts photographs for Judge Dranginis to examine. Judge Dranginis concluded that the warrant application showed probable cause for the crime of risk of injury to a child and issued the search warrant. The record does not indicate whether Judge Dranginis examined the Massachusetts photographs prior to or subsequent to the issuance of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">The warrant was executed on the morning of August 23,1987. The police seized numerous items of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>evidence, including sexually explicit photographs, undeveloped film, props and model release forms prepared by the defendant or Robin Zarick. The police also left a significant amount of evidence that they deemed not to fall within the ambit of items described in the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The defendant filed several motions to suppress evidence seized in connection with this search and to dismiss certain of the charges against him. The trial court denied these motions in part.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Following adverse rulings on these motions, the defendant entered pleas of nolo contendere to the thirty-two charges. This appeal followed the ensuing judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly refused to allow him to call Judge Dranginis and Judge Gill to testify at the suppression hearing. The defendant argued that such testimony was required to allow him to explore the extent and scope of assistance provided to the police by Judge Gill, and any possible communication between Judge Gill and Judge Dranginis that could have tainted the warrant process and Judge Dranginis\u2019 state of mind when she issued the warrant. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">The defendant sought to call Judge Gill to determine whether he had discussed the warrant affidavit with Judge Dranginis prior to its issuance. There is no evidence in the record to indicate that such a discussion occurred.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The record also indicates that Judge Gill\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>assistance to the police consisted solely of providing a Federal Bureau of Investigation pamphlet and a manual from the Center for Missing and Exploited Children.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The threshold for requiring the testimony of sitting Superior Court judges as witnesses is high. Such compulsion in Connecticut is disfavored because of concern with the interruption of court business as well as a desire to avoid abuse or harassment of sitting judges. <em>Woodward </em>v. <em>Waterbury, </em>113 Conn. 457, 465, 155 A. 825 (1931); see also C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, Connecticut Evidence (2d Ed. 1988) \u00a7 7.8. To challenge the veracity or accuracy of statements made by an affiant in connection with the preparation of a warrant, a defendant must make a \u201csubstantial preliminary showing\u201d of misconduct by the affiant. <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>438 U.S. 154, 155-56, 98 S. Ct. 2674, 57 L. Ed. 2d 667 (1978); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>223 Conn. 127, 144, 613 A.2d 211 (1992).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">A defendant challenging the role of an issuing judge in connection with the issuance of a warrant presents a claim analogous to the challenge of an affiant\u2019s statements under <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>supra. Such a chal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>lenge requires at a minimum the same substantial preliminary showing of misconduct that is required in the case of a challenge to an affiant\u2019s statements. Our review of the record indicates that there has been no showing by the defendant of any misconduct on the part of Judge Gill that would have justified calling him as a witness. Unsubstantiated, purely speculative assertions cannot substitute for such a showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">The defendant also sought to call Judge Dranginis to question her in connection with her viewing of the Massachusetts photographs. He claims that viewing the photographs may have influenced her decision as to the existence of probable cause by causing her to lose her neutrality. In the alternative, the defendant argues that viewing the photographs would have prevented a finding of probable cause by Judge Dranginis because the affidavit exaggerates the sexual content of the photographs. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Although it is not in dispute that Judge Dranginis viewed some portion of the Massachusetts photographs, the record does not establish whether she viewed them before or after issuing the warrant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Judge Dranginis\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>viewing of the photographs was irrelevant to the propriety of the issuance of the warrant, because the information contained within the four corners of the supporting affidavit was sufficient to allow a judge to find probable cause to issue the warrant.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Couture, </em>194 Conn. 530, 536, 482 A.2d 300 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1192, 105 S. Ct. 967, 83 L. Ed. 2d 971 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">The defendant made no preliminary showing that would have entitled him to an evidentiary hearing regarding any judicial misconduct by Judge Dranginis. The evidence that she, in fact, viewed some of the photographs was presented only because the trial court nonetheless permitted the defendant to examine the police officer regarding the facts surrounding the issuance of the warrant. Thus, this claim suffers from the same flaw as the claim regarding the refusal of the trial court to permit the defendant to call Judge Gill as a witness: the defendant did not make a sufficient preliminary showing of misconduct to warrant the extraordinary remedy of calling a Superior Court judge as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">Furthermore, even if we were to regard the testimony of the police officer as the functional equivalent of an attempt by the defendant to make a substantial preliminary showing of misconduct, that showing was insufficient to mandate calling Judge Dranginis as a witness. If Judge Dranginis viewed the photographs after signing the warrant, there was not even an arguable impropriety on her part, because she had already properly performed her judicial task of viewing the war<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>rant application based upon the material disclosed within the four corners of the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">The defendant\u2019s claim, therefore, rests upon the assertion that Judge Dranginis viewed the photographs before signing the warrant, an arguably improper act only because the photographs, which were described by the affidavit, were not, however, specifically made part of the supporting affidavit. That claim also fails because of an insufficient preliminary showing of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">A Superior Court judge issuing a search warrant is presumed to have performed his or her function properly, until shown to the contrary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>226 Conn. 514, 544-45 n.17, 628 A.2d 567 (1993). The evidence adduced by the defendant in support of his assertion of impropriety on Judge Dranginis\u2019 part, however, was as consistent with the proper exercise of her duties as it was consistent with an arguable impropriety in the exercise of her duties. Given this equipoise in the defendant\u2019s purported preliminary showing, that evidence was insufficient to warrant further factual inquiry by the extraordinary remedy of calling Judge Dranginis as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">The defendant\u2019s alternative claim, that viewing the photographs would illuminate a material misrepresentation in the affidavit supporting the warrant, is essentially a claim under <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>supra, that the warrant affidavit was misleading. In <em>Franks, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that if a defendant makes \u201ca substantial preliminary showing that a false statement knowingly and intentionally, or with reckless disregard for the truth, was included by the affiant in the warrant affidavit, and if the allegedly false statement is necessary for a finding of probable cause, the Fourth Amendment requires that a hearing be held at the defendant\u2019s request.\u201d Id., 155-56; see also <em>State </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 143; <em>State </em>v. <em>Weinberg, </em>215 Conn. 231, 237, 575 A.2d 1003, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 967, 111 S. Ct. 430, 112 L. Ed. 2d 413 (1990). We have previously noted that \u201c[tjhere is, of course, a presumption of validity with respect to the affidavit supporting the search warrant. To mandate an evidentiary hearing, the challenger\u2019s attack must be more than conclusory .... There must be allegations of deliberate falsehood or of reckless disregard for the truth, and those allegations must be accompanied by an offer of proof.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, quoting <em>Franks </em>v. <em>Delaware, </em>supra, 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">Judge Dranginis\u2019 testimony was not necessary to resolve the claim that the Massachusetts photographs were misrepresented in the affidavit. The defendant did not make a substantial preliminary showing of impropriety in connection with the preparation of the warrant application by the Plymouth police or in the review of the warrant application by Judge Dranginis. He has simply raised unsupported claims. Consequently, there was no basis for a <em>Franks </em>hearing in this case.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">The defendant claims that the search warrant that was issued, the seizures that were made pursuant to the warrant and the denial of the motion to suppress the evidence seized were all predicated upon a violation of the first amendment to the United States constitution as made applicable to the states by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>The defendant\u2019s claim is based on a reading of <em>State </em>v. <em>Palangio, </em>24 Conn. App. 300, 303-304, 588 A.2d 644, cert. denied, 218 Conn. 911, 591 A.2d 813 (1991), which, he claims, holds that the photographing of naked children is a per se violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and that such a per se rule violates the first amendment. The defendant has misread <em>Palangio, </em>and has misinterpreted the applicability of that decision to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">In <em>Palangio, </em>the Appellate Court indicated that in certain circumstances photographing naked or partially naked children can be a violation of \u00a7 53-21. That case does not, however, set forth a per se rule that such action is always a violation of \u00a7 53-21. Furthermore, the warrant application prepared by the Plymouth police sought evidence of the crime of risk of injury to a minor. The warrant application did not allege the existence of and did not seek to seize obscene material qua obscene material. The trial court correctly held that the photographs seized pursuant to the warrant constituted evidence of the crime of risk of injury to a child. The photographs memorialized situations created by the defendant that were likely to impair the health or morals of children. Such material is not protected by the first amendment. We are also unconvinced by the defendant\u2019s assertion that because of the \u201cartistic merit\u201d of the photographs seized, the warrant and the seizures thereunder should be subject to greater judicial scrutiny. Claims of artistic value do not override what is otherwise evidence of criminal activity. See generally <em>New York </em>v. <em>Ferber, </em>458 U.S. 747, 761-64, 102 S. Ct. 3348, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1113 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">The defendant next claims that the search warrant was issued without probable cause. As a preliminary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>matter, we note that the defendant has not adequately raised this issue in his brief. Although his brief has a heading that makes reference to a lack of probable cause, the text of the argument that the defendant makes under that heading addresses the issue of the breadth of the warrant and the authority it conferred upon the police to seize particular items, issues we address in part IV of this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">The defendant does not make any reasoned argument that the warrant and the underlying affidavit were insufficient to establish probable cause for the crime of risk of injury to a child. An appellant who fails to brief a claim abandons it; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatum, </em>219 Conn. 721, 742, 595 A.2d 322 (1991); <em>Liscio </em>v. <em>Liscio, </em>204 Conn. 502, 507, 528 A.2d 1143 (1987); <em>Petrizzo </em>v. <em>Commercial Contractors Corporation, </em>152 Conn. 491, 496, 208 A.2d 748 (1965); see generally Practice Book \u00a7 4065.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">A liberal (and perhaps overly generous) construction of a single sentence of the defendant\u2019s brief,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> however, could enable us to reach the question of probable cause for the issuance of the warrant. Giving the defendant the benefit of the doubt on the question of whether the issue of probable cause has been adequately raised on appeal, we conclude that probable cause existed for the issuance of the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">The affidavit accompanying the warrant stated in relevant part that: (1) the police had 194 photographs in envelopes bearing the return address of Robin Zarick, the defendant\u2019s wife. These photographs \u201cshowed . . . children completely nude and partially clothed. The photos showed the vaginal area, breasts and penis area of the juveniles. That some of the photos showed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>the children dressed in costumes and with heavy-makeup on their faces. Other photos showed the children caressing while nude and the children appeared to pose for some of the photos. . . . [T]he photos show young children in sexually explicit positions and caressing each other while naked and partially naked\u201d; (2) the defendant was in one of the photographs holding a naked child; and (3) the defendant had been identified in four separate incident reports by the Waterbury police department as having been photographing young children from his vehicle, and that such activity is a modus operandi of child molesters.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The standard of review for an issuing judge\u2019s determination that probable cause existed to issue a search warrant is to consider the information before the issuing judge at the time of the issuance of the warrant, together with the reasonable inferences drawn from such information, in the light most favorable to the issuing judge\u2019s determination of probable cause. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Spears, </em>965 F.2d 262, 268-71 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, U.S. , 113 S. Ct. 502, 121 L. Ed. 2d 438 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>219 Conn. 557, 565, 594 A.2d 933 (1991); see generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>supra, 536-40, and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">In determining whether probable cause exists to conduct a search, a \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test is used. <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>462 U.S. 213, 233, 103 S. Ct. 2317, 76 L. Ed. 2d 527 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 562; <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>219 Conn. 529, 545, 594 A.2d 917 (1991). \u201c[Pjrobable cause is a fluid concept\u2014turning on the assessment of probabilities in particular factual contexts\u2014not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat set of legal rules.\u201d <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Gates, </em>supra, 232. In determining the existence of probable cause to search, the magistrate should \u201cmake a practical, commonsense decision whether, given all of the circumstances set forth in the affidavit . . . there is a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\u201d Id., 238; <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 563. \u201cIn making this determination [of probable cause], the magistrate is entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the facts presented. When a magistrate has determined that the warrant affidavit presents sufficient objective indicia of reliability to justify a search and has issued a warrant, a court reviewing that warrant at a subsequent suppression hearing should defer to the reasonable inferences drawn by the magistrate.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>supra, 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">In the present case we conclude that the allegations, contained in the warrant application, of the existence of numerous photographs of naked children in sexually suggestive costumes and poses connected with the defendant, as well as the assertion that the defendant was engaged in conduct known to be a modus operandi of child molesters, was sufficient to allow a judge to find probable cause for the crime of risk of injury to a child. We therefore reject this claim of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The defendant next claims that the search warrant was overbroad and general in violation of the fourth amendment to the United States constitution, as made applicable to the states by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment, and article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the warrant was unconstitutionally general in two ways: (1) it authorized seizure of items to which no reference was made in the supporting affidavit; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>(2) it authorized the seizure of broad categories of items in terms so general as to allow the executing officers to substitute their own judgment for that of the issuing judge. Either alleged defect, the defendant claims, rendered the issuance of the warrant unconstitutional. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">The text of the warrant authorized the seizure of the following items: \u201cSexually explicit photographs, negatives, slides, magazines, movies, videotapes, audiotapes, handwritten notes, photographs, art, sex education books, photograph albums and displays, photocopies of photographs or pictures, drawings and tracings, cut and paste pictures, articles of clothing, costumes, jewelry and personal items, charts and records, computers and peripheral equipment, sexual aids, video and photography equipment, Pedophile manuals, photographic reproduction materials, U.S. Flag torn at top near blue and white stars, bill board background with nude and partially clad children and adults, white shredded shirt, black bead necklace with large white teeth attached to it, black robe with white embroidered design on right shoulder, large wooden walking stick, gold and white colored fur hand warmers, black and white animal fur skin, black lace headband, black fur, leopard skin designed belt, pink and blue cloth type bracelet, 1981 Ford LTD bearing Ct. passenger registration plate 271DAF registered to Nikolai Zarick.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">In reviewing a warrant application, a magistrate may apply ordinary dictates of common experience and common sense and may draw normal inferences from the facts alleged in the affidavit. <em>State </em>v. <em>Romano, </em>165 Conn. 239, 245, 332 A.2d 64 (1973). The items that were not mentioned in the affidavit but were authorized to be seized by the warrant<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> could reasonably have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>found by the issuing judge to have been the props and costumes depicted in the Massachusetts photographs that were described in the affidavit. There was no fourth amendment violation of the defendant\u2019s rights by the seizure of these items.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Similarly, we are unconvinced by the defendant\u2019s assertion that the warrant was drafted in terms so over-broad as to render it unconstitutional.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The description of items to be seized in a warrant need only be as specific as the circumstances and the nature of the activity under investigation permit. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruscoe, </em>212 Conn. 223, 234, 563 A.2d 267 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1084, 110 S. Ct. 1144, 107 L. Ed. 2d 1049 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vincent, </em>30 Conn. App. 249, 257-58, 620 A.2d 152, cert. granted, 225 Conn. 917, 623 A.2d 1026 (1993). In this case, the warrant, read as a whole, indicated that evidence related to the crime of risk of injury to a child was to be seized. References to \u201csexually explicit\u201d material, as well as terms such as \u201csexual aids\u201d and \u201cPedophile manuals,\u201d gave the executing officers sufficient guidance to prevent a \u201cgeneral, exploratory rummaging in a person\u2019s belongings.\u201d <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 467, 91 S. Ct. 2022, 29 L. Ed. 2d 564 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">The defendant claims that the police were required to obtain a second search warrant to develop sixty-one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>rolls of film that they acquired from Robin Zarick during the course of their search of the Zarick estate. He argues that the failure of the Plymouth police to obtain a second warrant prior to developing the film violated his rights under the fourth amendment, as made applicable to the states by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment, and article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and rendered the results of that search inadmissable. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">We need not reach the issue of whether a separate warrant is required to develop film seized pursuant to a lawful search because even if such a warrant were required, the search was consented to by Robin Zarick. She voluntarily surrendered the undeveloped film to the police as an example of her art. Implicit with the surrender of the film was the expectation that such film would be developed. A \u201csearch ... is not unreasonable under . . . the fourth amendment to the constitution of the United States ... if a person with authority to do so has freely consented . . . <em>.Schneckloth v.

Whether there was valid consent to a search is a factual question that will not be lightly overturned on appeal. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sanchez-Jaramillo, </em>637 F.2d 1094, 1098 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 862, 101 S. Ct. 166, 66 L. Ed. 2d 79 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">The trial court found, and the defendant does not dispute, that Robin Zarick\u2019s surrender of the film was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>voluntary.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> There was no violation of the defendant\u2019s fourth amendment rights as a result of this voluntary surrender of evidence to the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The defendant also claims that the Massachusetts photographs were illegally seized either by Guardian, acting as an agent of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or by the Massachusetts police. Such an illegal seizure, the defendant argues, tainted the warrant that was subsequently issued as a result of the discovery by the police of the Massachusetts photographs. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The determination of whether Guardian was acting as an agent of the state is a question of fact to be determined by the trial court. In this instance, the trial court found that there was no evidence that Guardian was an agent of the state.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The evidence supporting the trial court\u2019s finding includes the facts that: (1) the policy of turning over questionable photographs to the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>was initiated by Guardian; (2) the decision to turn over specific photographs was entirely up to a Guardian manager; (3) there was no supervision or random checking of Guardian by the police in connection with this policy; and (4) there were no instructions or rules regarding such policy promulgated by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">Factual matters are determined by the finder of fact and are not subject to reversal on appeal unless such findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Groton </em>v. <em>Yankee Gas Services </em>Co., 224 Conn. 675, 691, 620 A.2d 771 (1993); <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Danforth, </em>222 Conn. 150, 156, 609 A.2d 654 (1992). The trial court\u2019s findings that Guardian was not an agent of the state and that the Massachusetts photographs did not improperly come into the possession of the Massachusetts police were not clearly erroneous. Because no seizure of the photographs occurred, the defendant\u2019s claim of a violation of his fourth amendment rights is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Finally, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to dismiss certain counts against him as multiplicitous and violative of the fifth amendment, as made applicable to the states by the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment, and article second of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> A review of the record indicates that the defendant has not preserved his right to challenge the claims he now challenges as multiplicitous and, thus, we do not reach his substantive arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The record indicates that the defendant filed a pretrial motion to dismiss certain counts against him as multiplicitous. This motion failed to identify which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>counts the defendant claimed were multiplicitous. In the trial court, the defendant challenged counts 17, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 44 and 48 as multiplicitous. On appeal, the defendant claims that counts 7, 8, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 45, 51, 52, 57 and 58 are multiplicitous. Because the defendant did not challenge as multiplicitous in the trial court the counts that he now challenges on appeal, he has waived his right to challenge those counts that he challenges on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">In this opinion Borden and Dupont, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a provides: \u201cconditional nolo contendere PLEA.

I write separately because I would order the parties to rebrief the issue of whether there was probable cause to search the defendant\u2019s home. <em>Genovese </em>v. <em>Gallo Wine Merchants, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 475, 479, 628 A.2d 946 (1993). As the majority points out, the defendant did not adequately brief the issue, but merely raised it in one sentence. In <em>Genovese, </em>we, on our own, raised the applicability of a statute and ordered rebriefing by the parties to discuss that statute. \u201cCertainly, if we may use this newly established procedure to achieve justice on behalf of civil litigants, where only money is involved, we must do likewise when an individual\u2019s liberty is at stake.\u201d Id., 496-97. <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting.).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">Alternatively, I would not reach the merits of the probable cause issue. \u201cClaimed errors not adequately briefed and not fully developed will not be considered by this court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tatum, </em>219 Conn. 721, 742, 595 A.2d 322 (1991). Accordingly, I would treat the issue as having been abandoned by the defendant and leave it to be raised in a different forum.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">Furthermore, I am troubled by the analysis of the probable cause issue.

If the warrant affidavit fails to state in specific terms how the informant gained his knowledge or why the police believe the information to be trustworthy, however, the magistrate can also consider all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit to determine whether, despite these deficiencies, other objective indicia of reliability reasonably establish that probable cause to search exists.\u201d Id., 544.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\"><em>Barton </em>did not hold, as the majority suggests, that \u201c[i]n determining whether probable cause exists to conduct a search, a \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 test is used.\u201d Rather, in <em>Barton, </em>this court held that any deficiency in the informant\u2019s reliability or basis of knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>edge could be satisfied by considering the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d Whether the information furnished by the informant together with other firsthand information supplied by the affiants reaches the level of probable cause does not involve a totality of the circumstances analysis. Likewise, if there is no informant, as in the present case, a totality of the circumstances analysis is inappropriate. The court\u2019s use of the totality of the circumstances test to determine whether the information contained in the warrant constitutes probable cause further dilutes the protections of article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Diaz, </em>226 Conn. 514, 560 n.13, 628 A.2d 567 (1993) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">I concur in the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Katz, J., concurring.
