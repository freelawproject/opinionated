At the conclusion of the trial, the defendant was sentenced to serve a term of forty-five years to be suspended after the expiration of thirty-five years. On appeal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the defendant claims that: (1) the state failed to prove the element of intent to commit murder beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) the defendant\u2019s evidence established, as a matter of law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>his affirmative defenses of insanity<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and, in the alternative, extreme emotional disturbance. We remand the case to the three judge court, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4061,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for a further articulation of its determination that the defendant committed the crime of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">We briefly summarize the evidence presented at trial. On the evening of October 21, 1988, the Bridgeport police received information about a single car accident on the east side of the city. When they arrived at the scene, the police found a man, subsequently identified as Nesboume Wright, slumped over in the driver\u2019s seat of a car that had crashed into a fence. Wright\u2019s breathing was labored and he was bleeding profusely from the head. He died shortly thereafter from a wound caused by a bullet fired at close range to the right temple.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Desmond Clark, a distant relative of the defendant, testified that he saw the defendant and the victim at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>a variety store on the evening of October 21,1988, and that the victim agreed to give both Clark and the defendant a ride home. The victim drove to the defendant\u2019s home and double parked on the street in front of the defendant\u2019s residence. Clark then learned that the victim was not planning to take him home first, as the defendant had requested, so Clark got out of the car. As Clark was walking toward the back of the car, he heard gunshots, saw that the defendant was still in the car and then observed the defendant running alongside his residence with a gun in his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">On October 24, 1988, Bridgeport police officers searched the defendant\u2019s home and seized two handguns from the defendant\u2019s bedroom. A forensic firearms expert testified that two of the bullets retrieved from the scene of the shooting, one extracted from the victim\u2019s head and the other from the car, were fired from one of the handguns found in the defendant\u2019s home. At the conclusion of this testimony, the state rested and the defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, which the court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The defendant presented testimony from several expert witnesses and family members to establish that he lacked the requisite mental capacity to commit the crime of murder. The defense called three psychiatrists, including a psychiatrist who had been retained by the state, all of whom testified that the defendant suffered from chronic paranoid schizophrenia and that he had suffered from this illness for at least one year prior to the fatal shooting of the victim. A fourth defense expert, a clinical psychologist, diagnosed the defendant as psychotic. The defendant\u2019s family members recounted incidents of bizarre and eccentric behavior by the defendant and described his mental and physical deterioration over a period of approximately two years prior to the killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>The state called two rebuttal witnesses, a Bridgeport police detective and a psychiatric nurse. The officer provided evidence, obtained in a discussion with the defendant\u2019s mother, that the defendant behaved in a \u201ccrazy\u201d manner when he smoked marijuana, and the nurse testified about certain conduct of the defendant while he was incarcerated at the Bridgeport correctional center, which the state argued, tended to rebut the defendant\u2019s affirmative defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">At the close of the evidence, the defendant again moved for a judgment of acquittal. The motion was denied by the three judge court. Following closing arguments of counsel, the court, on January 16,1991, unanimously found the defendant guilty of murder. The presiding judge issued the decision of the court as follows: \u201cThe panel of judges designated for the trial of this case, after having deliberated on the issues and the facts and the law, unanimously determined that the accused is guilty as charged of the crime of murder.\u201d The record contains no findings of fact or other explanation of the court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">On June 12, 1991, the defendant filed a nine page motion for articulation, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4051,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> requesting the three judge court to articulate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>its finding of guilty. After summarizing the evidence in some detail, the motion sought articulation with respect to the following six questions: \u201c(1) Did the panel find the expert and lay evidence pertaining to the defendant\u2019s mental disorder to be credible; (2) If so, did the panel find that said psychiatric and psychological evidence had any relation to the question of the guilt of the defendant; (3) If the panel found that such expert and lay psychiatric and psychological evidence pertaining to the defendant\u2019s mental disorder was not credible what was the basis of this conclusion by the panel; (4) If the panel found that such expert and lay evidence pertaining to the defendant\u2019s mental disorder bore no relation to the question of the guilt of [the defendant], on what did it base such conclusion; (5) What was the basis of the court\u2019s rejection of [the] defense of extreme emotional disturbance; and (6) What was the basis of the panel\u2019s decision to deny [the defendant\u2019s] motion for examination pursuant to [General Statutes (Rev. to 1989)] \u00a7 17-244?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">On December 3, 1991, the three judge court issued an articulation, which stated in full: \u201cAfter delibera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>tions and consideration of the entire evidence, we unanimously find that the accused Richard Patterson with the intent to cause the death of Nesbourne Wright did shoot and kill Nesbourne Wright.\u201d The defendant failed to seek this court\u2019s review of that articulation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant did, however, file a second motion for articulation on September 10,1992, requesting that the three judge court \u201carticulate the basis for [its] statement\u201d of December 3, 1991. The defendant\u2019s second motion again sought a response from the court to the six questions posed in his initial motion for articulation. The court unanimously denied the defendant\u2019s second motion for articulation, without explanation, on December 8, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The defendant challenges the sufficiency of the state\u2019s evidence on the element of intent, and also contends that the three judge court could not reasonably have rejected his affirmative defenses of insanity and extreme emotional disturbance. On appeal, we undertake a searching and independent review to determine whether the court could reasonably have concluded that the cumulative effect of the evidence established the defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Famiglietti, </em>219 Conn. 605, 609-10, 595 A.2d 306 (1991). If \u201cnecessary to the proper disposition of the cause\u201d; Practice Book \u00a7 4061; however, we may remand the case to the trial court for a clarification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>or explication of its decision. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>199 Conn. 399, 416-17, 508 A.2d 1 (1986); <em>State </em>v. Cobbs, 198 Conn. 638, 643, 504 A.2d 513 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lafferty, </em>189 Conn. 360, 363, 456 A.2d 272 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ostroski, </em>184 Conn. 455, 460-61, 440 A.2d 166 (1981). We conclude that a remand to the three judge court for a further articulation of its findings is appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The articulation rendered by the court on December 3,1991, recited only its conclusory finding that the defendant shot and killed the victim with the intent to do so. In the absence of a further explanation by the court setting forth the factual basis for its decision, we would review the record to ascertain the facts upon which the court\u2019s decision <em>may </em>have been based. In view of the significant and closely contested issues raised by the defendant and the crucial importance of the court\u2019s fact-finding with respect to those issues, a further articulation by the court of the facts upon which its decision <em>was </em>based will substantially assist us in resolving the defendant\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That articulation, although it need not be responsive to all of the questions set forth in the defendant\u2019s motions for articulation, should at least reflect the trial court\u2019s basic findings with regard to the defendant\u2019s two affirmative defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b471-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person or of a third person . . . except that in any prosecution under this subsection, it shall be an affirmative defense that the defendant committed the proscribed act or acts under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance for which there was a reasonable explanation or excuse, the reasonableness of which is to be determined from the viewpoint of a person in the defendant\u2019s situation under the circumstances as the defendant believed them to be, provided nothing contained in this subsection shall constitute a defense to a prosecution for, or preclude a conviction of, manslaughter in the first degree or any other crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">\u201c(b) Evidence that the defendant suffered from a mental disease, mental defect or other mental abnormality is admissible, in a prosecution under subsection (a) of this section, on the question of whether the defendant acted with intent to cause the death of another person.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b471-9\"> The defendant appeals directly to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b) (3) which provides in relevant part: \u201cThe following matters shall be taken directly to the supreme court . . .
