For the reasons set forth below, we are not persuaded that the defendant\u2019s claims are meritorious, and we therefore affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. On September 13,1986, at approximately 11:45 a.m., the Bridgeport police responded to a telephone call from Lucy Ramirez, who had reported that her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>brother, the defendant, was brandishing a gun in her house. According to Ramirez, the defendant had arrived at her home acting \u201clike a mad man.\u201d He talked about a mission he had to complete and stated that he had killed three demons. The defendant subsequently went outside to his car and returned with two guns, one tucked in his waistband and the other in his left rear pocket. Ramirez and her mother succeeded in distracting the defendant so that Ramirez could retrieve the gun from his waistband. She hid it and telephoned the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Ramirez met police officers Kevin Meizies and James Sheffield at the door to her home, and informed them that they would find the defendant in the kitchen and that he had a gun in his left rear pocket. Upon entering the kitchen, Meizies found the defendant standing with his hands in the air. He appeared to be upset and frightened. Meizies attempted to calm him and to distract him long enough to remove the gun. As Meizies was undertaking to disarm him, the defendant uttered that \u201c[t]he devil made me do it,\u201d \u201c[I] killed the devil,\u201d and \u201cI am God.\u201d Meizies asked the defendant \u201cif he was all right, what\u2019s the matter,\u201d and reached around him and removed the gun from the defendant\u2019s rear pocket. The .38 caliber weapon contained five spent cartridges.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Because the defendant continued to be upset, Meizies and Sheffield transported him, in handcuffs, to Bridgeport Hospital for observation. While en route to the hospital, the defendant continued to talk about both God and the devil and stated that \u201cMary gave me the drugs.\u201d The officers left the defendant at the hospital and returned to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Shortly after Medina had departed for the hospital, Ramirez and her husband proceeded to the defendant\u2019s apartment at 605 Hallett Street. Between 12:30 p.m. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>and 1 p.m., the couple entered a rear bedroom and there discovered the body of the victim, Mary Beth Buckley. They summoned the police and medical personnel and met the responding officer, Alan Kohlbacker, at 1:19 p.m. Kohlbacker secured the apartment and called for additional police and emergency medical personnel, who thereafter met Kohlbacker at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">In the bedroom, the police found the victim\u2019s body seated on a bar stool with the right side of her head on the bar. The closet door behind the victim contained four bullet holes. On top of the bar were white powder and drug paraphernalia.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The police also seized two empty gun holsters and several live rounds of ammunition that were in plain view on the bedroom floor, as well as a box of .45 caliber ammunition from the kitchen table.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Officers Meizies and Sheffield subsequently returned to the hospital to place the defendant under arrest for the murder of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">An autopsy of the victim\u2019s body revealed that she had died from two bullet wounds that had been inflicted approximately four to six hours prior to the discovery of her body. One bullet had passed through her arm and into her chest. The other bullet had entered directly into her chest and passed through her heart and lung into her spine, severing the spinal cord. This bullet had been fired from the handgun recovered from the defendant\u2019s pocket. A third bullet had caused only a superficial wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>After the trial court, <em>Reilly, J., </em>had found probable cause to continue the prosecution of the defendant for the crime of murder, the defendant, on October 28, 1987, was found incompetent to stand trial by the trial court, <em>Curran, J., </em>and sent to Whiting Forensic Institute. Subsequently, on February 8,1988, he was found competent to stand trial and pretrial hearings on various of the defendant\u2019s motions ensued. A jury of twelve found the defendant guilty of all charges and the trial court, <em>W. Sullivan, J., </em>rendered judgment of conviction sentencing him to a term of imprisonment of fifty-one years.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The defendant first invokes the protections of the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution of the United States, and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress the incriminatory statements that he had made to the police in the kitchen of his sister\u2019s apartment and while en route to the hospital. Specifically, the defendant claims that these statements were elicited by the police in the absence of the warnings required by <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966); <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>187 Conn. 6, 11 and n.1, 444 A.2d 213 (1982); and that the statements were involuntary due to his mental condition at the time he made them. We conclude that the statements were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>obtained by the police in derogation of the defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights, and that the defendant\u2019s mental state at the time he made those statements did not render them involuntary as a matter of law under the due process clause of the United States constitution. We also conclude that the defendant did not properly preserve his claim of involuntariness under the Connecticut constitution and that the record below is not sufficient for our review of that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The state acknowledges that the police had not informed the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights prior to the statements he made in his sister\u2019s kitchen and, shortly thereafter, on his way to Bridgeport Hospital. The state maintains, however, that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not required because at no time was the defendant subjected to police interrogation. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">\u201cAlthough the <em>Miranda </em>warnings were originally effective in state prosecutions only because they were a component of due process of law under the fourteenth amendment . . . they have also come to have independent significance under our state constitution. . . . The warnings represent the belief, deep-seated in the Anglo-American legal tradition, that a person accused of a crime may be convicted only if exacting measures have been taken to assure that the accused has been treated with the most scrupulous fairness by agents of the government.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Fer</em>rell, 191 Conn. 37, 40-41, 463 A.2d 573 (1983); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>205 Conn. 437, 447, 534 A.2d 219 (1987). It is well settled, however, that a defendant is entitled to such warnings only if the statements are the product of custodial interrogation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>218 Conn. 239, 252, 588 A.2d 1066 (1991), and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>\u201c[T]he defendant has the initial burden of showing that he was subjected to custodial interrogation\u201d; id.; before the state must prove that adequate warnings of the rights that inhere in the privilege against compelled self-incrimination were given to the defendant and that the defendant\u2019s waiver of his rights was constitutionally valid. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>225 Conn. 55, 76, 621 A.2d 728 (1993); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Weidenhof, </em>205 Conn. 262, 267, 533 A.2d 545 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>200 Conn. 523, 531-33, 512 A.2d 217, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 940, 107 S. Ct. 423, 93 L. Ed. 2d 373 (1986). Unless it was clearly erroneous, we will accept the trial court\u2019s factual finding that the defendant was not the subject of a custodial interrogation. We will also, however, carefully review the record to determine whether the trial court\u2019s finding is founded on substantial evidence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>supra, 76-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Two conditions, therefore, give rise to the requirement of advice of rights under Miranda: (1) the suspect must be in the custody of law enforcement officials; and (2) the suspect must be subjected to interrogation. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>197 Conn. 396, 411, 497 A.2d 956 (1985). To determine whether a suspect is in custody so as to be entitled to receive <em>Miranda </em>warnings, we inquire whether a reasonable person, in view of all the circumstances, would have believed that he or she was not free to leave.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Mendenhall, </em>446 U.S. 544, 554, 100 S. Ct. 1870, 64 L. Ed. 2d 497 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>supra, 76; <em>State </em>v. <em>Oquendo, </em>223 Conn. 635, 647, 613 A.2d 1300 (1992). \u201cThe term \u2018interrogation\u2019 under <em>Miranda </em>is not limited to questioning explicitly designed to elicit an incriminating response but extends to any words or actions on the part of the police that the police should know are reasonably likely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>to elicit an incriminating response from a suspect. The police, however, cannot be held accountable for the unforeseeable results of their words or actions. <em>Rhode Island </em>v. <em>Innis, </em>[446 U.S. 291, 301-302, 100 S. Ct. 1682, 64 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1980)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>[206 Conn. 40, 62, 536 A.2d 936 (1988)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>supra, 411-12; <em>State </em>v. <em>Stankowski, </em>[184 Conn. 121, 136-37, 439 A.2d 918, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 1052, 102 S. Ct. 596, 70 L. Ed. 2d 588 (1981)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>supra, 253. \"Voluntary statements of any kind are not barred by the fifth amendment. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>supra, 478.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>supra, 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">We examine first the circumstances surrounding those statements made during the brief interval between the arrival of Meizies and his removal of the gun from the defendant\u2019s rear pocket. Meizies, who had been told by Ramirez that the defendant had a gun in his pocket, testified that the defendant had been waving his hands in the air and uttering religious expressions when Meizies confronted him in the kitchen. At that point, Meizies attempted to ascertain why the defendant appeared to be upset and what further action, if any, might be appropriate. Only when Meizies had determined that the defendant in fact had a gun and that his conduct warranted arrest did Meizies secure the weapon and take him into custody. This factual history persuades us that a reasonable person would have believed that he or she was free to leave. The record, therefore, supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the defendant was not in custody prior to the seizure of his weapon and that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were not required prior to that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Moreover, even assuming that the defendant had been in police custody upon Meizies\u2019 entrance into the kitchen, we are not persuaded that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required. The defendant was standing with his arms in the air and was acting upset and frightened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>when Meizies walked into the room. In response to this conduct, the officer asked the defendant \u201cif he was all right, what\u2019s the matter, that was about it.\u201d Meizies, who was then unaware of the fatal shooting of the victim, further testified that the defendant had initiated their brief conversation and that \u201cI wasn\u2019t really questioning him, I was just trying to get a little bit of control of the situation . . . basically to try to quell the situation.\u201d Our review of the record discloses only police conduct that had both the intent and effect of calming the defendant and maintaining the safety of all at the scene. Because Meizies\u2019 conduct was neither intended nor reasonably likely to provoke an incriminatory response from the defendant; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>supra, 253-54; <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>supra, 62-63; <em>State </em>v. <em>Copeland, </em>205 Conn. 201, 207-208, 530 A.2d 603 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>203 Conn. 212, 227, 523 A.2d 1306 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Vitale, </em>supra, 408-12; the officer\u2019s prudent efforts to evaluate and ameliorate the situation, after the defendant had initiated the exchange; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Doehrer, </em>200 Conn. 642, 645-48, 513 A.2d 58 (1986); did not constitute interrogation requiring <em>Miranda </em>warnings.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The defendant argues also that the trial court should have suppressed his incriminatory statements made en route to the hospital. The state concedes both that the defendant was in custody at that time and that he was not advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. In order to prevail on his suppression claim, therefore, the defendant need show only that he was interrogated by the police officers who accompanied him to the hospital. The defendant fails, however, to meet this burden. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>interrogation need not take the form of direct questioning; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>supra, 253; the record does not disclose any police questioning of the defendant or any other police conduct that was likely to elicit an incriminating response.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">The defendant maintains that his statements to the transporting officers should have been suppressed nevertheless because those statements were the product of the earlier \u201cinterrogation\u201d in the kitchen. We already have determined, however, that the defendant was neither in custody nor the subject of police interrogation when he made the incriminatory statements in the kitchen. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motions to suppress his statements and for a new trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The defendant claims, in the alternative, that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress his incriminatory statements because they were not voluntary. He argues that his capacity for self-determination was critically impaired because of his mental state at the time that he made the statements to the police. The defendant invokes applicable provisions of both the federal and state constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>1</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">We review first the defendant\u2019s federal constitutional claim that \u201c[t]he use of an involuntary statement of a defendant in a criminal trial violates a defendant\u2019s right to due process of law. . . .Asa prerequisite to admissibility the state is required to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that under all the circumstances admissions by an accused were voluntarily made. <em>Lego </em>v. <em>Twomey, </em>404 U.S. 477, 489, 92 S. Ct. 619, 30 L. Ed. 2d 618 (1972) . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kane, </em>218 Conn. 151, 160, 588 A.2d 179 (1991). Under the federal due process clause, however, the defendant must establish that his lack of voluntariness was the result of improper police activity. \u201cThe measure of voluntariness [under the federal constitution] is whether a review of all the circumstances surrounding the elicitation of the statement reveals that the conduct of the law enforcement officials involved was such as to overbear the will of the accused to resist and bring about a statement not freely determined.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>supra, 254-55. A statement by the defendant that is the product of police coercion, therefore, may not be used by the state against that defendant. <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 163-64, 107 S. Ct. 515, 93 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Roman, </em>224 Conn. 63, 69, 616 A.2d 266 (1992), cert. denied, U.S. , 113 S. Ct. 1868, 123 L. Ed. 2d 488 (1993). On appeal we undertake \u201can independent and scrupulous examination of the entire record to ascertain whether the trial court\u2019s finding [with respect to voluntariness] is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>200 Conn. 465, 478, 512 A.2d 189 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rosado, </em>supra, 255.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>The defendant\u2019s claim of coercive interrogation by the police is unsupported by the evidence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The only question posed to the defendant by the police was Meizies\u2019 inquiry, upon his arrival at the Ramirez home, as to whether \u201c[the defendant] was all right, what\u2019s the matter.\u201d As we have already determined, the defendant was not in custody at that time and the question was neither intended nor likely to prompt an incriminatory answer; Meizies merely was seeking to identify the cause of the defendant\u2019s behavior and to calm a potentially volatile situation. Nor is there any evidence that the conduct of the officers who transported the defendant to the hospital was in any way inappropriate. Indeed, the record indicates that the police were respectful of the defendant\u2019s rights and that their conduct was in no way provocative or improper. We conclude, therefore, that the statements made by the defendant to the police were not the product of police coercion and that, therefore, the trial court\u2019s admission of those statements did not offend the defendant\u2019s federal constitutional protection against the use of involuntary statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>2</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The defendant requests that we determine the contours of his right against compelled self-incrimination in accordance with the guarantees of article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He asserts that our state constitutional protections against the admission of a defendant\u2019s involuntary statements, unlike the protections of the federal constitution as defined by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Cobrado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>supra,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> do not require a predicate showing of coercive police conduct. The defendant, noting that this court has \u201c[o]n several occasions . . . left open the possibility that our state constitution might render a defendant\u2019s involuntary statements inadmissible even if they were motivated by factors other than police coercion\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Roseboro, </em>221 Conn. 430, 443, 604 A.2d 1286 (1992); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Northrup, </em>213 Conn. 405, 419-20, 568 A.2d 439 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Madera, </em>210 Conn. 22, 47-48, 554 A.2d 263 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>206 Conn. 213, 222, 537 A.2d 460 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>supra, 243; urges us to reach this issue and to reject the requirement of coercive police conduct under our state constitution. Although it is clear that \u201cin some instances . . . the protections afforded to the citizens of this state by our constitution go beyond those provided by the federal constitution\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Marsala, </em>216 Conn. 150, 160, 579 A.2d 58 (1990); the defendant may not prevail in this court on his state constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>claim because it was not properly raised and preserved in the trial court. The defendant has not satisfied the conditions established in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), for appellate review of unpreserved constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">The defendant\u2019s written motion to suppress statements<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> identifies article first, \u00a7 8, of our state constitution as one of several bases upon which he claims that his statements should be excluded. The defendant further alleged in his motion that his statements were not made knowingly and voluntarily. The motion, unaccompanied by case citation or a memorandum, otherwise failed to explicate the nature of his state constitutional voluntariness claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">A thorough review of the record reflects that the litigation of the defendant\u2019s voluntariness claim focused exclusively on the issue of whether the police were required to advise the defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. At the conclusion of the pretrial suppression hearing, the defendant\u2019s argument,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> addressed solely to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number><em>Miranda </em>issue, claimed that his statements were not made knowingly and voluntarily because he had not been given <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Defense counsel\u2019s brief rebuttal<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> to the state\u2019s closing statement, which also focused exclusively on the applicability of <em>Miranda, </em>simply reiterated the defendant\u2019s position that he was in police custody at the time the statements were made. The trial court\u2019s ruling on the defendant\u2019s suppression motion reflects its understanding that the only issue before the court was whether <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required under the circumstances.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>At trial, defense counsel renewed his motion to suppress the statements made by the defendant while he was en route to Bridgeport Hospital.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> He again limited his argument solely to the issue of custodial interrogation, as did the court in its denial of that renewed motion.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We find no other argument or mention of the voluntariness issue in the record of the proceedings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">At no time thereafter did the defendant argue or identify any claim of involuntariness other than his claim under <em>Miranda, </em>or otherwise alert the court that he was pressing any such claim.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Nor did he request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>that the court amplify its rulings on the motion to suppress, even though those rulings clearly were limited to a consideration of the issue of custodial interrogation. The record, therefore, is devoid of any suggestion that the defendant was pursuing a state constitutional claim that his statements were involuntary due to his mental condition at the time he made them. Furthermore, because the defendant did not clearly raise such a state constitutional claim in the trial court, the state was not put on notice that it was required to defend against such a claim. Thus, neither the state nor the trial court\u2014nor this court on appeal-had the benefit of a complete factual inquiry into the nature and extent of the involuntariness of the defendant\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">A defendant \u201ccan prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant\u2019s claim will fail.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 239-40. \u201cWe have also held that we remain free to dispose of the claim by focusing on whichever condition is most relevant in the particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>circumstances.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>223 Conn. 674, 689, 613 A.2d 788 (1992). We conclude that the record of the proceedings below is not adequate for our review of the defendant\u2019s claim that the admission of his statements at trial violated his rights under our state constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The trial court never ruled on the issue of the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statements under the state constitution because, as we have determined, that issue was not raised. We do not know, therefore, whether the trial court, after conducting a full evidentiary hearing and applying the state constitutional standard now urged by the defendant, would have found the defendant\u2019s statements to have been involuntary. As we recently held in declining to review an unpreserved claim of constitutional error, \u201c[s]ince such a determination is a question of fact, even if we were to agree with the defendant [on his interpretation of the Connecticut constitution], we would have to remand the case to the trial court for that factual determination, rather than to grant the defendant a new trial. Since, under the test in <em>Golding, </em>we must determine whether the defendant can <em>prevail </em>on his claim, a remand to the trial court would be inappropriate. The first prong of <em>Golding </em>was designed to avoid remands for the purpose of supplementing the record.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>supra, 689-90.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Because, as in <em>Stanley, </em>the defendant\u2019s claim cannot be resolved without a remand for an evidentiary hearing and findings on the issue of whether his allegedly impaired mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>state rendered his statements involuntary, even in the absence of police coercion, we conclude that the record is inadequate for review of that claim. We decline, therefore, to decide his state constitutional claim.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The defendant concedes that he caused the death of the victim. He claims, however, that the trial court improperly denied his motions for a judgment of acquittal<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> because the state failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he had the intent to kill the victim and that the evidence he introduced at trial established his affirmative defense of insanity by a preponderance of the evidence. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-12 and 53a-13.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The defendant argues that the facts established by the state<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> to prove the requisite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>statutory intent to commit murder were insufficient to preclude the reasonable hypothesis of recklessness and that the evidence, therefore, supported only a conviction for a lesser included offense.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> We conclude that the state\u2019s evidence concerning the defendant\u2019s intent and mental capacity was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict, and that the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motions for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">A defendant acts \u201cintentionally\u201d in causing the death of another when he or she has the conscious objective to cause the death of the victim. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-3 (11) and 53a-54a. \u201cIntent involves \u2018a mental process which ordinarily can be proven only by circumstantial evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>225 Conn. 55, 74, 621 A.2d 728 (1993); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Salz, </em>226 Conn. 20, 32-33, 627 A.2d 862 (1993). \u201cThe law recognizes no distinction between circumstantial evidence and direct evidence so far as probative force is concerned. . . . Intent is a question of fact, the determination of which should stand unless the conclusion drawn by the trier is an unreasonable one.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Bzdyra, </em>165 Conn. 400, 403, 334 A.2d 917 (1973); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>supra. \u201cIntent may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>inferred from the nature of any weapons used, the manner in which they were used and the nature and number of wounds inflicted.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>supra; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>214 Conn. 72, 82-83, 570 A.2d 203 (1990). For example, a jury may properly infer that a defendant had an intent to kill a victim from the evidence that the defendant used a deadly weapon to kill the victim, the manner in which the weapon was used, and the nature and number of wounds inflicted. <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bzdyra, </em>supra, 404.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u201c \u2018That the jury might have drawn other possible inferences from [the evidence] is not sufficient to undermine its verdict, since proof of guilt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt, not beyond a possible doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>219 Conn. 596, 604, 594 A.2d 459 (1991), quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>197 Conn. 574, 578, 500 A.2d 539 (1985).

Four bullets pierced the closet door in front of which the victim\u2019s body was discovered. The state also presented evidence that the defendant had left the scene when the victim was dead or in extremis and that he apparently made no effort to seek medical assistance for her. In addition, the jury heard testimony of intrigue and jealousy concerning the defendant, the victim and the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>former boyfriend, Gerald Wallisa,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> as well as evidence that the defendant had physically abused the victim not long before her death.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Although it is true, of course, that the state\u2019s proof of the defendant\u2019s guilt must exclude every reasonable supposition of innocence, a mere hypothesis of innocence will not suffice. <em>State </em>v. <em>Morrill, </em>193 Conn. 602, 611, 478 A.2d 994 (1984); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Salz, </em>supra, 29. And, \u201c[although some evidence may be inconsistent with the state\u2019s theory of the case, the jury is not bound to credit only that evidence to the exclusion of evidence consistent with the state\u2019s theory. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pinnock, </em>220 Conn. 765, 775-76, 601 A.2d 521 (1992).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Salz, </em>supra, 29-30. The defendant\u2019s assertion that he is entitled to a judgment of acquittal \u201csprings from his supposition of inferences that the jury could have drawn while ignoring inferences consistent only with his guilt that the jury did reasonably draw.\u201d Id., 30. Because the circumstances surrounding the death of the victim permitted the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had intended to cause the victim\u2019s death, the trial court properly denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal because the evidence he introduced at trial established, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>as a matter of law, his affirmative defense of insanity by a preponderance of the evidence. A review of the evidence introduced at trial, however, reveals a sufficient basis for the jury\u2019s rejection of the defendant\u2019s affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The defense relied primarily on the testimony of three experts and a deputy sheriff. Jeremy August, a psychiatrist who had examined the defendant at his request, testified that: the defendant was suffering from a bipolar affective disorder, a manic depressive illness; persons suffering from this illness experience periods of relatively normal functioning that may be interrupted by episodes of depression or mania; and the defendant\u2019s belief that he was on a special mission from God to purge evil from the world is typical of those who suffer from the illness. August concluded that on September 13,1986, the defendant had been unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Melvin Roy, a clinical psychologist, administered a battery of psychological tests to the defendant after he had been incarcerated. He diagnosed the defendant as having an affective bipolar disorder in partial remission. Elizabeth Augustine, also a clinical psychologist, administered psychological tests to the defendant and reviewed information supplied by August and Roy. She diagnosed the defendant as having a bipolar disorder and concluded that he had been unable to conform his behavior to the requirements of the law or appreciate the wrongfulness of his actions on September 13,1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">David Villa served as a deputy sheriff at the Bridgeport courthouse on September 15,1986, the date of the defendant\u2019s arraignment. He testified that the defendant\u2019s behavior \u201cwas the most bizarre episode I\u2019ve ever seen in fifteen years of service,\u201d and that the defendant giggled and laughed and told Villa that he was God. Villa observed that the defendant was \u201c[sjweating pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>fusely and his eyes had a very peculiar and bizarre appearance to them.\u201d The defendant\u2019s behavior on the day of his arraignment caused a group of deputies to place the defendant in a full body manacle.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">The state\u2019s evidence in derogation of the defendant\u2019s insanity defense consisted of the cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s witnesses and the introduction of various exhibits. On cross-examination, August testified that the pattern of the illness \u201cis one of recurring episodes with relatively good interepisodic functioning\u201d and that \u201c[t]he frequency of manic . . . episodes is largely individual . . . so that one person might have a manic episode once every ten years . . . [or] once every two months . . . [or] hourly.\u201d Although he did not agree with the diagnosis, August concurred that, upon the defendant\u2019s transfer from the Bridgeport Correctional Center to Fairfield Hills State Hospital, he had been diagnosed as a malingerer.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> On the basis of documents shown to him by the prosecutor, August also acknowledged that: the defendant had told persons at Fairfield Hills State Hospital that he pretended to be crazy so that he could get out of jail; the staff there had found that the defendant did not suffer from any significant mental illness; the defendant had a substantial history of substance abuse and that he apparently would also qualify for a substance abuse diagnosis; a psychiatrist at the Whiting Forensic Institute had diagnosed the defendant as suffering from a cocaine disorder leading to psychotic symptoms; and the defendant had not been a behavioral problem at either Whiting Forensic Institute or the Bridgeport Correctional Center, where he had sustained good functioning for extended periods of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>The state elicited on its cross-examination of Elizabeth Augustine that she customarily conducts twelve hours of psychological tests on her patients but administered only three hours of such tests on the defendant. Augustine also acknowledged that she had not settled upon a diagnosis of the defendant until the day before she testified. In addition, the state demonstrated that none of the defense experts had observed the defendant until at least six months after the commission of the alleged crime. The state also impeached Melvin Roy with evidence of a felony conviction for larceny. Roy also testified that the defendant had not been psychotic at the time Roy tested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The state also elicited the testimony of a rebuttal witness, Gerald Wallisa, who had lived with the victim for two years. In late August, 1986, Wallisa and the victim moved into the defendant\u2019s apartment. Soon thereafter, the three became involved in an argument and the defendant threatened to kill Wallisa and told him to move out, which he did. A short while later Wallisa returned to visit the victim. The defendant approached them, grabbed the victim and proceeded to drag her down a driveway. The defendant persisted in this conduct notwithstanding the victim\u2019s screams and protests that the defendant was hurting her.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The state also relies on evidence introduced in its case-in-chief to support its contention that the jury reasonably could have found the defendant\u2019s conduct resulted not from a mental disease or defect but instead from his voluntary ingestion of cocaine and alcohol. Walter Young testified that he had known the defendant for six years and that he had been remodeling a bathroom on the second floor of the apartment building at 605 Hallett Street, in which the defendant had lived. Young stated that he had last seen the defendant and the victim between midnight and 2 a.m. on September 13, 1986, seated at the kitchen table of their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>third floor apartment. Both were drinking alcohol and smoking cocaine. Young also testified that the defendant and the victim had been drinking and ingesting cocaine that day and evening and that they had been \u201cpartying\u201d for four days, that the defendant, who also had provided Young with alcohol and cocaine, was ingesting cocaine whenever Young went up to his apartment, and that the defendant was rundown, perspiring and had not slept for quite some time.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">It is apparent, therefore, that the jury reviewed conflicting evidence on the issue of the defendant\u2019s mental capacity at the time he fatally shot the victim. The evaluation of such conflicting evidence on the issue of legal insanity is the province of the finder of fact. <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>182 Conn. 603, 610, 438 A.2d 1149 (1981). \u201c[W]e have repeatedly stated that our review of the conclusions of the trier of fact ... is limited. . . . This court will construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the trial court\u2019s [judgment] and will affirm the conclusion of the trier of fact if it is reasonably supported by the evidence and the logical inferences drawn therefrom. . . . The probative force of direct and circumstantial evidence is the same. . . . The credibility of expert witnesses and the weight to be given to their testimony and to that of lay witnesses on the issue of sanity is determined by the trier of fact.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Steiger, </em>218 Conn. 349, 378-79, 590 A.2d 408 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Although expert witnesses testified on behalf of the defendant and the state called none, that alone is not a sufficient basis to disturb the verdict on appeal; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>203 Conn. 212, 237-38, 523 A.2d 1306 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>supra, 608-10; for the jury \u201ccan disbelieve any or all of the evidence on insanity and can construe that evidence in a manner different from the parties\u2019 assertions.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Steiger, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>381; see also State v. <em>Jarzbek, </em>204 Conn. 683, 707, 529 A.2d 1245 (1987), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1061, 108 S.

The jury had before it the defendant\u2019s expert testimony and the state\u2019s vigorous attack on it, as well as other evidence introduced by the state on the issue of the defendant\u2019s sanity. The jury was free to reject the expert defense testimony, in full or in part, and to credit the state\u2019s evidence, including the conclusions of the state medical personnel, elicited on cross-examination of the defendant\u2019s experts,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> that the defendant was a malingerer who did not suffer from a serious mental illness. The jury may have determined, alternatively, that the defendant\u2019s behavior was due not to a mental disease or defect, but instead to his voracious consumption of alcohol and cocaine. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13 (b). As we have stated, however, \u201c[i]t is not necessary for us to determine the reasons which the trier had for concluding that the defendant had substantial capacity both to appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct and to conform his conduct to the requirements of law.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez, </em>supra, 606. We must determine only whether any reasonable trier of fact could have rejected the defendant\u2019s affirmative defense of mental disease or defect. We conclude that the evidence introduced at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>trial permitted the jury to reject the defendant\u2019s assertion that he did not appreciate the wrongfulness of his conduct and that he was unable to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law at the time he killed the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">In this opinion Peters, C.

Because we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion on other grounds, we need not address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b488-8\"> The trial court initially denied the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the statements made to the police in the kitchen and on the way to the hospital because \u201cthe defendant at that time was not a suspect.\u201d That ruling, without more, would not properly have resolved the defendant\u2019s claim, however, because the defendant, though not a murder suspect, would have been entitled to <em>Miranda </em>warnings had he been subjected to custodial interrogation. The trial court, however, more properly addressed the defendant\u2019s claim in its later ruling on the defendant\u2019s renewed motion to suppress, stating \u201c[the defendant] was not under arrest; so they don\u2019t have to give rights unless the person is under arrest or suspected of a crime for which he\u2019s going to be interrogated or arrested.\u201d Although this ruling was cast in terms of arrest, rather than custody, it is sufficiently clear that the intent of the trial court was to focus on the appropriate factors. Moreover, absent a request for articulation, we read an ambiguous trial record to support, rather than undermine, the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b489-6\"> Our review of the record indicates that the defendant\u2019s federal constitutional claim that his statements were the product of police coercion was not raised by the defendant before the trial court.

Ed. 2d 473 (1986), the court held that \u201ccoercive police activity is a necessary predicate to the finding that a confession is not \u2018voluntary\u2019 within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment,\u201d and the admissibility of a defendant\u2019s statement that is not the product of police overreaching is instead \u201ca matter to be governed by the evidentiary laws of the forum.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\"> Exclusive of the prayer for relief, the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress statements reads in full: \u201cThe defendant moves pursuant to Section 821 of the Connecticut Practice Book, the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and Article One, Sections Seven and Eight of the Connecticut Constitution, to suppress any and all statements of the defendant, written or oral, made to any agents of the State and any testimony in relation to said statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">\u201cIn support thereof, the defendant alleges:</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">\u201ca. Said statements were not made knowingly and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">\u201cb. Said statements were made without the assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">\u201cc. The procurement of said statements was in violation of the defendant\u2019s rights as enumerated in the constitutional provisions herein cited,</p>\n<p id=\"Aqa\">\u201cd. Said statements were the product of an illegal detainment.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b492-12\"> The following is the complete text of the closing remarks of defense counsel at the suppression hearing: \u201cIt\u2019s clear that Mr. Medina was in custody at the time at the Boston Avenue address. There\u2019s been testimony that he wasn\u2019t free to leave when the police officers arrived, that his responses at the scene resulted from questioning of the police officer, what happened, that there was a complaint of the breach of the peace. Breach <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>of the peace is a crime. There was an expectation of having to deal with that, there\u2019s also an expectation that the person who was searched would have a weapon on him. There were two police officers present at the time and stayed with him at all times thereafter. The individual clearly was showing unusual behavior to the point where Officer Meizies believed that there was a psychological or mental problem requiring him to be taken to a hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u201cWe would contend that the questioning initiated by Officer Meizies resulted in the statements indicated in the State\u2019s disclosure; and that these statements should be suppressed because they were not made knowingly and voluntarily, that my client was not advised of his rights pursuant to the Constitution and Miranda; that the officer should have informed my client of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, that obviously the statements were made without assistance of counsel, that the statements were in violation of the defendant\u2019s rights against self-incrimination and were the product of an illegal detainment.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">\u201cWe would ask your Honor to suppress the statements in the\u2014that allegedly were made by my client to this officer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b493-8\"> Defense counsel stated as follows: \u201cJust in response, Your Honor, I believe the Court should find that under the circumstances that the defendant would reasonably believe that he was in custody with the police officers present, eventually he was cuffed, put in the back of a police car, even after allegedly incriminating statements were made, he was never warned of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and I think that the statements should be suppressed, your Honor.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b493-9\"> The complete statement of the court in connection with its ruling on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress statements is as follows: \u201cGentlemen, there are two motions that I have to act on. One is a motion to suppress statements\u2014that motion is denied\u2014in which statements I heard were in the sister\u2019s house and in the police car and at that time, according to the testimony, and according to the facts that were presented to me, the defendant at that time was not a suspect. To my knowledge, there\u2019s no confession here nor any statement concerning the facts signed by the defendant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b494-6\"> Defense counsel stated: \u201cI would object to the use of the statement, your Honor, inasmuch as the circumstances that Mr. Medina found himself under were such that would suggest to a person that he was under arrest. That he was in an interrogatory situation. That he had been asked questions already. That he wasn\u2019t warned\u201d; and, \u201c[T]he argument that I would make is that there was an arrest for breach of the peace, that there apparently were grounds for an arrest for breach of the peace, that there was a custodial\u2014that my client was taken into custody, that he had been asked questions prior to being taken into custody, that he was never given his rights against efficient [sic] self-incrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Defense counsel did not reargue his suppression motion with respect to the statements made by the defendant in the kitchen. He did, however, object to those statements as hearsay, and the trial court overruled that objection. That ruling is not a subject in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b494-8\"> The court stated as follows: \u201c[The police] were called down [to the Ramirez home] and ... he was not under arrest; so they don\u2019t have to give rights unless the person is under arrest or suspected of a crime for which he\u2019s going to be interrogated or arrested.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b494-9\"> The defendant asserts that the reference to article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution in his motion to suppress statements, together with the police testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s bizarre behavior at the time he made the statements, reasonably should have alerted the trial court of the defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim that the statements were involuntary due to his mental condition. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-10\">Article first, \u00a7 8, is the very provision under which <em>Miranda </em>warnings have \u201ccome to have an independent significance under our state constitution.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrell, </em>191 Conn. 37, 40-41, 463 A.2d 573 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Falby, </em>187 Conn. 6, 11 and n.1, 444 A.2d 213 (1982). The simple invocation of that constitutional provision, therefore, was not sufficient to have placed the court on notice that the defendant was making a voluntariness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>claim other than his <em>Miranda </em>claim. Nor can we conclude that the testimony of the police officers concerning the defendant\u2019s unusual behavior, elicited during the hearing on the defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>claim, somehow satisfied the defendant\u2019s obligation to articulate his claims with clarity and specificity. As we have indicated, the record reflects that the defendant did not raise the state constitutional claim in the trial court and it was neither the responsibility not the province of the court to have done so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b496-6\"> As we stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 240, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), \u201c[t]he defendant bears the responsibility for providing a record that is adequate for review of his claim of constitutional error.

Today, the majority upholds the defendant\u2019s conviction for the crime of murder, even though it may have been predicated on a confession made while the defendant was mentally ill, in violation of our state constitution. Following his conviction for murder, in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a), the defendant was sentenced to a prison term of fifty-one years. The defendant\u2019s pretrial motion sought to suppress statements made when he was apprehended on the day of the victim\u2019s death and when he was being escorted to the hospital. At that time, the defendant stated: \u201cThe devil made me do it\u201d; \u201cI killed the devil\u201d; \u201cI am God.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">I agree with the majority that under the federal due process clause, the fact that the defendant\u2019s confessions or admissions were made while he was insane does not affect their admissibility. In <em>Cobrado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>479 \u25a0U.S. 157, 167, 107 S. Ct. 515, 93 L. Ed. 2d 473 (1986), the majority of the United States Supreme Court held that \u201ccoercive police activity is a necessary predicate to the finding that a confession is not \u2018voluntary\u2019 within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d even though the admissions were made by the defendant when he was mentally ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Reviewability of the State Constitutional Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The defendant also argues, however, that the statements should have been excluded under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He contends that the admission of his involuntary statements violated his state constitutional right to due process.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The majority refuses to review the defendant\u2019s claim on the grounds that it was not raised before the trial court and that there is an insufficient record to review the claim under State v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). I agree with the majority that the defendant failed to raise the state constitutional issue before the trial court. Although defense counsel raised at trial the issue of whether the statements were made \u201cknowingly and voluntarily,\u201d the issue was raised in the context of the defendant\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights. Defense counsel failed to claim that the defendant\u2019s statements were involuntary because they were made while he was mentally ill, and therefore violated his rights to due process under the federal or state constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">Despite defense counsel\u2019s failure to raise the state constitutional issue before the trial court, I believe that the record is sufficient to warrant review under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra. The record is replete with evidence of the defendant\u2019s seriously impaired mental condition in this case. It is undisputed that the defendant suffered from bipolar affective illness (manic depressive illness) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>with psychotic features. At least one expert witness testified without contradiction that the defendant had suffered from this mental illness on the day the murder had been committed. \u201cOn appeal, in order to determine whether the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights have been infringed, we review the record in its entirety and are not limited to the evidence before the trial court at the time the ruling admitting the statements was made.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Toste, </em>198 Conn. 573, 576, 504 A.2d 1036 (1986). Indeed, our examination of the record must be \u201cindependent and scrupulous\u201d when determining whether a confession is admissible. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>200 Conn. 465, 478, 512 A.2d 189 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Furthermore, the majority ignores the standard of review for determining the voluntariness of a confession. \u201cAlthough we normally give great deference to the factual findings of the trial court, the ultimate issue of whether the statement is voluntary and admissible is a legal determination. <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Fulminante, </em>499 U.S. 279, 287, 111 S. Ct. 1246, 113 L. Ed. 2d 302, reh. denied, 500 U.S. 938, 111 S. Ct. 2067, 114 L. Ed. 2d 472 (1991). Accordingly, our standard of review is not whether the fact-finding of the trial court is \u2018clearly erroneous,\u2019 but whether, upon our review of the record, the state has proven that the incriminating statements were voluntarily made.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Roman, </em>224 Conn. 63, 76-77, 616 A.2d 266 (1992), cert. denied, U.S. , 113 S. Ct. 1868, 123 L. Ed. 2d 488 (1993) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The following facts are relevant to determining whether the statements are admissible. On September 13,1986, Bridgeport police officers Kevin Meizies and James Sheffield responded to a telephone call from the defendant\u2019s sister, Lucy Ramirez, who was concerned and frightened because her brother had come to her home and was acting \u201clike a madman.\u201d The officers arrived at the Ramirez residence to find the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>defendant standing in the kitchen with his hands in the air and a gun in his back pocket. Meizies testified that the defendant was sweating, seemed nervous and upset, and that \u201csomething was wrong obviously.\u201d Both Meizies and Sheffield testified to the defendant\u2019s bizarre statements, noting that \u201c[h]e said he killed the devil . . . [n]umerous times . . . .\u201d In addition, after Meizies retrieved the defendant\u2019s gun, the defendant \u201cwent over to a female relative of his who had answered the door,\u201d and bowed in front of her, saying \u201cI killed the devil. I am Angel Medina. I am God . . . [and] statements to that effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">The officers were so concerned about the defendant\u2019s behavior that they transported him to the Bridgeport hospital emergency room. On the way to the hospital, the defendant continued with his bizarre behavior, mumbling unintelligibly, continuing to say that he was God and that he had killed the devil, and that \u201cMary gave me the drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">In addition, as the majority acknowledges, David Villa, who was on duty as deputy sheriff at the Bridgeport courthouse when the defendant was arraigned, and who had observed the defendant for six hours, testified that the defendant\u2019s behavior \u201cwas the most bizarre episode I\u2019ve ever seen in fifteen years of service.\u201d Villa testified that the defendants eyes were \u201cbugged out . . . extended out a lot further than a normal person would. They were blood shot, puffy around the lids and actually [had] the appearance that they were bulging out of his head.\u201d Villa further testified that \u201cthe defendant told me directly that he was the devil. On many occasions. He also told me that he was God.\u201d According to Villa, the defendant engaged in a cyclical pattern of behavior, which continued for approximately six hours, being \u201cquiet and almost withdrawn in tears at the back of the cell,\u201d then becoming loud, \u201cscreaming in a high voice that he was the devil,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>and \u201cthrashing around in the cell.\u201d Villa testified that the defendant \u201cwould . . . go in for a few moments of giggling and laughter in the cell, moving around very-agitated in the cell.\u201d The defendant\u2019s behavior was \u201cso intense . . . that a group of deputies, including [Villa], entered the cell and placed [the defendant] into a full body manacle which consisted of a set of leg irons and a belly chain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Prior to trial, on September 30,1987, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a psychiatric examination. After evaluating the defendant, the clinical team, comprised of social workers, psychiatrists and psychologists, determined that the defendant was <em>not competent </em>to stand trial. They specifically noted that \u201ca major concern to team members was the defendant\u2019s religious delusional system which now substantially interferes in his current competency to stand trial.\u201d The clinical team also documented that the defendant had \u201cindicated that he believes he is a gifted child, has special powers and may be one of Jesus\u2019 followers. He has little concern over what could happen with his human body and 20 years or life imprisonment does not really matter to him. He somewhat philosophized that none of us could really be around even two days from now. He believed that he had died and had come back to life at about the same time that [the victim] was found dead. He has powers and his actions that resulted in his arrest are \u2018beyond the recollection of man\u2019s knowledge.\u2019 He then went on to state that time actually went backwards for everyone in August and September of last year. He states that he knows this as it was written in one book and that most people are not aware that time had in fact gone backwards. ... He did make reference to killing the devil, being very vague as to who the devil was. This coincides with the arrest incident report that made reference to a similar statement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Following the finding of incompetency, the defendant was admitted to Fairfield Hills Hospital. On November 2, 1987, he was transferred to Whiting Forensic Institute. At Whiting, although he was diagnosed as having a delusional disorder (paranoia), he was nevertheless declared competent to stand trial. The trial court did not rule on the motion to suppress statements until March 19, 1990, at which point it denied the motion despite the 1987 report indicating that the defendant had not been competent to stand trial at that time and had suffered from religious delusional problems consistent with the statements he sought to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">At trial, the defendant offered the testimony of three experts\u2014Jeremy August, a psychiatrist, and Elizabeth Augustine and Melvin Roy, clinical psychologists. August diagnosed the defendant as having bipolar affective illness, formerly known as manic depressive illness, with psychotic features. August explained that when bipolar affective illness becomes quite severe, \u201cthinking is disrupted, delusional ideas such as being God or being Satan or being possessed by the devil become prominent; and when that happens, then you have the extra diagnosis of psychotic features.\u201d He further testified that he had observed such psychotic features in the defendant when they met in 1987, and noted that the defendant \u201cbelieved that he was in a special relationship with God and that he had a mission to kill the devil.\u201d August moreover testified that the defendant was suffering from bipolar affective illness on the date of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">After performing a battery of psychological tests on the defendant, Melvin Roy concluded that the defendant \u201chas a serious affective [bipolar] disorder in partial remission.\u201d Roy described affective bipolar disorder as \u201ca serious disturbance in mood which affects the individual\u2019s behavior drastically ... in other words, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>psychotic disorder.\u201d Roy testified that although the defendant had not been psychotic when tested, he concluded that the defendant had been suffering from affective bipolar disorder at the time of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Elizabeth Augustine testified that she had begun testing the defendant, but had been unable to complete the usual battery of tests, which takes approximately eight or nine hours, because the defendant had become agitated and was unable to concentrate or pay attention after approximately three hours. Augustine testified that during the testing, the defendant\u2019s \u201cbehavior and thinking was not within normal limits. He was stimulated by things that would not provoke bizarre thinking in normal individuals.\u201d Augustine testified that the defendant\u2019s behavior had included \u201crapid speech, agitation, bodily agitation, getting up, pacing, sitting down, getting up, pacing, sitting down, getting up, pacing. Once again, sitting down. Inability to sit still. Coming out with more bizarre statements and delusion material.\u201d She also testified that the defendant was \u201chyper-religious,\u201d and that he had stated \u201cI am spirit and flesh. I am Holy Ghost.\u201d Finally, Augustine testified that the defendant\u2019s behavior was consistent with a person undergoing a manic phase of bipolar affective illness with psychotic features.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Although the state introduced evidence that the defendant had ingested drugs before he had made the statements at the Ramirez residence, there is also overwhelming evidence of the defendant\u2019s serious mental illness. As the majority acknowledges, the defendant suffered from \u201cbipolar affective disorder, a manic depressive illness; persons suffering from this illness experience periods of relatively normal functioning that may be interrupted by episodes of depression or mania; and the defendant\u2019s belief that he was on a special mission from God to purge evil from the world is typical of those who suffer from the illness.\u201d The nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>the defendant\u2019s confession is consistent with this illness. Even if the defendant\u2019s mental state had resulted from his ingestion of drugs, however, his confession still could not be characterized as voluntary. <em>Townsend </em>v. <em>Sain, </em>372 U.S. 293, 83 S. Ct. 745, 9 L. Ed. 2d 770 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">In view of the fact that the voluntariness of the statement is a legal question, and the overwhelming evidence of the defendant\u2019s mental illness in this case, I believe that the record is adequate to review the defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim. Alternatively, I would remand this case to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing and written findings. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>227 Conn. 902, 630 A.2d 73 (1993).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This issue has eluded us even though it has been squarely raised before this court; e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Roseboro, </em>221 Conn. 430, 443-44, 604 A.2d 1286 (1992); and I would get to the merits of the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">On the basis of my analysis in <em>State </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>223 Conn. 674, 699, 613 A.2d 788 (1992) <em>(Berdon, J., </em>dissenting), which noted that prior to the adoption of the state constitution in 1818, the common law required that the prosecution prove the voluntariness of a confession beyond a reasonable doubt, I conclude that <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>supra, must be rejected under the state due process clause. In <em>Stanley, </em>I noted that \u201c[t]he right to have excluded the involuntary confession, under the state constitution, is embraced in the following constitutional clause: No person shall be compelled to give evidence against himself .... Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8 (1965). This clause is virtually identical to the one that appeared in our first formal constitution of 1818; Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 9 (1818); and that of the federal constitution. U.S. Const., amend. V. What is thereby protected from governmental invasion is, quite simply, the right of a person to remain silent unless he chooses to speak in the unfettered exercise of his own will. <em>Malloy </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>[378 U.S. 1, 8, 84 S. Ct. 1489, 12 L. Ed. 2d 653 (1964)]. Hence, a confession is involuntary and inadmissible unless it is the product of a rational intellect and a free will. <em>Blackburn </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>361 U.S. 199, 208 [80 S. Ct. 274, 4 L. Ed. 2d 242] (1960) .... <em>Lego </em>v. <em>Twomey, </em>[404 U.S. 477, 491, 92 S. Ct. 619, 30 L. Ed. 2d 618 (1972)] (Brennan, J., dissenting).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>supra, 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">\u201cThe value the framers of our state constitution placed on the right to remain silent is evident and important in determining the contours of the state constitutional protection. <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>[222 Conn. 672, 685, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992)]. Zephaniah Swift, a lead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>ing jurist ... of 1818, wrote in his treatise on the law that \u2018the confession must be perfectly voluntary: for if the <em>least degree of influence </em>appear to be exercised over the prisoner\u2019s mind, to induce him to disclose his guilt, the whole will be rejected.\u2019 (Emphasis added.) 2 Z. Swift, A Digest of the Laws of the State of Connecticut (1823) p. 408. Justice Swift also pointed out in his treatise on evidence that voluntary confessions \u2018are deemed to be the most conclusive evidence . . . .\u2019 Z. Swift, A Digest on the Law of Evidence (1810) p. 133. He also noted, however, that \u2018[tjhere is, perhaps, no part of evidence in which there is so much misrepresentation and fabrication, as in testifying to the confession of a party.\u2019 Id., p. 149.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>supra, 698-99.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">\u201cCommon law precedent also leads me to the conclusion that our state constitution requires a higher standard of proof of voluntariness of a confession. E. Peters, \u2018Common Law Antecedents of Constitutional Law in Connecticut,\u2019 53 Alb. L. Rev. 259, 263 (1989). Blackstone, in formally shaping the contours of our common law, wrote: \u2018[Ijndeed, even in cases of felony at the common law, [confessions] are the weakest and most suspicious of all testimony; ever liable to be obtained by artifice, false hopes, promises of favor, or menaces; seldom remembered accurately, or reported with due precision; and incapable in their nature of being disproved by other negative evidence.\u2019 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England (1807) p. 357.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>supra, 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">This analysis, which requires that the state prove the voluntariness of a confession beyond a reasonable doubt, has equal application when the confession was made by a person who is mentally ill. I believe that, under our state constitution, we should adopt the reasoning of Justice Brennan in his dissent in <em>Connelly, </em>as follows: \u201cThe absence of police wrongdoing should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>not, by itself, determine the voluntariness of a confession by a mentally ill person. The requirement that a confession be voluntary reflects a recognition of the importance of free will and of reliability in determining the admissibility of a confession, and thus demands an inquiry into the totality of the circumstances surrounding the confession.\u201d <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Connelly, </em>supra, 176. Justice Brennan explained the requirements of reliability as follows: \u201cMinimum standards of due process should require that the trial court find substantial indicia of reliability, on the basis of evidence extrinsic to the confession itself, before admitting the confession of a mentally ill person into evidence. . . . To hold otherwise allows the State to imprison and possibly to execute a mentally ill defendant based solely upon an inherently unreliable confession.\u201d Id., 183.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">In sum, in order to establish that a confession by a mentally ill person was voluntary and is therefore admissible, our state constitution mandates that the state prove: (1) that the statements were made by the defendant of his own free will; and (2) that there was substantial indicia of reliability on the basis of evidence extrinsic to the confession.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In view of the substantial evidence of the defendant\u2019s mental illness in this case, I would hold that the statement was not voluntary and would remand for a new trial. In the alternative, I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>would remand this matter to the trial court for the purposes of hearing evidence and to make the necessary findings as to voluntariness. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>199 Conn. 399, 416-17, 508 A.2d 1 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Speaking for eight of the nine justices of the United States Supreme Court, Chief Justice Warren stated the following: \u201cSurely in the present stage of our civilization a most basic sense of justice is affronted by the spectacle of incarcerating a human being upon the basis of a statement he made while insane; and this judgment can without difficulty be articulated in terms of the unreliability of the confession, the lack of rational choice of the accused, or simply a strong conviction that our system of law enforcement should not operate so as to take advantage of a person in this fashion.\u201d <em>Blackburn </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>361 U.S. 199, 207, 80 S. Ct. 274, 4 L. Ed. 2d 242 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-8\"> Article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall be compelled to give evidence against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b507-9\"> It is not clear whether the defendant also claims that the admission of the statements violated his state constitutional right not to \u201cbe compelled to give evidence against himself . . . .\u201d Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b513-6\"> Even if the record were not adequate, I would still review the claim under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), because the defendant asserts the violation of a fundamental constitutional right and the record can be augmented simply by a hearing before the trial judge. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>227 Conn. 902, 903, 630 A.2d 73 (1993), this court <em>on its own, </em>without a request from either party, remanded the case \u201cto the trial court for an evidentiary hearing and written findings . . . .\u201d Likewise, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Pollitt, </em>199 Conn. 399, 416, 508 A.2d 1 (1986), this court remanded the case to the trial court for a hearing to determine whether <em>Brady </em>materials were withheld from the defendant. <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963). Moreover, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>227 Conn. 448, 629 A.2d 1133 (1993), we remanded the case to the three judge court for an articulation of the facts upon which the court based its verdict. Indeed, a remand is particularly appropriate and fair in this case in view of the trial court\u2019s decision on the motion to suppress, which indicated the court did not even reach the <em>Miranda </em>issues that were clearly raised. <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966); see <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Powers, </em>183 Conn. 124, 125, 438 A.2d 845 (1981). At the conclusion of the evidentiary hearing on the motion to supress, the trial court stated: \u201cTo my knowledge, there\u2019s no confession here nor any statement concerning the facts signed by the defendant.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b516-6\"> We have not done well during the past year regarding mental illness issues in relationship to the criminal law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Stanley, </em>223 Conn. 674, 613 A.2d 788 (1992) (refusal to review under state constitution whether state is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s confession was voluntary); <em>State </em>v. <em>Raguseo, </em>225 Conn. 114, 622 A.2d 519 (1993) (defense of extreme emotional disturbance is determined from the viewpoint of a \u201creasonable\u201d person in the defendant\u2019s situation); <em>State </em>v. <em>Joyner, </em>225 Conn. 450, 625 A.2d 791 (1993) (upholding a statute imposing on the defendant in a criminal prosecution the burden of establishing the defense of mental disease or defect).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Today, we add to the list our refusal to reach the issue of whether under our state constitution we will admit incriminating statements made while the defendant was mentally ill.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
