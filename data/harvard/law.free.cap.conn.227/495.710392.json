This and other questions<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> come to this court upon our grant of certification from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit pursuant to General Statutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>\u00a7 51-199a and Practice Book \u00a7 4168.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Westchester </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>Docket No. 92-7698 (L) (2d Cir. January 6, 1993). We conclude that, in the circumstances of this case, the plaintiff has not acquired an avigation easement by prescription.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The record certified by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals provides the following facts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The plaintiff is a New York municipal corporation that owns and operates the Westchester County Airport (airport). The airport is located in New York adjacent to the border between New York and Connecticut. The airport currently utilizes two runways. Runway 11/29 (runway) is an alternative runway that is normally used only if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>prevailing crosswinds make use of the main runway too dangerous for all but the largest aircraft or during an emergency. The runway abuts New York\u2019s border with Connecticut and its air approach zone is located almost entirely above Connecticut. The defendants<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> are Connecticut residents who own the land below the approach zone. Trees on their land have, over time, grown into that airspace.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Buffers of airspace known as clear zones surround the actual flight paths used by aircraft during take-offs and landings. The Federal Aviation Administration requires that these clear zones be kept free of obstructions so that aircraft may navigate safely during takeoffs and landings. In 1989, due to penetration into the clear zone by certain of the defendants\u2019 growing trees, the Federal Aviation Administration, in effect, reduced the usable length of the runway by approximately 1350 feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">As a consequence, in February, 1990, the plaintiff initiated an action for injunctive and declaratory relief in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York claiming, inter alia, that the defendants\u2019 trees interfered with the use of the runway. <em>Westchester </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>745 F. Sup. 951, 953 (S.D.N.Y. 1990).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiff claimed in the District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Court that \u201cthe use of the airspace for approximately forty years has given [it] a prescriptive easement in this flight zone\u201d; id., 954; and sought an injunction authorizing it to top or cut down, as necessary, trees that had penetrated into that zone and had thereby interfered with the plaintiffs claimed easement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Both the plaintiff and the defendants subsequently filed motions for summary judgment. <em>Westchester </em>v. <em>Greenwich, </em>793 F. Sup. 1195 (S.D.N.Y. 1992). The District Court, acknowledging that the courts of this state had never determined whether avigation and clearance easements<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> may be acquired by prescription, concluded nevertheless that the plaintiff had acquired such easements; id., 1205, 1207; and granted the plaintiff \u201ca limited injunction to cut back, at its own expense, the trees occupying runway 11/29\u2019s clear zones. . . .\u201dId., 1222. The court further held that \u201c[t]o the extent, certain trees cannot be simply trimmed back without destroying them, the County shall be permitted to remove them completely but must compensate defendants for their loss.\u201d Id. The defendants appealed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. The Court of Appeals subsequently certified the present questions to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Prescriptive easements are recognized in this state. General Statutes \u00a7 47-37;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Klar Crest Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rajon Realty Corporation, </em>190 Conn. 163, 459 A.2d 1021 (1983). \u201cTo establish an easement by prescription it is absolutely essential that the use be adverse. It must be such as to give a right of action in favor of the party against whom it has been exercised.\u201d <em>Whiting </em>v. <em>Gaylord, </em>66 Conn. 337, 344, 34 A. 85 (1895). In order to prove such adverse use, the party claiming to have acquired an easement by prescription must demonstrate that the use of the property has been \u201copen, visible, continuous and uninterrupted for fifteen years and made under a claim of right.\u201d <em>Andrzejczyk </em>v. <em>Advo System, Inc., </em>146 Conn. 428, 431, 151 A.2d 881 (1959); <em>Klar Crest Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rajon Realty Corporation, </em>supra, 168; <em>Putnam, Coffin &amp; Burr, Inc. </em>v. <em>Halpern, </em>154 Conn. 507, 515, 227 A.2d 83 (1967). There can be no claim of right unless the use is \u201cunaccompanied by any recognition of [the right of the servient tenement] to stop such use. A use by express or implied permission or license cannot ripen into an easement by prescription.\u201d <em>Sachs </em>v. <em>Toquet, </em>121 Conn. 60, 66, 183 A. 22 (1936); <em>Klar Crest Realty, Inc. </em>v. <em>Rajon Realty Corporation, </em>supra. Connecticut law refrains from extinguishing or impairing property rights by prescription unless the party claiming to have acquired an easement by prescription has met each of these stringent conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Although these principles are firmly rooted in our statutory and common law, the issue of whether an avigation easement may be acquired by prescription is one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>of first impression in this state. At least two other courts have held that an avigation easement may not be acquired by prescription. See <em>Hinman </em>v. <em>Pacific Air Transport, </em>84 F.2d 755 (9th Cir. 1936), cert. denied, 300 U.S. 654, 57 S. Ct. 431, 81 L. Ed. 865 (1937); <em>Sticklen </em>v. <em>Kittle, </em>168 W. Va. 147, 287 S.E.2d 148 (1981). Although we are not aware of any case in which a prescriptive avigation easement has been upheld, several jurisdictions have suggested that such an easement may be acquired under appropriate circumstances. See, e.g., <em>Drennen </em>v. <em>Ventura, </em>38 Cal. App. 3d 84, 112 Cal. Rptr. 907 (1974); <em>Shipp </em>v. <em>Louisville &amp; Jefferson County Air Board, </em>431 S.W.2d 867 (Ky. 1968), cert. denied, 393 U.S. 1088, 89 S. Ct. 880, 21 L. Ed. 2d 782 (1969); <em>Petersen </em>v. <em>Seattle, </em>94 Wash. 2d 479, 618 P.2d 67 (1980). Because we conclude that the plaintiff did not acquire a prescriptive avigation easement in the circumstances presented, we need not decide whether an avigation easement may ever be acquired by prescription in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">As we have stated, an easement may not be acquired by prescription unless the use of the property is \u201csuch as to give a right of action in favor of the party against whom [the adverse use] has been exercised.\u201d <em>Whiting </em>v. <em>Gaylord, </em>supra, 344. For the plaintiff to have acquired a prescriptive avigation easement, therefore, the defendants must have had a right of action against the plaintiff during a fifteen year period when the plaintiffs use of the airspace over the defendants\u2019 properties was \u201copen, visible, continuous and uninterrupted.\u201d The defendants, however, had no right of action against the plaintiff to stop the overflights because federal law prohibits landowners from obtaining injunctive relief against aircraft using the navigable airspace of the United States.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>United States </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>367 F. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Sup. 1338, 1341 (D. Conn. 1973), aff'd, 496 F.2d 452 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 958, 95 S. Ct. 218, 42 L. Ed. 2d 174 (1974); <em>East Haven </em>v. <em>Eastern Airlines, Inc., </em>331 F. Sup. 16, 32-33 (D. Conn. 1971), aff'd, 470 F.2d 148 (2d Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 411 U.S. 965, 93 S. Ct. 2144, 36 L. Ed. 2d 685 (1973). In these circumstances, the defendants could not have reclaimed the exclusive use of the airspace above their properties and, therefore, the use of that airspace by the plaintiff can not be considered adverse.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">The plaintiff argued, and the District Court agreed, that the right of the defendants to seek compensation from the plaintiff for aircraft flights \u201cso low and so frequent as to be a direct and immediate interference with the enjoyment and use of the land\u201d;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Causby, </em>328 U.S. 256, 266, 66 S. Ct. 1062, 90 L. Ed. 1206 (1946); <em>Griggs </em>v. <em>Allegheny, </em>369 U.S. 84, 88-89, 82 S. Ct. 531, 7 L. Ed. 2d 585 (1962); constituted a right of action<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> sufficient to satisfy the requirements of our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>law of prescription. We disagree. The certified record does not include any facts to suggest, and the District Court did not find, that the overflights had, in any manner, harmed the defendants\u2019 trees or otherwise interfered with the use and enjoyment of the defendants\u2019 properties. Nor did the defendants so claim. The defendants cannot have been required to have sought compensatory relief in order to have forestalled the plaintiff\u2019s acquisition of a prescriptive avigation easement when the overflights had never interfered with the defendants\u2019 use and enjoyment of their properties. Although we doubt that we would ever require a landowner to assert a constitutional takings claim in order to avoid the acquisition, of a prescriptive avigation easement, we are satisfied that these defendants were not obliged to do so.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">The first certified question is answered: No, not in these circumstances; because the plaintiff has failed to show that its use was adverse as required by Connecticut law.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">No costs will be taxed to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-10\"> \u201cAn avigation easement is an easement of right to navigation in airspace over designated land.\u201d <em>Sticklen </em>v. <em>Kittle, </em>168 W. Va. 147, 155, 287 S.E.2d 148 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b519-11\"> The Second Circuit Court of Appeals certified the following questions to this court:</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\">\u201c1.
