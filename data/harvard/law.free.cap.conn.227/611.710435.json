The defendant, Joseph Johnson, was convicted by a jury of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3) and larceny in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-122 (a) (3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Appellate Court affirmed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>the judgment of conviction. <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>29 Conn. App. 394, 615 A.2d 512 (1992). We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification to appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>224 Conn. 920, 618 A.2d 529 (1992). We now dismiss the appeal on the ground that certification was improvidently granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The facts of this case are set forth in the decision of the Appellate Court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 29 Conn. App. 395-98. In the Appellate Court the defendant claimed that the trial court had improperly relied on Practice Book \u00a7 769<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to exclude expert testimony offered to challenge the accuracy of a police officer\u2019s eyewitness identification. He argued that the ruling had deprived him of his state and federal constitutional rights to confront the witnesses against him.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Appellate Court agreed with the defendant that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>admission of the expert testimony proffered would not have violated \u00a7 769 and should have been admitted. Id., 399. It determined, however, that the trial court\u2019s ruling did not violate the United States constitution. Id., 401. It did not address the state constitutional issue because the defendant had not provided an independent analysis of his state claim. Id., 400 n.3. Because the trial court\u2019s ruling was merely evidentiary and not constitutional, the Appellate Court conducted an analysis that placed the burden on the defendant to demonstrate harmfulness. Id., 401. Pursuant thereto, the Appellate Court concluded that the defendant had failed to demonstrate that it was likely that the result of the trial would have been different in the absence of the improper ruling and, accordingly, affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Id., 401-402.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">The first of the two certified questions is: \u201cWas the Appellate Court correct in finding that the improper exclusion of impeachment evidence did not constitute a constitutional violation [of] the defendant\u2019s right to confront and cross-examine witnesses under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 920. The Appellate Court refused to address the merits of this claim because, as noted above, the defendant had not provided an independent state constitutional analysis. In his brief and during oral argument before this court, the defendant, although ostensibly relying on our cases that address state and federal confrontation clause issues, has again failed to provide a separate state constitutional analysis applicable to the facts of this case. As we stated in <em>State </em>v. <em>D'Ambrosio, </em>212 Conn. 50, 57 n.5, 561 A.2d 422 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1063, 110 S. Ct. 880, 107 L. Ed. 2d 963 (1990), \u201c[i]t is of no moment in this case whether a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to [confront witnesses against him] stems from the sixth amendment\u2019s confrontation clause . . . or from either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>the confrontation or due process clause of our state constitution. ... We postpone deciding this question until we have a case in which it would make a difference or until the United States Supreme Court offers us further guidance.\u201d See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Pinnock, </em>220 Conn. 765, 776 n.3, 601 A.2d 521 (1992). The defendant has provided us with no reason, even if we were to consider his claim pursuant to the state constitution, why the result would be any different than if the analysis were conducted pursuant to the federal constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">After examining the record on appeal and after considering the briefs and the arguments of the parties, we have concluded that the defendant\u2019s appeal of this issue should be dismissed on the ground that certification was improvidently granted. Our certification was predicated upon the assumption that the defendant would present a state constitutional argument that would distinguish our state constitutional guarantees from those provided by the federal constitution. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pinnock, </em>supra. In the absence of such an analysis, this appeal does not afford us the opportunity to undertake a full consideration of the question that we certified. See <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Flanagan, </em>220 Conn. 453, 454-55, 599 A.2d 380 (1991). Furthermore, it would serve no useful purpose for us to repeat the Appellate Court\u2019s careful and well reasoned consideration of the federal constitutional issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">The second certified question is: \u201cWas the Appellate Court correct in finding harmless error where the trial court had improperly excluded, as a discovery sanction, expert testimony offered to impeach the credibility of an eyewitness identification made by a police officer?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 920. This argument was fully considered in the decision of the Appellate Court. <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 29 Conn. App. 401-402. The Appellate Court concluded that although the ruling was improper, it was harmless, particularly in light <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>of a second, unchallenged identification of the defendant by the same police officer. Id., 401. Having examined the record on appeal and studied the briefs and the arguments of the parties, we conclude that the appeal on this question should be dismissed because certification was improvidently granted. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Milton, </em>224 Conn. 163, 168, 617 A.2d 460 (1992). It would serve no useful purpose to repeat the discussion contained in the Appellate Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b634-8\"> General Statutes S 53a-55 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of manslaughter in the first degree when ...
