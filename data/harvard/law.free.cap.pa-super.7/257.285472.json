Both the parties claimed title through Henry Heartzog, the plaintiff by will and the defendant under an alleged parol contract, the tenor of which being an alleged agreement by Henry Heartzog in his lifetime that Louisa Borgel should have the property for life. Offers were made to prove this ^agreement by oral testimony, which were rejected by the court below, who instructed the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff. Defendants appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b289-10\"><em>Errors assigned </em>among others were to the rejection of defendants\u2019 offers of evidence tending to show a parol agreement with the defendant Louisa Borgel by Henry Heartzog in his lifetime granting her a life estate in the property in question, to be followed by evidence of the possession of the property by the defendant, continuing to the prese\u00f1t time with the knowledge of the plaintiff in this case and with the knowledge of the testator in his lifetime.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b289-11\"><em>Perry J.

Rothermel, 112 Pa. 272; Whiting v. Opera House Co., 88 Pa. 100.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b290-10\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"ArC\">Porter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b290-11\">Both of the parties to this ejectment claim a life estate in the property through Henry Heartzog, deceased, \u2014 the plaintiff under the latter\u2019s will and the defendant under an alleged parol contract. The learned court below excluded several offers of proof submitted on behalf of the defendant, and finally directed a verdict for the plaintiff. The defendant has not been injured by the rejection of the offers of proof, for had the testimony been admitted, it would not in our opinion have sustained a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>verdict for the defendant. We need therefore not pass upon its competency. The defendant\u2019s title was based on an alleged parol gift or lease of the land, for life. Under the statute of frauds, a parol gift, if proven, has only the force of a tenancy at will, unless in addition to the parol gift, there is shown a continued possession, and the making of valuable improvements, such as cannot be adequately compensated for in damages. This proposition is sustained by many authorities. The defendant here offered to show neither the prolonged -possession, nor the making of improvements contemplated by the rule of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">If the agreement sought to be set up by the defendant be regarded in the light of a parol lease for life, her position is not strengthened. A parol lease for more than three years is, under the statute of frauds, but a tenancy at will, and even a ratification of it must be signified by writing: Dumn v. Rothermel, 112 Pa. 272. It was held in Whiting v. Pittsburg Opera House Co., 88 Pa. 100, that the facts that the tenant was in possession and that he made certain improvements in consideration of said lease do not create a sufficient equity to take the case out of the operation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The case of Smith v. Tuit, 127 Pa. 341, cited by the appellants, is not in point, inasmuch as that case was \u201c not affected by the statute of frauds, because the terms of the agreement are put in writing.\u201d The same distinction applies to Tuit v. Smith, 137 Pa. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">We are of opinion that no error'was committed by the court below in entering the judgment for the plaintiff, and the judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
