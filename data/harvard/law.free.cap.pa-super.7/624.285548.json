(2) In the conclusions of law by the court below as follows: \u201c 1. As there is no society known as the \u2018 Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church\u2019 there is latent ambiguity in the bequest of the testatrix to such society, and the legacy must, therefore, lapse. 2. The exceptions to the auditor\u2019s report must be dismissed and the same confirmed absolutely.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b656-13\"><em>Alfred S.

(1) Words were used in some part of the will which taken in connection with explanatory evidence show the party for whom the legacy was intended, as in the appeal of Washington and Lee University, 111 Pa. 572. (2) There being a latent ambiguity, the party was fixed definitely by parol testimony. (3) The object being uncertain, a discretionary power was vested in some one over the application of the grantor\u2019s bounty, as in The Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society\u2019s Appeal, 30 Pa. 425; McLain v. Township, 51 Pa. 196; Zeisweiss v. James, 63 Pa. 465; Kinike\u2019s Estate, 155 Pa. 101; Witman v. Lex, 17 S. &amp; R. 88.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b657-9\">There is nothing in the will or in the evidence that shows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>that either one of the societies named in the evidence or any other society was intended by the testator.'</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AVNK\">July 29, 1898:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AKu\">Beaver, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">The testatrix, a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Beaver Falls, Pa., bequeathed $1,000 to the \u201c Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church.\u201d It appears, from the evidence, that there is no society in this church bearing this precise name. The assignment of error relates to the conclusion of law reached by the court below which is as follows: \u201cAs there is no society known as the Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, there is latent ambiguity in the bequest of testatrix to such society and the legacy must, therefore, lapse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The intention of the testatrix is not to be frustrated simply because of a latent ambiguity. The legacy would not necessarily lapse because of such ambiguity, if it can be explained and the intention of the testatrix made clear by extrinsic evidence. This much is clear from the terms of the will \u2014 that the testatrix desired $1,000 of her estate to be expended in the cause of foreign missions administered by the Methodist Episcopal Church. It appears from the evidence that there is a corporation known as \u201c The Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church \u201d which has charge of the general missionary work of the church, both at home and abroad. It does not appear that there were two claimants for this legacy as such. It appears in the evidence, however, that there is the missionary society of the Methodist Episcopal Church and subordinate to it and under the supervision of its authority the woman\u2019s foreign missionary society of the Methodist Episcipal Church, whose distinctive work is among the women of foreign countries. It would seem from the evidence that the work of foreign missions and of home missions, although carried on under the direction of the same society, are distinct and the expenditures kept entirely separate. The evidence shows that the missionary society expends in its foreign work about $550,000 per year, exclusive of what is expended for woman\u2019s work by the women\u2019s society, which is about $250,000 per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">Reading the will in the light of this testimony, it seems to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>us very clear that the testatrix not only intended that the bequest of $1,000 was to the missionary society of the Methodist Episcopal Church but that her intention, clearly expressed in the will, can be fully carried out by paying the legacy to this society, inasmuch as it would take whatever may be received from the estate, subject to the trust impressed upon it by the testatrix, namely, its expenditure in the work of foreign missions. This is in accordance with the well-known principle strikingly exemplified in Appeal of Washington &amp; Lee University, 111 Pa. 572: kk Where there are two parties claiming a legacy, neither of whom bear the name of the legatee in the will and it is uncertain which is the one intended by the testator, if either, it must be determined by a consideration of all the language used and by proof of all the facts and surrounding circumstances.\u201d The authorities upon this subject are very fully set forth in the report of this case. It is unnecessary to multiply them here, but see the Domestic &amp; Foreign Missionary Society\u2019s Appeal, 30 Pa. 425, in which it was held that a legacy to the missions and schools of the Episcopal Church about to be established at or near Port Cresson upon the western coast of Africa is a good charitable bequest to the Domestic &amp; Foreign Missionary Society of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States of America.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The assignments of error are sustained, the decree of the court below is reversed and the record is remitted, with instructions to make distribution of the estate of the testatrix as if the bequest to the Foreign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church had been made to the Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">As it does not clearly appear who the appellee in this case is, the costs will be paid out of the estate.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
