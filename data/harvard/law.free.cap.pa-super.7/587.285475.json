The said Alexander Martin now deceased was further to pay the said plaintiff the sum of five dollars per month for boarding and raising said child until it arrived at the age of sixteen years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">On the trial the defendant did not 'offer any evidence and the court was requested to say to the jury \u201c that under all the testimony the plaintiff is not entitled to recover; \u201d which was refused, and the facts were submitted to the jury in a fair and well-guarded charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">The plaintiff proved the declarations of Martin in regard to the support of the child, which were made to disinterested persons, and that money was paid by him under the verbal contract as claimed by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Under the authority of Harrington v. Hickman, 148 Pa. 401, the action of the court was clearly right.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">In that case as in this \u201c The question then comes down to this : Is the clear distinct statement of the party to be charged any evidence of the fact stated? In an action against him, it would not admit of doubt that such a declaration would be competent, and if believed, sufficient evidence upon which to sustain a recovery. Why is it not competent in an action against his executors ? The competency of the declaration of the party to be charged does not depend upon whether he is living or dead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">The books of account of plaintiff\u2019s decedent were not produced, but they were not essential to sustain the claim which was founded upon an oral contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">The jury was the proper tribunal to pass upon the questions at issue and the evidence adduced was sufficient to warrant the verdict: Lautner v. Kann, 184 Pa. 334; Harrington v. Hickman, 148 Pa. 401. The character of the claim, the necessities of the plaintiff, the delay in bringing suit, all contributed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>increase the burden of the plaintiff in establishing his claim, but each and all were overcome by proof which satisfied the jury that the defendant\u2019s estate should pay for the support of his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">The case was fairly tried and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
