T. 1898. Rule to show cause why the appeals taken by The Masonic Home of Pennsylvania to the Superior Court from the order of C.P. No. 2, Phila.

The suggestion set forth that the Relator, William H. Henderson, had been duly elected and constituted as the representative of the Palestine Chapter, which Chapter was a contributor to the support of the Masonic Home and, therefore, duly entitled to representation in such corporation ; that Henderson being nominated to a vacancy on the Board of Managers was illegally declared to be unqualified for election and that one John O\u2019Donnell, was declared elected.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-7\">An answer was filed by John O\u2019Donnell admitting that the Chapter was entitled to a representative in good standing, but alleging that Henderson, the relator, was not in good standing and therefore ineligible as a candidate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-8\">A demurrer was filed to the answer averring, inter alia, no legal title in respondent and no sufficient cause set up why relator should not exercise office.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-9\">A petition was subsequently filed for an alternative mandamus, and an amended return of the corporation was filed. A demurrer was filed to the amended return which was disposed of by the court below in an opinion by Peek YP acker, P. J., reported in 6 Dist. Rep. 732, in accordance with which a judgment of ouster was entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-10\">A motion to show cause why judgment should not be opened and the petitioner, The Masonic Home of Pennsylvania, be allowed to intervene as party defendant was refused, in an opinion by Penkypacker, P. J., in 7 Dist. Rep. 103.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b82-11\">Appeals were taken to the Superior Court and a motion made for a rule to show cause why such appeal should not operate as a supersedeas.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AXr\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>March 9, 1898:</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b83-3\"><em>Robert H.

Hampton Todd, </em>for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AB6\">Jurisdiction in appeals in actions in quo warranto and mandamus is in the Supreme Court. '</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-5\">In all appeals where no money value is involved, but a mere right is in dispute, as the title to an office or the right to a divorce, the Supreme Court has jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-6\">The record of this case is in the Supreme Court, and jurisdiction follows the record: Keyser v. Farr, 105 U. S. 265.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b83-7\">A supersedeas should be granted by the court having at the time the custody of the record: 24 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 596; Payne v. Thompson, 48 Ala. 535.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b83-8\">Per Curiam,</author>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">The appeal from the original judgment in the quo warranto proceedings is now pending in the Supreme Court, and it is very clear that the court having jurisdiction to review those proceedings has jurisdiction to review the supplemental proceedings from which appeals have been taken to this court. The appeals do not involve the possession or ownership of real or personal property or any right, the value of which can be measured in money. So far as the questions of appellate jurisdiction are concerned, they are governed by the same principle as the case of Rosenberry v. Rosenberry, 180 Pa. 221, where the question was raised by counsel and jurisdiction of the appeal was entertained by the Supreme Court. .</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">Now, March 9, 1898, the above mentioned appeal is certified at the cost of the appellant to the Supreme Court for hearing and decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
