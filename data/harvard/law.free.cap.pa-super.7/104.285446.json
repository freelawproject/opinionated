Mancel Tweed, the driver, testified that on the day in question, he was driving up Diamond street on the north side of the street. As he neared the crossing he brought his horses to a stop and listened for the cars. He stopped his horses just as their heads reached the east foot crossing, which was about fifteen feet from the east track, and not hearing any warning he proceeded to cross the street. He testified that at the place where he stopped he could not see up Second street because of a factory at the northeast corner of Second and Diamond streets, and that you could not see up Second street until your horses\u2019 heads were .practically upon the track. That his custom was to stop at a foot crossing so as not to interfere with public travel, and that to stop at any other point at this crossing would be to leave his horses and carriage upon the foot crossing used by the public; that he had driven over this street before and that the defendant had been in the habit of stopping its cars on the north side of Diamond street before crossing Diamond street. That he was driving cautiously, and that he could not have driven nearer the track without blocking up the footways, and in no event could he have seen up Second street until his horses were upon the defendant\u2019s track.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b137-6\">Garret McMaster, the manager of the appellant company, was called, who testified that he took a similar pair of horses and carriage to Second and Diamond streets to ascertain the truth of this driver\u2019s statement and drove up on the north side of Diamond street to Second until he could see some thirty or forty feet up the street, stopped the horses, got out and measured the distance between his horses\u2019 heads and the east track and found that they were within three feet of the east track; that to enable the driver to see all the way up the street the horses would have to be upon the track. That the distance from the heads of the horses to the place where the driver sits was fifteen feet six inches ; that the building at the northeast corner obstructed the view of the driver so that the horses had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>to be driven within a few feet of the track before he could see an approaching car.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AcI\">March 21, 1898 :</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-5\">A number of citizens were called who testified that they saw the accident, saw the \"car coming at an unusual rate of speed, and that it did not slow up on reaching Diamond street until it struck the carriage; that no bell or other warning was given by the defendant, and that the horses and carriage were taken some twenty-five or thirty feet before the car was stopped, and then stopped only by the bodies of the horses being under the wheels.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-6\">The learned trial judge entered a nonsuit on the ground that the driver of the plaintiffs was guilty of contributory negligence, which the court refused to take off, on motion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-7\">Plaintiff appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-8\"><em>Error assigned </em>was refusal to take off nonsuit.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b138-9\"><em>W.

A number of persons were in the vehicle, and the driver and a companion occupied the elevated seat in front. So far as the evidence goes, the coup\u00e9 was of the kind in common use, and the horses easily controlled and accustomed to the electric cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-3\">When the carriage approached the intersection of Diamond and Second streets, the driver, who, according to his own statement, had been familiar with the locality for five years, says that he stopped, looked, and listened in order to ascertain if a car were approaching, and neither seeing nor hearing anything to warn him, drove on until his horses were on the railway track. He then, for the first time, saw a rapidly approaching car only about fifteen feet distant. It was too late to avoid the accident, which took place the next instant. The evidence of the defendant\u2019s negligence was sufficient to carry the case to the jury, but it is contended that the plaintiff, on the showing of its own witnesses, was guilty of such contributory negligence as to preclude a recovery. This is\" the only question for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">The inquiry naturally suggests itself, how the driver could have failed to see the coming car had he looked and listened at the right place. The car approached from the north on Second street, and the vehicle was on the north side of Diamond street. A brick building stands at the northeast corner of the two -ways and extends at least out to the street line. Instead of driving out on Second street far enough to obtain a view north, the driver stopped his horses back on Diamond street, east of the footway crossing the latter. So far as seeing was concerned he might as well have stopped many feet farther back. His vision could not pierce the brick building. From the east line of Second street to the nearest rail of the street car track it was twenty-six feet; that is, twelve feet of sidewalk and fourteen feet of gutter and driveway. At first thought it would seem that had he, as he drove out on Second street, merely glanced to the north, he could not have helped observing the coming-car, and that he might then have easily stopped his horses in time to prevent the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">One of the excuses he offers for not stopping is, that to have done so would have left the carriage standing on the foot cross<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>ing- His theory appears to be, that to save his own life and the lives of the people in the coup\u00e9, as well as to prevent the destruction of Ms employer\u2019s property, he had no legal right to obstruct the footwalk for even a few seconds. This absurd proposition needs no refutation, and if there were no other explanation, we would have to agree that the nonsuit was properly entered. But the driver also testified that it was impossible to obtain a view, north on Second street, far enough to see and escape the car, without driving so far out that Ms horses would be on the railway track, or at least so near thereto as to be in danger from the passing car, wMch projected eighteen inches beyond the rail on each side. In <em>this </em>statement he was to some extent corroborated.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Had it appeared from the evidence that Diamond street crosses Second street at a right angle, and that Second street extends, without bends or crooks, at a similar angle for any distance north, it is very difficult to understand why a look northward would not have revealed the car to the driver, after he had passed the building line, on Second street. But as to these important facts the evidence is silent. If the draft used by defendant\u2019s counsel in cross-examination, and the contents whereof are partially brought before us through the answers of witnesses, had gone in evidence, it might, perhaps, have exMbited these things, but an inspection of the formal bill of exceptions, which is indorsed by the defendant\u2019s counsel, \u201cNo objections,\u201d shows that the statement originally contained in the stenographer\u2019s notes, that the draft and certain photographs had been offered in evidence, was stricken out by the trial judge when settling the bill. The draft is thus excluded from our consideration, except to the extent that the matters it would have proved have crept into the testimony. Moreover, it is not attached to the record as an exMbit or otherwise, is not among the papers sent upj with the record, and therefore we could not, if it were allowable to examine it, know what it established in regard to the manner in which the streets Mtersect each other, and their particular courses, at and near the place of the accident. For aught we know from the evidence, or judicially, Second and Diamond streets may cross at such an angle as to corroborate rather than to contradict the driver\u2019s testimony, and where the fact of the plaintiff\u2019s contributory negligence is left at all in doubt, the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>is for the jury: Greenfield v. Harrisburg, etc., Ry., 178 Pa. 194. While some of the statements of the plaintiff\u2019s material witnesses may seem rather improbable, yet as the case stood when the plaintiff rested, they were not so inconsistent with mathematical and optical laws as to make their truth impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"A6sH\">Judgment reversed and procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
