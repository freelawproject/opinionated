This is contrary to the doctrine as enunciated in Andrews v. Fishing Creek Lumber Company, 161 Pa. 201. But here the court, \u201cin order to afford partnership creditors an opportunity to put their claims in shape for collection \u201d (i. e. to become record and lien creditors) tied up \u2014 -impounding\u2014this money previously definitively decreed, in specific amounts, to the appellant and his late copart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>ner\u2019s assignee, and gave ear to simple contract creditor\u2019s ex parte petitions and who were absolutely without status : Rudy\u2019s App., 94 Pa. 338, 344; Moore v. Dunn, 147 Pa. 359.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-5\">\u201cBut\u201d says Wait on Fraudulent Conveyances, section 73, \u201ca rule of procedure winch allowed any prowling creditor, before his claim was definitely established by judgment, and without reference to the character of his demand, to file a bill .... to impeach transfers or to interfere with the business affairs of the alleged debtor, would manifestly be susceptible of the grossest abuse. A more powerful weapon of oppression could not be placed at the disposal of unscrupulous litigants: \u201d Artman v. Giles, 155 Pa. 409; Kelly v. Herb, 157 Pa. 41.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-6\">Nor could the court by this decree change the course of distribution made by the auditor\u2019s report, duly confirmed and unappealed from.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-7\">The matter from that moment stood res judicata, and the court was bound to so consider it in the decree of August 24, 1897: Myers v. Coal Co., 126 Pa. 582; Harris v. Shuster, 3 Pa. Superior Ct. 331; Straw v. Smith, 179 Pa. 376, and cases cited in opinion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-8\">The confirmation of an auditor\u2019s report as originally submitted, or as it may be subsequently modified by the court, constitutes a definitive decree of- the court: Trickett\u2019s Law of Assignments, section 198.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-9\">Its benefits cannot be lost except by the omission of the party entitled to make his or her claim in due time, and in the proper manner, or by some act inconsistent with a bona fide claim, or where, by the provisions of law, the claim cannot be allowed: Williamson v. Krumbhaar, 132 Pa. 455.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b650-10\"><em>JR. A.

The matter was not res judicata: Wilson v. Wilson, 20 Atl. Rep. 644.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b650-11\">Several parties cannot each claim the benefit of the exemption law out of partnership property: Clegg v. Houston, 1 Phila. 352.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AXpH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>July 29, 1898:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b651-4\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AUx\">Orlady, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">McMurtrie and Alcers, being partners, confessed judgments aggregating $2,221.29 in favor of certain creditors, who caused executions to be promptly issued, and tbe personal property of the defendants to be sold thereunder for the sum of $3,433.45.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">An auditor was appointed to distribute the proceeds of the sheriff\u2019s sale, and pending the distribution, other creditors secured judgments against the late firm, and against one of the members individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">On March 1,1897, the court made an order confirming the report of the auditor absolutely, by which the balance in the hands of the sheriff was distributed</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">To David McMurtrie, ..... $407.88</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">To John D. Blair assignee of F. L. Akers, . 317.21</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">Qn the same day, the plaintiffs presented their petition in which they alleged certain facts relating to the distribution of the fund which caused the court to make the following order :</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">\u201c Now, March 1, 1897, it is ordered that the sheriff do not pay out the money distributed to the individual partners or their assignee before Wednesday, March 10, 1897.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">Subsequent to this, the sheriff paid $326.88 to David McMurtrie who claimed the balance of the fund, and asked that the sheriff be directed to pay that amount to him, to wit: $81.00, under the exemption laws. This was refused, and the single error urged is to this action of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-13\">The distribution of the proceeds of the sheriff\u2019s sale was conducted under the supervision of zealous counsel, and a number of petitions were presented asking for decrees which would hold or release the fund. None of these were final and many were not excepted to.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-14\">The whole fund was under the direct control of the court which had jurisdiction of all the parties and of the fund. The record shows that McMurtrie received $300 of the fund which was produced from the partnership assets, and that creditors of the firm claimed the balance on final judgments against the partnership, who, as stated by the court \u201c ought, in good conscience and equity to be paid before the individual partners would be entitled to such excess.\u201d In this we see no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-15\">The assignments of error are overruled and the decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
