T., 1898, by Ann Jones, from decree of O. C. Luzerne Co., No. 198 of 1890, refusing to entertain petition for an order upon Evan M. Evans to pay to her the distributive share as widow in the personal estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>of her husband, found and declared by the said court to be due to her and in the hands of said Evans, guardian, and refusing to make such order.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"Alf\">Before Rice, P. J., Wickham, Beaver, Orlady, Smith and Porter, JJ.</judges>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-5\">Exceptions to guardian\u2019s account. Before Darte, P. J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-6\">The facts sufficiently appear from the report of the preceding case in the matter of Lizzie Evans\u2019 estate, except that it appears from the record that the amount of money taken possession of by said guardian alleged to be due to the petitioner, the widow, as her distributive share amounted to 1417.58.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-7\">On presentation of the petition, the court refused the same, for the reason that the court has no jurisdiction to make such order. Ann Jones, the widow, appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b179-8\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1) in ruling that the orphans\u2019 court in Pennsylvania has no jurisdiction to compel a guardian to pay over to a widow of decedent, her distributive share of the personal estate of the decedent, which the guardian has taken into his possession. (2) In refusing to entertain the petition of the widow of John M. Evans, for an order upon Evan M. Evans to pay to her the distributive share in the personal estate of her deceased husband, to which she is entitled as widow, and of which he had become possessed as guardian.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b179-9\"><em>A. </em>Ricketts, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Apj\">The Act of June 16, 1836, sec. 19, P. L. 792, confers ample jurisdiction upon the orphans\u2019 court to meet the exigencies of this case: Mussleman\u2019s Appeal, 65 Pa. 480; Ashford v. Ewing, 25 Pa. 213.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b179-10\">Further than this, the cases of Brooke\u2019s Appeal, 102 Pa. 150, Odd Fellows Savings Bank\u2019s Appeal, 123 Pa. 356, and Mulholland\u2019s Estate, 154 Pa. 491, fully establish that the orphans\u2019 court has jurisdiction to compel, even those who are not under the special control of the court, to pay over any portion of decedents\u2019 estates of which they may have obtained possession; the fact that what they have in possession is part of a decedent\u2019s estate, being all that is necessary to give the court jurisdiction.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b179-11\"><em>John T. </em>Lenahan, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AId\">The citation of cases by counsel on the other side does not support the spirit and object <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>of the act. See Baskin\u2019s Appeal, 34 Pa. 272; Walton\u2019s Appeal, 174 Pa. 195 ; Bull v. Towson, 4 W. &amp; S. 557.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A0T\">March 21, 1898:</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b180-5\">So thoroughly grounded is the doctrine that the orphans\u2019 court has no jurisdiction in a case of-this nature that the Philadelphia courts in Laney\u2019s Est., 2 Dist. Rep. 801, seem to entertain no doubt whatever of the soundness of our position here.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"ACd\">Porter, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The widow\u2019s share of a decedent\u2019s estate passed (with the assent of the administrator), together with the interests of the wards, directly to the guardian. This appeal is from the refusal of the orphans\u2019 court, upon the account of the guardian, to make an order on him to pay to the widow her alleged share of the estate of the minors\u2019 deceased father. The amount claimed is not alleged to be a part of the estate of the minors. The guardian did not bring it into his account, nor should he have done so. It had no place there: Baskin\u2019s Appeal, 34 Pa. 272; Walton\u2019s Appeal, 174 Pa. 195. If it be improperly detained from the petitioner she is relegated to some other proceeding for its recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">The opinion of the court below is self-sustaining, and the amendment made to the decree was necessary to a proper adjudication of the subject-matter. The ingenious argument of the counsel for the appellant has not convinced us that error has been committed, and the decree of the lower court is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
