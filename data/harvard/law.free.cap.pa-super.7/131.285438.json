Before Mayer, P. J., and Hamilton and McKinney, associate judges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-13\">It appears from the record that a petition and bond of the Holloway Bottling Company for a wholesale liquor license was filed in the court of quarter sessions of Clinton County on November 29, 1897, as of No. 66, January sessions, 1898. That the day fixed by the said court for the hearing of liquor licenses was Monday the 27th day of <em>December,'1897; </em>that on the said day the court entered the following indorsement on the application : \u201c Now, the 27th day of December, 1897, license refused after due consideration by the court. W. L. Hamilton, A. J., J. Harris McKinney, A. J.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-14\">The docket shows the following entries: On January 3,1898, a petition praying for a re-consideration was filed. On January 19, 1898, the record was amended. On January 20, 1898, bill of exceptions sealed and made part of the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b163-15\">It is alleged in the bill of exceptions that no petition or remonstrance against the applicant was filed on the day it was read; that the court adjourned in the forenoon of the 27th of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>December, 1897, to meet on December 30, 1897, at 9 o\u2019clock A. M., and tliat after the said adjournment of the court on said December 27, 1897, the two associate judges of said court, the court not being in session at the time, marked the application for a license refused by the court and filed said refusal on the same day, when court was not in session.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-5\">On January 31, 1898, W. H. Clough entered his appearance for the appellees, whereupon counsel for the applicant moved that the appearance of <em>W. </em>H. Clough be stricken from the record, because, (1) There are no appellees' in this case and, therefore, his appearance is for nobody; (2) That his appearance was entered after the court had acted on the 27th of December, whereupon the following orders of the court were entered: \u201c And now, February 10,1898, the within reasons are well known to the court, no party appeared in court either by petition, remonstrance or exception, or by counsel, objecting to the granting of this license, and the license was refused. The parties now seeking to intervene were not parties to the proceedings at any time up to the refusal of the license, and not until an appeal was taken to the Superior Court. In my opinion the parties now seeking to become appellees cannot do so, as they were not parties in any way to the proceedings, and an attorney cannot appear for them as appellees, and the appearance of <em>W. </em>H. Clough, Esq., for appellees is therefore stricken from the record.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-6\">\u201c By the Court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b164-7\">\u201c C.

Kress, Esq., and W. H. Clough, Esq., appeared after the refusal of the license on December 27, 1897, we therefore, in the interest of justice and with a desire that both sides of the question involved in this case be fairly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>presented to the appellate court, refuse to concur in the above opinion of the president judge, and direct that the name of W. H. Clough, Esq., be not stricken from the record but be allowed to remain thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-5\">\u201c By the Court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-6\">\u201c W.

Speering, the applicant, appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-10\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were (1) in refusing to grant a wholesale liquor license to the applicant, W. F. Sperring, doing business as the Holloway Bottling Co., without any reason, and without assigning any reason for said refusal. (2) In refusing to grant applicant\u2019s license without having a due regard to the number and character of the petitioners for said license, when there was no objection, petition or remonstrance against it. (3) In refusing to grant applicant\u2019s license without a hearing. (4) In the two associates meeting together, in the absence of the president judge, when the court was not in session, refusing the license, and indorsing application \u201c December 27,1897, license refused after due consideration. By the Court: W. L. Hamilton, A. J., J. Harris McKinney, A. J. \u201d (5) In this, that Honorable J. Harris McKinney, one of the associate judges who signed the refusal, and without whose concurrence a decree of refusal could not have been entered, refused to assist in granting a license to any applicant, but was ready to join either of the judges in refusing any and all licenses, and did assist in refusing the only two which were refused, one of which is the applicant in this case. There was, therefore, no exercise of judicial discretion in this case by Honorable J. Harris McKinney, Associate Judge, but the decree was the \u201cmere despotic assertion of arbitrary will by one in power.\u201d (6) In declining to reconsider the refusal of said license on a petition of one hundred and fifty of the leading business men of the city of Lock Haven, and in refusing to strike off said refusal and to grant the license, when there was no objection, petition or remonstrance against it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b165-15\"><em>W.

The duty of the court below to give a hearing in this matter was arbitrarily neglected and refused by it. See Knarr\u2019s Petition, 127 Pa. 554; Thomas\u2019s Appeal, 169 Pa. 111; Dunlap\u2019s License, 171 Pa. 454.

Boos, 110 Pa. 594; Leister\u2019s App., 20 W. N. C. 224; Branch\u2019s License, 164 Pa. 427. Nor were they obliged to file any reasons for their decision: Commonwealth v. Kerns and Brother, 2 Pa.

It cannot be contradicted, overthrown, or weakened in its effect by the mere certificate of the president judge denying its truth. Neither do we base anything on the certificate of the associate judges, that a rehearing was had and the application refused a second time. These things are no part of the record, and including them in what are termed the \u201c bill of exceptions \u201d and \u201c additional bill of exceptions \u201d adds nothing to their character or weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The order of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
