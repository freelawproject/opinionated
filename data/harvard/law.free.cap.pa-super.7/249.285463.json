John W. Gantz and Elizabeth J. Tyrrell are his only surviving children. Lydia Florence Wiley is the only child of a deceased son. Samuel G. Hershey and Francis G. Hershey are the only two children of a daughter of the testator whose death-preceded his. The persons mentioned are the persons to whom the estate would have passed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>had he died intestate. Francis S. Tyrrell is the son of Elizabeth J. Tyrrell. Chester G. Hershey, as appears by the will, is a great grandson, being the son of Samuel G. Hershey, mentioned in the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b282-5\">The auditor in his construction of the will awarded to John W.

Testator had a perfect right to disinherit his son: Barr\u2019s Est., 2 Pa. 428; Jacob\u2019s Est., 140 Pa. 268; Miller\u2019s Appeal, 113 Pa. 459.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-11\">Particular expressions that would stand in the way of the general intent of the testator, are to be construed in subordination to it, or disregarded: Schott\u2019s Est., 78 Pa. 40.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AHA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>April 25, 1898:</decisiondate>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-4\">No presumption of an intent to die intestate, as to any part of Ms estate can be made, where the words of the testator will carry the whole: Miller\u2019s Appeal, 113 Pa. 459; Ferry\u2019s Appeal, 102 Pa. 207; Striewig\u2019s Est., 169 Pa. 61.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-5\">Share and share alike means per capita and not per stirpes: Hiestand v.

The difficulty lies in construing the language of the testamentary'paper. The words, \u201cshare and share alike with my other heirs,\u201d in the third paragraph of the will, clearly evince an intention that the estate shall, (after payment of the three legacies), be distributed among the testator\u2019s heirs in certain proportions. .</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">\u201c As a general rule of construction, it is well settled that a devise or bequest to heirs or heirs at law of a testator or to his next of kin will be construed as referring to those who are such at the time of the testator\u2019s decease, unless a different intent is plainly manifested by the will:\u201d Buzby\u2019s App., 61 Pa. 111; Stewart\u2019s Estate, Bell\u2019s Appeal, 147 Pa. 383. The court below has held that the giving of a specific legacy to John W. Gantz of $110, evinces an intention on the part of the testator to exclude the legatee from participation in the general distribution of the estate, although the legatee was his only living son, and one of his immediate heirs. We think no such conclusion is to be drawn from the giving of the legacy. In each of the cases above cited, a trust for life was created for a child, with remainder over to the right heirs of the testator. On the death of the child it was held that the right heirs of the testator were those living at his death, and that notwithstanding the limitation of the child\u2019s interest to a life estate, he should not be on that account excluded. It is elementary law that the heir shall not be deprived of his inheritance except by express words or an implication from which there is no escape. We think in this case that the legacy to John W. Gantz does not raise this implication. The inference to be drawn from the giving of it is one of preference for an only surviving son, rather than of an intention to exclude him.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">Again, the amount of the legacy is unusual, and bears the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>impress of a compensation or an adjustment rather than a benefaction or a distribution. We therefore hold that John W. Gantz is entitled to share with the other heirs in the distribution of the estate as indicated by the terms of the will. Francis S. Tyrrell and Chester G. Hershey receive their legacies, but do not participate in the general distribution because they are not heirs of the decedent, \u2014 Elizabeth J. Tyrrell and Samuel G. Hershey, the respective parents of the legatees both being- alive.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">The result of this construction of the will is a distribution of the estate, (after payment of the three specific legacies), among John W. Gantz, Lydia Florence Wiley, Samuel G. Hershey and Francis Hershey in equal shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">The decree of the court below is reversed, and the record is remitted in order that distribution may be made as herein indicated.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
