(\u201cDHI\u201d) appeals the decision of the Stark County Court of Common Pleas that denied its motion to dismiss the trial court\u2019s proceedings. DHI argues that since the parties signed a contract that included an arbitration agreement, the dispute should be submitted to binding arbitration. Appellees Mark, Catherine D., and Catherine S. Church contend that they did not sign, nor did they authorize their real estate agent to sign the contract containing the arbitration clause, thus rendering the arbitration clause unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">STATEMENT OF THE FACTS AND CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">{\u00b6 2} On August 9, 2003, Jeff Desjardins, a representative of DHI, presented a one-page home-inspection agreement to JoAnn Grisak, the real estate agent of the Churches. The written agreement set forth the terms and conditions of the visual/nondestructive home inspection that Desjardins was to perform at the future home of the Churches located at 7100 Deer Trail NW, in North Canton, Ohio. The inspection was requested by the Churches through their real estate agent Grisak and was done as part of their purchase of the Deer Trail residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-12\">{\u00b6 3} On the day and scheduled time of the home inspection, Desjardins met Grisak at the residence. He confirmed with her that he was to conduct the home inspection for the Churches. Before beginning his inspection, he provided Grisak with the home-inspection agreement that set forth the terms of the home inspection. After reviewing the one-page document, Grisak signed the agreement on behalf of the Churches, indicating their agreement to the terms and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>conditions set forth therein by signing the document as follows: \u201cJoAnn Grisak for Mark and Cathy Church.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">{\u00b6 4} Upon Grisak\u2019s signing the document, Desjardins conducted the home inspection for consideration of $300. Upon Desjardins\u2019s completing his inspection, Grisak again signed the agreement for Mark and Cathy Church, indicating that the home inspection was completed in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Within the agreed-to period, Desjardins prepared a 14-page report recording his findings, which he sent directly to Mark and Cathy Church. However, it is alleged that Desjardins failed to discover and disclose significant defects in the home to the Churches. Among the significant defects in the home is mold growth that has adversely affected the health of Mark and Catherine D. Church and their seven-year-old daughter, Catherine S. Church.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">{\u00b6 5} On February 1, 2006, the Churches filed a complaint against Ronald and Diane Marsilio (the sellers), Fleishour Homes, Inc. (the builder), and DHI. The Churches\u2019 claims against DHI initially included breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and violation of the Consumers Sales Practices Act (\u201cCSPA\u201d), and the Churches sought a declaratory judgment from the court with regard to a liquidated-damages provision contained in the home-inspection agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">{\u00b6 6} On March 8, 2006, DHI answered the Churches\u2019 complaint, denying the allegations against it and asserting various affirmative defenses, including that the claims were barred by a contractual arbitration provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">{\u00b6 7} On March 22, 2006, DHI filed a motion for partial judgment on the pleadings on the grounds that the Churches had failed to support their contract claim by attaching the written instrument upon which their claims were based, as required by Ohio Civ.R. 10(D)(1). DHI also asserted that the CSPA claim was time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">{\u00b6 8} On April 10, 2006, the Churches filed an opposition brief to DHI\u2019s motion. In their brief, the Churches stated that \u201c[pjursuant to a contingency in their purchase agreement with the Marsilios, Plaintiffs contracted with Defendant, Detective Homes Inspections, Ltd. (\u2018Defendant\u2019) to perform an inspection of the home. This inspection was completed on August 9, 2003, and a written report was submitted to Plaintiffs shortly thereafter.\u201d The Churches attached a copy of the written report and home-inspection agreement to their brief as an exhibit, and requested leave of the trial court to amend their complaint by attaching the contract to the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">{\u00b6 9} On April 13, 2006, the trial court dismissed the CSPA claim against DHI as being time-barred, and ruled that the exhibit attached to the Churches opposition brief of the inspection report and inspection agreement would be attached to the pleadings to satisfy Civ.R. 10(D)(1). Of particular relevance to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>this appeal is the arbitration provision directly above the acknowledgement and acceptance section that states: \u201cARBITRATION PROVISION \u2014 Any dispute between the parties shall be settled by arbitration before the Better Business Bureau.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">{\u00b6 10} On June 13, 2006, DHI filed a motion seeking to enforce the arbitration provision contained in the home-inspection agreement. Accompanying DHI\u2019s motion was an affidavit from Desjardins, the home inspector that performed the general home inspection on behalf of DHI.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">{\u00b6 11} On June 19, 2006, the Churches field a brief in opposition to DHI\u2019s motion to enforce the arbitration provision contained in the home-inspection agreement. The Churches did not challenge the evidence DHI attached to its motion. Moreover, the Churches did not submit any evidence in support of their contentions with their opposition brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">{\u00b6 12} On June 19, 2006, the Churches also filed an amended complaint. As background, the Churches requested leave of the trial court to file an amended complaint so that they could include allegations of injuries to Mark Church. On May 22, 2006, the trial court granted the Churches\u2019 request to file their amended complaint, which they filed on June 19, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">{\u00b6 13} On June 28, 2006, DHI filed its answer to the Churches\u2019 first amended complaint. Consistent with its first answer, DHI denied the allegations against it and again asserted various affirmative defenses, including enforcement of the contractual arbitration provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">{\u00b6 14} On June 30, 2006, DHI filed a reply brief to the Churches\u2019 memorandum in opposition to the motion to enforce the arbitration provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">{\u00b6 15} On July 6, 2006, the Churches filed a response to DHI\u2019s reply brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">{\u00b6 16} Finally, on July 11, 2006, the trial court denied DHI\u2019s motion to enforce the arbitration provision. In its judgment entry, the trial court noted that \u201cthere is no proof before the Court that the individuals signing the alleged arbitration provision, in fact, had the authority to bind the parties to this lawsuit to arbitration. The Court finds that there is no proof from an affirmative nature or negative nature concerning this issue.\u201d Further, the trial court found that \u201cany cause of action filed by the minor child would not be subject to any arbitration provision based on the evidence presently before the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">{\u00b6 17} It is from the trial court\u2019s ruling that DHI has filed the instant appeal, raising the following assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b253-13\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cI. The trial court erred in denying the appellant\u2019s motion to enforce the arbitration provision contained in the home inspection agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">{\u00b6 19} In <em>Stinger v. Ultimate Warranty Corp., </em>this court held that \u201c \u2018[t]he issue of whether a controversy is arbitrable under an arbitration provision of a contract is a question of law for the court to decide\u2019; therefore, our standard of review is de novo. <em>Gaffney v. Powell </em>(1995), 107 Ohio App.3d 315, 319, 668 N.E.2d 951.\u201d 161 Ohio App.3d 122, 2005-Ohio-2595, 829 N.E.2d 735, \u00b6 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">{\u00b6 20} R.C. 2711.01(A) provides that a provision in a written contract \u201cto settle by arbitration a controversy that subsequently arises out of the contract, or out of the refusal to perform the whole or any part of the contract * * * shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, except upon grounds that exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\u201d In general, a clause providing for arbitration \u201cshould not be denied effect unless it may be said with positive assurance that the subject arbitration clause is not susceptible to an interpretation that covers the asserted dispute.\u201d <em>Duryee v. Pie Mut. Ins. </em>Co. (Sept. 23, 1999), 10th Dist. Nos. 98AP-1255 and 98AP-1256, 1999 WL 744341.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">{\u00b6 21} DHI did not file a petition to stay the trial court proceedings under R.C. 2711.02. It did seek an order compelling arbitration under R.C. 2711.03. These two statutes provide for separate and distinct remedies for enforcement of an arbitration agreement. <em>Brumm v. McDonald &amp; Co. Secs., Inc. </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 96, 100, 603 N.E.2d 1141.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">{\u00b6 22} R.C. 2711.02 provides for indirect enforcement of an arbitration agreement by staying pending trial court proceedings on an issue that is subject to arbitration. R.C. 2711.03 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">{\u00b6 23} \u201cThe party aggrieved by the alleged failure of another to perform under a written agreement for arbitration may petition any court of common pleas * * * for an order directing that the arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in the written agreement. The court <em>shall hear </em>the parties, and, upon being satisfied that the making of the agreement for arbitration or the failure to comply with the agreement is not in issue, the court shall make an order directing the parties to proceed to arbitration * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">{\u00b6 24} R.C. 2711.03 provides for direct enforcement by a petition to a trial court for an order compelling arbitration. <em>Brumm v. McDonald &amp; Co. Secs., Inc. </em>In either type of proceeding, the very existence of an agreement to arbitrate can be an issue that the court must resolve. Under R.C. 2711.03, either party has the right to a jury trial if the existence of an agreement for arbitration is an issue. Under R.C. 2711.02, the trial court may, but is not required to, hold an actual trial in determining whether the issue involved in the underlying trial court proceeding is referable to arbitration under a valid arbitration agreement. <em>Cross v. Carnes </em>(1998), 132 Ohio App.3d 157, 164, 724 N.E.2d 828. Rather, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>trial court must simply be \u201csatisfied\u201d that the dispute is referable to arbitration under such an agreement. <em>Ritchie\u2019s Food Dist. v. Refrigerated Constr. Servs., </em>4th Dist. No. 02CA683, 2002-Ohio-3763, 2002 WL 1728643, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cWhen a trial court finds, after hearing the parties, that the making of an arbitration agreement is at issue and the <em>existence </em>or <em>applicability </em>of an arbitration agreement is disputed, the matter falls under R.C. 2711.03(B). R.C. 2711.03(B) requires that, when the existence of applicability of an arbitration clause is in dispute, * * the court shall proceed summarily to a trial of [the] issue [of whether the agreement existed and/or applied to the plaintiff].\u2019 \u201d <em>Liese v. Kent State Univ., </em>11th Dist. 2003-P-0033, 2004-Ohio-5322, 2004 WL 2801698, \u00b6 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">{\u00b626} \u201cWhen determining whether a trial is necessary under R.C. 2711.03, the relevant inquiry is whether a party has presented sufficient evidence challenging the validity or enforceability [or applicability] of the arbitration provision to require the trial court to proceed to trial before refusing to enforce the arbitration clause.\u2019 \u201d <em>McDonough v. Thompson, </em>8th Dist. No. 82222, 2003-Ohio-4655, 2003 WL 22052777, \u00b6 13, quoting <em>Garcia v. Wayne Homes, LLC, </em>2d Dist. No. 2001 CA 53, 2002-Ohio-1884, 2002 WL 628619, \u00b6 20-21. See also <em>Ison v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>148 Ohio App.3d 465, 2002-Ohio-3762, 773 N.E.2d 1101, \u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">{\u00b6 27} As an initial matter, we note that DHI never requested an oral hearing on the matter in the trial court. Nor did the Churches request a jury trial in their response to DHI\u2019s motion. We further note that neither party argues in this appeal that the trial court erred by failing to conduct a trial or an oral hearing prior to ruling in this matter. Nor does either party contend that they were not able to fully develop their cases concerning the arbitration clause by the trial court\u2019s consideration of the briefs and evidentiary material submitted by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-8\"> {\u00b6 28} Summary-judgment proceedings allow the parties to be heard. Summary judgment is \u201ca procedural device designed to terminate litigation and to avoid a formal trial where no issues exist for trial.\u201d <em>Griffith v. Linton </em>(1998), 130 Ohio App.3d 746, 753, 721 N.E.2d 146, citing <em>Norris v. Ohio Std. Oil Co. </em>(1982), 70 Ohio St.2d 1, 2, 24 O.O.3d 1, 433 N.E.2d 615. Accordingly, it is well settled that summary judgment is a proper mechanism by which a trial court can hear the parties and determine whether an arbitration clause is applicable to a given dispute. See <em>Liese v. Kent State Univ. </em>at \u00b6 40; <em>West v. Household Life Ins. Co., </em>170 Ohio App.3d 463, 2007-Ohio-845, 867 N.E.2d 868, \u00b6 18; <em>T &amp; R Ents., Inc. v. Continental Grain Co. </em>(C.A.5 1980), 613 F.2d 1272, 1276-1277.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>{\u00b6 29} While a party\u2019s request for an oral hearing -will be granted pursuant to R.C. 2711.03, an oral hearing is not mandatory absent a request. See, e.g., <em>Cross v. Carnes </em>(1998), 132 Ohio App.3d 157, 166, 724 N.E.2d 828; <em>Liese v. Kent State Univ. </em>at \u00b6 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c \u2018As a general rule, the doctrine of waiver is applicable to all personal rights and privileges, whether secured by contract, conferred by statute, or guaranteed by the Constitution * * *.\u2019 \u201d <em>Sanit. Commercial Servs., Inc. v. Shank </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 178, 180-181, 566 N.E.2d 1215, quoting <em>State ex rel. Hess v. Akron </em>(1937), 132 Ohio St. 305, 307, 8 O.O. 76, 7 N.E.2d 411. As such, it is well settled that a person may waive rights and privileges secured by statute, including the statutory right to a hearing conferred by R.C. 2711.03. <em>Liese v. Kent State Univ. </em>at \u00b6 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">{\u00b6 31} It is therefore clear that the parties waived their right to a trial and an oral hearing by not requesting that the trial court conduct one and by not objecting to the manner in which the trial court proceeded to resolve the matter. <em>Liese v. Kent State Univ.; T &amp; R Ents., Inc. v. Continental Grain Co. </em>In the same instance, however, the parties allowed themselves to be heard on the issue, as was required by R.C. 2711.03. The trial court conducted a nonoral hearing on DHI\u2019s motion to enforce the arbitration agreement on approximately July 5, 2006. Although an oral hearing was never conducted, the nonoral hearing allowed the parties to be heard, as required by R.C. 2711.03. <em>Liese v. Kent State Univ.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">The Claims of Mark and Catherine D. Church</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">{\u00b6 32} R.C. Chapter 2711 does not set forth the amount of evidence that must be produced to receive a trial under R.C. 2711.03. However, \u201ccourts are directed to address the matter as they would a summary judgment exercise, proceeding to trial where the party moving for the jury trial sets forth specific facts demonstrating that a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding the validity or enforceability of the arbitration agreement.\u201d <em>Garcia v. Wayne Homes, L.L.C. </em>(Apr. 19, 2002), Clark App. No. 2001 CA 53, 2002 WL 628619; <em>McDonough v. Thompson, </em>8th Dist. No. 82222, 2003-Ohio-4655, 2003 WL 22052777, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cA party to an arbitration agreement cannot obtain a jury trial merely by demanding one.\u201d <em>Dillard v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>(C.A.5 1992), 961 F.2d 1148, 1154. Further, under the <em>Dillard </em>analysis, a party contesting the \u201cmaking\u201d of the arbitration agreement must \u201cmake at least some showing that under prevailing law, he would be relieved of his contractual obligation to arbitrate if his allegations proved to be true * * * [and] produce * * * some evidence to substantiate his factual allegations.\u201d Id. at 1154. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>also <em>T &amp; R Ents., Inc. v. Continental Grain Co. </em>(C.A.5 1980), 613 F.2d at 1278; <em>Am. Heritage Life Ins. Co. v. Orr </em>(C.A.5 2002), 294 F.3d 702, 710; <em>McDonough v. Thompson, </em>8th Dist. No. 82222, 2003-Ohio-4655, 2003 WL 22052777, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">{\u00b6 34} In the instant case, DHI submitted evidence in the form of an affidavit from Desjardins, the person who conducted the inspection of the Churches\u2019 house. In that affidavit, the inspector detailed his meeting with the Churches\u2019 real estate agent, including the fact that the inspection report was to be prepared for the Churches. The inspector noted that the realtor signed the pre-inspection agreement on behalf of the Churches both before and after the inspection of the home. The Churches did not offer any evidentiary materials in support of their position that the realtor did not have express or apparent authority to sign the pre-inspection agreement on their behalf. The arguments advanced by the Churches amount to nothing more than hollow, bald assertions. See <em>Bhatia v. Johnston </em>(C.A.5 1987), 818 F.2d 418, <em>421-422 </em>(stating that self-serving affidavits do not amount to the type of evidence required to call the \u201cmaking of the arbitration\u201d agreement into question). <em>Am. Heritage Life Ins. Co. v. Orr.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">{\u00b6 35} In the case at bar, the Churches filed an amended complaint on June 19, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">{\u00b6 36} Exhibit A of the Churches\u2019 amended complaint is titled \u201cReal Estate Purchase Agreement.\u201d It is a four-page document that appears to be a preprinted form that Mark and Catherine D. Church, as buyers, completed and signed, and their real estate agent, Grisak, also signed. The section where Grisak\u2019s signature and information is located is titled \u201cAgent\u2019s Information.\u201d Therefore, as it related to the purchase of the home, Grisak was the Churches\u2019 agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">{\u00b6 37} Among other matters, the purchase agreement that the Churches and Grisak signed addresses inspections of the home. The section pertaining to inspections states that as part of the purchase of the home, the Churches elect to have a general home inspection, a radon inspection, an insect inspection, and a mold inspection. Further, the purchase agreement states:</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cB) INSPECTION: This Agreement shall be subject to the following inspection(s) by a qualified inspector of Buyer\u2019s choice within 14 days from the date of this Agreement. Buyer assumes sole responsibility to select and retain a qualified inspector for each requested inspection. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b257-10\">{\u00b6 39} \u201cAll inspections are to be performed by CONTRACTOR(S) OF BUYER\u2019S CHOICE, regardless of which party is paying for the inspection(s). Buyer or Buyer\u2019s agent is responsible to order the inspection(s).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b257-11\">{\u00b6 40} The Churches requested that DHI conduct the general home inspection of the Deer Trail residence on August 9, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>{\u00b6 41} As the above-quoted language establishes, the Churches agreed that they were solely responsible to select and retain a home inspector. Further, the quoted language acknowledges that the buyer\u2019s agent may have the authority to arrange for the inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">{\u00b6 42} The Churches made several changes to the purchase agreement, each of which was initialed by them. The Churches did not modify the paragraphs concerning the authority of the real estate agent to order the inspection of the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">{\u00b6 43} In a case similar to the case at bar, the homeowner \u201centered into a contract with defendant Castle Inspections, Inc., a company that performs home inspections for prospective buyers. Plaintiff could not be present on the day of the inspection, so he arranged for his father to be present in his place. The father signed a pre-inspection agreement on plaintiffs behalf which contained a broadly worded clause binding the parties to arbitration in the event of a dispute on the agreement. Defendant\u2019s inspection revealed no discernable problems with water leakage in the basement. Plaintiff purchased the house and later discovered water in the basement.\u201d <em>Stocker v. Castle Inspections, Inc. </em>(1995), 99 Ohio App.3d 735, 651 N.E.2d 1052. In <em>Stocker </em>the plaintiff filed an amended complaint that asserted three causes of action alleging: (1) defendant negligently inspected the property, (2) defendant violated provisions of the Ohio Consumer Sales Practices Act, and (3) defendant breached the pre-inspection agreement. In response to the amended complaint, the defendant in <em>Stocker </em>filed a motion to dismiss the complaint or, in the alternative, to compel the parties to submit to arbitration as required by the contract. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">{\u00b6 44} On appeal, the plaintiff argued that the arbitration provision did not apply to him since his father signed the agreement in his absence. The plaintiff argued that a submission to arbitration is beyond the implied or apparent powers of an agent. <em>Stocker, </em>99 Ohio App.3d at 737, 651 N.E.2d 1052. In reversing the trial court\u2019s decision, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth District observed: \u201cPlaintiff does not contend that the entire contract should be rescinded; in fact, his third cause of action seeks damages based upon defendant\u2019s alleged breach of the contract. Moreover, plaintiff makes no effort to show a failure of the contract itself. There is no allegation of fraud in the inducement or any other act by defendant that would make the contract unenforceable. Presumably, plaintiff and defendant lived up to their respective duties in the contract up to the point where the alleged breach occurred. Instead, plaintiff seeks to invalidate only that portion of the contract which binds him to arbitrate any dispute arising under the contract by asserting his father acted <em>ultra vires </em>in agreeing, in plaintiffs name, to arbitration.\u201d Id. The court in <em>Stocker </em>held:</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>{\u00b6 45} \u201cIn <em>Miller v. Wick Bldg. Co. </em>(1950), 154 Ohio St. 93, 42 O.O. 169, 93 N.E.2d 467, paragraph two of the syllabus states:</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">{\u00b6 46} \u201c \u2018Even where one assuming to act as agent for a party in the making of a contract has no actual authority to so act, such party will be bound by the contract if such party has by his words or conduct, reasonably interpreted, caused the other party to the contract to believe that the one assuming to act as agent had the necessary authority to make the contract.\u2019 See, also, <em>Cascioli v. Cent. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1983), 4 Ohio St.3d 179, 181, 4 OBR 457, 459, 448 N.E.2d 126, 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cMoreover, where the principal has placed the agent in a situation that a person of ordinary prudence, conversant in the nature of the particular business, is justified in assuming that the agent is authorized to perform on behalf of the principal, \u2018such particular act having been performed the principal is estopped as against such innocent third person from denying the agent\u2019s authority to perform it.\u2019 <em>Gen. Cartage &amp; Storage Co. v. Cox </em>(1906), 74 Ohio St. 284, 294, 78 N.E. 371, 372.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">{\u00b6 48} \u201cIn <em>Master Consol. Corp. v. BancOhio Natl. Bank </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 570, 575 N.E.2d 817, the court considered these legal principles and distilled them into the following syllabus:</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">{\u00b6 49} \u201c \u2018In order for a principal to be bound by the acts of his agent under the theory of apparent agency, evidence must show: (1) that the principal held the agent out to the public as possessing sufficient authority to embrace the particular act in question, or knowingly permitted him to act as having such authority, and (2) that the person dealing with the agent knew of those facts and acting in good faith had reason to believe and did believe that the agent possessed the necessary authority.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cWe find plaintiffs father, acting as agent, could sign the contract on plaintiff\u2019s behalf and, in the process, bind plaintiff to arbitrate any disputes arising from that contract. See <em>N &amp; D Fashions, Inc. v. DHJ Industries, Inc. </em>(C.A.8 1976), 548 F.2d 722, 729 (purchasing agent of fabric buyer had apparent authority to enter any agreements reasonably necessary to sell, including arbitration agreement).\u201d <em>Stocker, </em>99 Ohio App.3d at 738, 651 N.E.2d 1052.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">{\u00b6 51} In the case at bar, the Churches acknowledge that they accepted and paid for the inspection report. Their sixth cause of action in the case at bar is for breach of contract. The Churches have not presented any evidence concerning the existence of any contract other than the one that was signed by their real estate agent. The real estate agent, JoAnn Grisak, had at least apparent authority to enter any agreements reasonably necessary to the sale, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>including an arbitration agreement. In the absence of any expression to the contrary by the Churches, DHI was entitled to rely on this authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">{\u00b6 52} Affirmative evidence exists in the record to show that Mark and Cathy Church are bound by the arbitration provision contained in the home-inspection agreement. Accordingly the trial court erred in failing to uphold the arbitration provision with respect to the claims of Mark and Cathy Church.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The Claims of the Minor Child Catherine S. Church</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">{\u00b6 58} Appellant DHI next maintains that the minor child, Catherine S. Church is bound by the arbitration provision contained in the pre-inspection agreement. Under the facts of this case, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">{\u00b6 54} In their amended complaint, the Churches have alleged three causes of action against DHI: (1) breach of contract, (2) negligence, and (3) negligent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-9\">{\u00b6 55} In order to recover on a negligence claim, a plaintiff must prove that (1) the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty, (2) the defendant breached that duty, and (3) the breach of the duty proximately caused the plaintiffs injury. \u201cThe existence of a duty is fundamental to establishing actionable negligence, without which there is no legal liability.\u201d <em>Adelman v. Timman </em>(1997), 117 Ohio App.3d 544, 549, 690 N.E.2d 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">{\u00b6 56} The existence of a duty is a question of law. <em>Mussivand v. David </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 314, 318, 544 N.E.2d 265. Further, the existence of a duty depends on the foreseeability of the injury. <em>Huston v. Konieczny </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St.3d 214, 217, 556 N.E.2d 505. \u201cOnly when the injured person comes within the circle of those to whom injury may be reasonably anticipated does the defendant owe him a duty of care.\u201d <em>Adelman, </em>117 Ohio App.3d at 549, 690 N.E.2d 1332. Additionally, an injury is foreseeable if a defendant knew or should have known his act was likely to result in harm to someone. <em>Huston, 52 </em>Ohio St.3d at 217, 556 N.E.2d 505. Once the existence of a duty is found, a defendant must exercise that degree of care that an ordinarily careful and prudent person would exercise under the same or similar circumstances. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">{\u00b6 57} Ohio has long recognized the right of a parent to maintain a derivative action against a third-party tortfeasor who injures the parent\u2019s minor child. See, e.g., <em>Grindell v. Huber </em>(1971), 28 Ohio St.2d 71, 57 O.O.2d 259, 275 N.E.2d 614, and <em>Whitehead v. Gen. Tel. Co. </em>(1969), 20 Ohio St.2d 108, 49 O.O.2d 435, 254 N.E.2d 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">{\u00b6 58} Paragraph three of the syllabus in <em>Whitehead </em>reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>{\u00b6 59} \u201cWhere a defendant negligently causes injury to a minor child, that single wrong gives rise to two separate and distinct causes of action: an action by the minor child for his personal injuries and a derivative action in favor of the parents of the child for the loss of his services and his medical expenses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">{\u00b6 60} <em>Whitehead </em>held:</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">{\u00b6 61} \u2018Where a court determines, in an action by the parents of an injured minor child, that a defendant is not liable to the parents for the loss of services and medical expenses of the child, that judgment does not collaterally estop the child from bringing an action against that same defendant to recover damages for her personal injuries, so long as it does not appear from the record in that prior action that the child was a party, or that the child was a real party in interest, or that the child had control over that litigation, or that the parents and child were in privity.\u201d See also <em>Grindell v. Huber </em>(1971), 28 Ohio St.2d 71, 75, 57 O.O.2d 259, 275 N.E.2d 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">{\u00b6 62} In <em>Gallimore v. Children\u2019s Hosp. Med. Ctr. </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 244, 617 N.E.2d 1052, the court extended this concept: \u201ca parent may recover damages, in a derivative action against a third-party tortfeasor who intentionally or negligently causes physical injury to the parent\u2019s minor child, for loss of filial consortium. We further find that \u2018services\u2019 are just one aspect of consortium. \u2018Consortium\u2019 includes services, society, companionship, comfort, love and solace.\u201d Id. at 251, 617 N.E.2d 1052.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">{\u00b6 63} Accordingly, in the case at bar, the <em>parents\u2019 </em>action for the loss of filial consortium and medical expenses of the child would be subject to the arbitration provisions of the pre-inspection agreement as set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">{\u00b6 64} As the child\u2019s cause of action for personal injuries is separate and distinct from that of her parents\u2019 claims, it cannot be subject to the parents\u2019 agreement to arbitrate. The minor is not seeking to enforce any provision of that contract. Liability in such instance is not dependent upon any contractual relation between the person injured and the contractor but on the failure of the contractor to exercise due care in the performance of his obligation. The minor child need not rely on the terms of the written agreement in asserting her claims. It is not sufficient that the minor\u2019s claims \u201ctouch matters\u201d concerning the agreement or that the claims are \u201cdependent upon\u201d the agreement. <em>Hill v. G.E. Power Sys., Inc. </em>(C.A.5, 2002), 282 F.3d 343, 348-349; <em>I Sports v. IMG Worldwide, Inc., </em>157 Ohio App.3d 593, 2004-Ohio-3113, 813 N.E.2d 4, \u00b6 17. Although the minor child\u2019s claims may be dependent upon establishing DHI\u2019s breach of the agreement, she does not need to rely on the terms of the agreement in asserting her claims. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>{\u00b6 65} In <em>Auto-Owners Ins. Co. v. Old Time Roofing </em>(May 12, 2000), 7th Dist No. 98-CA-176, 2000 WL 652612, the court noted:</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">{\u00b6 66} \u201cIt has been stated that when contracting with one party:</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">{\u00b6 67} \u2018[T]he defendant may place himself in such a relation toward [a third party] that the law will impose upon him an obligation, sounding in tort and not in contract, to act in such a way that [the third party] will not be injured. The incidental fact of the existence of the contract * * * does not negative the responsibility of the actor when he enters upon a course of affirmative conduct which may be expected to affect the interests of another person.\u2019 Prosser and Keeton, 667-668, \u00a7 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">{\u00b6 68} \u2018The question is: Has the defendant broken a duty apart from the contract? If he has merely broken his contract, none can sue him but a party to it, but if he has violated a duty to others, he is liable to them.\u2019 Prosser and Keeton, 667-668, \u00a7 93.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">{\u00b6 69} The scope of the contractor\u2019s duties to third parties is limited to the duties assumed under the contract. <em>Heneghan v. Sears, Roebuck and Co. </em>(1990), 67 Ohio App.3d 490, 494, 587 N.E.2d 854, see <em>Hendrix v. Eighth and Walnut Corp. </em>(1982), 1 Ohio St.3d 205, 1 OBR 230, 438 N.E.2d 1149; <em>Banks v. Otis Elevator Co. </em>(Dec. 17, 1987), Cuyahoga App. No. 53059, 1987 WL 29664; <em>Robinson v. J.C. Penney Co. </em>(May 20, 1993), Cuyahoga App. Nos. 62389 and 63062, 1993 WL 172981; <em>Hill v. Sonitrol of Southwestern Ohio, Inc. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 36, 521 N.E.2d 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">{\u00b6 70} The questions of whether DHI owed a duty to the minor child, the scope of any such duty, and whether DHI breached such duty are not before this court. The narrow question raised in this appeal is whether the minor child can be forced to arbitrate her claim for personal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">{\u00b6 71} The child\u2019s cause of action for personal injuries does not arise out of any third-party-beneficiary status she might have under the inspection agreement. Rather, it arises from the injury she suffered because of the condition of the home. Therefore, Catherine S. Church, the minor child, cannot be compelled to arbitrate her personal-injury claim against DHI.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">Cross-Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b262-11\">{\u00b6 72} The Churches raise one cross-assignment of error, so to speak, in their brief. They argue that DHI has waived its right to enforce the arbitration clause. DHI contends that a cross-appeal was required and that this court should ignore the presented assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-12\">{\u00b6 73} R.C. 2505.22 permits the filing of assignments of error by an appellee who has not appealed. The statute states: \u201cIn connection with an appeal of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>final order, judgment, or decree of a court, assignments of error may be filed by an appellee who does not appeal, which assignments shall be passed upon by a reviewing court before the final order, judgment, or decree is reversed in whole or in part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">{\u00b6 74} In <em>Parton v. Weilnau </em>(1959), 169 Ohio St. 145, 170-171, 8 O.O.2d 134, 158 N.E.2d 719, the Ohio Supreme Court stated that assignments of error of an appellee who has not appealed from a judgment may be considered by a reviewing court only to prevent \u201ca reversal of the judgment under review.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">{\u00b6 75} Further, \u201can assignment of error by an appellee, where such appellee has not filed any notice of appeal from the judgment of the lower court, may be used by the appellee as a shield to protect the judgment of the lower court but may not be used by the appellee as a sword to destroy or modify that judgment.\u201d Id. See also <em>Glidden Co. v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co., </em>112 Ohio St.3d 470, 2006-Ohio-6553, 861 N.E.2d 109, \u00b6 30-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">{\u00b6 76} The waiver argument is clearly the \u201cshield\u201d envisioned in <em>Parton. </em>This argument, if successful, would reverse the holding that the claims of Mr. and Mrs. Church are subject to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">{\u00b6 77} We would note that the trial court did not expressly rule on the Churches\u2019 waiver argument. Nevertheless, when a trial court fails to rule on a pretrial motion, it may ordinarily be presumed that the court overruled it. <em>State ex rel. The V Cos. v. Marshall </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 467, 469, 692 N.E.2d 198; <em>State ex rel. Cassels v. Dayton City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 217, 223, 631 N.E.2d 150; <em>Newman v. Al Castrucci Ford Sales </em>(1988), 54 Ohio App.3d 166, 561 N.E.2d 1001. From the trial court\u2019s judgment, it may be presumed that the court overruled the Churches\u2019 waiver argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">{\u00b6 78} Essentially, the Churches argue that DHI waived the right to arbitration by participating in the litigation through filing discovery requests, participating in pretrial conferences, filing motions and waiting until the matter had been pending four months before formally requesting arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">{\u00b6 79} In <em>Mauk v. Washtenaw Mtg. Co., </em>5th Dist. No. 03CA0019, 2003-Ohio-4394, 2003 WL 21981977, this court noted, \u201cThe determination as to whether arbitration has been waived is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Carter Steel &amp; Fabricating Co. v. Danis Bldg. Constr. Co. </em>(1998), 126 Ohio App.3d 251, 710 N.E.2d 299. In order to find an abuse of that discretion, we must determine that the trial court\u2019s decision was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable and not merely an error of law or judgment. <em>Blakemore v. Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 217 [5 OBR 481] 450 N.E.2d 1140.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>{\u00b6 80} \u201cThe essential question is whether, based on the totality of the circumstances, the party seeking arbitration has acted inconsistently with the right to arbitrate.\u201d <em>Harsco Corp. v. Crane Carrier Co. </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 406, 410, 701 N.E.2d 1040. To determine whether a defendant acted inconsistently with arbitration, the court should consider: \u201c \u2018(1) any delay in the requesting party\u2019s demand to arbitrate via a motion to stay judicial proceedings and an order compelling arbitration; (2) the extent of the requesting party\u2019s participation in the litigation prior to its filing a motion to stay the judicial proceeding, including a determination of the status of discovery, dispositive motions, and the trial date; (3) whether the requesting party invoked the jurisdiction of the court by filing a counterclaim or third-party complaint without asking for a stay of the proceedings; and (4) whether the non-requesting party has been prejudiced by the requesting party\u2019s inconsistent acts.\u2019 \u201d Id. quoting <em>Phillips v. Lee Homes, Inc. </em>(Feb. 17, 1994), Cuyahoga App. No. 64353, 1994 WL 50696, and citing <em>Rock v. Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. </em>(1992), 79 Ohio App.3d 126, 606 N.E.2d 1054; <em>Brumm v. McDonald &amp; Co. Securities, Inc. </em>(1992), 78 Ohio App.3d 96, 603 N.E.2d 1141.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">{\u00b6 81} In <em>Mauk, </em>2003-Ohio-4394, 2003 WL 21981977, this court found that the appellant had waived its right to arbitration by filing a motion to dismiss, engaging in discovery, obtaining a protective order, and waiting over seven months to formally request arbitration. The court found the appellant\u2019s argument in <em>Mauk </em>\u2014 that it was not aware of the arbitration provision pertaining to appellees \u2014 to be spurious.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">{\u00b6 82} The case at bar is distinguishable from <em>Mauk. </em>In this case, the Churches filed their original complaint on February 1, 2006. On March 8, 2006, DHI answered denying the allegation of the complaint and asserting various affirmative defenses, including the claim that the Churches\u2019 claims were subject to the arbitration provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">{\u00b6 83} Under the facts of this case, we are unwilling to find that the trial court abused its discretion by overruling the Churches\u2019 waiver argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-7\">{\u00b6 84} The Churches have named as additional defendants in the case at bar the previous homeowners and the home builder. Accordingly, this is not a case in which all claims are subject to arbitration resulting in a complete stay or dismissal of all causes of action. In other words, discovery, dispositive motions, and potentially a jury trial can conceivably occur with the remaining defendants. Thus, the expense and necessity of trial preparation will occur regardless of whether the Churches\u2019 claims against DHI are subject to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">{\u00b6 85} The Churches concede that DHI has not invoked the jurisdiction of the court by filing a counterclaim or third-party complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>{\u00b6 86} We cannot say that the Churches have been prejudiced by DHI\u2019s inconsistent acts. This is especially true in light of our decision that the minor child\u2019s claims are not subject to the arbitration provision contained in the preinspection agreement. Undoubtedly, discovery, dispositive motions, and potentially a jury trial will be necessary to resolve those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">{\u00b6 87} Our decision today is based upon the facts presented in this case. This court will continue to closely scrutinize whether a party seeking arbitration has acted inconsistently with the right to arbitrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">{\u00b6 88} Upon review, we find that the trial court\u2019s conclusion from these facts cannot be termed an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">{\u00b6 89} The Churches\u2019 cross-assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">{\u00b6 90} Appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error is affirmed in part and overruled in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">{\u00b6 91} For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Stark County, Ohio, is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and this cause is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-11\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b265-12\">Delaney, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b265-13\">Hoffman, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b265-14\">Hoffman, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AnJ\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-15\">{\u00b6 92} I fully concur in the majority\u2019s thorough and well-reasoned analysis and disposition of appellant\u2019s sole assignment of error. And while I would agree that under the facts of this case, the trial court would not have abused its discretion in rejecting appellees\u2019 argument that DHI waived its right to arbitration, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that we should presume that the trial court did so based upon its failure to expressly rule thereupon.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> While I agree that when a trial court fails to rule on a pretrial motion, it may ordinarily be presumed to have overruled it, such a presumption is not appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>{\u00b6 93} Appellees did not file a pretrial motion requesting a ruling that DHI had waived its right to arbitration; rather, appellees raised the waiver argument in their response to DHI\u2019s request to enforce the arbitration agreement. No express ruling on a pretrial motion was necessary. Furthermore, because the trial court denied DHI\u2019s request to arbitrate on the basis that no evidence of agency existed, it became unnecessary for the trial court to consider appellees\u2019 waiver argument. Accordingly, I would refrain from addressing and deciding the merits of this issue unless and until the trial court is again requested to consider appellees\u2019 waiver argument and given an opportunity to exercise its discretion in ruling thereon.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b265-16\">. I fully concur in the majority\u2019s analysis and conclusion that DHI was not required to file a cross-appeal and that raising the argument via a cross-assignment of error is the proper procedural mechanism to bring the issue before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
