Lamb and Mara V. Lamb, filed April 23, 2007. On December 14, 2005, the Lambs appealed a decision of the Washington Township Board of Zoning Appeals to the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas, and the court affirmed the board\u2019s decision on April 3, 2007. The board had affirmed the decision of the Washington Township zoning inspector that the Lambs\u2019 use of their home as a \u201cnutrition therapy clinic\u201d was not permitted under the Washington Township Zoning Resolution. The zoning inspector determined that Mara was not \u201clegally permitted to operate her nutritionist business from [her] residence since she is required by state law to have a license to be a nutritionist.\u201d Mara is both a licensed dietician and a certified diabetes educator, and she advertised herself in the Yellow Pages as a dietician and listed her home address and phone number. Two members of the board voted to uphold the inspector\u2019s decision, two members voted to overturn it, and one member did not vote; the resolution requires that three of the five members of the board vote against the inspector before his decision can be overturned.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">{\u00b6 2} The resolution defines home occupation as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">{\u00b6 3} \u201cHome Occupation</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cAny occupation conducted in its entirety within a dwelling unit, provided that no person other than members of the family residing on the premises shall be engaged in such occupation and the use of the dwelling unit for the home occupation shall be clearly incidental and subordinate to use for residential purpose by its occupants, provided that:</p>\n<p id=\"b792-11\">{\u00b6 5} \u201cA. Said occupation does not require a state or local license and/or inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-12\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cB. It does not occupy more than two hundred (200) square feet or floor area within the dwelling unit and does not require alteration of the structure.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-13\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cC. There are no displays that will indicate from the exterior that the premises are being used for a non-residential purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>{\u00b6 8} \u201cD. The only mechanical equipment installed or used is that which is normally used for domestic or household purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">{\u00b6 9} The trial court noted that while the Lambs asserted ten assignments of error, \u201conly assignments of error two, three and eight are relevant to determining whether the [board\u2019s] decision was proper * * * albeit all were reviewed by the court.\u201d The court noted that it reviewed the evidence submitted by the Lambs and the zoning inspector as well as testimony from the Lambs\u2019 neighbors, and concluded that the board\u2019s \u201cdecision was supported by a preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence.\u201d The court also determined that the board \u201cdecided that the purpose behind the zoning ordinance was to limit traffic in residential areas.\u201d The court concluded that \u201cthis is a legitimate and rational reason behind the zoning ordinance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">{\u00b6 10} The Lambs assert six assignments of error. We will address the Lambs\u2019 sixth assignment of error first, as doing so renders analysis of the remaining assignments of error moot. It is as follows: \u201cThe court of common pleas\u2019 decision was unreasonable, arbitrary and unconscionable in that it upheld the zoning board\u2019s decision which decision was unsupported by any evidence, much less by a preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence on the whole record, and it was an abuse of discretion of the court of common pleas to affirm the board\u2019s decision on a basis not stated in the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">{\u00b6 11} We first note that in analyzing an administrative appeal, the common pleas court \u201cmay find that the order, adjudication, or decision is unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence on the whole record. Consistent with its findings, the court may affirm, reverse, vacate, or modify the order, adjudication, or decision, or remand the cause to the officer or body appealed from with instructions to enter an order, adjudication, or decision consistent with the findings or opinion of the court. The judgment of the court may be appealed by any party on questions of law as provided in the Rules of Appellate Procedure and, to the extent not in conflict with those rules, Chapter 2505. of the Revised Code.\u201d R.C. 2506.04. The common pleas court \u201cmust weigh the evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Dudukovich v. Lorain Metro. Housing Auth. </em>(1979), 58 Ohio St.2d 202, 12 O.O.3d 198, 389 N.E.2d 1113. \u201cR.C. 2506.04 requires the court to examine the \u2018substantial, reliable and probative evidence on the whole record,\u2019 which in turn necessitates both factual and legal determinations.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">{\u00b6 12} In deciding whether the court correctly applied the standard of review prescribed by R.C. 2506.04, we \u201chave a limited function\u201d to review the common pleas court\u2019s judgment only on questions of law. Id. An appellate court \u201cis to determine only if the trial court has abused its discretion. An abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>discretion \u2018 * * * implies not merely error of judgment, but perversity of will, passion, prejudice, partiality, or moral delinquency.\u2019 <em>State ex rel. Commercial Lovelace Motor Freight, Inc. v. Lancaster </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 191, 193, 22 OBR 275, 277, 489 N.E.2d 288, 290. Absent an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court, a court of appeals must affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.\u201d <em>Lorain City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 257, 261, 533 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">{\u00b6 13} The Lambs argued to the court that the board\u2019s decision was \u201carbitrary and capricious and unsupported by a preponderance of substantial evidence because there was no evidence that appellant was using the property in any way that required a state or local license.\u201d We agree that the conclusion of the board is not supported by substantive, probative, and reliable evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">{\u00b6 14} Jack Kuntz, the zoning inspector, testified before the board that the resolution permits home occupations as accessory uses in the single-family-residential district where the Lambs reside, and he determined that Mara\u2019s use of her home \u201cdid not fit into the definition of a home occupation.\u201d According to Kuntz, to \u201cbe a dietician requires a state license, which is a violation of what the definition states.\u201d He stated that Mara did not have any employees working in her home, that she did not use more than 200 square feet of her home as an office, and that the Lambs did not modify the exterior of their home to accommodate Mara\u2019s office. Kuntz stated that the Lambs did add an additional driveway to the property. He further testified that there was no signage at the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">{\u00b6 15} Bill Lamb testified that Mara in some weeks sees no clients at their home and in other weeks she may see one or two. According to Bill, Mara \u201cdoes that as a service and a convenience to the patients; some of whom live near where we live, some who don\u2019t want to go to a doctor\u2019s office, and there may be other reasons. * * * [S]he does have other offices to go to. She does see other patients. She has an extensive practice elsewhere.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">{\u00b6 16} Mara testified that she is a registered licensed dietician, that she has a master of science degree in nutrition and a bachelor\u2019s degree in dietetics, and that she is also a certified diabetes educator. She stated that she does \u201cmany things,\u201d including consulting at \u201cfacilities for the mentally retarded, for the mentally ill, for assisted care, [and] for nursing homes.\u201d She does \u201cnutritional assessments\u201d on her computer at home and at the facilities. She conducts \u201cwellness programs for a number of organizations; for example, Trotwood Fire Department, the VA Hospital, Dining with Diabetes, and so on.\u201d She is \u201ca lecturer\u201d and a \u201cfull professor,\u201d and she authors educational materials. Mara counsels patients, and she stated that 90 percent of her patients are diabetics. Mara stated, \u201cI see them not as a dietician, but as a certified diabetes educator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Mara further stated as follows: \u201cI have 4 offices. I work with Doctor Westbrock on his weight control program. I see his patients there. I work with Doctor Hughes, who is a radiologist. I see his cancer patients in his office. I work with Doctor Sarwal. I have an office in his office. I am his certified diabetes educator. I work with Doctor Pelfrey. * * * She has an osteoporosis clinic and has asked me to help her patients there. I see patients at various facilities. I am a nutritionist with the Montgomery County Combined Health District. I make home visits. I am also with the Visiting Physicians Association and make home visits.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cThe reason that I meet the criteria for a home occupation is that I am a certified diabetes educator, and I see patients occasionally in my home office just for a convenience, but never more than 4, and I generally try to get them to see me elsewhere. I make a lot of home visits too. I work with a lot of patients who are just not able to get around. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cWhen I do my consulting, I am a dietician, but I do it on the computer. I go to the facilities. When I see diabetics, I am a certified diabetes educator.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">{\u00b6 20} Mara also spoke of the driveway that she and Bill added to then-property as follows: \u201cWhy did we put a driveway in there? Because Bill\u2019s mother did not want to go into a nursing home. She was kicking and screaming. And I said, okay, she can come and live with us. We will put a driveway in. She walks with a walker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">{\u00b6 21} Regarding her Yellow Pages advertisement, Mara stated, \u201cThe reason I have my home address and home occupation the same is that I have so many places that I consult for and that I do work. It\u2019s convenient to have one mailing address. * * * It\u2019s because I have to have a mailing address.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">{\u00b6 22} Finally, Mara stated that she spends 50 percent of her time working outside of her home, and that the majority of her time spent at home involves computer work, \u201creading, writing, faxing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-10\">{\u00b6 28} The following neighbors of the Lambs also testified at the hearing: Mark Bidwell, Leslie Kiefaber, Carol Williams, Angie Bidwell, Mary Rose Pica, Liam Harper, and Fred Husted. Each of them expressed their concerns about a business being operated in their residential neighborhood and the resulting potential for an increase in traffic.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">{\u00b6 24} While the court of common pleas concluded that the board\u2019s decision was supported by a preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence, the court did not point to the evidence upon which it relied. The zoning inspector stated that except for the fact that Mara is a licensed dietician, her home occupation complies with the resolution. The evidence established, however, that when Mara sees clients at her residence, she works as a diabetes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>educator, and she does not need a state or local license to do so. The resolution does not prohibit such an accessory use of the Lambs\u2019 residence. The Lambs\u2019 neighbors\u2019 concern about a potential increase in traffic in their neighborhood is not evidence that Mara\u2019s home occupation violates the resolution. There being an abuse of discretion, the judgment of the court of common pleas is reversed and the matter is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b796-6\">Brogan and Fain, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
