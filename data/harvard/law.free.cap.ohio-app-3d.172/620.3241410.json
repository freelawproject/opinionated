After hearing, but before a decision was rendered, Shields\u2019s counsel filed a notice with the court requesting the court to defer ruling until Shields could present newly discovered evidence. At a subsequent telephone conference, Shields\u2019s attorney Requarth told the court that a witness whom Shields had subpoenaed to the prior hearing, another employee of Englewood, failed to appear because the Englewood city manager had instructed the witness to disobey the subpoena. As a result of this assertion, the trial court scheduled a hearing to take additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">{\u00b6 8} Immediately prior to that hearing to take additional evidence, attorneys Requarth and Deitering admitted that they had misrepresented the reason for the witnesses\u2019s failure to attend the prior hearing, conceding that his failure to appear had been due to their failure to serve the subpoena at his proper address. Englewood moved for sanctions for the frivolous conduct of these attorneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">{\u00b6 9} The trial court entered judgment granting the motion for sanctions, pursuant to R.C. 2323.51, and on the same date, in a separate judgment entry, sustained the decision of the EPAAB to terminate Shields\u2019s employment. After a subsequent hearing, the trial court awarded $4,392.50 in attorney fees to Englewood as a sanction for the frivolous conduct of Requarth and Deitering.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">{\u00b6 10} Appellants have presented ten assignments of error for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">First Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b665-12\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error by considering the administrative record supplied by the City of Englewood in arriving at its decision to uphold the Appellee Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>Second Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court committed plain error in conducting a hearing for the presentation of \u2018additional evidence.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">{\u00b6 13} R.C. 2506.03 provides the procedure that is to be employed by a trial court in conducting an appeal of an administrative decision:</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe hearing of an appeal taken in relation to a final order, adjudication, or decision covered by division (A) of section 2506.01 of the Revised Code shall proceed as in the trial of a civil action, but the court shall be confined to the transcript filed under section 2506.02 of the Revised Code unless it appears, on the face of that transcript or by affidavit filed by the appellant, that one of [five specific exceptions applies.] * * * If any circumstance described in divisions (A)(1) to (5) of this section applies, the court shall hear the appeal upon the transcript and additional evidence as may be introduced by any party. At the hearing, any party may call, as if on cross-examination, any witness who previously gave testimony in opposition to that party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">{\u00b6 15} In his first assignment of error, Shields claims that none of the testimony at the administrative hearing was sworn testimony and that he objected to this procedure at two times during the proceeding. If true, this would constitute an exception under R.C. 2506.03(A)(3) that would permit the court to hear additional evidence. He then argues that as a result, the trial court should not have considered the transcript of the administrative proceeding in any fashion. Englewood suggests that a careful review of the transcript will reveal that neither of Shields\u2019s attorneys ever objected to unsworn testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">{\u00b6 16} The record on appeal does not reflect that any objection was made to unsworn testimony. The objections that were made were directed generally to the procedure for the hearing employed by the EPAAB. Shields\u2019s counsel objected to the time limits placed upon his presentation of evidence and to the board\u2019s refusal to issue subpoenas for witnesses to testify on behalf of Shields. In fact, the only witness who actually testified at the hearing was Shields himself. And the transcript does not reflect that Shields requested to be sworn prior to testifying. It is well accepted that the failure to administer an oath to witnesses in an administrative proceedings is not fatal and that any objection is waived if it is not timely asserted. \u201cIn the event that there is no objection to the admission of unsworn testimony at an administrative hearing, the error of allowing this evidence is waived * * <em>Zurow v. Cleveland </em>(1978), 61 Ohio App.2d 14, 24, 15 O.O.3d 21, 399 N.E.2d 92. The trial court should then consider the unsworn testimony as though it were given under oath. Id. at 24, 15 O.O.3d 21, 399 N.E.2d 92. See, also, <em>Neague v. Worthington City School Dist. </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 433, 702 N.E.2d 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>{\u00b6 17} In his second assignment of error, Shields, conceding that he did not object in the trial court, argues that the taking of additional evidence constituted plain error. He bootstraps this argument to his argument in the first assignment of error, asserting that the result that should have occurred was that there would have been no evidence before the trial court, which thereby would have necessitated a reversal of the administrative decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">{\u00b6 18} Addressing the applicability of the plain-error doctrine to appeals of civil cases, the Supreme Court of Ohio in <em>Goldfuss v. Davidson </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 116, 122-123, 679 N.E.2d 1099, stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c[I]n appeals of civil cases, the plain error doctrine is not favored and may be applied only in the extremely rare case involving exceptional circumstances where error, to which no objection was made at the trial court, seriously affects the basic fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial process, thereby challenging the legitimacy of the underlying judicial process itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">{\u00b6 20} Even assuming, arguendo, that the trial court\u2019s decision was in error, the decision to allow the taking of additional evidence could not reasonably be characterized as seriously affecting the basic fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial process. It would not rise to the level required for the application of the plain-error doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">{\u00b6 21} Because we do not have a transcript of the January 13, 2005 hearing which the additional evidence was taken, we cannot review whether Shields objected in any fashion or whether he took advantage of the opportunity to call and examine witnesses on his own behalf. If he did so, the invited-error doctrine would also apply. See <em>Hal Artz Lincoln-Mercury, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St.3d 20, 28 OBR 83, 502 N.E.2d 590.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-9\">{\u00b6 22} While Shields has filed videotapes and DVDs of the proceedings herein, he has not provided typed or printed portions of those transcripts, as required by App.R. 9(A). Therefore, the lack of a transcript precludes us from reviewing Shields\u2019s specific arguments. App.R. 9(A) provides, \u201cWhen the transcript of proceedings is in the videotape medium, counsel shall type or print those portions of such transcript necessary for the court to determine the questions presented, certify their accuracy, and append such copy of the portions of the transcripts to their briefs.\u201d Without a transcript, we must presume the regularity of the trial court\u2019s proceedings, and Shields\u2019s arguments necessarily fail. <em>Craig v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>Montgomery App. No. 21056, 2006-Ohio-1132, 2006 WL 574398, \u00b6 12-13; <em>State v. Morris, </em>Montgomery App. No. 21125, 2006-Ohio-2129, 2006 WL 1132755, \u00b6 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-10\">{\u00b6 23} In reviewing the record of the administrative proceedings, we note that there are, on the face of that record, deficiencies that would trigger the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>provisions of R.C. 2506.03(A)(2) and (4), which would have allowed the trial court to have conducted a hearing to allow additional evidence. We also note that the trial court\u2019s judgment entry of October 4, 2004, properly found, upon Shields\u2019s motion to supplement the record, that because \u201cShields was not given the opportunity to \u2018offer and examine witnesses\u2019 nor a full opportunity to \u2018[o]ffer evidence to refute evidence and testimony offered in opposition to his position * * * \u2019 that the court would \u2018hear the appeal on the transcript and such additional evidence as may be introduced by any party.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">{\u00b6 24} Because R.C. 2506.03 provides that \u201cthe court shall hear the appeal upon the transcript and additional evidence as may be introduced by any party,\u201d Shields has not demonstrated any error on the part of the trial court. Further, even if it was error, this is not an issue that seriously affects the basic fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial process, and thereby challenges the legitimacy of the underlying judicial process. Accordingly, we find that the first and second assignments of error are not well taken and that they should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Third Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cThe judgment of the trial court is contrary to law in that Appellant was unconstitutionally deprived of his employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-8\">Fifth Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b668-9\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cThe order discharging Appellant is not supported by reliable, substantial, and probative evidence and the judgment of the trial court is thus contrary to law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-10\">{\u00b6 27} Regardless of how Shields has denominated these assignments of error, his argument as to both is that the trial court\u2019s decision is contrary to the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-11\">{\u00b6 28} When reviewing an administrative appeal pursuant to R.C. 2506.04, the trial court considers the \u201cwhole record,\u201d including any new or additional evidence admitted under R.C. 2506.03, and determines whether the administrative order is unconstitutional, illegal, arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or unsupported by the preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence. <em>Sphere Investments Ltd. v. Washington Twp. Bd. of Zoning Appeals, </em>Montgomery App. No. 20733, 2005-Ohio-2518, 2005 WL 1208118, at \u00b6 10. The trial court may \u201caffirm, reverse, vacate, or modify the order * * * or remand the matter to the body appealed from with instructions to enter an order * * * consistent with the findings or opinion of the court.\u201d R.C. 2506.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>{\u00b629} However, the standard of review to be applied by an appellate court in an R.C. 2506.04 appeal is much \u201c \u2018more limited in scope.\u2019 \u201d <em>Henley v. Youngstown Bd. of Zoning Appeals </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 142, 147, 735 N.E.2d 433, quoting <em>Kisil v. Sandusky </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 30, 34, 12 OBR 26, 465 N.E.2d 848. In <em>Henley, </em>the Ohio Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">{\u00b6 30} \u201c \u2018[R.C. 2506.04] grants a more limited power to the court of appeals to review the judgment of the common pleas court only on \u201cquestions of law,\u201d which does not include the same extensive power to weigh \u201cthe preponderance of substantial, reliable, and probative evidence,\u201d as is granted to the common pleas court.\u2019 <em>[Kisil, </em>12 Ohio St.3d at 34, 12 OBR 26, 465 N.E.2d 848], at fn. 4. \u2018It is incumbent on the trial court to examine the evidence. Such is not the charge of the appellate court. * * * The fact that the court of appeals * * * might have arrived at a different conclusion than the administrative agency is immaterial. Appellate courts must not substitute their judgment for those of an administrative agency or a trial court absent the approved criteria for doing so.\u2019 \u201d <em>Henley, </em>90 Ohio St.3d at 147, 735 N.E.2d 433, quoting <em>Lorain City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 257, 261, 533 N.E.2d 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">{\u00b6 31} As explained by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Henley, </em>a question of law is \u201c[a]n issue to be decided by the judge, concerning the application or interpretation of the law.\u201d Id., 90 Ohio St.3d at 148, 735 N.E.2d 433, citing Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (7 Ed.1999) 1260.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">{\u00b6 32} In addition to Shields\u2019s arguments that the evidence does not support the decision of the trial court or the EPAAB, he also suggests that at some time during the proceedings Englewood offered an \u201caltered rationalization\u201d for the discipline of Shields. Shields attempts to hang an argument on a distinction between whether he was allegedly in front of the National City Bank on the date in question to clean or to check a catch basin. However, this appears to be a distinction without a difference. The bottom line is that both factfinders determined that Shields had violated Standard VII of the Rules of Merit Employment of Englewood, which pertains to \u201cproviding untruthful information\u201d as to the events occurring transpiring at the National City Bank on December 5, 2003. This does not constitute an \u201caltered rationalization,\u201d and there is nothing from the record before us that would support a finding that Shields was unconstitutionally deprived of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">{\u00b6 33} This court does not have the ability to review any findings of fact or to weigh any of the evidence. We may only review questions of law upon which the trial court ruled. Accordingly, we find the third and fifth assignments of error to be without merit and overrule them.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>Fourth Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error by prohibiting Appellant from presenting evidence which would have demonstrated that the altered rationalization for his discharge was not reliable, probative and substantial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">{\u00b6 35} For several reasons, we also find the fourth assignment of error to be meritless. Shields argues here that the trial court repeatedly prohibited Shields from testifying as to certain matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">{\u00b6 36} First, because Shields has not provided this court with typed or printed portions of those transcripts from the January 13, 2005 hearing, as required by App.R. 9(A), we are precluded from reviewing Shields\u2019s specific arguments in this respect, and we must presume the regularity of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">{\u00b6 37} Second, the quoted portions of the testimony that Shields now complains of do not reflect that any objections were made to the trial court\u2019s supposed limitations on Shields\u2019s testimony. Evidentiary rulings that are not objected to at trial are waived for purposes of appeal unless the appellant demonstrates plain error. <em>State v. Daoud, </em>Montgomery App. No. 19213, 2003-Ohio-676, 2003 WL 327997.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">{\u00b6 38} Finally, Shields\u2019s argument on this assignment resolves into a discussion of the weight of the evidence and whether there was sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Shields was at the location in question in order to clean or to check a catch basin. We have already determined that this was not an issue in the trial court, and we have also pointed out that we cannot review the findings of fact made by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-9\">{\u00b6 39} Shields\u2019s fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-10\">Sixth Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b670-11\">{\u00b6 40} \u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error by ordering sanctions without conducting a hearing in conformity with ORC \u00a7 2323.51(B)(2)(c).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\">{\u00b6 41} In response to Englewood\u2019s motion for sanctions, the trial court on June 30, 2005, ordered the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b670-13\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c[T]he Motion for Sanctions filed herein by the Defendant on June 21, 2005 will be submitted for decision on July 15, 2005 as of 1:00 p.m. No oral hearing will be conducted unless requested by any party and approved by the Court in which event a definite date and time will be set.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-14\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cAll memoranda and/or affidavits either in support of or in opposition to the motion must be filed by July 07, 2005, with Replies due on or before July 14, 2005, with a copy delivered to the Court not later than twenty four hours prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>the aforesaid date and time for submission unless the Court, upon oral or written request, grants an extension.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">{\u00b6 44} The record does not reflect, and Shields does not argue, that thereafter any request was made for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether attorneys Requarth and Deitering engaged in frivolous conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">{\u00b6 45} As to whether an evidentiary hearing must be conducted, we agree with the analysis contained in <em>McKinney v. Aultman Hasp. </em>(Apr. 27,1992), Stark App. No. CA 8603, 1 992 WL 100451, which states as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">{\u00b6 46} \u201c[T]he subject statute [R.C. 2323.51] does not mandate that a hearing be held but does require that if attorney fees are to be ultimately awarded, then a hearing indeed <em>must have been conducted </em>in accord with subsections (a), (b) and (c) of R.C. 2323.51(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cAdmittedly the statute contains inscrutable language creating conflicting results. However, the Court of Appeals of Summit County has effectively \u2018translated\u2019 (at least in our eyes) it in the following unambiguous format:</p>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">{\u00b6 48} \u201c \u2018When a frivolous conduct motion is filed, pursuant to R.C. 2323.51, the party against whom the motion is directed should be given opportunity to respond, as with any motion. See Civ.R. 8; <em>Ohio Furniture Co. v. Mindala </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 99, 100 [22 OBR 133, 488 N.E.2d 881], footnote 4. <em>If the motion has merit, </em>whether the party against whom it is directed responds or not, then the trial court must set a hearing as provided in R.C. 2323.51(B)(2)(a). Such a hearing date provides an opportunity for each party to submit briefs and evidentiary materials which may support their respective positions. The hearing is not required to be an oral hearing. Whether the hearing is to be conducted on the submitted matters or orally remains discretionary with the trial court.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>McKinney, </em>supra, quoting <em>In re Annexation of 18.23 Acres </em>(Jan. 11, 1989), Summit App. No. 13669, 1989 WL 1643 (George, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">{\u00b6 49} In the instant case, where the alleged conduct occurred in the trial judge\u2019s presence, where counsel had the opportunity to respond to the motion with briefs and by the submission of affidavits or other evidentiary material, and where counsel, after being given the opportunity, failed to request an evidentiary hearing, and where the trial court conducted an oral hearing for the purpose of further argument, we believe it is safe to say that the trial court could proceed to judgment on the issue of whether there was a prima facie showing of frivolous conduct warranting a subsequent hearing on the sanction to be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">{\u00b6 50} We adopt and apply the reasoning of the authorities cited above. R.C. 2323.51 does not mandate that an evidentiary hearing always be conducted to determine whether a particular action involves frivolous conduct, but it does require that if attorney fees are to be ultimately awarded, then a hearing indeed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>must be held in accordance with subsections (a), (b), and (c) of R.C. 2323.51(B)(2). The sixth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Seventh Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cThe fundamental fact found by the trial court used to justify the imposition of sanctions is unsupported by the evidence and is at odds with the trial court\u2019s own stated recollection of the events.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">Eighth Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error by imposing sanctions without providing Ms. Deitering and Ms. Requarth a reasonable opportunity for discovery contrary to the provisions of ORC \u00a7 2323.51.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">{\u00b6 53} Both of these assignments of error are directed to a claim that the trial court\u2019s findings of fact as to what information attorneys Requarth and Deitering conveyed to the trial court during the April 27, 2005 conference call were erroneous. In order to reach this assignment of error, we must first determine that the trial court erred in finding that they did not represent to the court that the absence of a certain witness, an Englewood employee named Riggleman, was due to the actions of Englewood\u2019s city manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">{\u00b6 54} No single standard of review applies in R.C. 2323.51 cases; the inquiry is one of mixed questions of law and fact. Purely legal questions are subject to de novo review. <em>Stuller v. Price, </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-30, 2003-Ohio-6826, 2003 WL 22966820, at \u00b6 14. Review of a trial court\u2019s factual determinations, however, involves some degree of deference, and we will not disturb a trial court\u2019s findings of fact where the record contains competent, credible evidence to support them. <em>Wiltberger v. Davis </em>(1996), 110 Ohio App.3d 46, 673 N.E.2d 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-11\">{\u00b6 55} It is clear that there was controverted evidence before the court as to the import of the telephone conference call between the court and counsel on April 27, 2005. Attorney Requarth\u2019s affidavit filed with the court clearly attempts to cast her representations as informing the court only that she believed, in good faith based upon prior experience, that Riggleman\u2019s absence was due to the acts of Englewood\u2019s city manager. To the contrary, attorney Washington\u2019s affidavit says that the representation made to the court by attorney Requarth was unequivocally that Riggleman did not appear because Englewood\u2019s city manager told him not to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-12\">{\u00b6 56} Particularly telling is a colloquy between the trial court and Deitering at the September 23, 2005 hearing on the issue of whether counsel had engaged in frivolous conduct:</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>{\u00b6 57} \u201cTHE COURT: But you\u2019ll concede that the information, during the phone conversation, was not given to me. That is, I was not told that the belief that Mr. Smith had something to do with Mr. Riggelman\u2019s [sic] failure to appear in January was based upon past experience with Mr. Smith, not upon any personal knowledge about this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cMS. DEITERING: That was not clarified, Your Honor, she did not\u2014 she simply made the one statement and did not go on to explain why it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cTHE COURT: And I understand that, Joyce. But the one that troubles me and that I\u2019m wrestling with is this, and again, the phone conversation was not recorded. We are all who were part of that phone conversation, I am sure, struggling to some extent with the exact words that were said. I will say this, for the record, however, I came away from that hearing \u2014 excuse me \u2014 I came away from that telephone conversation with the impression that Mr. Riggleman had conveyed to you or at least had conveyed to Mr. Shields that he did not appear at the January 13th hearing because Mr. Smith had in some way persuaded him not to.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">{\u00b6 60} At that point, Deitering concedes that the misimpression that was conveyed to the court during the April 27, 2005 telephone conference regarding the reasons for the absence of Riggleman was not cleared up at any time prior to the scheduled June 13, 2005 hearing by either herself or Requarth.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">{\u00b6 61} Therefore, there was competent, credible evidence before the court from which it might have reached either conclusion. Because the statements of attorney Requarth and the actions of attorney Deitering occurred in the presence of the trial court, and because the trial court was in the best position to make this factual determination, we will not disturb this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">{\u00b6 62} Because we find that the trial court made an appropriate factual finding as to the frivolous conduct of counsel, it is immaterial whether attorneys Requarth and Deitering were seeking the court\u2019s forebearance until they could conduct discovery regarding Riggleman\u2019s testimony, or were seeking to reopen the hearing, which the court granted. Frivolous conduct is defined to include \u201cfactual contentions that are not warranted by the evidence.\u201d R.C. 2323.51(A)(2)(iv). Therefore, the misrepresentation of counsel was untrue, and it delayed the case, causing Englewood to incur additional expense and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">{\u00b6 63} The seventh and eighth assignments of error are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">Ninth Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cThe trial court committed prejudicial error by imposing sanctions against Ms. Deitering for her passivity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>{\u00b6 65} In this assignment of error, attorney Deitering argues that she made no statements to the court and, therefore, she cannot be sanctioned for any conduct or statement of her co-counsel, Requarth.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">{\u00b6 66} Clearly, Deitering and Requarth were acting in concert when they moved the court on April 21, 2005, to defer ruling on the matter. Both Deitering and Requarth were a part of the April 27, 2005 telephone conference during which Requarth misrepresented the facts upon which their motion was premised. Deitering did nothing during that conference to correct the misimpression that her co-counsel was advocating.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">{\u00b6 67} The trial court found Deitering\u2019s frivolous conduct to have consisted of \u201cacquiescing in Ms. Requarth\u2019s comment regarding Mr. Smith\u2019s interference when she knew that the comment had no evidentiary support.\u201d Clearly, an attorney who knowingly acquiesces in the active misrepresentation of facts by his or her co-counsel to a court, without clarifying that misrepresentation to the court, can likewise be found to have engaged in frivolous conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">{\u00b6 68} Furthermore, this issue was never raised in the trial court. Deitering argued at the September 28, 2005 hearing on the issue of frivolous conduct on behalf of both Requarth and herself, and did not raise this issue. It is well settled that a nonconstitutional issue raised for the first time on appeal is not properly before a reviewing court. See, e.g., <em>Blausey v. Stein </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 264, 266, 15 O.O.3d 268, 400 N.E.2d 408.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">{\u00b6 69} Appellants\u2019 ninth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-9\">Tenth Assignment of Error</p>\n<p id=\"b674-10\">{\u00b6 70} \u201cThe court committed prejudicial error by awarding attorney fees for services which were not reasonably incurred as the result of the conduct of Deitering and/or Requarth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-11\">{\u00b6 71} In this assignment of error, Deitering and Requarth argue that because their April 21, 2005 motion requested the court to defer ruling only until they could take the deposition of Riggleman, the court should not have ordered the evidence reopened and should not have scheduled the June 9, 2005 hearing. Therefore, they argue that the trial court, in its award of attorney fees, considered expenses that related to other than what they requested in their motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-12\">{\u00b6 72} This argument is of course specious. First, the April 21, 2005 motion, which they have denominated as a \u201cnotice,\u201d asked to present newly discovered evidence. Second, when the court ordered the June 9, 2005 hearing on the matter, Deitering and Requarth raised no objection, and they acquiesced in the procedure to be employed in response to their motion and representations. At no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>time did they attempt to depose or even interview Riggleman prior to the June 9, 2005 hearing, instead electing to simply call him as a witness at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">{\u00b6 73} \u201c[W]here a trial court has found the existence of frivolous conduct, the decision to assess or not to assess a penalty lies within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>Wiltberger, </em>110 Ohio App.3d at 52, 673 N.E.2d 628. Because the appellants have failed to demonstrate an abuse of discretion by the trial court in this regard, we overrule the tenth assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">{\u00b6 74} Having overruled all of Appellants\u2019 assignments of error, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b675-7\">Brogan and Powell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b675-8\">Sumner E. Walters, J., retired, of the Third District Court of Appeals, and Stephen W. Powell, J., of the Twelfth District Court of Appeals, sitting by assignment.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
