The court held that disputed village ordinances are \u201cvalid and enforceable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-13\">{\u00b6 2} Appellants own property in Richmond, Ohio. The Litvas keep horses on their property for breeding, training, and giving riding lessons. Swiger and Rowland raise donkeys, goats, and chickens on their property and use the animals as attractions for their antique shop. When appellants purchased the land, there were no laws or regulations prohibiting property owners from keeping farm animals on their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-14\">{\u00b6 3} Subsequently, a group of citizens in favor of the prohibition of farm animals in the village placed a proposed ordinance on the ballot through an initiative petition. The voters passed the initiative petition on November 6, 2001, Ordinance No. 626, which prohibits \u201cthe keeping, harboring, fencing, penning, pasturing, or stabling of * * * fowl and farm or domesticated animals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b391-15\">{\u00b6 4} Richmond Village Council (\u201cCouncil\u201d) then passed Ordinance No. 505.15 as an enforcement mechanism for Ordinance No. 626. Ordinance No. 505.15 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>permits those who already own farm animals to keep farm animals and requires them to register the animals with the village.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">{\u00b6 5} Appellants filed a complaint asking for damages and a declaration and judicial determination of rights and duties with respect to the enforcement of Ordinance Nos. 626 and 505.15. Appellants claimed that the recently passed legislation caused their farm animal businesses to suffer loss of income in the raising, maintaining, cultivating, breeding, and boarding of their animals.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">{\u00b6 6} Appellants and appellee each filed summary judgment motions. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of appellee, finding that the ordinances are valid and enforceable, and appellants are \u201cpermitted to maintain there [sic] non-conforming use in the manner and to the extent it existed on the effective day\u201d of the passage of the Ordinances. In other words, appellants \u201cmay continue to possess the same number of animals possessed on the effective date of the Ordinances but this right is not limited to the identical animals that were owned at the time.\u201d Appellants filed a timely notice of appeal on June 30, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">{\u00b6 7} Appellants raise two assignments of error, the first of which states:</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cThe court erred in granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment without a hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b392-9\">{\u00b6 9} Appellants contend that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment without a hearing, because they could have presented material evidence in support of their case through testimony and documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-10\">{\u00b6 10} Civ.R. 56(C) states that courts are to consider only \u201cpleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, written admissions, affidavits, transcripts of evidence, and written stipulations of fact\u201d when ruling on summary judgment motions. Therefore, Civ.R. 56(C) does not allow for testimony to be presented in a summary judgment hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-11\">{\u00b6 11} Further, Ohio appellate courts \u201cuniformly agree that a trial court is not required to schedule an oral hearing on every motion for summary judgment.\u201d <em>Hooten v. Safe Auto Ins. Co., </em>100 Ohio St.3d 8, 2003-Ohio-4829, 795 N.E.2d 648, at \u00b6 14. The trial court has discretion in deciding whether to grant a request for an oral hearing. Id. Here, there is no indication that appellants requested an oral hearing. - Thus, even if appellants did request an oral hearing, it would not be mandatory for the trial court to hold one. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in granting summary judgment without a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-12\">{\u00b6 12} Accordingly, appellants\u2019 first assignment of error is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-13\">{\u00b6 13} Appellants\u2019 second assignment of error states:</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe court erred in allowing the village of Richmond to take plaintiffs\u2019 property rights without just compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">{\u00b6 15} Appellants now argue that by \u201cdrastically\u201d restricting the uses of their property without compensation, their land has become less valuable. They contend that the ordinances constitute a taking as prohibited by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. However, they never made this argument in their summary judgment motion. Appellants\u2019 summary judgment argument focused on whether the ordinances were properly passed and whether their enforcement was a valid exercise of police power by appellee. Irrespective, these ordinances did not result in the taking of appellants\u2019 property in that they were not prohibited from using their property as they had in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\"> {\u00b6 16} Both Section 19, Article I of the Ohio Constitution and the Fourteenth and Fifth Amendments to the United States Constitution prohibit the government from taking private property for public use without just compensation. <em>Palazzolo v. Rhode Island </em>(2001), 533 U.S. 606, 617, 121 S.Ct. 2448, 150 L.Ed.2d 592; <em>State ex rel. R.T.G., Inc. v. State, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 1, 2002-Ohio-6716, 780 N.E.2d 998, \u00b6 33. \u201cThe clearest sort of taking occurs when the government encroaches upon or occupies private land for its own proposed use.\u201d <em>Palazzolo, </em>533 U.S. at 617, 121 S.Ct. 2448, 150 L.Ed.2d 592. However, this is not the only type of taking. For instance, governmental regulation of property can sometimes constitute a taking. See <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon </em>(1922), 260 U.S. 393, 43 S.Ct. 158, 67 L.Ed. 322 (\u201c[W]hile property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">{\u00b6 17} Furthermore, Section 3, Article XVIII of the Ohio Constitution grants Ohio municipalities the power to enact local police regulations. \u201cA legislative body may enact legislation declaring that previously lawful activity will thereafter be deemed a nuisance. Such legislation will be upheld against constitutional challenge if it comes within the police power, i.e., if it has a real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals or general welfare of the public and is neither unreasonable nor arbitrary.\u201d <em>Downing v. Cook </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 149, 150, 23 O.O.3d 186, 431 N.E.2d 995, 997. The appellant must demonstrate a \u201cclear and palpable abuse of power\u201d for a reviewing court to substitute its judgment for legislative discretion. <em>State v. Renalist, Inc. </em>(1978), 56 Ohio St.2d 276, 278, 10 O.O.3d 408, 383 N.E.2d 892.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">{\u00b6 18} Here, appellants contend that their properties have effectively been \u201ctaken\u201d because the ordinances have diminished their property values. But as noted above, appellants did not make this argument to the trial court when they moved for summary judgment. Appellate courts will not consider arguments that parties raise or for the first time on appeal. <em>Nasser ex rel. Nasser v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number><em>Orthopaedic Assn. of Youngstown, </em>7th Dist. No. 01-CA-123, 2002-0hio-5208, 2002 WL 31172981, at \u00b6 27. \u201cDespite the fact that appellate courts review summary judgment decisions de novo, \u2018[t]he parties are not given a second chance to raise arguments that they should have raised below.\u2019 \u201d <em>Aubin v. Metzger, </em>3d Dist. No. 1-03-08, 2003-Ohio-5130, 2003 WL 22229400, at \u00b6 10, quoting <em>Smith v. Capriolo </em>(Apr. 11, 2001), 9th Dist. No. 19993, 2001 WL 358387. Accordingly, an appellate court must limit its review of a summary judgment to that which was on record before the trial court. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">{\u00b6 19} Furthermore, appellants have not offered any evidence that the legislation was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unrelated to the general safety and welfare of the public. Also, there was no evidence of a taking because a taking did not occur. The electorate themselves made the determination that farm animals were not wanted in the village, presumably for health and safety reasons. The residents of the village of Richmond decided that it was reasonable and in the best interests of the community to restrict farm animals. There was no evidence that this was an abuse of police powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">{\u00b6 20} Appellants have also not offered any evidence demonstrating that Council clearly and palpably abused its police power when it enacted Ordinance No. 505.15 to enforce Ordinance No. 626. Council passed Ordinance No. 505.15 as an enforcement mechanism and as a way to allow prior farm-animal owners to maintain ownership of farm animals. This was not an abuse of power by Council, but rather an attempt by Council to enforce the wishes of the residents of Richmond. It was also an indication that appellants did not suffer a taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">{\u00b6 21} But even though the ordinances are valid, the trial court\u2019s order puts a further restriction on appellants\u2019 property that the ordinances do not. The ordinances simply require appellants to register their animals with the village. The ordinances did not result in any taking of appellants\u2019 property. The court\u2019s order, however, limits the number of animals appellants may possess on their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">{\u00b6 22} Ordinance No. 505.15(a) provides that \u201c[e]very owner * * * of farm or domesticated animals that are currently kept * * * within the current municipal corporation limits shall register the same with the Village.\u201d Section (b) goes on to provide that the failure of any owner to register his or her animals by a certain date shall be deemed to be a violation of Ordinance No. 626. Nowhere in Ordinance No. 505.15 or 626 does it provide that animal owners are limited to the same number of animals they possessed on the effective date of the ordinances. The trial court added this restriction. On this basis, appellants\u2019 second assignment of error has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>{\u00b623} For the reasons stated above, the trial court\u2019s judgment is hereby affirmed insofar as it held Ordinance Nos. 626 and 501.15 valid and enforceable. These ordinances did not result in the taking of appellants\u2019 property, in that appellants were not prohibited from using their property as they had in the past. The court\u2019s judgment is modified, however, and the part of the judgment that limits appellants to the number of animals appellants possessed on the effective date of the ordinances is hereby vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b395-5\">Waite, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b395-6\">DeGenaro, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b395-7\">DeGenaro, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AEN\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">{\u00b6 24} In their complaint, appellants raise both due-process and takings claims. Both the village and the trial court addressed the due-process claim, but neither addressed appellants\u2019 takings claim. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s order is not a final, appealable order, and we do not have jurisdiction to hear this case. Because the majority deals with this case on its merits, I must respectfully dissent from its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">{\u00b6 25} The parties\u2019 arguments before this court have confused due-process arguments with takings arguments. When dealing with the merits, the majority continues in the same vein. Furthermore, the majority wrongly concludes that these ordinances cannot be a taking because the citizens directly approved of the law through the power of initiative. Legislation enacted by initiative is on the same constitutional footing as legislation enacted by a legislature. If we were to deal with appellants\u2019 takings claims on their merits, we should reverse the trial court\u2019s decision and remand the case for further proceedings because there is a genuine issue regarding whether a taking took place.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">Is There a Taking if the Action is Done Directly by the Electorate?</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">{\u00b6 26} The Ohio Constitution has reserved the powers of initiative and referendum to the people of both the state of Ohio and its municipalities. Section 1(f), Article II, Ohio Constitution. The powers of initiative and referendum are limited to questions that are legislative in nature. <em>State ex rel. DeBrosse v. Cool </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 1, 6, 716 N.E.2d 1114. Accordingly, the constitutional limitations on the legislature\u2019s power to enact laws \u201cshall be deemed limitations on the power of the people to enact laws.\u201d Section 1, Article II, Ohio Constitution. \u201cIf this means anything, it means that a law, even approved by a referendum of the people, must conform to the constitutional test.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Doerfler v. Otis </em>(1918), 98 Ohio St. 83, 105, 120 N.E. 313 (Wanamaker, J. dissenting). Constitutional prohibitions on legislative action reach \u201cany form of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>legislative action, including direct action by the people.\u201d <em>Middletown v. Ferguson </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 71, 76, 25 OBR 125, 495 N.E.2d 380, citing <em>Ross v. Oregon </em>(1913), 227 U.S. 150, 163, 33 S.Ct. 220, 57 L.Ed. 458; see, also, <em>State ex rel. Smith v. Fremont </em>(1927), 116 Ohio St. 469, 478-479, 157 N.E. 318 (local initiatives are subject to the same constitutional limitations as other legislative acts). As a Michigan appellate court has said:</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cA referendum is simply another way to create such municipal legislation. The fact that the municipal legislation was arrived at by a referendum vote does not immunize it from an attack on the basis of its constitutionality or reasonableness. The fact that a majority vote can be obtained on a given subject does not grant a municipality the absolute right to do anything it wishes.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Pulte Land Co., L.L.C. v. Alpine Twp. </em>(Sept. 12, 2006), Mich.App. Nos. 259759 and 261199, 2006 WL 2613450.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">{\u00b6 28} The Ohio Supreme Court has recognized that parties may wish to challenge the constitutionality or legality of the substance of an ordinance passed via initiative, but it requires that these challenges be made after the electorate passes the proposed ordinance. <em>DeBrosse, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 6, 716 N.E.2d 1114. Both state and federal courts in Ohio have routinely dealt with challenges to the constitutionality of a particular initiative or referendum passed by a majority of voters. For example, courts have held that initiatives and referenda passed by the voters cannot unconstitutionally impair a binding contract. <em>Middletown, </em>25 Ohio St.3d at 76, 25 OBR 125, 495 N.E.2d 380; <em>State ex rel. Perona v. Arceci </em>(1998), 129 Ohio App.3d 15, 19, 716 N.E.2d 1181. Likewise, a court can set aside a referendum passed by the voters if the referendum violates the Equal Protection Clause. <em>Arthur v. Toledo </em>(C.A.6, 1986), 782 F.2d 565, 574.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">{\u00b6 29} The majority may somehow believe that takings claims are different from other constitutional claims and that these zoning-type measures passed by voters can never result in such a claim, but this is simply not the case. The plain language of both the United States and Ohio Constitutions prohibits the involuntary appropriation of private property for public use without just compensation. The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that \u201cprivate property [shall not] be taken for public use, without just compensation.\u201d Likewise, Section 19, Article I of the Ohio Constitution requires compensation \u201cwhere private property shall be taken for public use.\u201d These clauses share the \u201ccommon purpose\u201d of ensuring that individuals will not be forced \u201cto bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. United States </em>(1960), 364 U.S. 40, 49, 80 S.Ct. 1563, 4 L.Ed.2d 1554; <em>State ex rel. Horvath v. State Teachers Retirement Bd. </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 67, 70, 697 N.E.2d 644. The Takings Clause \u201cdoes not prohibit the taking of private property, but instead places a condition on the exercise of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>power.\u201d <em>First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. Los Angeles Cty. </em>(1987), 482 U.S. 304, 314, 107 S.Ct. 2378, 96 L.Ed.2d 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">{\u00b6 30} There is nothing within either the United States or Ohio Constitution that excuses providing compensation for the involuntary appropriation of private property for public use as long as the voters themselves directly decide that the property should be appropriated. The Ohio Supreme Court has recognized this when it addressed whether a referendum passed by the voters resulted in a taking. <em>State ex rel. Trafalgar Corp. v. Miami Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>104 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-6406, 819 N.E.2d 1040. The government\u2019s obligation to provide just compensation under the Takings Clause is triggered when an involuntary appropriation of private land for public use occurs; it does not matter who approved the appropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">{\u00b6 31} The majority\u2019s conclusion, if true, would mean that people could have their property taken from them without any compensation at all. For example, the voters in a municipality could decide that a judge should be punished for a particularly unpopular opinion. The voters could then vote to conf\u00edscate that judge\u2019s property in order to establish a park in which would stand a monument designed to vilify the unpopular opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">{\u00b6 32} Such a scenario was put into action recently by people upset with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kelo v. New London </em>(2005), 545 U.S. 469, 125 S.Ct. 2655, 162 L.Ed.2d 439. In that case, the city of New London sought to take property from private property owners in order to give that property to a private developer, so the developer could turn the property into a largely commercial center, which would include a hotel, office space, shopping areas, and new residences. The court reaffirmed the established principle that \u201cthe City would no doubt be forbidden from taking petitioners\u2019 land for the purpose of conferring a private benefit on a particular private party.\u201d Id., 545 U.S. at 477, 125 S.Ct.2661, 162 L.Ed.2d 439. Nevertheless, the court afforded \u201clegislatures broad latitude in determining what public needs justify the use of the takings power.\u201d Id. at 483, 125 S.Ct. 2655, 162 L.Ed.2d 439. The court held that the use in this case was a public use, despite the fact that the property was being immediately transferred to a private developer, because the plan was \u201ccarefully formulated\u201d to \u201cprovide appreciable benefits to the community, including \u2014 but by no means limited to \u2014 new jobs and increased tax revenue.\u201d Id. When reaching this conclusion, the court refused to second-guess the city\u2019s considered judgments about both the efficacy of its development plan and what lands it needs to acquire in order to effectuate the project. Id. at 488-490, 125 S.Ct. 2655, 162 L.Ed.2d 439.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">{\u00b6 33} After that decision, a group tried to have the home of Justice David Souter, a justice who was in the <em>Kelo </em>majority, taken and turned into a hotel as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>reprisal for his role in the <em>Kelo </em>decision. See Lost Liberty Hotel \u2014 Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (April 19, 2007), http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Liberty_ Hotel. Over a year after <em>Kelo </em>was decided, the group was actively trying to have a local municipality take the homes of justices who voted in the <em>Kelo </em>majority. See Freestar Media, LLC (April 19, 2007), http://www.freestarmedia.com. Ultimately, the group has not, as of yet, convinced an electorate to appropriate the homes of the justices. However, the fact that this group has so far failed to take property in retribution for a judicial decision does not mean that some other group in the future may not be successful in doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">{\u00b6 34} Under such a scenario, the electorate could decide, via initiative, to directly take a judge\u2019s home. This action, according to the majority\u2019s rationale, would not be a taking. Such a scenario could face anyone or any group (such as, potentially, the appellants in this case) that goes against the popular will if the majority\u2019s proposition were true. And while populism is one of the principles informing our system of democratic government, the Ohio and United States Constitutions prevent this kind of direct populist repression of an unpopular individual or minority group. \u201c[T]he power granted to American courts to pronounce on the unconstitutionality of laws still forms one of the most powerful barriers that has ever been raised * * * \u201d to protect against the so called \u201ctyranny of the majority.\u201d Alex de Tocqueville, Democracy in America (2002 Ed.) 98, 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Taking vs. Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">{\u00b6 35} Although the majority\u2019s conclusion that an involuntary appropriation of private property for government use is not a taking if it is accomplished directly by the electorate is incorrect, this is not the sole way in which the majority opinion is contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">{\u00b6 36} The majority discusses whether \u201cthe legislation was unreasonable, arbitrary, or unrelated to the general safety and welfare of the public\u201d or an abuse of the village\u2019s \u201cpolice power\u201d when discussing whether the ordinances constituted a taking. Opinion at \u00b6 18-19. The majority is presumably engaging in this discussion in order to address whether the application of the ordinances to the particular property at issue in this case is constitutionally invalid. In <em>State ex rel. Shemo v. Mayfield Hts. </em>(2002), 95 Ohio St.3d 59, 63, 765 N.E.2d 345, the Ohio Supreme Court, relying on United States Supreme Court precedent, stated that a compensable regulatory taking can occur <em>\u201ceither </em>if the application of the zoning ordinance to the particular property is constitutionally invalid, i.e., it does not substantially advance legitimate state interests, <em>or </em>denies the landowner all economically viable use of the land.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">{\u00b6 37} <em>Shemo </em>made it clear that the \u201csubstantially advances\u201d test was not the only way to tell whether a particular action was a taking. Id. For instance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>courts have recognized that governmental regulation can act as a taking if that regulation \u201cgoes too far.\u201d <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon </em>(1922), 260 U.S. 393, 415, 43 S.Ct. 158, 67 L.Ed. 322. In <em>Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc. </em>(2005), 544 U.S. 528, 125 S.Ct. 2074, 161 L.Ed.2d 876, the United States Supreme Court clarified that there are \u201ctwo categories of regulatory action that generally will be deemed <em>per se </em>takings for <em>Fifth Amendment </em>purposes. First, where government requires an owner to suffer a permanent physical invasion of her property\u2014 however minor \u2014 it must provide just compensation. A second categorical rule applies to regulations that completely deprive an owner of <em>\u2018all </em>economically beneficial use\u2019 of her property.\u201d (Emphasis sic. and citations omitted). Id. at 538, 125 S.Ct. 2074, 161 L.Ed.2d 876, quoting <em>Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council </em>(1992), 505 U.S. 1003, 1019, 112 S.Ct. 2886, 120 L.Ed.2d 798. There is also a third category of regulatory taking, which is governed by <em>Penn Cent. Transp. Co. v. New York City </em>(1978), 438 U.S. 104, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 57 L.Ed.2d 631. Under <em>Penn Cent., </em>courts must conduct an ad hoc examination of the following three factors when determining whether a partial regulatory taking occurred: (1) the economic impact on the landowner, (2) the extent the regulation has interfered with reasonable investment-backed expectations, and (3) the character of government action. <em>Penn Cent., </em>438 U.S. at 124, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 57 L.Ed.2d 631; <em>State ex rel. Horvath v. State Teachers Retirement Bd. </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 67, 71, 697 N.E.2d 644. \u201cThe <em>Penn Central </em>factors \u2014 though each has given rise to vexing subsidiary questions \u2014 have served as the principal guidelines for resolving regulatory takings claims that do not fall within the [two categories of per se regulatory takings].\u201d <em>Lingle, 544 U.S. at </em>539, 125 S.Ct. 2074, 161 L.Ed.2d 876. Each of these inquiries \u201caims to identify regulatory actions that are functionally equivalent to the classic taking in which government directly appropriates private property or ousts the owner from his domain.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">{\u00b6 38} Moreover, <em>Lingle </em>held that the \u201csubstantially advances\u201d test is not a takings test at all. Id. at 540-542, 125 S.Ct. 2074, 161 L.Ed.2d 876. \u201c[T]his formula prescribes an inquiry in the nature of a due process, not a takings, test, and * * * it has no proper place in our takings jurisprudence\u201d because it \u201creveals nothing about the <em>magnitude or character of the burden </em>a particular regulation imposes upon private property rights. Nor does it provide any information about how any regulatory burden is <em>distributed </em>among property owners. In consequence, this test does not help to identify those regulations whose effects are functionally comparable to government appropriation or invasion of private property; it is tethered neither to the text of the <em>Takings Clause </em>nor to the basic justification for allowing regulatory actions to be challenged under the Clause.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>{\u00b6 39} The issue of whether the ordinances in question were otherwise lawful has nothing to do with whether they constitute a taking for which appellants should be compensated; instead, this issue deals with whether the ordinances violate due process. Appellants have not argued a due-process claim in this appeal; instead, their argument on appeal deals solely with whether they are owed compensation under the Takings Clause. Thus, we should disregard any argument dealing with whether the ordinance substantially advances legitimate state interests when addressing appellants\u2019 takings argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Final Appealable Order</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">{\u00b6 40} This brings us to the procedural issues presented by the record. It is reasonably clear that appellants pleaded a cause of action seeking a declaration that a taking took place. Ohio is a notice-pleading state. <em>York v. Ohio State Highway Patrol </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 143, 144, 573 N.E.2d 1063. Civ.R. 8(A) requires only that a complaint \u201ccontain (1) a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the party is entitled to relief, and (2) a demand for judgment for the relief to which the party claims to be entitled.\u201d Under this rule, \u201ca plaintiff is not required to prove his or her case at the pleading stage,\u201d and the complaint is sufficient \u201cas long as there is a set of facts, consistent with the plaintiffs complaint, which would allow the plaintiff to recover.\u201d <em>York, </em>60 Ohio St.3d at 145, 573 N.E.2d 1063.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">{\u00b6 41} Appellants\u2019 complaint states that the ordinances in question prevent them from operating the business they were formerly allowed to operate and that, as a result, they \u201chave suffered great pecuniary loss of income.\u201d They sought a declaration \u201cas to their rights\u201d in respect to the ordinances. Under a notice-pleading regimen, this is sufficient to take a claim for a declaration that a taking has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">{\u00b6 42} It is worthwhile to note that appellants asked for damages as well, but could not receive compensation for the taking in this case. \u201cMandamus is the appropriate action to compel public authorities to institute appropriation proceedings where an involuntary taking of private property is alleged.\u201d <em>Shemo, </em>95 Ohio St.3d at 63, 765 N.E.2d 345.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">{\u00b6 43} Despite the fact that appellants pleaded this takings claim, the village\u2019s motion for summary judgment did not ask the trial court to decide this claim. The village\u2019s motion was based solely on whether the ordinances were a proper exercise of its police powers, i.e., whether the ordinances had \u201ca real and substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare of the public and is neither unreasonable nor arbitrary.\u201d The village argued that the ordinances were not \u201ca clear and palpable abuse of power\u201d and urged the trial court to conclude that the appellants \u201cwould be permitted to continue to have farm animals\u201d in a particular number.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>{\u00b6 44} The trial court granted the village precisely the relief it sought. It concluded that the ordinances were \u201cvalid and enforceable\u201d and concluded that those ordinances limited appellants to keeping the same number of animals on their property as were kept at the date that the ordinances became effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">{\u00b6 45} Our appellate jurisdiction is limited to the review of final orders, judgments, and decrees. Section 3(B)(2), Article IV, Ohio Constitution; R.C. 2505.03. R.C. 2505.02(B)(1) provides that an order is final if it \u201caffects a substantial right in an action that in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment.\u201d However, Civ.R. 54(B) states that such an order is not appealable if \u201cmore than one claim for relief is presented in an action\u201d and the order only enters \u201cjudgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims\u201d unless the trial court expressly determines \u201cthat there is no just reason for delay.\u201d See, also, <em>Chef Italiano Corp. v. Kent State Univ. </em>(1989), 44 Ohio St.3d 86, 88, 541 N.E.2d 64 (a final order must comply with Civ.R. 54(B)).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">{\u00b6 46} In this case, it appears fairly clear that the trial court did not grant judgment on appellants\u2019 taking claims. Its judgment addresses whether the ordinances are valid and enforceable, an issue that is irrelevant in a takings action. Furthermore, the trial court granted the village exactly the relief it requested in its motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, it appears that appellants\u2019 takings claim is still pending before the trial court. Because the trial court did not find that there is no just reason for delay, its judgment is not final and appealable, and we do not have the jurisdiction to review its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">{\u00b6 47} The majority avoids this conclusion by arguing that appellants have waived their takings arguments by not asking the trial court for summary judgment on those claims. This is an odd conclusion because parties are, after all, entitled to move for partial summary judgment and are not required to argue all of their claims in a motion for summary judgment. I fail to see how a party\u2019s failure to seek summary judgment on a claim affects whether we have jurisdiction over a nonfinal, appealable decision addressing that party\u2019s other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">Merits of Takings Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">{\u00b6 48} Finally, even if the trial court had addressed the merits of appellants\u2019 takings claim, it acted improperly by denying that claim at this point in the litigation. In a declaratory judgment action, courts determine facts \u201cin the same manner as issues of fact are tried and determined in other civil actions in the court in which the action or proceeding is pending.\u201d R.C. 2721.10. Some declaratory judgment actions are decided pursuant to a motion to dismiss under Civ.R. 12(B)(6). See, e.g., <em>Stacy v. Gains, </em>7th Dist. No. 03 MA 193, 2004-Ohio-7213, 2004 WL 3090231. Others are dealt with under Civ.R. 56(B), which allows motions for summary judgment in cases seeking a declaratory judgment. See, e.g., <em>Am. Mfr. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Kurtz, </em>7th Dist. No. 04 MA 53, 2005-Ohio-6452, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>2005 WL 3293813. However, declaratory judgment actions must be tried to a court or jury when they cannot be otherwise resolved. <em>Erie Ins. Group v. Fisher </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 380, 381, 15 OBR 497, 474 N.E.2d 320.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">{\u00b6 49} The evidence in the record on this claim demonstrates that there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether appellants are owed compensation for a taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">{\u00b6 50} Appellants\u2019 takings claim is based on neither of the two per se regulatory takings categories. Instead, their claim focuses on whether the ordinances are a regulatory taking under <em>Penn Cent. </em>To reiterate, <em>Penn Cent. </em>outlines three factors that courts must consider when determining whether a partial regulatory taking occurred: (1) the economic impact on the landowner, (2) the extent the regulation has interfered with reasonable investment-backed expectations, and (3) the character of government action. Id. at 124, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 57 L.Ed.2d 631.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">{\u00b6 51} In its opinion, the majority correctly notes that there is no numerical limit within the ordinance on the animals kept in the village by people who kept animals in the village prior to the ordinances\u2019 passage. This could lead to the conclusion that there is no limit on the appellants\u2019 ability to keep animals in the village. However, such a conclusion ignores the fact that there is a temporal limit within the ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">{\u00b6 52} Ordinance No. 626 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">{\u00b6 53} \u201cNo person, firm or corporation shall permit the keeping, harboring, fencing, penning, pasturing or stabling of horses, cattle, mules, swine, sheep, goats, donkeys, geese, ducks, chickens and other fowl and farm or domesticated animals with the exception of rabbits, dogs and domesticated cats, within the corporation limits of the Village of Richmond.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cFor the purposes of this Ordinance, the term \u2018farm or domesticated animal\u2019 shall include any and all animals which can or are normally kept or raised for food and/or profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-11\">{\u00b6 55} \u201cWhoever violates this Ordinance shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree and shall be punished by a fine of up to two hundred and fifty dollars ($250.00) and/or up to thirty (30) days in jail. Each day a violation of this Ordinance occurs shall be considered a separate offense and may be charged as such. A second violation of this Ordinance by the same person, firm, corporation, or entity shall be a misdemeanor of the third degree and shall be punished by a fine of up to five hundred dollars ($500.00) and/or up to sixty (60) days in jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-12\">{\u00b6 56} Ordinance No. 505.15 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>{\u00b6 57} \u201c(a) Every owner, keeper and/or harborer of horses, cattle, mules, swine, sheep, goats, donkeys, geese, ducks, chickens and other fowl and farm or domesticated animals that are currently kept, harbored, fenced, penned, pastured, stabled or otherwise kept within the municipal corporation limits shall register the same with the Village on or before June 15, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">{\u00b6 58} \u201c(b) Failure of any owner, keeper and/or harborer of horses, cattle, mules, swine, sheep, goats, donkeys, geese, ducks, chickens and other fowl and farm or domesticated animals that are currently kept, harbored, fenced, penned, pastured, stabled or otherwise kept within the municipal corporation limits on or before June 15, 2002, shall be deemed to be in violation of [Ordinance No. 626].</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">{\u00b6 59} \u201c(c) No person shall fail to, or falsely or fraudulently register any animal that is required to be registered pursuant to [Ordinance No. 626].</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">{\u00b6 60} \u201c(d) Whoever violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. Each day a violation of this ordinance occurs shall constitute a separate and distinct offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">{\u00b6 61} When these ordinances are read in pari materia, it is clear that possession of an animal registered under Ordinance No. 505.15 will not result in a violation of Ordinance No. 626. Furthermore, it is clear that there is a limit on the animals that can be grandfathered under Ordinance No. 505.15. Under the plain language of that ordinance, the animals covered by the ordinance must be registered \u201con or before June 15, 2002.\u201d Possession of any animal not registered by that date \u201cshall be deemed\u201d to be a violation of Ordinance No. 626. Thus, under the plain language of these ordinances, only the animals kept and registered in the village on or before June 15, 2002, will be allowed to remain in the village without violating Ordinance No. 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-9\">{\u00b6 62} If this conclusion were in any doubt, such doubt would be resolved by the preamble to the resolution adopting Ordinance No. 505.15, which recognized that the village may not be able to prohibit the keeping of any animal in the village that was kept before Ordinance No. 626 was enacted. The preamble specifically stated the intent to specifically grandfather \u201cthose animals\u201d kept in the village prior to its passage in order to clarify that keeping those animals in the village would not violate Ordinance No. 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-10\">{\u00b6 68} In plain language, this means that the ordinances allow appellants to keep the animals they registered by June 15, 2002, within the village limits, but not allow appellants to keep any new animal, other than rabbits, dogs, or domesticated cats, within the village limits after that date. Appellants introduced evidence showing that their businesses depend on their ability to raise and board animals, both now and in the future. Accordingly, these ordinances clearly have some economic impact on appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>{\u00b6 64} What is unclear at this time is the extent of the economic impact this has on appellants. For example, in their motion and appellate brief, appellants claim that one couple has suffered losses of around $2,000 per month while the other couple has suffered losses of around $1,120 per month. However, this claim is not supported by the affidavits attached to the motion for summary judgment or any other evidentiary material. Furthermore, it is unclear the extent to which these purported losses actually affect appellants economically.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">{\u00b6 65} Likewise, there is some evidence in the record showing that the ordinances have interfered with appellants\u2019 reasonable investment-backed expectations. For instance, one affidavit stated that a couple bought property in the village specifically to raise, train, and house horses and invested \u201cthousands of dollars\u201d in the property. However, there is no clear evidence establishing whether this investment will have been a complete waste due to the passage of these ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">{\u00b6 66} Given these factual uncertainties, the trial court could not have terminated this case at this stage in the proceedings. The evidence in the record is simply insufficient to conclusively determine whether a taking has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">{\u00b6 67} The majority rejects appellants\u2019 takings arguments by concluding that an action cannot be a taking if it is done directly by the voters, rather than by a legislative body. This conclusion is contrary to established Ohio Supreme Court case law placing legislation enacted by initiative on the same constitutional footing as legislation enacted by a legislature. Moreover, the majority uses due-process analysis when dealing with appellants\u2019 takings arguments. Accordingly, I must respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">{\u00b6 68} In this case, the trial court\u2019s order did not address the takings claim raised by appellants in their complaint. Accordingly, its judgment is not a final, appealable order, and this appeal must be dismissed for a lack of jurisdiction. Furthermore, the trial court\u2019s decision should be reversed and this case remanded for further proceedings if its order had addressed the takings claim, because there is a genuine issue regarding whether a taking has occurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
