The Thompsons had been hosting this annual celebration since the early to mid 1990s, and appellant attended each year. Several other guests were invited to the annual parties, and on this occasion, nearly 100 guests attended.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-11\">{\u00b6 3} In 1995, the Thompsons had purchased a large circular trampoline from Biggie, Inc., and they placed it in their backyard.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They allowed their guests to use the trampoline during their annual Independence Day parties. Adults would typically use the trampoline only in the evening, while children would use the trampoline throughout the afternoon. The first time appellant had ever used a trampoline was during one of these parties. Thereafter, from 1995 to 2000, appellant used the trampoline at each Independence Day party, and on each occasion, she would do so with other adults.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-12\">{\u00b6 4} On the date of the accident, appellant arrived at the Thompsons\u2019 home at approximately 3:00 p.m. She consumed at least one alcoholic beverage, a vodka <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>cocktail, during the party. Although the Thompsons advised their guests to bring their own alcoholic beverages if they wished to drink at the party, Mr. Thompson later provided his guests, including appellant, with a \u201ctest tube\u201d containing a sample of the alcoholic beverage \u201csex on the beach.\u201d Appellant consumed at least one test-tube sample of this beverage at approximately 10:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">{\u00b6 5} At approximately 11:00 p.m., appellant decided to use the trampoline, as she had at previous parties. Appellant climbed upon the trampoline with four other guests. The group then walked around the trampoline until one person began to jump in the middle. Appellant and the three other participants then moved to the perimeter of the trampoline, though still on the mat\u2019s surface, and waited for a turn to jump in the middle. As she stood on the perimeter, appellant bounced approximately six inches in the air as a result of the person jumping in the middle. At some point during these activities, appellant\u2019s brother, Rodney Moran, proceeded to the middle of the trampoline for a turn to jump. As he proceeded to jump, however, appellant lost her balance and fell on her back. She sustained a broken neck and crushed spinal cord as a result, rendering her quadriplegic.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">{\u00b6 6} On February 22, 2002, appellant filed the instant personal-injury action, alleging strict-products-liability claims against Biggie and ADTEC and negligence claims against the Thompsons.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On April 25, 2006, by way of separate entries, the trial court granted summary judgment in favor of all appellees. With respect to Biggie and ADTEC, the court determined that the dangers presented by the subject trampoline were open and obvious and a matter of common knowledge. Therefore, the court determined that no duty was owed to appellant. Similarly, with respect to the Thompsons, the court determined that the dangers associated with trampoline use were open and obvious such that appellant was owed no duty. The court further found that appellant assumed the inherent risks associated with trampoline use and that the record did not support a finding of recklessness on the part of the Thompsons to impose liability upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">{\u00b6 7} Appellant now appeals the trial court\u2019s decision, raising three assignments of error. In addition, the Thompsons raise a single cross-assignment of error pursuant to R.C. 2505.22.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">{\u00b6 8} Appellant\u2019s Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>{\u00b6 9} \u201cThe trial court erred in granting [appellees\u2019] motions for summary judgment because a genuine issue of material fact remains as to whether the dangers associated with trampoline use were open and obvious to [appellant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">{\u00b6 10} In her first assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to all appellees based upon the premise that the dangers associated with trampoline use are open and obvious. Appellant contends that issues of fact exist as to whether the particular dangers created by more than one person bouncing on the trampoline at one time and the presence of more than 225 pounds on the trampoline at one time are open and obvious. We find merit in appellant\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">{\u00b6 11} On appeal, a trial court\u2019s decision granting summary judgment is reviewed de novo. <em>Burgess v. Tackas </em>(1998), 125 Ohio App.3d 294, 296, 708 N.E.2d 285. Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue of material fact remaining for trial, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and reasonable minds can only come to a conclusion adverse to the nonmoving party, construing the evidence most strongly in that party\u2019s favor. See Civ.R. 56(C); see, also, <em>Harless v. Willis Day Warehousing Co. </em>(1978), 54 Ohio St.2d 64, 66, 8 O.O.3d 73, 375 N.E.2d 46. The movant bears the initial burden of informing the court of the basis for the motion and demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 293, 662 N.E.2d 264. Once this burden is met, the nonmovant has a reciprocal burden to set forth specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-7\">{\u00b6 12} In this case, appellant alleges strict products liability against Biggie and ADTEC and negligence against the Thompsons for failing to warn her of specific dangers associated with the trampoline. The trial court granted summary judgment to all appellees based upon the open-and-obvious nature of the dangers posed by trampoline use. We begin our analysis by addressing the open-and-obvious doctrine as it applies to appellant\u2019s products-liability claim against Biggie and ADTEC.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-8\">1. Products Liability</p>\n<p id=\"b271-9\">{\u00b6 13} Appellant\u2019s products-liability claim is premised upon a warning deficiency with respect to the subject trampoline. As an initial matter, appellant seeks to recover against Biggie and ADTEC pursuant to R.C. 2307.73 because the manufacturer of the trampoline has since dissolved and is not subject to judicial process.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Neither ADTEC nor Biggie disputes appellant\u2019s claim in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>regard. Accordingly, we apply R.C. 2307.73 in determining whether summary judgment is warranted as to appellant\u2019s failure-to-warn claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cTo recover compensatory damages for a strict products liability claim based on a warning defect, [the plaintiff] must establish that [the defendants\u2019 product] was \u2018defective due to inadequate warning or instruction\u2019 and that this defect was the proximate cause of [the plaintiffs] injuries.\u201d <em>McConnell v. Cosco, Inc. </em>(S.D.Ohio 2003), 238 F.Supp.2d 970, 976, citing R.C. 2307.73(A). Under R.C. 2307.76(A)(1), \u201ca product is defective due to inadequate warning or instruction * * * at the time of marketing if, when it left the control of its manufacturer, both of the following applied: (a) [t]he manufacturer knew or, in the exercise of reasonable care, should have known about a risk that is associated with the product and that allegedly caused harm for which the claimant seeks to recover compensatory damages; (b) [t]he manufacturer failed to provide the warning or instruction that a manufacturer exercising reasonable care would have provided concerning that risk, in light of the likelihood that the product would cause harm of the type for which the claimant seeks to recover compensatory damages and in light of the likely seriousness of that harm. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">{\u00b6 15} Nevertheless, \u201c[a] product is not defective due to lack of warning or instruction or inadequate warning or instruction as a result of the failure of its manufacturer to warn or instruct about an open and obvious risk or a risk that is a matter of common knowledge.\u201d R.C. 2307.76(B). In other words, a defendant\u2019s statutory duty to warn is obviated when the dangerous condition causing injury to the plaintiff is open and obvious or commonly known. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-7\">{\u00b6 16} In considering whether a product presents an open-and-obvious risk, it is necessary to determine whether the particular hazard giving rise to the subject injury was obvious or commonly known. See, e.g., <em>McConnell </em>at 978; see, also, <em>Cervelli v. Thompson/Center Arms </em>(S.D.Ohio 2002), 183 F.Supp.2d 1032, 1042. For example, in <em>McConnell, </em>the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, applying Ohio products-liability law, denied a highchair manufacturer\u2019s summary-judgment motion when issues of fact remained as to whether the risk of strangulation was an obvious risk or a matter of common knowledge associated with the use of a highchair. See <em>McConnell. </em>In doing so, the court explained that while it may be commonly known that a child may fall out of a highchair and sustain injury if not properly attended and strapped into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>the chair, there was no evidence indicating as such with respect to the risk of a child being strangled by the tray of the highchair when attempting to slide out of the highchair. See id.; see, also, <em>Cervelli </em>(holding that the danger of a shooter being injured when firing a rifle, due to a mechanical wearing down of the threads that could cause the nipple to eject and become a dangerous projectile, was not open and obvious).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">{\u00b6 17} Here, Biggie and ADTEC argue that the dangers associated \"with the trampoline were open and obvious because appellant had used the trampoline on prior occasions, had used the trampoline while other people were on it, and testified that she had never read any of the warnings on the trampoline or asked the Thompsons about the dangers of its use. As well-summarized by the trial court, the facts demonstrate that appellant was in fact aware of various dynamics of the trampoline at the time she decided to use it on the evening in question. Specifically, appellant was aware of the instability of the surface, especially when more than one person was on the trampoline at one time. Further, appellant was aware of the rebound effect created when one person jumped in the middle of the trampoline while she stood on the perimeter. Appellant acknowledged that she could lose her balance and fall while participating in the activity of jumping on the trampoline.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">{\u00b6 18} In addition to the foregoing, however, appellant also testified she did not know that multiple people bouncing on the trampoline at a given time created the particular risk of a \u201cdouble bounce,\u201d which could project her out of control even though she was only standing on the perimeter of the trampoline \u201clightly\u201d bouncing. Further, appellant testified that she did not know that the presence of more than 225 pounds on a trampoline at a given time created the particular risk of the trampoline surface transforming from a flexible, forgiving surface into a hard, inflexible surface. Rather, appellant thought that if she fell on the trampoline, she would be falling on a flexible, forgiving surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">{\u00b6 19} Appellant testified that she was never warned about these conditions and never saw a warning on the apparatus itself. Significantly, appellant presented expert evidence indicating that these particular hazards are not commonly known to most people who use trampolines. In fact, other participants who used the trampoline on the evening in question testified that they were unaware that these conditions existed. Appellant\u2019s experts opined that only through instruction or adequate warning would these conditions become known, and in this particular case, opined that neither was given to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">{\u00b6 20} The trial court, noting the absence of Ohio Supreme Court precedent discussing trampoline injuries,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> cited the Illinois Supreme Court case <em>Sollami v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number><em>Eaton </em>(2002), 201 Ill.2d 1, 265 Ill.Dec. 177, 772 N.E.2d 215, in finding the dangers of trampoline use to be open and obvious.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We find <em>Sollami </em>to be distinguishable, however, because it does not address the instant hazards involving the unexpected transformation of the trampoline surface or loss of control due to a double bounce when the claimant is only standing and/or lightly bouncing on the perimeter of the trampoline. Moreover, unlike the claimant in <em>Sollami, </em>appellant was not \u201crocket jumping,\u201d the dangers of which the Illinois Supreme Court found that a reasonable user would appreciate. Rather, here, appellant testified that she was only standing on the perimeter, being lightly bounced approximately six inches in the air in response to the middle jumper, at the time she fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">{\u00b6 21} Based upon the specific facts and evidence presented in this case, and construing the evidence in a light most favorable to appellant, we find that there are issues of fact concerning whether the particular hazards identified above were commonly known, notwithstanding the general knowledge that appellant admittedly had regarding the use of a trampoline and the usual risks it posed through its normal properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">2. Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">{\u00b6 22} Appellant\u2019s negligence claim against the Thompsons is based upon premises liability. Specifically, appellant alleges that she was a social guest of the Thompsons, to whom the Thompsons owed a duty to exercise ordinary care not to cause her injury by any of their own acts or by any activities carried on by them and to warn her of any condition on the premises of which they knew and which one of ordinary prudence and foresight in their position should have reasonably considered dangerous, if they had reason to believe appellant did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>know and would not discover such a dangerous condition. See <em>Karlovich v. Nicholson </em>(Sept. 30, 1999), Lake App. No. 98-L-097, 1999 WL 960583, \u00b64. Appellant argues that the trial court erred in finding that the dangers associated with trampoline use were open and obvious such that the Thompsons had no duty to warn appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">{\u00b6 23} The open-and-obvious doctrine concerns the first element of a negligence claim, namely, whether a duty exists. See <em>Armstrong v. Best Buy Co., Inc., </em>99 Ohio St.3d 79, 2003-Ohio-2573, 788 N.E.2d 1088, \u00b6 14. \u201cWhere a danger is open and obvious, a landowner owes no duty * * * to individuals lawfully on the premises.\u201d Id. \u201cThe rationale behind the * * * doctrine is that the open- and-obvious nature of the hazard itself serves as a warning.\u201d <em>Olivier v. Leaf Vine, </em>Miami App. No. 2004 CA 35, 2005-Ohio-1910, 2005 WL 937928, \u00b6 21, citing <em>Henry v. Dollar Gen. Store, </em>Greene App. No. 2002-CA-47, 2003-Ohio-206, 2003 WL 139773, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">{\u00b6 24} Open-and-obvious hazards are those hazards that are not concealed and are discoverable by ordinary inspection. <em>Parsons v. Lawson Co. </em>(1989), 57 Ohio App.3d 49, 50-51, 566 N.E.2d 698. A dangerous condition does not actually have to be observed by the claimant to be an open-and-obvious condition under the law. <em>Colvin v. Kroger Co., </em>Madison App. No. CA2005-07026, 2006-Ohio-1151, 2006 WL 589381, \u00b6 11; <em>Lydic v. Lowe\u2019s Cos., Inc., </em>Franklin App. No. 01AP-1432, 2002-Ohio-5001, 2002 WL 31111820, \u00b6 10. Rather, the determinative issue is whether the condition is observable. Id. This determination \u201cdepends upon the particular circumstances surrounding the hazard.\u201d <em>Olivier </em>at \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">{\u00b6 25} The Thompsons argue that they owed no duty to appellant because appellant acknowledged that she was aware of the dynamics of the trampoline. As stated, appellant testified that she had used the trampoline on prior occasions and that she knew that the surface was unstable to walk upon, knew that she could fall, and knew that more than one person on the trampoline put her off balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">{\u00b6 26} Appellant also testified, however, that she did not know that excess weight on the trampoline made the surface stretch so that it was transformed into a hard, inflexible surface. She also testified that she did not know that standing on the perimeter of the trampoline while a person jumped in the middle of the trampoline created a double bounce that could propel her out of control. Moreover, appellant presented expert evidence that these conditions are not commonly known and that most trampoline users do not realize the dangerousness of these conditions unless instructed or warned. Appellant testified that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>was not instructed or warned by the Thompsons and did not see the warnings affixed to the trampoline.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">{\u00b6 27} As stated, in light of these facts, we find that issues of material fact exist regarding whether the particular hazards allegedly giving rise to appellant\u2019s injuries were open and obvious. While we recognize that jumping on a trampoline involves the obvious risks of losing balance, falling down, falling off the apparatus altogether, and colliding with other individuals if more than one is present on the trampoline, we cannot find as a matter of law that the particular hazards at issue here were open and obvious. Appellant\u2019s first assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">{\u00b6 28} Assignment of Error No. 2:</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cThe trial court erred in holding that [appellant\u2019s] injuries were caused by risks inherent in jumping on a trampoline and that [appellant] assumed the risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">{\u00b6 30} Assignment of Error No. 3:</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cThat [sic] the trial court erred in holding that there was no Civ.R. 56(C) evidence of recklessness or intentional conduct on the part of the Thompsons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">{\u00b6 32} In her second assignment of error, appellant argues that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the Thompsons based upon a primary-assumption-of-risk defense, when genuine issues of material fact exist as to whether the particular risks at issue are inherent in trampoline use. We find merit in appellant\u2019s argument. Accordingly, our resolution of appellant\u2019s second assignment of error resolves her third, as her third assignment of error involves the trial court\u2019s determination regarding recklessness where it found assumption of risk to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">{\u00b6 33} Primary assumption of risk is a defense that, if successful, \u201cmeans that the duty element of negligence is not established as a matter of law, [preventing] the plaintiff from even making a prima facie case.\u201d <em>Gallagher v. Cleveland Browns Football Co. </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 427, 431-432, 659 N.E.2d 1232. This doctrine \u201cis invoked when a participant of a recreational activity attempts to sue a non-participant sponsor or landowner for injuries resulting from the recreational activity.\u201d <em>Karlovich, </em>Lake App. No. 98-L-097, 1999 WL 960583, at \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-12\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cPrimary assumption of the risk relieves a recreation provider from any duty to eliminate the risks that are inherent in the activity * * * because such risks cannot be eliminated.\u201d <em>Whisman v. Gator Invest. Properties, Inc., </em>149 Ohio App.3d 225, 236, 2002-Ohio-1850, 776 N.E.2d 1126. Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>\u201conly those risks directly associated with the activity in question are within the scope of primary assumption of risk * * <em>Gallagher, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 432, 659 N.E.2d 1232. \u201cThe types of risks associated with the activity are those that are foreseeable and customary risks of the * * * recreational activity.\u201d <em>Pope v. Willey, </em>Clermont App. No. CA2004-10-077, 2005-Ohio-4744, 2005 WL 2179317, \u00b611.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">{\u00b6 35} Here, the trial court found that trampoline use is a recreational activity and that appellant assumed the \u201cordinary risks\u201d of the activity. While we agree that trampoline use is a recreational activity, we cannot find that the instant risks were foreseeable as a matter of law. The dangers allegedly giving rise to appellant\u2019s injury include the hard, inflexible surface of the trampoline mat caused by the presence of more than 225 pounds and the double bounce created by more than one person using the trampoline at one time.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">{\u00b6 36} Appellant\u2019s testimony, as well as the expert evidence she submitted, indicates that the risks associated with the double bounce and with more than 225 pounds on the trampoline at a given time are not inherent in normal trampoline use. Appellant testified that she was unaware of either of these dangers, and appellant\u2019s experts opined that most people are unaware of these dangers when they engage in trampoline use. While falling down, colliding with others, or potentially falling off the apparatus altogether may be foreseeable risks in trampoline use, we cannot find as a matter of law that the same is true for the conditions at issue here, given the facts of this case. Accordingly, we find that issues of fact remain in this case as to whether appellant assumed the risk of injury in using the trampoline, such that her negligence claim against the Thompsons is barred. Appellant\u2019s second and third assignments of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">{\u00b6 37} Appellees\u2019 Cross-Assignment of Error No. 1:</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cThe trial court correctly granted summary judgment because there was no genuine issue of fact that the Thompsons did not breach a duty owed to [appellant] as social hosts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">{\u00b6 39} The Thompsons raise a cross-assignment of error pursuant to R.C. 2505.22,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> requesting that this court affirm the trial court\u2019s alleged finding that the Thompsons did not breach a duty to appellant because they were unaware of any hidden dangers associated with the trampoline. Our reading of the trial court\u2019s decision, however, indicates that the trial court determined only that the instant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>dangers were open and obvious, thereby obviating any duty to warn. Thus, the court did not reach the issue of whether the Thompsons breached a duty to appellant,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the question is not properly before us at this time. While we recognize that a statement made by the trial court in its decision, which the Thompsons cite in support of their cross-assignment of error, is unclear, we cannot find that the statement constitutes a conclusive finding as to the issue of breach of duty, given the trial court\u2019s holding that the dangers at issue were open and obvious. Accordingly, the Thompsons\u2019 sole cross-assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">{\u00b6 40} Based upon the foregoing, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision and remand the matter to the trial court for consideration of the remaining issues and for further proceedings according to law and consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b278-6\">Young and Bressler, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b269-13\">.

Appellant asserted numerous theories of products liability against Biggie and ADTEC, including failure to warn. Appellant's failure-to-warn claim is the only claim at issue on appeal.

The claimant, a 15-year-old girl, was injured when she and four other children jumped on a trampoline at the same time. The children were \"rocket jumping,\u201d which requires three or four jumpers to jump simultaneously on the perimeter of the trampoline while one person jumps to the center and is thereby propelled higher than the other jumpers.
