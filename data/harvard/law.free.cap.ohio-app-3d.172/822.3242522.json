Nancy was the primary wage earner during the marriage, and Steven maintained steady employment as an electrician at the Mound. In early 2003, when the Mound was downsizing, the Gregorys agreed that Steven should accept a severance package and return to school. Thereafter, the marriage appears to have deteriorated, and Steven did not promptly begin school or find other employment. He did begin school at Sinclair Community College after a few months, but he admittedly made a \u201cpoor showing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b864-14\">{\u00b6 3} On September 30, 2004, Nancy filed a complaint for divorce. She also sought a restraining order restricting Steven\u2019s disposal of property, among other things. On October 14, 2004, the trial court granted the restraining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-15\">{\u00b6 4} The trial court conducted a hearing on January 24, 2006, at which each party testified on his or her own behalf. The court entered its final judgment and decree of divorce and a final decree of shared parenting on January 5, 2007. It used October 14, 2004, as the date on which the marriage had ended. The parties\u2019 assets were divided, and Nancy was named the residential parent of the parties\u2019 children.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Steven appeals from several aspects of the trial court\u2019s judgment, raising ten assignments of error. In reviewing these assignments of error, we recognize that the trial court exercises broad discretion in dividing marital assets and in setting child and spousal support. <em>Neville v. Neville, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 275, 2003-Ohio-3624, 791 N.E.2d 434, \u00b6 5; <em>Moore v. Moore, </em>166 Ohio App.3d 429, 2006-Ohio-1431, 850 N.E.2d 1265, \u00b6 7, 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">{\u00b6 6} I. \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion by imputing income to appellant when determining his child support obligations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">{\u00b6 7} Steven argues that the factors set forth at R.C. 3119.01(C)(ll)(a) did not support the trial court\u2019s decision to impute income to him in its child-support calculations. Nancy contends that the court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Steven had been voluntarily underemployed.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">{\u00b6 8} The parties agree that Steven left his employment at the Mound in 2003 by their mutual agreement when he was offered a severance package and his future job security was in question. It is undisputed that Steven earned $42,000 \u2014 the amount of income imputed to him \u2014 at the Mound. The parties\u2019 understanding when Steven left his employment was that he would return to school. Nancy apparently believed that Steven would maintain a full-time class load in pursuit of a degree and would work part-time during school. Steven did neither. He admittedly made a \u201cpoor showing\u201d in his grades and completion of classes and did not seek full- or part-time employment. Even after the parties\u2019 separation, it is unclear whether Steven sought employment. He testified that he had taken out personal loans and borrowed from friends and family to pay his expenses because he wanted to pursue his education instead of employment. Steven also claimed that he suffered a \u201cpsychotic episode\u201d and extreme stress related to the deterioration of the marriage that caused him to delay his enrollment in school and prevented him from finding meaningful employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-8\">{\u00b6 9} Steven claims that the trial court abused its discretion in imputing income to him because he had quit his job by agreement of the parties, had helped to take care of the children, and had provided for the family through unemployment benefits. He contends that his knowledge of electronics was \u201crudimentary,\u201d that he needed more training, and that Nancy had an educational advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-9\">{\u00b6 10} R.C. 3119.01(C)(11) sets forth the factors to be considered in imputing income. Those factors include what the parent would have earned if fully employed, prior employment experience, education, physical, and mental disabilities, if any, and availability of employment in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-10\">{\u00b6 11} In our view, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imputing income or in calculating its amount. Steven earned $42,000 in 2003 at the Mound. Since leaving the Mound, he had returned to school and had nearly completed his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>second associate degree, as the parties had planned and in anticipation of earning more income. The court concluded that the parties\u2019 agreement that Steven would pursue his education in lieu of working \u201cwas no longer viable or reasonable once the marriage began to break down.\u201d Moreover, the court concluded that Steven \u201cneither matriculated nor worked,\u201d even after Nancy had asked him to return to work at least part-time. In the court\u2019s view, Steven provided no evidence that he could not work full time and complete his classes part time. Based on Steven\u2019s previous earning capacity and his recent education, the trial court could have reasonably imputed income at the same level as his previous employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">{\u00b6 12} The first assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-6\">{\u00b6 13} II. \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion by ordering appellant to pay one-half of the minor children\u2019s parochial school tuition or alternatively by failing to apply tuition expenses and health care costs as credits to appellant\u2019s child support obligation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">{\u00b6 14} Steven claims that the trial court erred in ordering him to pay one-half of the tuition for his children\u2019s parochial school or, in the alternative, in failing to give him a credit against his child-support obligations for monies spent on tuition and health care.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-8\">{\u00b6 15} The parties had agreed during their marriage to send their children to parochial school, and at the time of the divorce, the older child was in the seventh grade. The court reasonably concluded that the children should not be required to change schools in the midst of the divorce and that the older child should be permitted to finish elementary school at his current school. Thus, the court ordered that the children remain in Catholic school for two years, with the parties splitting the cost equally. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering Steven to pay half of the children\u2019s tuition.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-9\">{\u00b6 16} To effectuate the shared tuition costs, the trial court reimbursed Nancy for half of the tuition that she had already paid during the parties\u2019 separation by awarding her the parties\u2019 entire 2004 state and federal tax returns. The refunds totaled $7,798. Additionally, Nancy was ordered to pay for the children\u2019s tuition for the school year ending in 2006. She also benefitted from the proceeds of a school raffle in which she won a $2,100 tuition credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">{\u00b6 17} The evidence showed that the grade school tuition was $3,900 per year for the two children, which was reduced by Nancy\u2019s raffle winnings for the 2005-2006 school year. Thus, Steven contends that it was unreasonable for the court to award Nancy almost $10,000 to offset her payment of the tuition.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">{\u00b6 18} We cannot address this contention on the record before us. We cannot determine whether the court awarded Nancy too large an amount to cover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>Steven\u2019s portion of the tuition or whether it intended for the amount to cover Steven\u2019s portion of the tuition for more than one year. It is unclear who paid the children\u2019s tuition for the 2004-2005 school year. Moreover, the court ordered that the children would continue in Catholic school for the 2006-2007 and 2007-2008 school years, which would include one year at Alter High School for the older child, and no evidence was presented as to the tuition at Alter. Thus, we cannot determine whether Steven\u2019s total tuition obligation under the decree\u2014 which will be paid with the tax refund and tuition credit \u2014 is comparable to half of the amount of the tax refunds and tuition credit. We will remand to the trial court for clarification of this part of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">{\u00b6 19} The second assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">{\u00b620} III. \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in calculating appellant\u2019s spousal support award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">{\u00b6 21} Steven contends that the trial court\u2019s award of spousal support was inadequate and did not sufficiently consider the statutory factors set forth at R.C. 3105.18(C)(1). He claims that the length of the marriage, the parties\u2019 disparate incomes, and his lack of earnings for the preceding four years justified a greater award.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-8\">{\u00b6 22} The trial court awarded spousal support to Steven for five years in the amount of $650 per month. This calculation assumed annual income for Steven and Nancy of $42,000 and $95,000, respectively. The court found that the parties had had an above-average standard of living during the marriage. The court found that Steven\u2019s monthly expenses were reasonable and that they amounted to $1,421 per month. The court also noted that Steven had received additional education in recent years and that he could continue to pursue a degree in electrical engineering while working full time. The court retained jurisdiction over the amount of spousal support.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">{\u00b6 23} In our view, the spousal support award was reasonable. Steven earned $42,000 without the benefit of his additional education. By the time of the decree, he had obtained additional education with the goal of increasing his income, and if he chooses to do so, he will acquire several more years of education before the spousal support ends. Moreover, Steven\u2019s lack of employment for the preceding years was attributable to his own choices. Under these circumstances, the trial court\u2019s award of spousal support was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">{\u00b6 24} The third assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">{\u00b6 25} IV. \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion when allocating marital assets and debt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>{\u00b626} Steven contends that the trial court distributed the parties\u2019 marital property inequitably. He discusses several alleged disparities in the distribution of assets, which we will address in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">{\u00b6 27} Steven\u2019s first complaint about the division of marital assets relates to the marital home. In its July 18, 2006 order, the court did not allow Steven to receive credit for equity accrued due to principal payments made by Nancy while the divorce was pending. Steven claims that this was unfair to him, although it is undisputed that he did not contribute to the payments made while the parties were separated. He asserts that the court \u201ccut off [his] ability to build equity in the marital property, and ordered him to pay [Nancy] for that lost equity.\u201d In essence, he objects to the court\u2019s manner of calculating the amount of equity to which he was entitled. The trial court found that use of the date of separation as the date of the end of the marriage was equitable \u201cgiven the behavior of [Steven], the delays occasioned by his actions, his failure to cooperate in discovery and failure to work and failure to pay child support.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">{\u00b6 28} We cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in using the date of the parties\u2019 separation as the date of the end of the marriage for the purpose of dividing assets. The court obviously believed that Steven had made the entire process more difficult and drawn out than it needed to be. Under these circumstances, it was entirely reasonable for the court to deny Steven any benefit of the delay, such as the equity that had accrued on the marital home while the proceedings were pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">{\u00b6 29} Steven also objects to the trial court\u2019s order that he pay the cost of dividing his deferred compensation plan and the cost of \u201cnon-market variation deductions or withdrawals\u201d against his retirement accounts. Although Steven complains of unfairness, he does not explain the asserted unfairness. It appears that Nancy was ordered to pay the cost of preparing documents for the division of her retirement benefits. Thus, as it relates to the cost of dividing retirement benefits, this order did not result in any unfairness to Steven. The court\u2019s order with respect to \u201cnon-market variation deductions or withdrawals\u201d being charged against Steven is claimed to be unfair because of a lack of similar treatment as to Nancy\u2019s accounts. Steven points to nothing in the record and provides no insight as to how this was unfair. Accordingly, this provision does not appear to provide any undue benefit to Nancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">{\u00b6 30} Steven asserts that the court acted unreasonably in ordering him to pay more than half of two credit-card balances. Based on our review of the trial court\u2019s calculations, we disagree with his premise that he was ordered to more than half of the credit-card debt. In fact, it appears that he was ordered to pay substantially less than half.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>{\u00b6 31} The couple had two credit cards with outstanding balances at the end of their marriage: a Shell card and a VISA card. Nancy testified that the Shell card had an outstanding balance of $2,340.52 when the parties separated and that she had paid $474 on this card while the divorce was pending. The court ordered Steven to pay $1,644.50 through a deduction from his equity in the home. This amount presumably represented approximately half of the balance, $1,170.26, plus the $474 that Nancy paid on the account before the divorce was finalized. Thus, with respect to the Shell account, Steven was ordered to pay more than half because he was ordered to reimburse Nancy for the total amount \u2014 rather than half \u2014 of the payments she had made. However, when the trial court\u2019s disposition of the VISA card in taken into account, Steven came out ahead. Nancy testified that the balance on the VISA card when the parties separated was $2,391.73 and that she had paid $1,289.98 while the divorce was pending. With respect to this card, the court ordered Steven to pay $1,289.98. This appears to have been an error because the court ordered Steven to reimburse Nancy for all of the payments she had made while the divorce was pending but not for his share of the outstanding balance. If the court had ordered Steven to pay half of the principal and half of the payments, he would have been required to pay $1,840.86, rather than $1,289.98. Thus, any error by the trial court with respect to the credit cards did not prejudice Steven.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">{\u00b6 32} Next, Steven claims that he should have received interest on the proceeds from the sale of the parties\u2019 vacant lot on West Lion Five Point Road, which were held in trust by Nancy\u2019s attorney by agreement of the parties while the divorce proceedings unfolded. The record established that a substantial portion of the proceeds was paid to Steven\u2019s various attorneys while the case was still pending. Moreover, he agreed to have the funds held in trust when the lot was sold, and he does not appear to have requested the payment of interest on those funds at the time of the agreement. Under these circumstances, we find no error in the trial court\u2019s failure to award Steven interest on these funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">{\u00b6 33} Steven also argues that the court abused its discretion in ordering him to pay all of the expenses incurred in selling the parties\u2019 time-share. Steven misreads the trial court\u2019s order. The trial court stated that Nancy should dispose of the time-share as prudently as possible. The court ordered that Nancy\u2019s costs in maintaining the property from 2004 through its sale and any costs associated with the sale should be reimbursed from the sale proceeds and that the remaining net proceeds should be divided equally between the parties. Insofar as the costs were paid from the proceeds of the sale, the parties shared these expenses equally. There was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">{\u00b6 34} Finally, Steven disputes the valuation of the parties\u2019 vehicles. He claims that his Tahoe was overvalued and that Nancy\u2019s Impala was undervalued. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>He also claims that the trial court erred in ordering the sale of a 1985 Chevrolet Camaro without assigning a specific value to that vehicle and in awarding an old Lumina, valued at $500, to Nancy without any offsetting benefit to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">{\u00b6 35} Nancy presented evidence about the values of the parties\u2019 vehicles, and the trial court adopted these values. Steven did not present any evidence regarding the values of the Tahoe, Impala, or Lumina. He testified only about the 1985 Camaro, and he agreed with Nancy\u2019s proposed valuation and sale of that vehicle. Based on the record before us, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in valuing the parties\u2019 vehicles. Moreover, considering that a greater value was assigned to Steven\u2019s Tahoe than to Nancy\u2019s Impala, we cannot say that the trial court erred in awarding the Lumina to Nancy without identifying an offsetting benefit to Steven.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">{\u00b6 36} The fourth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-7\">{\u00b6 37} V. \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in determining the fair market value of the marital residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b870-8\">{\u00b6 38} The trial court determined that the fair market value of the family home at 4832 James Hill Road in Kettering was $200,000. This was the value assigned to the home by Denver Williams, upon whom the parties had agreed as the appraiser. Steven disputed this valuation because the house was valued at $229,200 for tax purposes, because Williams had allegedly failed to consider a house directly across the street that had sold for $240,000 several months earlier, and because Williams had allegedly included in his analysis of comparable properties a house that was sold in an estate sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-9\">{\u00b6 39} The trial court acted reasonably in accepting the appraiser\u2019s valuation of the house. Nancy testified that the house across the street was not comparable to the Gregory house because of a significant addition to the back of that house. Moreover, the court was not required to accept the county\u2019s valuation for real estate tax purposes. The court apparently found the appraiser\u2019s valuation to be the most thorough and credible assessment of the house\u2019s value. The court did not abuse its discretion in reaching this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-10\">{\u00b6 40} The fifth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">{\u00b6 41} VI. \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in requiring appellant to pay appellee\u2019s attorney fees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b870-12\">{\u00b6 42} Steven contends that the trial court erred in ordering him to pay Nancy\u2019s attorney fees because no rational basis existed for doing so. Although he acknowledges the trial court\u2019s conclusion that he caused much unnecessary delay and expense, he claims that the record does not support this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>{\u00b6 43} With respect to attorney fees, the Final Judgment and Decree of Divorce states:</p>\n<p id=\"b871-4\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cPursuant to this court\u2019s order of December 22, 2005, the Defendant shall pay all legal fees incurred by Plaintiff, including any advancement and court costs effective December 22, 2005. In addition, Defendant was ordered to pay his own legal expenses as incurred in this case as well. All attorney fees for the Plaintiff prior to and through December 21, 2005 shall be her sole responsibility, including all court costs and advancements or expenses which she incurred otherwise during that time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">{\u00b6 45} It appears that the trial court ordered Steven to pay attorney fees and court costs accruing after December 22, 2005, out of frustration with his delay tactics and contemptuous behavior. However, the prior judgment to which the court refers is a bit more cryptic than its description in the final decree would indicate. On December 23, 2005, the court filed an entry referencing a hearing on December 22, in which it continued the case until January 24, 2006. The continuance was apparently due to Steven\u2019s failure to provide discovery. The court ordered Steven to provide discovery within 14 days and stated: \u201cThe Defendant shall be responsible for all attorney fees, court costs and expenses for both [him] and the Plaintiff because of this delay.\u201d The language in the final decree is much more broad. It seems to make Steven responsible for all of Nancy\u2019s attorney fees after December 22, 2005, not just those necessitated by the delay, failure to provide discovery, and other contemptuous behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">{\u00b6 46} Although we are unimpressed with Steven\u2019s argument that his misconduct was unsubstantiated and that an award of attorney fees was unwarranted, we conclude that the trial court must clarify the extent to which it awarded fees and its reasons for doing so. The final decree purports to grant attorney fees much more expansively than the December 23, 2005, entry did, although the final decree relies on that previous entry for its justification. It appears that the award of fees should be tailored to include only that work attributable to Steven\u2019s lack of cooperation and should not include all of Nancy\u2019s attorney fees beyond a particular date, including, for example, her representation at the final hearing. Thus, while we recognize that the trial court has broad discretion in this matter, we remand for clarification of its actions and its reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">{\u00b6 47} The sixth assignment of error is sustained in part and overruled in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">{\u00b6 48} VII. \u201cThe trial court erred when it failed to include required language into the final decree of shared parenting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">{\u00b6 49} Steven claims that the court erred in failing to include language related to relocating the children in its final decree, as required by Montgomery County Loc.R. 4.24(G). Nancy asserts that this language is contained in the decree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>through the incorporated standard order of parenting time. Nancy is correct. The language to which Steven refers is in the standard order of parenting time at paragraph 18, which is incorporated into the shared-parenting plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">{\u00b6 50} The seventh assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">{\u00b6 51} VIII. \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion by requiring appellant to provide all transportation related to parenting time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">{\u00b6 52} Stephen claims that as \u201cthe disadvantaged party,\u201d the trial court should not have burdened him with all of the transportation responsibilities related to parenting time.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">{\u00b6 53} The trial court did not explain its allocation of transportation responsibilities. Nancy points out, however, that the standard order of parenting time allocates responsibility for transportation to the nonresidential parent. In our view, there is nothing inherently unfair about this allocation. Steven did not demonstrate that transportation was an undue burden for him or that the parties live far apart. Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering Steven to provide all transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-9\">{\u00b6 54} The eighth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-10\">{\u00b6 55} IX. \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion in awarding appellee the amount of her spousal support arrearage as an off-set against appellee\u2019s property settlement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-11\">{\u00b6 56} Under this assignment of error, Steven asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in its handling of Nancy\u2019s arrearage in spousal support. The court recognized a $3,462 arrearage in temporary support, and it ordered that \u201c[t]hese funds shall be offset in the exchange of assets ordered herein * * * or to fund [Steven\u2019s] attorney fees obligations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-12\">{\u00b6 57} Steven claims that there is no \u201crational reason\u201d for this provision, but he fails to make a cogent argument as to how he was prejudiced by this handling of the arrearage. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-13\">{\u00b6 58} The ninth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-14\">{\u00b6 59} X. \u201cThe trial court abused its discretion by making clearly erroneous findings of fact in the final decree of shared parenting and shared parenting plan and the shared parenting plan\u2019s language created ambiguity and must be corrected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b872-15\">{\u00b6 60} Steven objects to the language of the final decree, which indicates that he agreed to a shared-parenting arrangement while acknowledging that the court essentially granted custody of the children to Nancy. He claims that he did not agree to the terms of the plan and that the conflicting language creates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>ambiguity. He asserts that the trial court should be ordered to more clearly express its intention to grant shared parenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">{\u00b6 61} In the transcript, Nancy\u2019s attorney recited what he claimed to be the parties\u2019 agreement as to the children: that Nancy would have custody, serving as the residential parent and legal guardian, and that Steven would be the nonresidential parent. Further, Nancy\u2019s attorney indicated that they would be labeling the arrangement as shared parenting although, for all intents and purposes, it gave custody to Nancy. Steven\u2019s attorney acknowledged that this was an accurate statement of the parties\u2019 agreement. Steven did not present any evidence related to the custody of the children. Steven subsequently refused to sign the shared-parenting plan and other documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">{\u00b6 62} Based on the testimony at the hearing, the trial court\u2019s characterization of the parties\u2019 agreement was accurate. The language of the parties\u2019 agreement was somewhat contradictory, mixing custodial and shared-parenting language, but the trial court could have reasonably concluded that the content of the agreement was clear. The shared parenting plan reflects that agreement. Moreover, the trial court found that Steven was largely responsible \u201cfor * * * the tortured procedural history of this case,\u201d causing unnecessary delay and expense, failing to provide discovery and to pay child support, and \u201cadopting] a bunker mentality\u201d at times. Under these circumstances, we conclude that Steven\u2019s refusal to sign the shared parenting plan was not probative of whether the plan reflected the parties\u2019 agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">{\u00b6 63} The tenth assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">{\u00b6 64} As it relates to tuition and Nancy\u2019s attorney fees, the judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings as described herein.
