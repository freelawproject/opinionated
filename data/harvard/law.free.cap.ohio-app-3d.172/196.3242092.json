For the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">{\u00b6 2} From 1997 through June 2000, plaintiff was the general contractor for the construction of several office buildings. Plaintiff retained defendant Reitter Wall Systems (\u201cReitter\u201d) to install stucco and cultured stone on the exterior walls of the buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">{\u00b6 3} In the spring 2002, the building tenants began complaining of musty smells, eye irritation, and other health-related problems. Preliminary investigations revealed that mold had been growing on the inside surface of the exterior walls of the buildings. Plaintiff retained Remedies Restoration to conduct environmental testing to assess the nature and origin of the mold. Remedies obtained mold samples and sent them to Indoor Air Management, Inc. for analysis. Indoor Air determined that mold concentrations inside the buildings were higher than concentrations outside the buddings. Remedies and Indoor Air also found that the mold inside the buildings was hazardous to persons predisposed to mold allergies and respiratory conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">{\u00b6 4} MSI Technical Services, Inc., an expert hired by Reitter\u2019s insurance carrier, found that the mold was caused by moisture penetrating through the mortar used to attach the stone masonry to the wall sheathing. MSI also reported that moisture in the wall system and the resulting mold could have been prevented, or greatly reduced, by tooling the exterior surface of the joints or applying a breathable sealer to the exterior of the joint surface. MSI concluded that the mold formed as a result of Reitter\u2019s failure to seal the exterior joints of the buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">{\u00b6 5} The mold contamination rendered the buildings uninhabitable; plaintiff was required to remediate and restore the building walls to cure the mold damage. Plaintiff also incurred substantial costs in cleaning the mold from the buildings, relocating tenants from the uninhabitable office space, and conducting environmental testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">{\u00b6 6} Plaintiff was insured under a comprehensive commercial general liability insurance policy issued by Selective. The policy contained several exclusions, including, as pertinent here, exclusions for pollution and \u201cbusiness risks.\u201d Shortly after the mold was detected, Selective unilaterally added a fungi/bacteria exclusion. Plaintiff notified defendant of the mold problem and eventually sought coverage under the policy. By letter dated January 17, 2003, Selective denied coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>{\u00b6 7} On July 22, 2003, plaintiff filed a complaint against Selective<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and Reitter. As to Selective, plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that (1) it was entitled to coverage under the policy for the damages sustained in remediating the mold, (2) no policy exclusions precluded plaintiffs entitlement to coverage for those damages, and (3) Selective failed to perform its contractual obligations under the policy. Against Reitter, plaintiff asserted claims for breach of contract, breach of express warranties, breach of implied warranties, and strict liability. Plaintiff subsequently amended its complaint<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to add a bad-faith claim against Selective<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> stemming from the denial of coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">{\u00b6 8} Selective submitted a motion for summary judgment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> attaching a copy of the insurance policy. Plaintiff also filed a summary judgment motion. The trial court granted in part and denied in part both motions. In particular, the trial court ruled that plaintiffs allegations of property damage arising out of the mold problems did not constitute \u201cproperty damage\u201d arising from an \u201coccurrence\u201d as required for coverage under the policy. The trial court further determined that plaintiffs claims were not barred by the pollution or fungi/bacteria exclusions, but were precluded by the \u201cbusiness risk\u201d exclusions. The trial court dismissed plaintiffs bad-faith claim because it found there was no coverage under the policy. The trial court entered judgment for Selective, stating there was no just reason for delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">{\u00b6 9} Plaintiff timely appeals the trial court\u2019s judgment, asserting two assignments of error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">1. The trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Defendant/Appellee Selective Insurance Company of South Carolina by ruling that Plaintiff/Appellant Dublin Building Systems\u2019 claims do not fall within the coverage grant of the Selective Policy, as journalized by the trial court\u2019s February 3, 2006 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Judgment Entry. Because Plaintiff/Appellant Dublin Building Systems\u2019 claims are in fact covered by the Selective Policy, this Court should remand Plaintiff/Appellant\u2019s bad faith claim for adjudication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">2. The trial court erred in concluding that the \u201cbusiness risk\u201d exclusions contained in the Selective Policy preclude coverage of Plaintiff/Appellant Dublin Building Systems\u2019 claims, as journalized in the trial court\u2019s August 10, 2005 Decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">{\u00b6 10} Appellate review of a decision granting summary judgment is de novo. <em>Helton v. Scioto Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1997), 123 Ohio App.3d 158, 162, 703 N.E.2d 841. \u201cWhen reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on summary judgment, the court of appeals conducts an independent review of the record and stands in the shoes of the trial court.\u201d <em>Mergenthal v. Star Banc Corp. </em>(1997), 122 Ohio App.3d 100, 103, 701 N.E.2d 383. A trial court shall grant summary judgment only when (1) there is no genuine issue of material fact, (2) the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and (3) reasonable minds can come to but one conclusion, and that conclusion is adverse to the party against whom the motion for summary judgment is made. Civ.R. 56(C); <em>State ex rel. Grady v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 181, 183, 677 N.E.2d 343.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">{\u00b6 11} Plaintiffs first assignment of error asserts that the trial court erred in concluding that the property damage resulting from its defective workmanship (through its subcontractor Reitter) did not constitute an insurable \u201coccurrence\u201d under the policy. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">{\u00b6 12} The policy at issue includes the following pertinent language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-9\">a. We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d to which this insurance applies. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-10\">* =|: *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-11\">b. This insurance applies to \u201cbodily injury\u201d and \u201cproperty damage\u201d only if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-12\">(1) The \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d is caused by an \u201coccurrence\u201d that takes place in the \u201ccoverage territory\u201d; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-13\">(2) The \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d occurs during the policy period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axu\">{\u00b6 13} \u201cProperty damage\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-14\">a. Physical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss of use of that property. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-15\">b. Loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the \u201coccurrence\u201d that caused it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b241-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>{\u00b6 14} \u201cOccurrence\u201d is defined as \u201can accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">{\u00b6 15} This court has determined that an insured\u2019s defective workmanship on a construction project constitutes an insurable \u201coccurrence\u201d under a commercial general liability policy. In <em>Erie Ins. Exchange v. Colony Dev. Corp. </em>(1999), 136 Ohio App.3d 406, 736 N.E.2d 941, we held that \u201callegations that a building contractor breached its duty to construct or design a building in a workmanlike manner are sufficient to invoke the general coverage provision for property damage caused by an occurrence.\u201d Id. at 415, 736 N.E.2d 941. The policy in <em>Erie </em>defined \u201coccurrence\u201d exactly as it is defined in the policy at issue here. This court reasoned that allegations of negligence in constructing or designing a building reasonably fall within the policy\u2019s definition of occurrence, that is, accident, because negligent acts are not done with the intent or expectation of causing injury or damage. Id. at 414, 736 N.E.2d 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">{\u00b6 16} We reached a similar conclusion in <em>Natl. Eng. &amp; Contr. Co. v. United States Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., </em>Franklin App. No. 03AP-435, 2004-Ohio-2503, 2004 WL 1103993. In that case, we acknowledged that several Ohio appellate courts have concluded that commercial general liability policies with similar coverage language do not insure against claims for defective or negligent workmanship or construction because such claims do not constitute an \u201coccurrence.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 17. The rationale is that such policies \u201care intended to insure the risks of an insured causing damage to <em>other </em>persons and their property, <em>not </em>to insure the risks of an insured causing damage to the insured\u2019s own work.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Id. Indeed, we specifically cited many of the cases Selective relies upon in the instant case, e.g., <em>Environmental Exploration Co. v. Bituminous Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. </em>(Oct. 16, 2000), Stark App. No. 1999CA00315, 2000 WL 1608908 (holding that faulty workmanship does not constitute an accident and since, without an accident, there can be no occurrence as that term is defined in the insurance policy); <em>Heile v. Herrmann </em>(1999), 136 Ohio App.3d 351, 736 N.E.2d 566 (holding that faulty workmanship does not constitute an occurrence); and <em>Royal Plastics, Inc. v. State Auto. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1994), 99 Ohio App.3d 221, 225, 650 N.E.2d 180, quoting <em>Hybud Equip. Corp. v. Sphere Drake Ins. Co., Ltd. </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 657, 664, 597 N.E.2d 1096 (\u201cthe insurance policy defines \u2018occurrence\u2019 to mean \u2018an accident.\u2019 This language is \u2018clear and plain, something only a lawyer\u2019s ingenuity could make ambiguous\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">{\u00b6 17} We rejected that line of cases, instead relying upon the rationale of <em>Erie. </em>We also cited several of the cases upon which plaintiff relies in support of its position here: <em>Hahn\u2019s Elec. Co. v. Hartford Cas. Co., </em>Franklin App. No. 01AP-1391, 2002-Ohio-5009, 2002 WL 31111850 (stating that the allegations of a contractor\u2019s negligent performance of its work and breach of its duty to perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>in a workmanlike manner arguably fall within the policy\u2019s coverage for property damage caused by an occurrence); <em>Zanco, Inc. v. Michigan Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St.8d 114, 11 OBR 413, 464 N.E.2d 513 (stating in dicta that a \u201cperfectly credible argument can be made that the allegations in the * * * counterclaim [for breach of its duty to perform in a workmanlike manner] were within these initial provisions for coverage\u201d); and <em>Acme Constr. Co., Inc. v. Continental Natl. Indemn. Co., </em>Cuyahoga App. No. 81402, 2003-Ohio-434, 2003 WL 194879 (stating that allegations of negligence or defective workmanship regarding a sewer system constituted an occurrence).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">{\u00b6 18} At oral argument in the instant case, Selective conceded that <em>E\u00f1e </em>and <em>Natl. Eng. </em>are virtually indistinguishable from the case at bar. Nonetheless, Selective urges us to abandon our holdings in those cases in favor of the rationale employed in the aforementioned Ohio cases and foreign jurisdictions, e.g., <em>Weedo v. Stone-E-Brick, Inc. </em>(1979), 81 N.J. 233, 405 A.2d 788. We decline to do so based upon the doctrine of stare decisis.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">{\u00b6 19} Consequently, based upon our decision in <em>E\u00f1e, </em>which we followed in <em>Natl. Eng., </em>we hold that plaintiffs allegations of faulty workmanship by its subcontractor, Reitter, are sufficient to invoke the general coverage provision for \u201cproperty damage\u201d caused by an \u201coccurrence.\u201d The trial court erred in finding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">{\u00b620} Plaintiff also asserts in this assignment of error that the trial court erred in dismissing its bad-faith claim. We defer discussion of this argument pending resolution of the second assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">{\u00b621} Plaintiff asserts in its second assignment of error that the trial court erred in concluding the \u201cbusiness risk\u201d exclusions preclude coverage under the policy. Again, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">{\u00b6 22} The policy excludes claims arising out of an insured\u2019s so-called \u201cbusiness risks.\u201d The applicable sections of the policy state, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-9\">2. Exclusions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-10\">This insurance does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-12\">j. Damage to Property</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-13\">\u201cProperty damage\u201d to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-14\">(5) That particular part of real property on which you or any contractors or subcontractors working directly or indirectly on your behalf are performing operations, if the \u201cproperty damage\u201d arises out of those operations; or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>(6) That particular part of any property that must be restored, repaired or replaced because \u201cyour work\u201d was incorrectly performed on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-4\">* sis *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-5\">Paragraphs (3), (4), (5) and (6) of this exclusion do not apply to liability assumed under a sidetrack agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-6\">Paragraph (6) of this exclusion does not apply to \u201cproperty damage\u201d included in the \u201cproduets-eompleted operations hazard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-7\">k. Damage to Your Product</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-8\">\u201cProperty damage\u201d to \u201cyour product\u201d arising out of it or any part of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-9\">l. Damage to Your Work</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-10\">\u201cProperty damage\u201d to \u201cyour work\u201d arising out of it or any part of it and included in the \u201cproduets-eompleted operations hazard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-11\">This exclusion does not apply if the damaged work or the work out of which the damage arises was performed on your behalf by a subcontractor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-12\">{\u00b6 23} Although the trial court did not address these exclusions individually, it apparently concluded that all of them barred coverage under the policy. Indeed, the court found that \u201cwhen Plaintiff/Defendant Reitter failed to properly seal the exterior walls [of the office buildings], Plaintiffs work was incorrectly performed and the damage done to the exterior walls was excluded under the plain and unambiguous provisions of the business risk exclusions cited above.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b243-13\">{\u00b6 24} Plaintiff maintains that the trial court erred in so finding, as none of the exclusions apply. At oral argument, Selective conceded that exclusions j(5), j(6), and 1 do not bar coverage. Accordingly, the sole issue to resolve is whether exclusion k precludes coverage under the policy. We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-14\">{\u00b625} As noted, exclusion k bars coverage for damage to the insured\u2019s \u201cproduct\u201d arising out of it or any part of it. The policy defines \u201cproduct\u201d as \u201c[a]ny goods or products, <em>other than real property, </em>manufactured, sold, handled, distributed or disposed of by [you].\u201d (Emphasis added.) Plaintiff contends that since its \u201cproduct\u201d here is real property, i.e., office buildings, exclusion k does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-15\">{\u00b6 26} In contrast, Selective maintains that \u201creal property\u201d means \u201cland\u201d only and does not include structures affixed upon the land. We note initially that \u201c \u2018[w]here a policy of insurance prepared by an insurer provides generally for a certain coverage, exclusions from such coverage must be expressly provided for or must arise by necessary implication from the words used in the policy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Erie Ins. Exchange v. Colony Dev. Corp., </em>Franklin App. No. 02AP-1087, 2003-Ohio-7232, 2003 WL 23096010, at \u00b6 36, quoting <em>Butche v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. </em>(1962), 174 Ohio St. 144, 21 O.O.2d 418, 187 N.E.2d 20, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>{\u00b6 27} Moreover, \u201c \u2018[p]olicies of insurance, which are in language selected by the insurer and which are reasonably open to different interpretations, will be construed most favorably for the insured.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 37, quoting <em>Butche, </em>at paragraph three of the syllabus. Further, \u201c \u2018[i]t is not the responsibility of the insured to guess whether certain occurrences will or will not be covered based on nonspecific and generic words or phrases that could be construed in a variety of ways. * * * [I]n order to defeat coverage, \u201cthe insurer must establish not merely that the policy is capable of the construction it favors, but rather that such an interpretation is the only one that can fairly be placed on the language in question.\u201d \u2019 \u201d Id., quoting <em>Andersen v. Highland House Co. </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 547, 549, 757 N.E.2d 329, quoting Reiter, Strasser &amp; Pohlman, The Pollution Exclusion Under Ohio Law: Staying the Course (1991), 59 U.Cin.L.Rev. 1165, 1179.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">{\u00b628} Selective asserts that there are several recent Ohio and out-of-state decisions that hold that a general contractor/developer\u2019s finished structure constitutes its \u201cproduct\u201d as opposed to \u201creal property\u201d for purposes of applying the business-risk exclusions. In support of its contention, Selective cites several Ohio cases; however, a review of those cases reveals that they are distinguishable from the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">{\u00b6 29} Unlike the policy at issue here, the policy in <em>Zanco, </em>11 Ohio St.3d 114, 11 OBR 413, 464 N.E.2d 513, did not include an exception for \u201creal property\u201d under the \u201cyour product\u201d exclusion. Further, the policy in <em>Ohio Cas. Ins. Co. v. Joseph Sylvester Constr. Co. </em>(Sept. 30, 1991), Trumbull App. No. 90-T-4439, 1991 WL 206628, included a special exclusion that precluded claims for property damage to work performed by the insured arising out of materials furnished in connection with the work; Selective\u2019s policy does not include such an exclusion. Further, the policy did not include an exception for \u201creal property.\u201d <em>Acme </em>discussed only a \u201cwork performed\u201d exclusion; in addition, <em>Acme </em>does not describe \u201creal property\u201d as land only, as defendant contends.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">{\u00b6 30} Moreover, the term \u201creal property\u201d is generally recognized as including both land and the structures affixed thereto. \u201c[R]eal property\u201d is \u201can estate or property consisting of lands and of all appurtenances to lands, as buildings, crops, or mineral rights.\u201d Webster\u2019s Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language (1997) 1196. \u201cReal property\u201d is \u201c[l]and and anything growing on, attached to, or erected on it.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.2004) 1254. Ohio law has defined real property to include buildings attached to land. See, e.g., R.C. 5701.02 (defining \u201creal property\u201d to include \u201cland itself * * * and * * * all buildings, structures, improvements, and fixtures of whatever kind on the land\u201d); <em>Zell v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Rev. </em>(Aug. 26, 1986), Franklin App. No. 86AP-153, 1986 WL 9522 (for tax purposes, real property includes any buildings on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>land). Selective fails to cite any contrary authority. Accordingly, we hold that Selective failed to meet its burden of proving that exclusion k precluded coverage, and the trial court erred in so finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">{\u00b6 31} Regarding plaintiffs bad-faith claim, we note that \u201can insurer has the duty to act in good faith in the handling and payment of the claims of its insured.\u201d <em>Hoskins v. Aetna Life Ins. Co. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 272, 276, 6 OBR 337, 452 N.E.2d 1315. \u201c \u2018[A]n insurer fails to exercise good faith in the processing of a claim of its insured where its refusal to pay the claim is not predicated upon circumstances that furnish reasonable justification therefor.\u2019 \u201d <em>Zoppo v. Homestead Ins. Co. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 552, 554, 644 N.E.2d 397, quoting <em>Staff Builders, Inc. v. Armstrong </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 298, 303, 525 N.E.2d 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">{\u00b6 32} Here, the trial court dismissed plaintiffs bad-faith claim upon finding that Selective\u2019s denial of coverage was reasonable, as plaintiffs claim for property damage due to its defective work was not an insurable event for which defendant should have provided coverage and that the \u201cbusiness risk\u201d exclusions precluded coverage of plaintiffs claims. Having determined that the trial court erred in finding no coverage under the policy, we remand the matter to the trial court for determination of plaintiffs bad-faith claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">{\u00b6 33} For the foregoing reasons, we sustain plaintiffs first and second assignments of error. The judgment of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas is hereby reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with law and consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b245-9\">Petree and Travis, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-8\">.
