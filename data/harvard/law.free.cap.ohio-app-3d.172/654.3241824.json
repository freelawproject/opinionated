For the following reasons, the decision is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-11\">{\u00b6 2} Upon review of the record, the relevant history of this litigation is as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">{\u00b6 3} The parties are purported shareholders or directors of Kil-Kare, Inc., a corporation that operates a racetrack in Xenia, Ohio. Until suffering a stroke in April 2005, Richard Chrysler had effective control of a majority of Kil-Kare\u2019s shares, giving him control of the company. At that time, the board of directors consisted of Elizabeth Hosta, Roy Baker, Marion Brooks, Richard Chrysler, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>William Chrysler (\u201cthe original board\u201d). After Richard became incapacitated, a dispute arose between Richard\u2019s daughters, Elizabeth Hosta and Susan Chrysler, and two of his sons, Jack Chrysler and William Chrysler, over the control of various shares and the company\u2019s management. According to plaintiffs, on October 25, 2005, Jack and William used proxies obtained from Richard at his nursing home to elect a new board of directors consisting of Jack Chrysler; William Chrysler; Ken Sheets, their attorney; and Rick Chrysler, another brother (\u201cthe new board\u201d). Plaintiffs alleged that this election was held without summoning a shareholders\u2019 meeting as required by Kil-Kare\u2019s bylaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">{\u00b6 4} On November 8, 2005, plaintiffs brought suit against defendants, alleging that Jack had obtained a proxy to vote Richard\u2019s shares through undue influence, that William was improperly taking cash from the business, and that the two had tried to oust Hosta, Baker, and Brooks from the board of directors and to change the corporation\u2019s bylaws in a way that would allow the brothers to run the company without interference from others. Plaintiffs sought an accounting of the business and an injunction preserving the status quo and prohibiting William and Jack from altering the shareholders, directors, officers, vendors, and contractors of Kil-Kare. By an amended complaint, plaintiffs added claims for conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, civil conspiracy, wrongful termination and breach of fiduciary duty arising out of the termination of Hosta\u2019s employment, and specific performance to pay certain bills for legal services. Plaintiffs also requested a declaratory judgment that (1) Hosta is the owner of 30 shares of Kil-Kare stock, (2) Hosta, Baker, and Brooks are the rightful directors of the company, (3) Jack does not have the ability to lawfully exercise voting rights associated with any shares of Kil-Kare, and (4) William does not have the ability to lawfully exercise any powers as an officer of Kil-Kare. Defendants brought counterclaims against Hosta for conversion and defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">{\u00b6 5} In November 2005, the parties agreed to preserve the status quo pending a determination of the permanent relief requested in the complaint. The agreed prehminary injunction provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cBy agreement of the parties, it is ordered that the parties are enjoined from (a) engaging in any acts to change the lineup of shareholders, directors, officers, venders, or (b) from using money or assets of Kil-Kare, Inc. for the payment of any bills or expenses (including but not limited to bills, expenses, or attorney fees relating to this litigation) other than in the ordinary course of business without prior approval of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, (c) from using money or assets being held in trust for the benefit of either Richard Chrysler or the five children of Richard Chrysler for the payment of any bills, expenses, or attorney fees relating to this litigation, (d) from changing any bylaws, regulations, or articles of incorporation of Kil-Kare, Inc. In addition, the plaintiffs shall not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>enter upon any properties owned by Kil-Kare. In addition, the defendants shall facilitate the production, as soon as reasonably practical and at a specific time and place to be worked out between counsel, of all financial and other books and records of Kil-Kare, Inc. for inspection by an accounting professional or other person of the plaintiffs\u2019 choosing.</p>\n<p id=\"AZB\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThis order shall remain in place until further order of the court upon motion. Bond is waived.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">{\u00b6 8} On November 9, 2005, the trial court approved the agreed preliminary injunction as an order of the court. (Due to an apparent oversight, a copy of the injunction was not filed until March 27, 2006.)</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">{\u00b6 9} On February 2, 2006, defendants filed a motion to lift the agreed preliminary injunction, which they referred to as a temporary restraining order. Plaintiffs opposed the motion and requested to be reinstated as directors pending a final adjudication of the case. The magistrate held a hearing on these (and other) motions on March 3, 2006. On April 10, 2006, the magistrate denied the motion, indicating that the agreed preliminary injunction \u201ckeeps the status quo until further order of the Court.\u201d The magistrate found no evidence that the injunction would harm defendants if the agreement were not terminated and noted that they were free to operate the business. He indicated that the court would consider deleting the requirement that defendants not change vendors, upon motion, if the requirement caused a problem with Kil-Kare\u2019s operation. Defendants filed objections to the ruling, which were subsequently overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">{\u00b6 10} On April 14, 2006, defendants moved to amend the preliminary injunction. The motion requested permission to approve the transfer of stock from the estate of a shareholder to Jack Chrysler and William Chrysler (one share each), to hold the annual meeting of shareholders and to transact any business which was appropriate before that meeting, and to remove the restriction on changing vendors of the company. Plaintiffs opposed the motion. We find no indication that the court addressed this motion, and we presume it was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">{\u00b6 11} On May 17, 2006, plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment, seeking an order declaring that the board of directors consisted of the original board. Defendants also sought summary judgment on that claim and on Hosta\u2019s claim that she owned 30 shares of Kil-Kare stock.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendants argued that plaintiffs failed to present evidence to support their assertion that the new board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>was not properly elected. In a surreply, defendants further argued that the original board could not be restored because the board members\u2019 one-year term expired in January 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">{\u00b6 12} While the motions for partial summary judgment remained pending, Jack Chrysler, as secretary for Kil-Kare, issued a notice for an annual shareholders\u2019 meeting scheduled for July 31, 2006. The notice indicated that the purpose of the meeting was to elect a board of directors, to deliver a financial report for the corporation, to deliver a report on the pending litigation, and to transact any other necessary business. The notice further proposed Richard, Jack, William, Rick, and Sheets as the board of directors, and indicated that this slate would take office upon the lifting of the preliminary injunction. In response, on July 19, 2006, plaintiffs filed a motion for clarification of the existing injunction and for a temporary restraining order to prevent defendants from holding a shareholders\u2019 meeting until after trial, which was scheduled for August 23, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">{\u00b6 13} On July 21, 2006, the trial court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment on their request for a declaratory judgment that the original board was the valid board of directors of Kil-Kare. The court noted that Jack Chrysler had admitted that no notice had been sent to shareholders regarding the October 25, 2005 meeting to elect a new board of directors. The court concluded that it was \u201cclear\u201d that the new directors were elected without proper notice to shareholders and that the election of the new directors was invalid. As for a remedy, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cThe next step for the Court is to fashion a remedy that minimizes the disruption of the day to day present operation of Kil-Kare, Inc. The one year term for the <em>old directors </em>has expired. Presently, the Court has granted injunctive relief and ordered the <em>new directors </em>to stay in place until further notice. A dramatic change back to the <em>old directors </em>pending an election could have an adverse [e]ffect on the corporation. Accordingly, the Court Orders that the Agreed Preliminary Injunction shall remain in effect until a meeting, with proper notice, can be held and a new board of directors elected. To accomplish this, the Court shall set a conference with counsel to discuss how to facilitate the mechanics of this goal.\u201d (Emphasis sic and footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b699-8\">{\u00b6 15} The trial court further noted that in order to have a valid election, the court must make a determination of the validity of the irrevocable proxies signed by Richard Chrysler and naming William Chrysler to vote his shares of stock. The court determined that a hearing was necessary to resolve the issue of the proxies\u2019 validity, and it scheduled a hearing before the magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">{\u00b6 16} On the same day, the trial court overruled plaintiffs\u2019 motion for a temporary restraining order. The court stated: \u201cBased upon this Court\u2019s Judgment Entry filed July 21, 2006, finding that the election of the board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>directors on October 25, 2006 [sic], was invalid, Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion is moot. There can be no election of new directors until this Court rules on the validity of the proxies given to William Chrysler and a conference is held to discuss the mechanics of the election.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">{\u00b6 17} On August 11, 2006, the magistrate ruled on the parties\u2019 motions regarding the validity of the proxies. The magistrate began by noting that the trial court had held that the new board was improperly elected and that \u201cthe Court Ordered Agreed Preliminary Injunction originally filed in this case would remain in effect until a meeting of the shareholders could be held and a new board elected.\u201d The magistrate determined that it could not determine by summary judgment whether the proxies were valid. The magistrate further overruled defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on whether Hosta owned 30 shares of stock. The trial court subsequently adopted the magistrate\u2019s ruling over defendants\u2019 objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">{\u00b6 18} After the magistrate\u2019s ruling, the parties submitted pretrial statements. In plaintiffs\u2019 pretrial statement, plaintiffs reiterated that the trial court had determined, by summary judgment, that the old board\u2019s ouster was wrongful, \u201cthough the court went on to rule that the defendants\u2019 purported board should be permitted to act as the board pending trial.\u201d Plaintiffs stated: \u201cAt trial, the court will need to decide who the board of directors shall be pending the next shareholders\u2019 meeting.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">{\u00b6 19} On August 16, 2006, the parties jointly filed a notice of partial dismissal, which dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 claims for conversion, breach of fiduciary duty, civil conspiracy, and wrongful termination, and both of defendants\u2019 counterclaims. On August 23, 2006, plaintiffs dismissed their claim for specific performance. Accordingly, at trial, the only remaining issue was the parties\u2019 rights to vote certain shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">{\u00b6 20} A trial was held before the magistrate on August 24, 2006. After the trial, plaintiffs filed proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. Plaintiffs sought a judgment that declared Hosta the owner of record of 30 shares of Kil-Kare stock and ordered that the preliminary injunction entered in November 2005 remain in place pending the election of a new board of directors at a shareholders\u2019 meeting to be held on November 1, 2006. The proposed judgment further specified that the shareholders should receive three weeks written notice of the meeting and indicated which individuals, if any, should be able to vote the remaining disputed shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">{\u00b6 21} On November 3, 2006, the magistrate dismissed Hosta\u2019s claims regarding the 30 shares of Kil-Kare stock on the ground that Richard Chrysler, an indispensable party, was not a party to the litigation. The magistrate further resolved the issue as to which individuals, if any, could vote the shares in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Richard Chrysler Trust, the Barbara Chrysler Trust, and the stock held by Gilbert Trailer Rental, Inc. The magistrate found that the proxies were invalid and had no legal effect. The magistrate concluded, stating, \u201cThe matter of which parties can vote specific blocks of Kil-Kare, Inc. stock having been determined by this Court, the Corporation is free to hold an election to determine the next board of directors, consistent with this decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">{\u00b6 22} No one filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s ruling. Accordingly, on November 21, 2006, the trial court adopted the decision as its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">{\u00b623} On December 19, 2006, plaintiffs filed a second lawsuit seeking a resolution of whether Hosta or Richard Chrysler owned the disputed 30 shares of Kil-Kare stock. <em>Baker v. Chrysler, </em>Greene Case No. 2006-CV-1158. Because that action remains pending, no shareholders\u2019 meeting has been held.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">{\u00b6 24} On February 21, 2007, plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce the agreed preliminary injunction and to require defendants to show cause why they should not be held in contempt for violating its terms. Plaintiffs indicated that defendants terminated the contract with Brooks Racing Tires and fired Whalen and Company as Kil-Kare\u2019s outside accountants. On March 12, 2007, the trial court overruled the motion, reasoning:</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cOn November 3, 2006, the Magistrate issued a decision that was adopted by this Court on November 21, 2006. This was a final judgment terminating the case. The Court has no subject matter jurisdiction to take further action.\u201d The court relied upon <em>State ex rel. Rice v. McGrath </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 70, 577 N.E.2d 1100, to support its conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">{\u00b626} On March 14, 2007, plaintiffs sought reconsideration of the denial of their motion to enforce the injunction. However, prior to a ruling on the motion for reconsideration, they filed a notice of appeal from the March 12, 2007 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">{\u00b6 27} In their sole assignment of error, plaintiffs assert that the trial court erred in concluding that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enforce its injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">{\u00b6 28} The central issue on appeal is the proper characterization of the trial court\u2019s injunction. Plaintiffs argue that the agreed preliminary injunction was adopted as a permanent injunction in the court\u2019s July 21, 2006 decision. Plaintiffs state that nothing in the November 21, 2006 decision altered or terminated the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">{\u00b6 29} Defendants argue that this appeal \u201cis nothing more than an impermissible collateral attack on a final judgment from which Plaintiffs failed to pursue a timely appeal.\u201d They state that they had agreed to a preliminary \u2014 not permanent \u2014 injunction, which terminated with the adoption of the magistrate\u2019s Novem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>ber 3, 2006 decision. Defendants argue that the November 21, 2006 ruling was the sole final judgment in this case and that plaintiffs failed to object to that ruling. Defendants emphasize that the magistrate did not recommend granting a permanent injunction despite plaintiffs\u2019 request for that relief in their proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law. They assert that because the preliminary injunction was a temporary order that terminated with the November 21, 2006 final judgment, the court lacked jurisdiction to enforce the order when plaintiffs filed their motion to enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">{\u00b6 30} As an initial matter, we find the trial court\u2019s reliance upon <em>Rice </em>to be misplaced. In <em>Rice, </em>the plaintiff sought to enjoin the city of Westlake from interfering with the maintenance of a fence that he had erected. Upon West-lake\u2019s motion, the trial court dismissed the complaint with prejudice. The dismissal was affirmed on appeal. Later, Westlake requested the trial court to hold Rice in contempt of the court\u2019s order. After a hearing, the trial court ordered Rice to remove the fence or to allow Westlake to remove it at his expense. Rice filed a complaint for a writ of prohibition preventing the court from taking any further action except to vacate the contempt order. The Supreme Court allowed the 'writ, noting that \u201ca judge loses his authority to proceed in a matter when he unconditionally dismisses it.\u201d Here, the trial court was not asked to enforce an injunction after the dismissal of the action. Rather, plaintiffs requested enforcement of an injunction after the court had entered a final judgment. <em>Rice </em>is thus inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cThe purpose of a preliminary injunction is to preserve and protect the ability of the court to provide an effective judgment on the merits.\u201d <em>Pidgeon v. Ramar Land Corp. </em>(1991), 62 Ohio Misc.2d 223, 226, 597 N.E.2d 562; see <em>Consun Food Industries, Inc. v. Fowkes </em>(1991), 81 Ohio App.3d 63, 69, 610 N.E.2d 463 (\u201cThe function of a preliminary injunction is just this \u2014 to maintain the status quo pending trial\u201d). Unlike permanent injunctions, a preliminary injunction is not intended as a remedy for a litigant on the merits of a claim. Id. \u201cPreliminary injunctions by their very nature are interlocutory, tentative, and impermanent; they are generally regarded as being superseded by a final judgment that is rendered on the merits in the underlying controversy.\u201d <em>Burns v. Daily </em>(1996), 114 Ohio App.3d 693, 708, 683 N.E.2d 1164, citing <em>Ameron, Inc. v. United States Army Corps of Engineers </em>(D.N.J.1985), 610 F.Supp. 750, 757, affirmed as modified (C.A.3, 1986), 787 F.2d 875. Consequently, prehminary injunctions are not enforceable after final judgment has been entered. <em>Burns, </em>114 Ohio App.3d at 708, 683 N.E.2d 1164.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">{\u00b6 32} When a permanent injunction has been issued by the trial court on the merits of a claim, the court has continuing jurisdiction to enforce the injunction. Civ.R. 65(C); see <em>Am. Motors Corp. v. Huffstutler </em>(1991), 61 Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>St.3d 343, 575 N.E.2d 116 (trial court \u201ccan continue to exercise supervisory authority over [attorney\u2019s] compliance with the [permanent] injunction\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Bruns Coal Co. v. Compton </em>(1953), 96 Ohio App. 541, 55 O.O.127, 123 N.E.2d 43. A permanent injunction may be enforced as an act of the court and disobedience of the order may be punished as contempt. R.C. 2727.11; R.C. 2727.12; see <em>Zakany v. Zakany </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St.3d 192, 9 OBR 505, 459 N.E.2d 870 (court has authority under R.C. 2705.02(A) and its inherent authority to punish disobedience of its orders with contempt proceedings). The permanent injunction may be enforced by motion without the necessity of an independent action. Civ.R. 65(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">{\u00b6 33} Whether the trial court had jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the agreed preliminary injunction depends on whether the court issued only a preliminary injunction, which terminated with the trial court\u2019s November 21, 2006 final entry, or a permanent injunction, which continued to be in effect at the time of plaintiffs\u2019 motion to enforce.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">{\u00b6 34} The parties originally agreed to enter into a preliminary injunction only. On July 21, 2006, however, the trial court ruled upon plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment on whether the new board had been validly elected. The trial court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion and determined that the new board was invalid. Moreover, it \u201cfashioned a remedy\u201d for this claim by ordering that the agreed preliminary injunction \u201cremain in effect until a meeting, with proper notice, can be held and a new board of directors elected.\u201d By this order, the trial court addressed the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 claim regarding the validity of the new board and granted plaintiffs injunctive relief, albeit not reinstatement. Because the court adopted the terms of the agreed preliminary injunction as a remedy for plaintiffs on the merits of their claim, the only reasonable characterization of the July 21, 2006 order is one granting a permanent injunction that would terminate when the shareholders\u2019 meeting was held. This order was intended to survive until a proper shareholders\u2019 meeting occurred, regardless of when the parties\u2019 other claims were adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">{\u00b6 35} Defendants argue that the magistrate never recommended a permanent injunction after trial. At the outset, we note that although no hearing or trial was held on which board of directors was the valid board, no trial was necessary because there were no disputed factual issues. Accordingly, the trial court\u2019s imposition of a permanent injunction without a hearing, based on its grant of summary judgment in plaintiffs\u2019 favor, was permissible. See <em>Gibson Guitar Corp. v. Paul Reed Smith Guitars, LP </em>(C.A.6, 2005), 423 F.3d 539, 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">{\u00b6 36} More significantly, the August 2006 trial was limited to the issue of which individuals could vote specific blocks of Kil-Kare stock. The issue of whether the new board had been properly elected had already been resolved by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>summary judgment, and the parties had voluntarily dismissed the remaining claims and counterclaims. Accordingly, the magistrate was free to confine himself to the ownership of the 30 shares of Kil-Kare stock claimed by Hosta, the validity of the proxies signed by Richard Chrysler, and the power to vote shares of Kil-Kare stock held by Gilbert Trailer Rental.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">{\u00b6 37} Defendants argue that the November 21, 2006 judgment, which adopted the magistrate\u2019s recommendation, was the court\u2019s final order and that no injunction was issued therein. Defendants note that plaintiffs faded to object to the magistrate\u2019s ruling, and they therefore assert that plaintiffs waived any objections to the lack of an injunction in the ruling. By requesting the magistrate to incorporate a permanent injunction into his final ruling, plaintiffs arguably implied that they did not initially consider the July 21, 2006 order to have imposed a permanent injunction. However, neither plaintiffs\u2019 request nor the magistrate\u2019s failure to recommend a permanent injunction in his November 3, 2006 decision had any effect on the previously ordered injunction. As stated above, the July 21, 2006 injunction had been imposed by the court on the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 claim regarding the validity of the new board of directors in its ruling on plaintiffs\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment. The magistrate did not need to impose an injunction in order to resolve the issues presented at trial, and his ruling on the voting rights did not contradict or supersede the July 21, 2006 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">{\u00b6 38} We agree with defendants that the November 21, 2006 judgment was a final judgment. Specifically, the judgment was a final judgment because it fully resolved the remaining issues in the litigation. See R.C. 2505.02(B)(1). However, a trial court may enter several final orders during the course of an action. The final judgment need not reiterate the rulings on claims that have been previously resolved during the litigation. Accordingly, the magistrate was not required to reiterate the injunction ordered in the court\u2019s July 21, 2006 order. The magistrate\u2019s failure to include an injunction in his November 3, 2006 decision, contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 request, did not nullify the court\u2019s previous July 21, 2006 order. Because the lack of an injunction in the magistrate\u2019s November 3, 2006 decision had no effect on the previously ordered permanent injunction, plaintiffs\u2019 failure to object to the magistrate\u2019s ruling was likewise inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">{\u00b6 39} In sum, the record indicates that the trial court imposed a permanent injunction, incorporating the terms of the agreed preliminary injunction, in its July 21, 2006 order granting partial summary judgment and that it entered a final judgment resolving the remaining claims on November 21, 2006. Because the injunction ordered on July 21, 2006 was a permanent injunction, the trial court erred when it concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the agreed preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>{\u00b6 40} The assignment of error is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">{\u00b6 41} The decision of the trial court is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b705-6\">Brogan, J., concurs.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b705-7\">Grady, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b698-10\">.

Instead, and because the judgment failed to order such relief, I find that the appeal should be dismissed for lack of a final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-10\">{\u00b6 43} Civ.R. 65(D) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b705-11\">{\u00b6 44} <em>\u201cEvery order granting an injunction </em>and every restraining order shall set forth the reasons for its issuance; shall be <em>specific in terms; </em>shall describe in reasonable detail, and <em>not by reference to the complaint or other document, </em>the act or acts sought to be restrained; and is binding upon the parties to the action, their officers, agents, servants, employees, attorneys and those persons in active concert or participation with them who receive actual notice of the order whether by personal service or otherwise.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">{\u00b6 45} The judgment of November 21, 2006, from which this appeal was taken, makes no mention of injunctive relief of any kind. Therefore, such relief cannot, consistent with the positive requirements of Civ.R. 65(D), be read into that judgment. Likewise, the judgment cannot be construed to grant or impose injunctive relief \u201cby reference to\u201d the preliminary injunction the court previously ordered on November 9, 2005, either expressly or by implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-13\">{\u00b6 46} Plaintiff-appellants sought a declaration pursuant to R.C. 2721.02 that the new board of directors was invalidly elected. They did not likewise ask for injunctive relief on the declaration they sought, which per R.C. 2721.09 the court was authorized to grant. However, Civ.R. 54(C) provides that \u201cevery <em>final judgment </em>shall grant the relief to which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled, even if the party has not demanded the relief in the pleadings.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Therefore, a summary judgment that determines rights without providing any remedy establishing the respective obligations of the parties to permit compliance or enforcement with the determination is not a final judgment. <em>Coon v. Barnes </em>(1994), 95 Ohio App.3d 349, 642 N.E.2d 449.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-14\">{\u00b6 47} The summary judgment determined and declared that the new board of directors was invalidly elected and therefore ultra vires, and that the former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>board of directors could not act because its term had expired. That determination left the corporation without a board of directors. Yet, except where the stockholders are otherwise specifically authorized to act, \u201call of the authority of a corporation shall be exercised by or under the direction of its directors.\u201d R.C. 1701.59(A). As a result, a corporation lacking a board of directors cannot function. That is why the court entered the preliminary injunction on November 9, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">{\u00b6 48} Having declared by way of the interlocutory summary judgment that neither board could act for the corporation, the court could not render that interlocutory judgment final without also providing a remedy establishing the obligations of the parties with respect to the rights of the parties relative to control and operation of the corporation that the court had determined. <em>Coon. </em>On this record, that would require the court to appoint some entity to function as the corporation\u2019s board, as it had in the preliminary injunction it granted. The judgment of November 21, 2006, failed to do that, and failing to do that the judgment is not final, and not being final the judgment is not appealable pursuant to R.C. 2505.02, even with a Civ.R. 54(B) certification. Id. No certification was made by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">{\u00b6 49} Because the November 21, 2006 judgment was not final and did not by its terms vacate the preliminary injunctive relief the court previously granted, that relief remains in effect. Therefore, on the error assigned, the trial court erred when it held that it lacks jurisdiction to enforce that injunctive relief. Nevertheless, for the reasons stated, I would dismiss the appeal for lack of a final order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
