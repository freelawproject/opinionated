Chesterton Company and others,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeal from a decision of the Butler County Court of Common Pleas overruling their motion to dismiss the asbestos-related colon-cancer claims of plaintiffs-appellees, Carl Nichols Jr. and Kenneth Bellamy, after finding that the provisions in R.C. 2307.92 do not apply to appellees\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">{\u00b6 2} In July 2001, Kenneth Bellamy was among a group of plaintiffs who filed a personal-injury action against numerous defendants who manufacture, sell, or otherwise \u201cplace into the stream of commerce\u201d asbestos or asbestos-containing products or machinery. Bellamy and the other plaintiffs alleged that they developed \u201casbestos-related lung injury, disease, illness and disability and other related physical conditions\u201d as a result of the defendants\u2019 actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-9\">{\u00b6 3} In December 2001, Carl Nichols Jr. filed a similar complaint,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with similar allegations against numerous defendants, many of whom had been already named as defendants in the Bellamy action. A number of the defendants in appellees\u2019 actions are now the appellants in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">{\u00b6 4} Appellees\u2019 lawsuits are among the thousands of asbestos cases filed in Butler County over the past ten years. The total number of asbestos claims filed in this state has created an asbestos-litigation crisis. See <em>Wilson v. AC&amp;S, Inc., </em>169 Ohio App.3d 720, 2006-Ohio-6704, 864 N.E.2d 682, \u00b622. The General Assembly has sought to resolve this crisis by enacting 2003 Am.Sub.H.B. 292 (\u201cH.B. 292\u201d), which became effective on September 2, 2004. Id. at \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">{\u00b6 5} The key provisions of H.B. 292 are codified in R.C. 2307.91 through 2307.98. For example, R.C. 2307.92 requires plaintiffs bringing certain kinds of asbestos claims to make a prima facie showing that the exposed person has a physical impairment resulting from a medical condition and that the person\u2019s exposure to asbestos was a substantial contributing factor to the medical condi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>tion. See R.C. 2307.92(A) through (D). H.B. 292 also defines ternas like \u201ccompetent medical authority,\u201d see R.C. 2307.91(Z), which had not been previously defined by either the General Assembly or the Ohio Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">{\u00b6 6} In April 2006, the trial court held a hearing on several hundred asbestos cases that were pending before the court, including those brought by appellees. At the hearing, both appellees asserted that they had contracted colon cancer as a result of their exposure to asbestos. The trial court ordered appellees to submit evidence that their colon cancers were linked to asbestos exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">{\u00b6 7} In June and August of 2006, both appellees submitted written opinions from Dr. Arthur Frank, who opined that appellees\u2019 colon cancers were causally connected to their asbestos exposure. Appellants responded to appellees\u2019 evidence by moving to have appellees\u2019 actions administratively dismissed on the grounds that Dr. Frank was not a \u201ccompetent medical authority\u201d for purposes of R.C. 2305.10(B)(5) because he was not a \u201ctreating\u201d physician as required by R.C. 2307.91(Z)(2). Therefore, appellants argued, appellees\u2019 causes of action had not yet accrued pursuant to R.C. 2305.10(B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">{\u00b6 8} At some point during the proceedings, the trial court asked the parties to brief the question of how colon cancer claims should proceed in light of H.B. 292. Appellants responded with a brief in September 2006 in which they argued that H.B. 292 \u201cgives guidance for <em>all </em>asbestos claims (emphasis sic)\u201d and that \u201c[c]olon cancer claims are within the sweep of [H.B. 292].\u201d Appellants also argued that even if the trial court chose not to apply H.B. 292, the court should, nevertheless, look to that statute for guidance in applying R.C. 2305.10(B)(5). In particular, they urged the trial court to apply the definition of \u201ccompetent medical authority\u201d found in H.B. 292, which is codified at R.C. 2307.91(Z), in determining whether appellees\u2019 causes of action had accrued under R.C. 2305.10(B)(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">{\u00b6 9} Appellees responded to appellants\u2019 brief by arguing that H.B. 292 applies only to \u201cvery specific categories of asbestos related disease,\u201d namely, to asbestos claims based on nonmalignant conditions, lung cancer in smokers, or wrongful death. See R.C. 2307.92(B), (C), and (D). Appellees asserted that because their asbestos-related colon-cancer claims do not fall within any of these categories, the provisions of H.B. 292 do not apply to their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">{\u00b6 10} On November 22, 2006, the trial court issued an order overruling appellants\u2019 motion to dismiss, after finding that R.C. 2307.92(B), (C), and (D) do not apply to colon-cancer claims like those brought by appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">{\u00b6 11} Appellants now appeal from the trial court\u2019s November 22, 2006 order,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> raising the following assignment of error:</p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>{\u00b6 12} \u201cThe trial court erred by not applying R.C. 2305.10 and 2307.92(A), statutes that tie accrual of an asbestos personal injury action to the date when \u2018competent medical authority\u2019 informs the plaintiff that the injury is \u2018related [sic] to the exposure.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">{\u00b6 13} Appellants argue that the trial court erred by overlooking R.C. 2307.92(A). They assert that the General Assembly\u2019s plain intent in enacting that provision was to clarify when an asbestos-related cause of action accrues under R.C. 2305.10(B)(5) by clarifying the meaning of the term \u201ccompetent medical authority.\u201d They contend that when so clarified and applied to the facts of these two cases, R.C. 2305.10(B)(5) shows that appellees do not have accrued causes of action for asbestos injury, and therefore, the trial court erred by not dismissing appellees\u2019 causes of action. We disagree with appellants\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">{\u00b6 14} R.C. 2305.10(B)(5) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b778-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c[A] cause of action for bodily injury caused by exposure to asbestos accrues upon the date on which the plaintiff is informed by competent medical authority that the plaintiff has an injury that is related to the exposure, or upon the date on which by the exercise of reasonable diligence the plaintiff should have known that the plaintiff has an injury that is related to the exposure, whichever date occurs first.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b778-8\">{\u00b6 16} Prior to September 2, 2004, the General Assembly had never defined the phrases \u201cbodily injury caused by exposure to asbestos\u201d or \u201ccompetent medical authority.\u201d <em>Wilson v. AC&amp;S, Inc., </em>169 Ohio App.3d 720, 728, 2006-Ohio-6704, 864 N.E.2d 682, \u00b6 17. \u201cThe ambiguity in these phrases resulted in an extraordinary volume of cases that strains the courts in this state and threatens to overwhelm our judicial system.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 123, citing Section 3(A)(3) of H.B. 292.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">{\u00b6 17} On September 2, 2004, H.B. 292 went into effect. The basic purpose of the law is to resolve this state\u2019s asbestos-litigation crisis. <em>Wilson </em>at \u00b6 29. The key provisions of H.B. 292 are codified in sections 2307.91 through 2307.98 of the Revised Code. In <em>Wilson, </em>this court held that retrospectively applying R.C. 2307.91, 2307.92, and 2307.93 did not violate the ban on retroactive legislation in Section 28, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. See <em>Wilson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">{\u00b6 18} Of critical importance in this case is the meaning and applicability of the provisions in R.C. 2307.92. R.C. 2307.92(A) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>{\u00b6 19} \u201cFor purposes of section 2305.10 and sections 2307.92 to 2307.95 of the Revised Code, \u2018bodily injury caused by exposure to asbestos\u2019 means physical impairment of the exposed person,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to which the person\u2019s exposure to asbestos is a substantial contributing factor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">{\u00b6 20} R.C. 2307.91(FF) defines the term \u201csubstantial contributing factor\u201d as meaning both that (1) exposure to asbestos is the predominate cause of the physical impairment alleged in the asbestos claim and (2) a competent medical authority has determined with a reasonable degree of medical certainty that without the asbestos exposures the physical impairment of the exposed person would not have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">{\u00b6 21} R.C. 2307.91(Z) defines the term \u201ccompetent medical authority\u201d as meaning a medical doctor who (1) is providing a diagnosis for purposes of constituting prima facie evidence of an exposed person\u2019s physical impairment that meets the requirements specified in R.C. 2307.92, and (2) meets the requirements listed in R.C. 2307.91(Z)(l)-(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b779-7\">{\u00b6 22} R.C. 2307.92(B) provides that \u201c[n]o person shall bring or maintain a tort action alleging an asbestos claim based on a nonmalignant condition<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> in the absence of a prima-facie showing, in the manner described in [R.C. 2307.93(A).]\u201d R.C. 2307.92(B)(1) through (3) then lists the minimum requirements that the prima facie showing must contain. R.C. 2307.92(C) provides similar requirements for persons bringing or maintaining an asbestos claim based upon lung cancer of an exposed person who is a smoker, and R.C. 2307.92(D) provides similar requirements for persons bringing or maintaining an asbestos claim based upon wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">{\u00b6 23} Appellants acknowledge that the requirements in R.C. 2307.92(B), (C), and (D) do <em>not </em>apply to appellees\u2019 colon-cancer cases. Nevertheless, appellants assert that the language in R.C. 2307.92(A) clarifies the point at which <em>all </em>asbestos causes of action accrue under R.C. 2305.10(B)(5), by clarifying the meaning of the term \u201ccompetent medical authority\u201d in R.C. 2307.91(Z). Specifically, appellants maintain that no asbestos cause of action accrues for purposes of R.C. 2305.10(B)(5) until the plaintiff is informed by \u201ccompetent medical authority,\u201d as that term is now defined in R.C. 2307.91(Z), that the plaintiff has an injury that is related to exposure to asbestos.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>{\u00b624} However, appellants\u2019 argument ignores the definition of one other critical term in R.C. 2307.92(A). As previously stated, R.C. 2307.92(A) defines the phrase \u201cbodily injury caused by exposure to asbestos\u201d to mean <em>\u201cphysical impairment </em>of the exposed person, to which the person\u2019s exposure to asbestos is a substantial contributing factor.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The term \u201cphysical impairment\u201d is defined in R.C. 2307.91(V) as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c \u2018Physical impairment\u2019 means a nonmalignant condition that meets the minimum requirements specified in division (B) of section 2307.92 of the Revised Code, lung cancer of an exposed person who is a smoker that meets the minimum requirements specified in division (C) of section 2307.92 of the Revised Code, or a condition of a deceased exposed person that meets the minimum requirements specified in division (D) of section 2307.92 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">{\u00b626} In this case, appellees\u2019 colon cancers do not constitute a physical impairment for purposes of R.C. 2307.92(A) because they do not fit within any of the three categories listed in R.C. 2307.91(V). Therefore, appellees\u2019 claims do not constitute a \u201cbodily injury caused by exposure to asbestos\u201d for purposes of R.C. 2307.92(A). Consequently, R.C. 2307.92(A), like R.C. 2307.92(B), (C), and (D), has no application to appellees\u2019 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">{\u00b6 27} Appellants argue, in the alternative, that this court should still apply the definition of \u201ccompetent medical authority\u201d found in R.C. 2307.91(Z) to this case because that definition is the \u201cbest evidence of what the General Assembly meant in 1980 when it passed [R.C.] 2305.10(B)(5) and included the term \u2018competent medical authority.\u2019 \u201d We find this argument unpersuasive as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">{\u00b628} R.C. 2307.91(Z) defines \u201ccompetent medical authority\u201d as \u201ca medical doctor who is providing a diagnosis for purposes of constituting prima-facie evidence of an exposed person\u2019s physical impairment that meets the requirements specified in R.C. 2307.92[.]\u201d Thus, R.C. 2307.91(Z) makes clear that the definition of \u201ccompetent medical authority\u201d applies to medical doctors who provide a diagnosis for purposes of meeting the requirements specified in R.C. 2307.92.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-9\">{\u00b6 29} If the General Assembly had intended for the definition of \u201ccompetent medical authority\u201d to apply to R.C. 2305.10(B)(5) in <em>all </em>asbestos cases, the legislature could have easily said so. Because the General Assembly did not, it is apparent that the definition of \u201ccompetent medical authority\u201d contained in R.C. 2307.91(Z) applies merely to those medical doctors who provide a diagnosis for purposes of establishing prima facie evidence of an exposed person\u2019s physical impairment that meets the requirements of R.C. 2307.92. Because the provisions in R.C. 2307.92 do not apply to appellees\u2019 colon-cancer claims, the definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>\u201ccompetent medical authority\u201d contained in R.C. 2307.91(Z) does not apply in this case, either.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">{\u00b6 30} Appellants\u2019 assignment of error is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b781-7\">Bressler and Powell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b776-12\">. The other defendants-appellants in this case are the Oglebay Norton Company, Certainteed Corporation, Union Carbide, Georgia-Pacific Corporation, Cleaver-Brooks, Riley Stoker Corporation, Garlock Sealing Technologies, L.L.C., and Rapid American Corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b776-13\">. According to appellants\u2019 brief, Nichols's suit was originally filed in April 2001 as part of \"a mass filing\u201d of asbestos-related claims by \"numerous plaintiffs against scores of defendants.\u201d The trial court found the joinder of these plaintiffs to be improper and ordered the plaintiffs to file separate complaints. Nichols complied with this order by filing his individual complaint in December 2001.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b777-11\">. Although the issue is not entirely free from doubt, we deem the entiy from which appellants are appealing to be a final order pursuant to R.C. 2505.02(B)(4), because it appears to be an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>order denying appellants the provisional remedy of requiring appellees to make a prima facie showing under R.C. 2307.92 to prove their asbestos-related claims, and (1) the order in effect determines the action with respect to the provisional remedy and prevents a judgment in favor of appellants with respect to the provisional remedy, and (2) appellants would not be afforded a meaningful or effective remedy by an appeal following final judgment as to all proceedings, issues, claims, and parties in the action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b779-9\">. R.C. 2307.91(N) defines the term \"exposed person\u201d as \"any person whose exposure to asbestos or to asbestos-containing products is the basis for an asbestos claim under section 2307.92 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b779-10\">. R.C. 2307.91(T) defines \"nonmalignant condition\u201d as \"a condition that is caused or may be caused by asbestos other than a diagnosed cancer.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
