The finding of the court, made in response to the issue, is to the effect that, while there was an explosion, it did not precede the fire, but occurred during the fire and after the commencement thereof and while the building and its contents were in process of destruction by the conflagration. Appellant attacks this finding and insists that \u201cin our testimony we have eliminated every possibility of fire preceding the explosion.\u201d It conclusively appears from the testimony of the only witness having knowledge of the fact, that, upon going out on his porch, he saw the building was on fire, that he ran back into the house to get his hat, and while in the house he heard the explosion. Other than the fact that the front of the building and some of the merchandise were blown into the street and several hours thereafter found scorched and burned, the record discloses absolutely nothing tending in the slightest degree to overcome this direct testimony. The contention as to insufficiency of evidence to support the finding of which appellant complains is wholly without merit; indeed, the testimony upon which the court based the finding is without conflict. This being true, the explosion must be deemed the result of, and an incident of, the fire which was the direct and proximate cause of the loss. <em>(German American Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Hyman, </em>42 Colo. 156, [16 L. R. A. (N. S.) 77, 94 Pac. 27]; 1 Clement on Fire Insurance, p. 123.)</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> While not pleaded, it was on the trial made to appear that after the fire plaintiff made an assignment of the sum due under the policy to a third person, by reason of which fact appellant insists that, having parted with all his right in the policy, he was thereby precluded from maintain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>ing this action. Reference to this assignment shows that it was made to the assignee as plaintiff\u2019s agent merely for collection of the insurance money, as to which, however, no adjustment was to he made without plaintiff\u2019s approval. By such assignment the assignee acquired no personal interest in the benefits to be derived by the collection, and hence plaintiff, being the real party in interest, did not lose his right to sue upon the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">No grounds other than the alleged errors discussed are urged by appellant for a- reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Conrey, P. J., and' James, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
