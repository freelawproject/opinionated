We are of the opinion that the appeal is frivolous and that it was taken for delay. This being so, the judgment is affirmed, with the added penalty of one hundred dollars hereby imposed upon the appellant for the taking and prosecution of a frivolous appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">Waste, P. J., and Knight, J., <em>pro tem., </em>concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
